I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. James Samford, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Loughton, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, the GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. Thank you, James, and thanks everyone for joining our first quarter earnings call.
We kicked off the year with another great quarter, active accounts were up 47% and gross profit was up 62%. The transformation of TV from legacy TV to [indiscernible] streaming pace 2.37 but has a long way to go. Consumers are moving from traditional pay TV services to Internet deliver services. Roku is building a large audience for content providers and advertisers and aggregating streaming services for consumers. We have a leading TV screening platform in the U.S. with nearly 21 million active customers.
As I mentioned active accounts grew strongly in the quarter. Our strategy to build scale of our installed base by selling streaming players and licensing our TV operating system is working well [indiscernible] 3.10 by the increase in Roku’s smart TV U.S. market share. It was one in four in Q1 up from one in five last year. The Roku OS is the number one licensed TV OS and Roku TVs are in aggregate the number two best-selling smart TV in the United States and we’re growing fast.
As I’ve said before, I believe that virtually all TVs sold were licensed in OS just like most smartphones run in licensed OS. Roku makes the only purpose built OS for TV. We're also deepening our relationship with advertisers and content publishers. Roku's platform business continues to perform extremely well up 106% in the quarter. The 70 billion spent each year on TV advertising in the U.S. continues to shift to streaming as advertisers follow viewers.
According to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room. And streaming ads simply work better. A recent study by IPG and MAGNA concluded that ads on the Roku platform are 67% more effective per exposure at driving purchase intent compared to traditional linear TV ads. We're also making significant progress on strategic initiatives like the Roku channel. It’s a great time to be in streaming business.
And now I'll turn it over to Steve to comment on our results and outlook. Thanks Anthony.
We had another strong quarter and are well positioned for a very strong year. Active account growth accelerated to 47% year-over-year to 20.8 million. We add accounts via three paths low-cost players, Roku TV, [indiscernible] 4.59 all were important contributors to our 47% active account growth. And like last quarter half of new accounts came from licensed sources primarily Roku TV.
Total Q1 revenue increased 36% year-over-year to 136.6 million. Platform revenue more than doubled again and now exceeds our player segment at 55% of total revenue. Revenue came in above our outlook range with strong platform growth reflecting the continued strength of our account monetization. Player revenue was down 3% year-over-year largely due to a deliberate mix shift to lower price Roku Express and Streaming six and lower ASPs on our high end ultra. Player units were up 5% year-over-year and ASPs were down 7%.
Gross profit growth in Q1 was 62% year-over-year to 63.1 million with platform gross profit up 90% year-over-year partially offset by player gross profit decline [indiscernible] 6.06. Importantly, gross margin expanded seven percentage points year-over-year to a record 46%. Player segment gross margin of 16% is seasonally strongest in Q1 which tend to be less promotional. And in addition, we experienced lower airfreight charges this quarter compared to the prior two quarters. We expect player gross margins to come back down to single digits for the rest of the year.
OpEx came in lower than expected at 70 million which helped adjusted EBITDA come in well ahead of our outlook at a loss of $0.8 million in Q1 better than a loss of $4.4 million in Q1 last year.
In the new year we adopted the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 details of which are disclosed in our 10-Q which we expect to file in the next few days. There were several items that impacted the quarter. First upon adoption on January 1, we flushed 38 million to retained earnings including 28 million from our deferred revenue balance without recognizing any of that revenue in the income statement. There were other opening adjustments related to accounts receivable and other assets as well.
Second in the income statement for the quarter the adoption of 606 resulted in net positive benefits to revenue of roughly 5 million and roughly 0.5 million benefit to gross profit. The positive revenue impact was largely driven by the delivery of our performance obligation to a Roku powered partner during the quarter partially offset by other net 606 related changes.
As a reminder under 606 the IP software is accounted for as a performance obligation and the value attributed to that performance obligation is recognized upon transfer to the customer. Previously the value of the IP software was spread over the life of the contract. We expect that these types of transaction to affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition and thus increasing the risk of variability in future periods.
With that brief overview, let me turn to our outlook. When we provided our outlook in February, we were confident that the momentum we were seeing entering 2018 allowed us to set full-year revenue and gross profit growth targets of 31% and 43% respectively at the midpoints. With the strength of our Q1 results our updated full-year outlook increases to 36% revenue growth and 49% gross profit growth at the midpoint.
We plan to increase our investments and R&D in sales and marketing compared to Q1 levels to fuel continued growth and innovation, but we believe there is a clear path to being at or near breakeven this year on an adjusted EBITDA basis.
For Q2, we're seeing strong demand across both platforms and players which is reflected in our outlook for year-over-year revenue growth of 41% at the midpoint. Continued mix shift to video advertising and seasonality in player margin is reflected in our outlook for year-over-year gross profit growth of 61% at the midpoint.
On the expense side, roughly half of Q1 new hires came in March. So we will see the full impact of those new hires in our Q2 operating expenses, as well as our incremental hiring plans. As a result, adjusted EBITDA is expected to dip back down from Q1 to a loss of $7 million to $12 million.
Finally a few words on seasonality in our outlook for the back half of the year. We expect normal revenue seasonality on the topline to continue with roughly 23% of full year revenue in Q3 and 37% of total revenue in Q4. We also anticipate seasonal gross margin in Q4 to pull back to roughly 41% primarily from seasonal mix of player revenues and holiday promotions.
Our expenses are expected to ramp more linearly as we continue to grow our engineering and sales and marketing teams which will keep Q3 EBITDA losses in roughly mid-single-digit million loss range. Overall as you can see from the results this was another great quarter for Roku and we remain optimistic about the trends we're seeing in both the industry and our fundamentals. Thank you for your support.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Laura Martin with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Congratulations on these numbers, you exceeded every single line item we projected. I don’t know you discussed on the call, but two I wanted to ask about were the Roku channel how big - how important it was in the quarter and what you're expecting it to ramp during the year. And also I often ask about this mix of platform revenue how much came from each of the three buckets content, audience development and pure ad growth, I don’t know if you could give me some granularity on that that will be great? Scott is on the call, I'll just add a few things and I’ll turn it over to Scott. The Roku channel is doing extremely well for us. We’re super excited I mean we’re now - assume well on Roku but we are also to taking the offer up to Samsung and we’re looking strongly to other platforms as well, as quite as we could take the Roku channel to expand our reach.
It’s a top 15 channel on the Roku platform now after only a few months of being in the market. And the number three, 3.0 channel on the platform. I think it’s got a lot of potential. So Scott I don’t know if you wanted to add to that. The Roku channel is already contributing significantly to our inventory mix in the audience that we sell to advertisers. I think also importantly the Roku channel because of its growth is proving to be a significant traffic driver, audience driver for content providers into the Roku channel. So it’s become a vehicle by which content partners can go and build pretty significant OTT audiences.
Your other question about the mix of platform revenue across content ads, we’re seeing strength across the breadth of the business including revenues from content partnerships. Revenue from audience development and ad sales were really hitting on all cylinders, all of those segments are growing significantly.
Platform revenues more than doubled ARPU's up 50% and platform revenue as a mix of total are at 55%. And we’re excited about the trajectory of the platform business. We look at it as creating significant value for both content partners and advertisers at 21 million - almost 21 million households are active accounts. We are an ad skill platform where our content partners can go and build significant OTT audiences and where advertisers can come reach a large audience of engage TV viewers. And then I’m going to ask you guys something out of your control. The thing that buffeted the stock during the quarter was this announcement that Amazon would kick you out of the [indiscernible] TVs and Best Buy and go exclusive with Best Buy. My question to you is does that mean that Amazon Fire will no longer be competing with you in Walmart and Costco which are 50% of your unit sales and so that actually gates them as a competitor going forward which is good for you or not? So just in general the Roku TV is doing extremely well for us. It’s positioned extremely well and it’s getting stronger. Roku TV is the number one licensed smart TV OS in this country. In Q1 in particular one in four of every smart TV sold in United States ran the Roku OS that compares with one in five last year. It’s getting review, users love it, CNET just reviewed the new TCL six series that’s the best TV value we’ve reviewed. So Roku TV generally is doing great for us and retailers are picking up more, more models.
So we expect that this year Best Buy and Walmart and all major retailers will sell more Roku TV models then they sold last year. What’s really happening here is that TVs are switching from these home grown smart TV platforms to license OS and that’s so Roku’s scale is coming. Market share smart TV is coming out of the fact that a lot of - the most all TV is previously were build with these home grown OSs and the Roku OS is just much, much better solution for consumers and TV companies.
As the market switches to license Oss, Roku is not going to be the only winner there, Amazon and others maybe Google will get some share. But Roku is by far the biggest and the most we think the most well positioned.
As far as the actual deal, you should get a check but I think the press release confirmed the BestBuy.com confirmed that what you just said in terms of exclusivity. Because I do think it's a material upside driver if Amazon is going to be left as a competitor in every retail side other than Best Buy. So wouldn’t you agree with that or not? Yes. Great number guys, keep up the good work. Thanks. Our next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Just on the acceleration in Roku TV sales, is that your existing OEM relationships getting incremental share or was there any contribution from your new OEM partnerships that you launched in the quarter? So, actually accounts were up 47% year-over-year in the quarter and was driven by - we acquired accounts three-ways all are important to us, all are making great contribution. One is streaming players we sell million of streaming players, we licensed our offering systems TV manufacturers there is 10 brands selling Roku TVs now in all major retailers and retailers are sorting more and more models as time goes on. And then we see sell Roku - we license the operators under the Roku part brand.
So TV specifically what’s driving growth in that, I think the main growth driver is just that a license to OS Roku is just much better solution that results in the lower cost TV with more content, better features. So it’s a great TV and that’s resulting in getting more and more adoption its get adoption more buys. More retail placement of more models and more OEMs picking up our license. So it’s all of that. And then just one virtual MVPD which you called out specifically in the shareholder letter. I know you've added - TV failure recently just wondering if you could help us understand how much of the platform revenue or gross might be coming from these relationships that you’re adding? The virtual MVPD is doing very well on our platform. We are a natural place for these partners to come and acquire users. And so we have seen significant growth from the virtual MVPD category in terms of usage. That said it’s one among many verticals for us ad supported viewership for example continues to grow faster than the other verticals in the platform? Our next question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is open. Just looking at ARPU you accelerated thanks for the third consecutive quarter. Just curious if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that as you think about sort of uplift in CPM growing number of inventory, your ability to fill more inventory product mix shift any sort color you provide be great? Thank you. ARPU is doing well, up 50% in the quarter driven by two big chunks advertising is the biggest contributor to ARPU and then content distribution is the other big contributor. I'll let Scott who runs our platform business talk more about it specific. Ralph the driver are and you ticked off a few of them in your question. Certainly we continue to build better and better ad products - ad products that perform better for our advertisers. Anthony mentioned in his opening remarks that Roku ads are simply more effective than linear TV ads this IPG study that was run showing the Roku ad over 67% more effectiveness.
But more so then CPM on the ad side of the business the drivers for us are frankly simply selling more - working with more and more with the top national advertisers we work with. While more than half of the top 200 ad age national advertisers many of those accounts are now in third plus year of renewing with us.
We continue to bring them research showing them that they can reach unduplicated incremental viewers in the living room through Roku that the ads are more effective. And so tapping and selling more and more of the inventory flowing through our platform is a key driver. A big part of that is video advertising but our audience development segment these ads that we sell to our content partners to help them build audiences on Roku is also growing very robustly. And as a function of how potent our tool set is for helping them acquire subscribers and the size of our user base to help them go build their business in OTT. This is Anthony I’ll also add, the big driver is audience is moving the streaming – if you look at some Nielsen data showed the 10% and 18 to 34 year-old in U.S. are only reachable via TV ads on the Roku platform, that’s a big change in the way TV ads are consumed. Maybe just as follow-up intra quarter there is announcement about Samsung offering or going to offer the Roku channel going forward and I know Samsung it doesn't license OS. But just curious just in terms of how you're thinking about that opportunity to drive more active accounts to the overall Roku platform? Thanks. We're super excited about the Roku channel I think its exciting on a bunch of different levels. We are doing extremely well on Roku. We are looking at expanding distribution reach. We announced the Samsung deal to distribute on Samsung but we're also looking are there other platforms we could potentially distribute the Roku channel on. We're also adding more, more content to the Roku channel. So for example we recently announced live news will be there – will stream in the Roku channel including ABC News.
Growing in popularity on Roku is getting a lot of usage and I think it’s a great way for content owners to monetize and build honest with their content without putting a lot of – building a lot of new skills, so it's got a big future I think. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. I want to ask a question to Scott about getting access to more ad inventory or inventory in which you can place ads or share the ad revenue. Can you just talk about that how those industry conversations for Roku are going and what it is that sort of unpeeling some more and more of that add inventory towards you, I know just mentioned, you just talked about this recently but are you seeing the material pick up in the percentage of content ad supported content companies that are on your site.
Now more willing to share that ad revenue or giving you that ad inventory, is it a pricing dynamic, is it industry acceptance, is it ad units or really not much more power to build to them just talk about the back end and how you free up that or how you gain access to more of that ad inventory? Thank you. It's really a combination of all the things that you mentioned in your question. Our goal at the end of the day is to create value for our content partners to get them on to the platform whether through an app or TRC to build their audience and to help them monetize. We are increasingly; we are monetizing an increasing share of the ad inventory that flows through our platform. We do that in a variety of ways, we've got partners to look to us exclusively to help them monetize because we're so good at it. We've got partners who have their own sales team and they sell a piece and we sell a piece and then we've got lots of additional types of relationships.
As we've gotten bigger as we've demonstrated more and more success in the market in selling into TV advertising budgets our partners have gotten more and more comfortable with Roku playing a role in their success and their monetization on the platform. You wouldn’t be willing to quantify that at all would you that increasing share the ad inventory or quantify or qualitatively talk about it’s a small percentage and then where you think you could go to? It’s a small percentage but it can get bigger. I mean the ads, an average household in U.S. is worth about $500 in ad revenue and we're still a small part of that. And that entire $70 billion in – advertising spend is going to switch to streaming as – over time and we won’t get all of it but we’re well positioned to participate in the big piece of it. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. I want to dig a little more into Roku channel then your comment or letter about upfront meetings. So on the Roku channel can you just talk for example like with Samsung, how much of that’s about actually bringing ad revenue to you versus signing up new households. And how do you think about, Samsung participating in the economics.
And then in addition in the letter you talked about adding more meaningful content to the Roku channel and you listed studios. How do you weigh kind of the revenue share of the economics of being bigger potentially at a lower gross margin and kind of so how do you weigh that kind of basically its profit versus margin right for the channel.
And then can you just talk about when you talked – as far as these upfront meetings – just give us some more color is this guaranteed inventory that you’re selling are you part of discussions are being led by the networks, just some more color on that? Thank you. With regards to your question about Samsung, we look at TRC as creating value for consumers up and then find great content, great free content, creating value for our content partners helping them build audiences in addition to whatever direct consumer experiences they may have on our platform and creating value for advertisers giving them both incremental reach and new ad products to message to users.
The extension of the Roku channel to Samsung really is about just amplifying the value that we're creating for our content partners and our advertisers in the form of incremental reach. This is an important criteria for advertisers just to know that they're reaching more and more viewers. And so that is the driver behind relationships like the Roku channel on Samsung. Now with your question - on your question with regards to content and content licensing, TRC is exceeded our expectations both in terms of just share hours of viewership and number of users engaging.
And it's really for us a vehicle that we're looking to accelerate. The news partnerships that Anthony mentioned folks like ABC News coming into the Roku channel are reflective of our desire to stand that and keep growing TRC aggressively. And our content partners CTRC is really creating a whole new vector for audience growth for content providers in OTT. So you'll see, you'll continue to see us working hard at the content in TRC and the places where it’s available.
You also had a question about upfronts, this is the first year that Roku is participating in the upfront which for TV folks is the spring season when they sit down and they plan their annual TV investments. That's important because it's indicative of the fact that national advertisers are starting to think holistically about how to reach consumers in the living room and recognize that a larger and larger portion of their viewers are now only available in OTT.
So during those upfront meetings we're sitting down with agencies and brands and providing them with planning tools and showing them incremental viewership that's possible. In our platform and ultimately this is what's influencing those advertisers to make OTT a part of their annual TV budgeting process. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open. First I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on roughly what portion of your streaming hours are now on AVAD Services. And then in terms of the Best Buy channel for you guys I just want to clarify sounds like that you received some assurances or transparency - from Best Buy about its plans after it rules out the Amazon TVs in its stores and that's what's kind of giving you the confidence if that all continue to be a growth channel for you. I just want to clarify that - it sounds like that your comments are based on some assurances or clarity I don't think that the deal is yet rolled out so just wanted to clarify that? Thanks. I'll take the Best Buy question and I'll let Scott answer the other part of the question. Best Buy sells all our retailers sell multiple models of Roku TVs - we have 10 different OEMs and I guess the way I would say it is - as we're confident that you based on our - the visibility we have today and to the rest of the year and the holiday season that the number of models of Roku TV at Best Buy will go up this year versus last year. And it will go up with Walmart and it will go up in probably all of our retailers. Mark with regards to your question about AVAD, we don't have an updated number for you with regard to the share but the AVAD segment this ad supported programming and channels on our platform continues to be the fastest growing segment of consumption on our platform. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Alan Gould with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Two questions, Scott can you give us some sense how ESPN Plus is doing on the app. And also on the Roku channel, is there any limitations by the content owners of you taking that content off of the Roku Universe and do you pay upfront at all for any of that content or is it all revenue share? On ESPN I won't comment specifically on their performance, but I will say we were very excited to get that app launched on our platform it’s a great partnership, a great team and we think they brought forward really great consumer experience. With regard to TRC and our rights there, the best leverage, the best influence we have with our content partners is showing them what's possible when they partner with us to build audiences on our platform and to help them monetize their awesome IP.
We've done that the Roku channel is doing incredibly well on Roku and so our content partners have been very, very gained to look beyond what we’re doing today towards other opportunities to monetize both on and off Roku. And is it all rev shared you kept for any of that content? We send the fastest the mix of rev shares and licenses to the content is on the Roku channel. Our next question is from Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. [indiscernible]? Tom, we can’t actually hear your question, I don’t know if you can rephrase it. So without specifically talking about ESPN Plus I just wanted to know what you thought about more in live sports heading to OTT and whether or not that could be a needle mover for revenue for Roku? Thanks. There is lots of live sports available on Roku, I mean there is ESPN, there is the NFL channel, there is soccer base, I mean I think at this point more or less everything is available it just depends you might have to buy a virtual MVPD package or you might have to buy a bundle to get some of the sports. I don’t know if you want to add. I mean we - we also obviously think live in news as a great pairing and the preferred way that lot of people want to watch news which is why we’ve gone ahead and written partnerships with ABC and Cheddar and people to bring live news to the Roku channel. We’re very excited about the opportunity there as well. There is a misconception among a lot of people that live is not really available OTT just live generally that’s not true there is lots of live content that streams. [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Anthony Wood for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining our call. I’d like to sum up by just saying that on May 20, we’ll ring the open bell again at NASDAQ and celebrate National Streaming Day which also marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of our first streaming player which was the first player that allowed Netflix to stream to the TV. We made a lot of progress since then as you can see from our performance last quarter. Industry trends are favorable and we are still early in the global shift to streaming. Thanks for your support and for joining our call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.","today's earnings conference call is being recorded .

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. James Samford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Samford, you may now begin. Good afternoon. And welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, the GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A. Please be sure to review our shareholder letter, which contains much more details than we will cover in the introductory remarks.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, August 8, 2018 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. Some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the third quarter and full-year 2018 and the future growth of our business.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today's shareholder letter and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations to non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on Company's Investor Relations Web site at ir.roku.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our IR Web site for important content.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period in 2017. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. Thank you, James, and thanks everyone for joining our second quarter earnings call. The strong momentum we saw entering 2018 continued this quarter as we expanded our reach to 22 million active accounts, up 46%. ARPU was up 48% year-over-year to a record high as per customer revenue continued strong growth. We are pleased with this growth but know these are still early days as consumers, content providers and advertisers, continue to make the transition to streaming.
The Roku Channel continues to be an area of focus and growth for us. Our Roku Channel strategy is to focus on free longform content, expand content categories, extend to platforms beyond the Roku OS and broaden into new geographies. For example, we recently added news to the Roku Channel and we recently announced availability in Canada. Today, we launched the Roku Channel for the Web, allowing anyone to stream free movies and TV shows. And we also released the Roku Channel as an app on select smart Samsung TVs.
Another important announcement in the quarter was the launch of our new Roku TV wireless speakers. These are specifically designed for Roku TVs and use the Roku connect wireless protocol. These speakers dramatically increase how easy it is to improve the sound quality on a Roku TV. This makes Roku TV more appealing to consumers, which should increase loyalty and engagement. On the advertising front, we are making our targeted capabilities and technology more accessible to content publishers and advertisers through our new programmatic audience marketplace. This is an exciting time to be in the streaming business. The massive TV ecosystem is moving to modern platforms with streaming at the center of a more dynamic and innovative approach to content distribution.
At Roku, we are determined to deliver enormous benefits to consumers and to help content publishers and advertisers thrive on our platform. Before opening the line up for questions, I'll turn it over to Steve for brief comments on our results and outlook. Thanks Anthony. We had a particularly strong quarter, which is turning 2018 into another great year for Roku. Our active account growth of 46% year-over-year came from the strength in both players and Roku TV. Please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter, but I will highlight a few items before turning to comment on our outlook.
Total Q2 revenue increased 57% year-over-year to $156.8 million with platform revenue nearly doubling again and representing 58% of total revenue. Monetization of our platform continues to be driven by strong advertising growth, which is the largest and fastest growing part of Roku, but we also saw very strong content distribution revenue growth this quarter.
Player revenue growth of 24% was particularly strong this quarter with robust demand for streaming players across both our retail and partner channels. And we saw less impact from discounting or mix shift to low price players compared to last year. Player units were up 22% year-over-year and ASPs were up 2%. As we have said in the past, player revenues can be lumpy based on a variety of factors, including timing of retail shipments, partner promotional campaign and supply chain and inventory levels. Heading into Q3, we are comping against a very strong Q3 last year and based on visibility we have today, we expect player revenue to be roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year.
Q4 is seasonally our strongest quarter for players and we anticipate delivering modest positive year-over-year growth. Our key financial performance metrics is gross profit, which was up 107% year-over-year this quarter to a record $77.8 million. While the biggest driver was platform gross profit growth of 84% year-over-year, player gross profit benefited from lower COGS from the release of accruals of $8.9 million related to potential IP licensing liabilities that have not materialized and management now believes will not materialize. Excluding these accrual releases, which did not impact revenue, total gross profit was up 83% year-over-year and gross margin expanded six percentage points year-over-year to 44%.
We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, primarily via increased headcount, resulting in year-over-year OpEx growth of 53% to $78 million. Adjusted EBITDA came in well ahead of our outlook at positive $7.1 million in Q2 based on strong overall results and the benefit from IP licensing accrual reversal. In the New Year, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 details of which are disclosed in our first quarter 10-Q, which we filed in May 2018. In the income statement for this quarter, revenue and gross profit under ASC 606 were roughly $3.1 million and $0.8 million higher than they would have been under ASC 605 respectively.
Most of the impact was in our platform segment related to the gross up of both revenue and cost of goods sold for inventory split ad impressions. The difference between 605 and 606 will continue to be highly volatile in the back half depending on a variety of factors such as timing and terms of contract signings or modification, mix of ad inventory and timing of delivery of obligations under existing contracts. Based on what we have reported year-to-date and our visibility into the back half, we now expect the overall difference between 606 and 605 for the year to be positive $5 million to $10 million on revenue and roughly neutral on gross profit.
With that brief overview, let me turn to our outlook. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and what we know as of today about account growth, engagement and monetization trends, we are again raising our full-year outlook. Our updated full-year outlook increases to 40% revenue growth and 61% gross profit growth at the midpoint, up from prior growth rates of 36% and 49% respectively when we provided outlook in May and 31% and 43% growth in our February outlook. Consistent with what we’ve said in the past, we plan to reinvest gross profit upside back into R&D and sales and marketing to fuel continued growth and innovation. And the effect of these investments, which is primarily headcount related is expected to show up in 2019 and beyond.
Based on the strength of the first half of 2018, we now expect positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year, up from at or near breakeven previously. As you may have seen in recent 8-K filings, we signed a new lease agreement that will significantly expand our real estate footprint over the next few years, and provide us with capacity to grow. We expect this to add incremental expense in CapEx in 2019 and 2020. Our goal continues to be to manage the business at roughly breakeven during this period of market expansion, and we will provide more detailed outlook for 2019 in our Q4 earnings call in February.
For Q3, our outlook for year-over-year revenue growth of 35% at the midpoint factors in a roughly flat player revenue growth and modest slowdown in Q3 platform revenue growth, primarily due to tough comp in the prior year when platform grew 137% year-over-year. Continued mix shift to video advertising and seasonality in player margin is reflected in our outlook for year-over-year total gross profit growth of 47% at the midpoint, and nearly 4 percentage points of margin expansion.
On the expense side, we are adding talent at a rapid pace, which factors into our outlook for a modest adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 before rebounding to positive adjusted EBITDA in our seasonally strong Q4. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we continue to see plenty of opportunities to reinvest in our business to solidify our long-term growth potential.
Thank you for your continued interest in Roku. And with that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Just wanted to ask about the Roku channel launching for free on all devices. Obviously, it's very early. But is there any way you can give us a sense for how you think about the longer-term opportunity with this announcement in terms of drive engagement in new accounts and monetization? And then just a follow-up to that would be is the content set that you currently have for the Roku channel available or will there be incremental investment necessary for content or marketing? Thank you. This is Anthony I'll start and maybe Scott can add something. Just overall our strategy - to recap our Roku channel strategy it’s free longform content so [indiscernible] service. Our goal is to keep expanding [reach] [ph]. So one way we’re going to do that is expanding our platform, so we announced for example, our Web launch today. We plan to expand to more geographical regions. So for example, we recently announced we’re entering Canada. And then we plan to keep adding more content categories, particularly longform content. So for example, we added news recently. So we’re making good progress on that strategy. And I'll let Scott answer the question around the economics. And just to add to Anthony's comment and by way of background, the Roku Channel launched last September. We’ve had huge success with the channel on our platform in the time since. The channel is already a top five reach channel in terms of the number of users or accounts that it reaches in a given month. And it really validates the original thesis behind the channel, which is that there is this great thirst amongst OTT consumers for free content. So the announcement that you saw today are really an extension of that thesis and taking that experience off platform where we can amplify the impact that we have for our content partners, extend reach for our advertisers and ultimately meet new users who may not yet have Roku.
In terms of your question, Evan about content, the strategy is -- take the same types of content off platform and give users the same experience. And as I said with our content partners the dialogue is really around how can we expand the number of people and ultimately the money that they earn in partnering with us to provide free ad support experiences like Roku Channel. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. So our work suggests that Roku channel advertising could be as high as 15% of your total advertising. Without commenting that's right or wrong how do you think about the margins of Roku Channel advertising relative to the rest of the ad business? Second question, is it possible to get an update on the Samsung partnership, potential timing, any color, will this be older sets, newer sets? Any help would be helpful. And then lastly, Steve, on this $8.9 million benefit. Would you agree that the right way really to strip it out, both in the quarter and the guide, and obviously that’s one time and really could be out of the compares for 2019? Thanks. With regards to your first question about the contribution of the Roku channel, I’m not going to disclose the percent today, but I will say it’s already a material contributor to our ad sale, not just in terms of raw volume but the opportunity for us to create new ad experiences, because it's a wholly controlled experience. So for example, we are regularly now crafting sponsorships that live within the Roku channel. These are unique experiences that allow brands to message directly to our users. With regards to your question about Samsung, we’ve already been active in sponsorship activity on the Samsung platform. And with today's launch, the Roku channel going live, we’ll be extending the Roku channel experience to Samsung sets. These are select Samsung TVs but generally the newer models, the Tizen models, as Samsung calls them. Just on the $8.9 million for the IP licensing accrual release that’s a process that we do regularly. We review all our accruals and contingencies and then we assess the likelihood for them to materialize. This quarter it was a particularly large number. So I think it's appropriate for you to look at it and back that out as a unusually big accrual release versus standard what we experienced in any given quarter. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Two questions. Anthony, could you talk a little bit about your TV OS landscape and a little bit about your expectations for signing new partners and landing new agreements to look out over the next couple of years. And in particular I’d be curious why you think some OEMs use Roku OS for some SKUs but not all of them. And what the opportunity might be to take that to the relationship you have with TCL? And then just for Scott, the Roku audience network I know it’s new. But can you give us any qualitative commentary on how your publishing partners have responded to that, how they might be using it? And any help on thinking about the revenue model for Roku, given I think it's a data services business rather than something where you’re the principal seller of that. Any help there would be great. Thank you. So Ben so on TV, this is Anthony. On TV I would say at a high level, it’s progressing as we expected. Our thesis is that all TV OEMs will switch to a licensed operating system, just like all phone company, phone makers either license Android or the Apple. That same dynamic is happening in TVs and we’re by far the number one licensor of OS to TV manufacturers. One in four smart TVs in the first half of the year, were licensed Roku TVs. So it’s going well. And in terms of the dynamics around what's coming next I think you will continue to see us adding more OEMs and adding more SKUs at retailers. So I think that will continue.
The -- why do OEM - some OEMs not carry 100% Roku SKUs, because they are still I think learning and finding their way and still learning that Roku SKUs sell better. So they are not necessarily all in at once. But we generally deliver excellent results working with partners and they generally increase the SKU count as their business with us progresses. So the TV business I think it’s doing well.
Our biggest competitor in that business is [inertia] [ph] with homegrown OSs. But as companies that continue to ship their own operating systems start continue to lose market share then there I think that will drive everyone to eventually license an OS. Ben, with regards to your question about the recently announced Roku audience marketplace, what I’d provide by way of background is that from the very beginning, our goal with advertising at Roku has been elevate, to evolve the state of advertising to make TV advertising natively targetable, interactive, much more highly measured like any digital media that a modern marketer expects. As you know, we run a robust and very fast growing ad sales business of our own, but the majority of ad inventory flowing through our platform is still sold by publishers on our platform.
And so a consistent request from the beginning from our publishers that we serve in many ways has been to help empower them with some of the same capabilities, so that they themselves can commence higher CPMs and compete in this evolving TV world. So the marketplace is really about deploying our ad tech and our data so that premium publishers like Fox, Viacom and Turner can sell addressable interactive high-value campaigns, leveraging the capabilities that we built at Roku into our operating system. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham & Co. Maybe a couple, so I think first, Scott, we just went through our first upfront and we got the final numbers today at the upfront, it was up 5%. But I’m interested in what your learnings were from being in the TV upfront this year and whether you can give us more granularity on your process and anything you’re willing showing upfront? Second -- how about Anthony, Apple is saying that the China tariffs are not affecting them. Can you just let us know if any of these TVs or any of these lists so far, and whether you think the Chinese tariffs will affect any of your deals with Chinese TV manufacturers? And then my last question is normally you give us -- the last couple of quarters, you have given us of your added users, what -- you said half are Roku TV. I assume that this huge over delivery on the player side means that that was lower, meaning units accounted for more. So could you size for us how much the units added to this quarter versus Roku TVs on the user side that would be great? Thanks guys. So in terms of the tariff, this time we’re not seeing any financial impact from the tariffs. They don’t appear to affect any of our products. It’s something that’s changing and we’re monitoring it carefully so we’ll keep an eye on it. Laura, with regards to your question about the upfront, I don’t have any specifically things to mention here except to say that they went very well. This is really the first time in our ad sales business history where we were participating in the upfront planning window. And I think the big takeaway for us is this is really the first year in which advertisers are proactively planning for OTT as part of their annual TV spending plan. Roku now uniquely delivers 10% of adult 18 to 34. So if you're planning against that critical demo, you’ve got to include OTT in your planning process. And we were very active across town in equipping these teams with the tools to think about the portion of their budgets that should be spent against OTT. So I’d characterize our activity in the upfront is very successful. Anthony, do you want to take the question… I think, Steve, do you want to take that? Laura, I will do the users. So yes, in terms of the mix between the licensing and players, players had a particularly strong quarter. It certainly can be lumpy. But given that the mix for licensing versus player went slightly under 50%, but we don't think that's a consistent trend. And so we still think the majority going forward will be -- new accounts will be generated from licensed sources. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Thanks for taking my questions I have two if I could. First on players, given the upside and player revenue. Can you talk about if the player channel move back into greater than 50% position in terms of source of new active accounts this quarter, and how you’re thinking about that? And secondly you talked about mix shift in the ad revenues to channels where your gross margins are closer to 50%. As it relates to the Roku channel since its -- is it fair to say that is one of your higher margin channels, and much higher than the 50%? Just trying to give a sense of how that’s impacting the platform margins. Thanks. As part the answer to last question, I did mention that players had a particularly strong quarter, both in terms of retailer demands and content promotion, partner promotion. That did drive the licensing to player new account percentage down where licensing was a little under 50%, but we don't think that’s a consistent trend going forward, more of a blip just give how strong the player business was. The player business can be lumpy and so that’s something that we wouldn’t recommend extrapolating in our -- as we mentioned in our remarks that we think the player business, on a revenue basis will be roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and then a modest growth year-over-year in Q4.
In terms of the mix shift in ad revenues, I would really look at it in terms of -- within the platform segment, the video advertising business on average is roughly 50% business or slightly better. And then other pieces of the platform in terms of audience development or the content distribution side, those tend to be much higher margins. So I wouldn’t necessarily specify CRC versus non-CRC video ads, more of how the video ad business overall runs. Mark this is Scott. I would just add to that that while margins are healthy in TRC it’s also an incredibly strategic channel for us for the reasons I mentioned earlier. It’s a channel that we fully control. We can create new ad product and new experiences. It’s a vehicle for us to go off platform. And so while we certainly are -- care about the margins and achieve healthy margins in the channels, it’s also got incredible strategic value to us as a platform. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Two questions if I could. First, just curious what drove the reacceleration or modest reacceleration in streamed hours, just general market continuing with OTT or the Roku channel have pronounced impact there. And then two, Steve would you mind us clarifying what you talked about for EBITDA margins. I know you talked about increased OpEx for the facility and reinvestments. But did you say that you’re potentially going to look to run the business at breakeven in 2019. Just in terms of the streaming hours, the streaming hours in the active accounts have been growing in similar range, and they can bounce around each quarter. Active accounts were up 46% and the streaming hours were up 57%. So I wouldn’t note any material change in terms of acceleration of streaming hours per se, it's been relatively consistent relative to the growth rate of the active account. So it's been growing faster than active accounts consistently, which has speaks to increased engagement on the platform but nothing more significant than that.
In terms of the EBITDA for facility, as we mentioned that we signed a new headquarters lease, we think that will have incremental OpEx and CapEx. Frankly, that's really business as usual as we’ve been continuing to grow and our lease will be up soon and we’re running out of space. In terms of running a breakeven in 2019, I mean that’s been a stated goal before so just reaffirming that. Certainly, we will get into the more specifics on the 2019 guidance when we get to the February call. But that’s been a consistent plan is we think there is tons of growth opportunity and we’re still early days in the transition of streaming. And we have a lot of great investments so we’re going to continue to manage the business to invest in these growth opportunities as the gross profit growth continues. Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. So I have two questions. The first is, with I think it was the mid May launch of live news. Can you talk about how user engagement is with that content versus the other content in the platform? And then second now that you have additional hardware SKUs with the speakers. Can you tell us what your strategy is on profitability? For example, do you intend to -- all the speakers at breakeven similar to your other hardware, the players? Thanks. So in terms of news, news is doing well on the Roku channels. We haven’t broken out the percentage, but its meeting our expectations and doing well and adding engagements. Engagement continues to grow on the Roku channel, it’s moved up to a top five channel in reach. So we’re pleased with the progress. The strategy of course like I said before is to keep adding more content sources. So we added news and we’re going to be adding more types of content as well, primarily longform and of course free content and expanding reach with new off-platform distribution and more geographies.
In terms of the speakers, I am really excited about our new speakers. They’re awesome I’m using them at home and really enjoying them. They sound excellent. But it’s not -- for us, the reason we’re doing wireless speakers is it’s not really about generating hardware revenue, it’s about making the Roku TV platform an even better TV platform. So we believe that Roku TV OS licensing platform that we license is the best smart TV platform in the industry, but we think we can make it better. And one of the things -- one of the ways we can make it better is making it super easy, bringing it to an ease of use to a new level when a customer wants to enhance the audio of their TV.
TVs are getting thinner results that just from physics is sound quality gets worse so people want to upgrade the audio quality of their TVs. And they do that today with home theater systems or sound bars, and those systems can be expensive and they are certainly not easy to use or connect. And so with the Roku TV wireless speakers, you just plug the speakers in, they pair to the TV and now you got better sound on your TV, it’s just a much, much better experience and they sound great. So for us it’s about making the Roku TV platform even better, more appealing to customers and we think that will result in more loyalty to the Roku platform. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. So I want to just about outreach efforts with advertisers, or any color you can give us on other verticals, particular advertisers you’d call out that have really -- are engaging a lot more with Roku, a lot more with OTT advertising opportunities, just color on that side of the business. And then how many people you have that are trying to go out to advertising, and then any thoughts or final thing on that, on the use of the application of programmatic as an advertising solution. Thanks a lot. With regards to the advertisers we service, at the end of the day, we’re a TV ad platform. And so we’re seeing activity across every vertical that’s active in TV advertising, whether that's financial services or CPG or farmer auto. If we over index, it would be in entertainment, because at the end of the day, we’re an entertainment platform. We’re doing business with well over 50% of the top 200 national advertisers and every quarter we crack new accounts, most of that top 200 now are in renewal phases with us.
With regards to how we go about securing that business, we’re a natively digital ad stack, programmatic is coursework platform. The audience marketplace, which we spoke about a little earlier on this call, is programmatic at its core. Data driven selling programmatic based techniques are, in our opinion, a central component of the future of the way TV advertising is going to be traded. But it’s also true that the vast majority of the $70 billion that’s spent in TV advertising today is bought and sold in a more traditional fashion. And so we do have a team that services that aspect of the business as well. And to Laura Martin's question earlier also about our participation in the upfront that’s a central way in which we go secure TV ad dollars as well. Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. So starting off of featured free functionality in the platform, I was wondering if you could speak to whether this is more of a display ad opportunity for you guys. That seems like these are pretty premium services that are going to be fed through it, so I’m not sure if this is an inventory opportunity as well, or just simply a user interface opportunity for engagement. And then a quick follow-up on the tariffs question earlier. I was wondering if there was anything you could speak to around suppliers and diversification of geography of supply of OS TVs and players, or any color around that. And then my last question is around Roku Pay and whether there's anything to be said right now around new developments or functionality for easing the OTT subscription pay and processing through that? Let me just talk a little bit about feature free. So one of the things we believe about the Roku platform is that it’s the best platform for free content. Obviously, all the paid services are available in the pathway but people want value when they switch to streaming and that means people like free content. And of course our ad business is the poor driver of our gross profit, and so we’re big fans of free as supported content as well. The feature free feature is the new main menu option that aggregates all the free content -- not all of it, but a lot of the free content that’s available and Roku makes it easy for customers to find
There is lots of free content on Roku, but there is also 5,000 channels on Roku and it’s -- a viewer might not know where to go to look for free content. So the primary goal is to aggregate that into one spot from a UI experience make it easy for consumers to find it. And when they find something they want to watch they click on it and then it deep links into that app, so it runs the app and then launches that channel. So that’s a combination of editorial -- it's an editorial based feature so we decided what goes into feature free. And we obviously want to help consumers -- I mean, we want put good content in there but we also want content that we have good economic relationships in there with as well, so kind of a combination there.
In terms of tariffs, I don’t have much more to say about tariffs, except that they don't currently affect us. Our TVs -- we have a lot of different TV manufacturers and they are not built in China. We have TVs built in different places around the world as well. And then I'll let Scott to talk about Roku Pay. Roku Pay remains a major area of investment for us. Our view is that it removes the friction for consumers to sign up for services, buy movies on our platform and it’s a great service for our content partners who are interested in acquiring users on our platform. And so it remains a key area of investment and technology and talent side of things and really central to our subscription business and also our audience development business where our publishers basically buy advertising from us to drive people into that pay funnel. Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. I was wondering if we could drill into the video advertising revenue in the quarter. If you could help us size up either the size of the video revenue or year-on-year growth and what drivers were most important volume versus pricing? And also, would you be willing to tell us what percentage of streaming hours were actually supported, i.e. monetizable for you, excluding -- that exclude SVOD and YouTube? So any color around those variables would be super helpful. Thank you very much. We have not broken out video ad revenues specifically, but what I'll say is that the ad business runs about -- it flows up and down about two thirds of our platform revenues and the video ad portion of that is our largest ad business. Your question with regards to volume or pricing -- pricing is really strong and growing. The big driver of our growth is really volume and selling into new accounts and getting existing advertisers to spend more with us. We don’t disclose the exact portion of our leadership that’s AVOD. I’ll just say there that as you can see by our investment in TRC and featured free that ad support viewing remains one of our strongest growing segments. It's really a investment for us and a big part of our making such progress on engagement and monetization of the platform. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Gould with Loop Capital. I’ve got two questions please. First, what kind of response you’re getting from the content producers that are supply programming to Roku, whether Roku channel as the channel is getting more successful. And also do you have the rights to take the programming across platforms and across geographies, or you just have different programs on the Roku channel depending on the geography? And my second question is I would assume we’re getting close to the shipments of the new TVs for the holiday season. I believe you’ve got about your 25% market share of TVs are now Roku powered. What do you think that's going to look at the -- what do you think that market share will be at the holiday season? The response Alan from content partners in their partnership with us on TRC has been great. The important thing to know is that there’s just mountains and mountains of IP out there of great programming that’s being under-monetized. And the Roku channel, because of its success, has become a really powerful vehicle for content partners to reach consumers in monetizing our platform. Our success there is a big part of how we are now exporting TRC to other platforms. Our content partners want to partner with us in that endeavor. You had a question about geography. So yes, I mean as you go into other geographies, the licensing teams or paradigms to shift but within the U.S. our cross-platform deals tend to be singular deals. And regarding TV, the TV business is really doing well and we’re growing market share there. Other than the outlook we’ve given, we don’t have any particular outlook for the second half of the year. But I would say that just our TVs are getting great reviews, the TCL 6-Series is an awesome TV just one CNET editor’s choice. Roku TVs are the top-selling TVs on amazon.com. That our fundamental thesis that all TV manufacturers license an OS is not changed we believe that the case. And our market share in the first half was one and four smart TVs in U.S. that means three and four are not Roku TVs, and those are almost all, what we would call homegrown operating systems. And I’d believe that the dynamic of a Roku TV having a better cost structure and much more content and a better user experience is going to result -- is resulting in more and more OEM switching to the licensed OS of which Roku is number one licensor of OS in the U.S. and we expect to remain in that position. So I think the market share is going to continue to grow as TV manufacturers switch to licensed OSs. Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG. I got a couple. First, when I see on the Roku channel things like Cheddar programming or people TV, I assume that those are channels that are content that is more than willing to benefit from the advertising opportunity that Roku presents given the amount of usage that you're getting off of that channel. But when I see things like the Matrix trilogy, which is the highlight today on the Roku channel. Are you buying that content or essentially paying upfront for that content from Warner Brothers? How does that work when we're seeing really high-profile movie content showing upfront in center in the Roku channel? Are the economics different? And I think essentially tied to the last question that Alan asked. Do you have access to the Roku channel up in Canada and across all devices, or does it vary based on platform and country, et cetera? And then I have a quick follow-up. I’ll let Steve and Scott answer your question on the Roku channel. But first I just want to note that not a single person or call who has congratulated me on our quarter today. So I’m not sure what's going on [Multiple Speakers] would be rich… That was amazing… But anyway, Scott, you want to… Great quarter, Anthony… Yes, thank you. Rich, the answer is the mix of models is evolving, it’s still early days certainly that’s the case for international. We really just launched TRC in another geography in Canada as part of a new push abroad for us to take some of the same ad capabilities that we’ve built here in the U.S. to other geographies. Our economic models are a mix of, Web shares and then many of our content partners with apps on our platform are now also syndicating content into the Roku channel. So they have like Cheddar, they have [Multiple Speakers]. Since you brought up Cheddar, there is a Cheddar app on Roku but then there is a Cheddar live stream within the Roku channel. And our view is that at the end of the day for IP owners what's going to matter to them is traffic and monetization and that partnership with us around a property like the Roku channel is a way to supercharge the audience and earnings that they see on the platform. And so we should assume that there is some amount of capital that you're committing towards actual licensing of content, a minimal amount but some level of capital? We do directly license some content. But I think, for example the Matrix, titles like that come part on the Roku channel, I think -- I know it's just a reflection of this increasing scale of the Roku channel and the ability to operate with the same economic model that offers more popular content. We’ve got a little less than a year under our belt. We’re getting more and more confidence in predicting what users are going to consume, what's going to resonate with them. We’re getting more and more expert -- not just at prediction but actually promoting, driving traffic around it and that’s why you will see us get bolder with great titles like the Matrix Trilogy. And then just a quick follow-u, or a separate question. So one of the most interesting apps that I’ve seen launch over the last few years has been something called Locast, which is launched on Android, basically is providing free over the air television in New York and Dallas. They don't have a Roku app yet. But it would seem like a great way for you to offer on Roku devices, and potentially even on the Roku channel, a wide array of high-quality premium content. Is that something you're interested in and looking at other ways? I know Areo I think had a channel on Roku at one point before that was shut down. But how do you think about new forms of over the air television making its way on to your platform. Most of what I know about Locast is from reading your note on it, Rich. But I won’t comment on future apps coming on t the platform. We do remain an open platform and I think we’ve demonstrated interest in all programming coming on to the platform. I don’t think we’re in a position to comment specifically on their strategy or its merits. But there is no reason Locast couldn’t be on the Roku platform and we’re curious to see how it does. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any closing remarks. Thanks. I’d like to close by saying we are pleased with this quarter's results and the positive outlook for the rest of 2018. We’re making great strides in growing active accounts, engaging TV viewers and helping content publishers and brands reach them. I am particularly excited about our rate of innovation. This quarter alone, we introduced the audience marketplace feature free, Roku TV wireless speakers and expanded the Roku channel. Thanks for all your support and for joining today's call. And I look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","today's call is based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions . our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call . if otherwise stated, all comparisons will be against our results for the comparable period in 2017.",1.0

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, the GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A. Please be sure to review our shareholder letter, which contains much more details than we will cover in the introductory remarks.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, November 07, 2018 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. Some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 and the future growth of our business.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today's shareholder letter and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on Company's Investor Relations Website at ir.roku.com and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR Website for important content.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period in 2017.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. Thank you, James and thanks everyone for joining today's call. We had another great quarter with outstanding results. The transition to streaming is creating huge opportunities for Roku. We are executing well and the fundamentals of our business are strong.
Cord cutting continues to alter the TV landscape. We believe the trend will accelerate as more consumers understand the choice and value that streaming offers and as traditional Pay TV bundle shrink, more content will move to streaming.
The scale of our customer base now rivals large traditional US cable and satellite companies and while they are losing video subscribe, we continue to grow quickly and I'm encouraged by the high level of engagement from our nearly 24 million active accounts.
In our shareholder letter, we set out a number of ways that OTT is a superior solution for advertisers. For example, this quarter we announced our measurement partner program; our ability to demonstrate effectiveness is unlocking larger and larger budgets. Already around two thirds of the Ad Age top 200 advertisers have worked with Roku.
The Roku channel celebrated its first anniversary this quarter. We launched it only a year ago and we made huge progress growing it's reach and engagement and is now a meaningful part of our advertising growth strategy.
Roku has the unique position in the industry and we continue to execute well in a competitive marketplace. The opportunity before us is large and it's a great time to be in the streaming business.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve for brief comments on our results and outlook. Thanks Anthony. Our strong third quarter results have put us on track for another record year. Active account growth of 43% year-over-year and streaming our growth of 63% year-over-year help deliver another quarter above our outlook. Please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter, but I'll highlight a few items and provide some color on Q4 outlook.
Total Q3 revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $173.4 million with platform revenue up 74% to a milestone of $100 million and representing 58% of total revenue. There are several key components to our platform business and I'd highlight that video ad sales, the largest part of the platform more than doubled year-over-year again this quarter.
We also saw very strong results from the audience development business, which is closely linked to our content distribution business since many of our content partners take advantage of our marketing tools to attract audiences to their services.
Player revenue growth of 9% was ahead of the outlook we provided with another strong quarter from retail channels. Player units were up 15% year-over-year and ASPs were down 5% as we continue to see strong demand for sub $50 players, particularly our new 4k Premiere Plus, which is priced at an incredible $49.99 at retail.
We tightened our Q4 revenue outlook slightly but as a reminder, Q4 is seasonally our strongest quarter and is very backend loaded with the bulk of our revenues occurring between Black Friday and the end of the year. So Q4 is still heavily dependent on how the holidays stack up given the highly competitive retail environment.
Our key financial performance metric is gross profit, which was up 58% year-over-year this quarter to a record $79 million. Gross margin was 45.6% up 560 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of expectations, due to strong audience development and solid player gross profit upside in the quarter.
Q4 is more promotional for players and the mix shift to video ad generally pulls platform margins down from Q3 levels. We expect to see that pattern again this quarter with platform gross margins down modestly, sequentially and player gross profit dipping to low to mid-single-digit margins.
We are investing in a wide range of growth opportunities for 2019 and beyond. So we continue to invest in attracting top talent to pursue them. OpEx in the quarter grew 57% to $90.7 million driven by a combination of continued rapid headcount growth and significantly higher stock-based comp and payroll taxes from stock option exercises.
Adjusted EBITDA came in at a positive $2 million in Q3, our first positive adjusted EBITDA Q3 ever and well ahead of our outlook as a result of higher revenue and gross profit. With that brief overview, let me turn to our outlook for the full year.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date and what we know as of today about account growth, engagement and monetization trends, we are again raising our full-year outlook. Our updated full-year outlook increases to 42% revenue growth and 63% gross profit growth at the midpoint, up from the prior growth rates of 40% and 60% respectively when we provided outlook in August.
As a reminder we plan to reinvest gross profit upside back into R&D and sales and marketing to fuel continued growth and innovation, managing the business to roughly breakeven EBITDA during this period of market expansion. However, based on the strength of the first three quarters of 2018, we expect to deliver between $21 million and $28 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year, up from our prior estimate of $11 million to $23 million.
For Q4, our outlook is for year-over-year revenue growth of 38% at the midpoint with player and platform revenue growth roughly in line with Q3 levels. Continued mix shift to video advertising and seasonality in player margins is reflected in our outlook for year-over-year total gross profit growth of roughly 41% at the midpoint.
While we expect to report positive EBITDA margins of roughly 6% in Q4, stock-based comp is expected to increase to roughly $15 million in the quarter as we see the full impact of RSU grants issued in Q3 to new and existing employees, which are expensed in the quarter that they are granted and as they vest.
We look forward to providing more color on 2019 when we report our full 2018 results in February. Given the strength of the fundamentals of our business and our leadership position, we continue to see plenty of opportunity to reinvest our business to achieve our long-term growth potential.
And with that, let's turn the call over for questions, operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Two questions. One on the Roku Channel and one on the Roku Everywhere strategy, on the Roku Channel any comments on improvements in the pricing or ad load versus the last couple of quarters, and just talk about the forward growth outlook for the Roku channel and then on this Roku Everywhere strategy, just talk about traction you've seen forward so far, how do we think about -- how should we think about the materiality of that, maybe not near-term but over the next course of the next year or two? Thanks a lot. Hey Mark, Scott Rosenberg here. Great question. Roku channel continues to hit on all cylinders. We mentioned in the shareholder letter, it's a top five channel in terms of the engagement, it's grown faster than any channel in the history of the platform and continues to be a very fertile area of investment for us in terms of putting new content into it.
We got a bunch of news channels more recently. We had a great night last night for example with the midterms, the events of news drive a lot of engagement and so in general we continue to put more wood behind that fire and drive the growth of the Roku channel on platform.
We think that value proposition of free has been proven strong on our platform by the growth of the Roku channel. We do think that, that proposition extends off of Roku as well. We don't have anything more to say about off Roku plans at this point, but we do think we've demonstrated how powerful that pre-proposition is with the Roku channel. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. This is Zach on from Mark. First question, could you just provide us an update on some of your new initiatives that you announced last quarter, the featured free and the Roku Channel on the web how those are tracking relative to expectations?
And then secondly, last month you announced favorable ruling in Mexico to resume sales of Roku [indiscernible] there, so how should we be thinking about that opportunity and then kind of taking more broader picture, just how should we think about international expansion opportunities as we head into 2019, thanks? Hey this is Anthony. I'll take the Mexico and international question and then maybe Scott can talk a little bit about Feature Free and TRC. Yeah, we won, just to recap, we've been hand cuffed in Mexico for a while. We won a court case on that. We're back in full force in Mexico. So we're happy about that and that will help our Mexico business.
In terms of international, the way we think about streaming is that the global business, it's international opportunity. We launched TRC in Canada. TCL just launched Roku TVs in Canada; we're in other countries, but it is also a fact that most of our active accounts are US active accounts.
The domestic market is a large market for us and we believe there is a big opportunity internationally, but it's an area that we traditionally haven't focused on. We are starting to focus on it, but we don't have anything new to announce there yet. Mark with regards to your question about new things that we launched in the quarter as you mentioned featured free was a feature that we launched. This is yet another way, another cut for us on celebrating free across the platform. It's been quite popular as a means to drive consumer awareness of free content that's available across the platform, just as is launching TRC on the web, on desktop, on Samsung. These are all part of our broader theses which is borne out in last year of how important great, free ad supported programming is for consumers.
One other thing I'll mention about a new item in the quarter was we announced our measurement partner program which is a partnership across 11 different research companies, sort of a who's who in the measurement space from Nielsen, comScore, Oracle, Kantar, Placed.
These are partnerships that in conjunction with our ad sales allow us to prove just how much more effective an ad placed on Roku is relative to traditional linear television. It's a signal of our confidence in our transparency improving to brands that they should be shifting their budgets to OTT. Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is now open. Hi guys. Great numbers and thanks for another very nice quarter. So I was really intrigued, I really like the advertising section, I was really intrigued, you said that you could measure effectiveness and return on investment of the ads, which has been the sort of Holy Grail like you're combining visual and liner and I am just wondering if you could give us any harder data points or just examples of that. I don't really get how you couldn't go end to end, which is the holy grail of what ROI is on your ads.
That's one and then Anthony for you this hardware number is much better than we had in our estimates and so I'd like to -- do I put that into this bigger -- Amazon shoot itself in the foot by only now being an insignia brand in Best Buy and one of the reasons its hardware number over delivered player revenue is because your basically - is there a pivot going on towards Costco and Walmart where you're over-delivering this player revenue, did you see a mix shift where Amazon [indiscernible] itself competitively by aligning with Best Buy. Those are my two questions. Thank you. Laura, let me tackle your question about ad effectiveness and I'll share with you just a couple of stats before I get into some examples. So two thirds of top 200 national advertisers have spent with the seven of the top 10 brands, eight of the top 10 auto brands, four of the top six wireless brands.
We have made incredible progress in penetrating in these accounts, convincing them of the value proposition of spending in OTT and one of the best ways we do that is by bringing research to the table. In the last quarter, almost half of every ad impression that ran on our platform was associated with some sort of research study in which we were showing back to the brand the ROI of their investment with Roku.
And because every ad that we serve on Roku can be measured on an individualized basis, we can tie out and add exposure to a mid or bottom funnel KPI that an advertiser cares about. So just as an example we mentioned it in the letter, but with Carnival Cruises, we are able to directly correlate exposure to an ad on our platform with a visit to their website.
With Jack-in-the-Box and a partnership with Placed which does location-based measurement, we are able to prove that we drove 160,000 incremental visits to Jack-in-the-Box stores, restaurants and perhaps the most influential type of measurement that we're doing right now with TV advertisers is we're leveraging our ACR data to be able to show it to an advertiser who they reached through their traditional linear investment and more importantly, who they didn't reach and who they could be reaching if they were investing in OTT.
So on a pre-campaign basis, we've given an estimate of the incremental TV viewers they can reach by spending with Roku and then on a post campaign basis, we prove it and we've done dozens of those types of incremental reach studies with brands like Dell, Home Depot, Panera, [Amica] [ph], Duracell, it’s one of the most attractive aspects for a TV advertising team when they are investing with us.
Ultimately what we think helps us win in this space is providing a superior ad solution. We think the TV ad product that we're selling is the future of TV advertising. Hey Laura, this is Anthony. Before I get on -- before I discuss hardware and Best Buy for a second, I just want to add to the measurements and advertising question. 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds watch their television on Roku and so if you're an advertiser and you want to target the video ad at them, Roku is the place you have to go to reach them.
But 10% of the budgets have not moved over to Roku yet or the streaming and the biggest obstacle there is just the way the advertiser is used to buying ads, just their traditional spending pattern and so by using measurement and ROI analysis, we can help move that along by showing advertisers that this new way of advertising really, really works and so 10% of viewers are on Roku in that demographic, but the budgets haven't moved yet, but they will and it's just a question of time.
So in terms of your question on hardware and Best Buy, yes, player sales continue to do well. Why is that? Well I think it's a combination of factors. One is we build great products. Our focus on value, ease-of-use, content really pays off for example, we recently won the CNET Editor’s Choice award for the Roku Streaming Stick Plus. So that's one reason.
The other is streaming and cord cutting is really happening. Traditional pay TV operators lost a million subscribers in the quarter, two million year-to-date with a million in the quarter alone whereas Roku added 1.8 million active accounts in Q3. So cord cutting is happening, people are streaming more and we make great products at a great value.
Our business model is to grow our active account by licensing our Roku TV platform to TV companies and also selling players. We also work with operators. In terms of TV is you mentioned Best Buy. Best Buy signed a deal with Amazon, but we expect the number of Roku TVs to be sold at Best Buy this year to actually increase versus last year.
So Best Buy is an important partner for us. We sell a lot of TVs there, member of TVs to seller is growing and of course we can, our dealer is allowed to sell anywhere, not just at Best Buy. So that's great and then even the result of all that is the one in four TVs so far, one in four smart TVs sold so far this year in the United States are Roku TVs. So the business is working well for us. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe for Scott if you look at the growth of the platform business 75% this quarter expected for next quarter, what's the limiting factor for that growth because obviously you guys are doing lots of things for advertisers that are unique and differentiated. Is it access to inventory? Is it advertiser demand for inventory or is it is hours? I am just curious if we think about the sort of levers of growth, what is the limiting factor to drive that faster? Hey Ben, this is Steve, let me just talk to you a little bit about overall platform trends and then Scott can add some color on top of that. So Q3 was a very strong quarter overall for the business and platform. Had great growth at 74% year-over-year. Important to note that it hit a great milestone of the $100 million in revenue for the quarter which is the first time that's happened.
And looking into platform, there are three major components; ads, content distribution and licensing and so I think the most important takeaway of the growth trajectory there is that the ad business itself, which is the majority of platform has is shown consistent strong growth throughout the year in each of the quarters year-to-date.
The content distribution side and the licensing side can be a bit more lumpy and where we've seen strong quarters in licensing in Q1 and a particularly strong quarter in content distribution in Q2, so those can vary each quarter depending on that. So overall I think it's a great trajectory for platform and especially the ad business. Ben, with regards to your question about limiters, we don't see a near-term ceiling on our growth opportunity the video ad business grew over 100% year-over-year. I think Anthony mentioned, if we have competition, it's really the traditional spending pattern of advertisers, its traditional TV and basically constantly coaching our client to move their spending to Roku.
We've been very effective at showing them the ROI math that last dollar that they put in the linear TV is reaching a smaller and smaller base and then as they move that dollar to Roku it's going to deliver much more reach and ROI.
Just backing out more broadly and thinking about our advantages as an ad platform, the reason advertisers come to us in the first place is we're an ad scale platform with the largest most engaged user base. It's a unique audience that can only be reached on Roku. We've got that direct consumer relationships in all the data that flows from it and ultimately it's ad that work.
One of that themes of this call and in our letters how much work we're doing on the research front to prove to our advertisers that their investment with us delivers more effect than their other options for spending their money. And this is Anthony. I'll just -- let me just say that our platform business is fundamentally strong. It's well positioned and we're executing well. If you just think about it big picture, there is $70 billion a year spent on TV advertising. Our platform business in the quarter was $100 million. There's a lot -- we're very proud of that but there's a lot of room to grow there. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color Scott. I think this question is for you what is the retention rate or whatever is the right metric of how much repeat business you do with the advertisers. You've cited very impressive list of clients there.
And what are the major hurdles that you have to get them over to spend more with you and how do resolve those bottlenecks? You mentioned data, but is there structural issue, are the media buyers unwilling to lend their clients buy. So if you could give some color on that, would appreciate that. Yeah it's a great question and it's part of our everyday operation as a team. We've extremely, extremely high retention rates. Typically their relationship with us starts with a small pat spend and as I said we aggressively package research with that first spend because of our confidence that that researcher is going to show high ROI. Very quickly that rolls into multiple spending from that brand.
That said, while we work with two thirds of the top 200 national advertisers there is another third out there and that's just in the top 200 list. So I would say our focus is both on renewal and importantly expansion of current accounts as well as tapping into all the accounts that have not yet started to talk to work with us.
All that both renewal and expansion as well as new account acquisition is driving 100% growth in our video ad business. All right. And a quick follow-up Sling TV reported subscriber ads that people were disappointed with. Do you see any divergence in how virtual MVPD is performing on your platform? Hey, this is Anthony. MVPD is a great category for us. They are a great way to get access to certain contents for us for example ESPN all virtual MVPDs are growing on their platform. So we can't talk about anyone in particular, but we carry all of them I believe and it's a good business for us.
They are actively using the tools that we offer and the product we sell to help them build audience and expand their engagement. Okay Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. Two questions. First can you talk about how the mix between ads and then content distribution impacted ARPU in the third quarter and then, particularly about supply and demand factors in the ad business i.e. you said supply likely outstripping demand right now.
And then secondly, can you talk about how your participation in upfront will impact fourth quarter in 2019, given that this is new versus last year and kind of how you strategically use that event, thank you? Yeah hey Jason, it's Steve. I'll take the first part of that. So in terms of ARPU, ARPU along with all the other key operating metrics are on a great trajectory. ARPU was up over $17 on a TTM basis up 37% year-over-year.
In terms of kind of the mix within that, as we mentioned in the letter and as Scott mentioned earlier, the ad business continues to have strong consistent growth throughout the year with video advertising notably more than doubling yet again year-over-year basis.
So in terms of mix that continues to grow the mix there. As I mentioned on a answer earlier in the call, the content distribution side can bounce around depending on the quarter and this is one of those quarters where it bounced down on a relative growth basis, but important to note that all parts of the platform business are growing over time. So we're very happy with the trajectory there. Jason with regards to your question about supply and demand, I'll talk about both our audience development and our brand advertising business. It depends on the time of the year and the growth of the business. There are times on the home screen when we're supply constrained because of the activity and the interest from our content partners in promoting on the platform.
But in general most of that task is focused on optimizing what ad we're going to a user in order to drive the highest possible outcome. So I wouldn’t say it's as much supply constrained as it is about an optimization problem.
On the JDO advertising side of the equation, the platform, the ad opportunities on the platform continue to grow very aggressively. Ad supported viewership is our fastest-growing segment. The Roku channel is growing very aggressively ad supported publishers on our platform who we partner with from advertiser growing aggressively, we generally are worry less about supply and focus more on stoking more demand along wise what we've been talking about on this call is partnering with advertisers to show them the unduplicated incremental users that could be reaching in OTT.
That's a good get set up for your question about up-fronts. Our goal going into upfront discussions with advertisers was to engage them literally as they're planning out their annual TV spending cycle and to show them what they needed to be spending in OTT to complete their TV reach plans. We've been very effect to add that and there are really two main results from those upfront discussions.
One is significant increases in spending commitments from agencies and brands in that cycle and importantly two, we've been asked because we're a leader in this space to help agencies and brands proactively plan for OTT as a category and because of our scale and our reach our tool set like our ACR tools, we've been able to help them with that planning cycle, which ultimately for us is a much deeper relationship with the right side of this business. This is Anthony. I'll just add that there is a lot of things we're working on to improve our platform, a lot of tactical things to make sure we're scaling correctly. A lot of things we do regard our ad business, but really the fundamental limiter is this an ultimate indicator that it's going to be a large market is what's happening here is what happened in mobile and in another words moved first three platforms and viewed to mobile a few years before the ad dollars caught up. I wish they eventually did and that's the same phenomena we're seeing on OTT where viewers are moving to stream like I said 10% of that key demographic 18 to 34-year-olds now only reach will not just on stream but only on Roku.
And the ad dollars will flung over and that's growing fast, but it's going to take a little bit of time for it completely move over. Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thanks. And I joined a bit late. So apologies if this is duplicative at all, but just wanted to ask about the Roku channel extending internationally, just wanted to understand at this point what that gating factors that are at all if any as you continue to expand it globally pass Canada?
And then on the content side, it seems like a lot of the incremental content that you're adding on the live side is around news. Just trying to understand if what with the gating factors similar are on the additions of content in terms of how you're partnering with the media companies as well, thank you. This is Anthony. So in terms of international we think there is a large international opportunity. We don't have anything new to announce there. I'm just repeating our strategy of the Roku channel is to continue to expand the amount of content that's available in the channel to expand the geography that's available and to continue to add different content category.
In terms of content categories, so we started with movies, entertainment movies and TV show. We continue to add a deeper depth of the TV show to the channel. We then added news. We continue to add more news partners. So for the midterms, we focus on beating up our news offering, which was a very successful strategy for us.
We're proud that we delivered broadcast quality live news services from a great set of partners for free to our customers. So that's been a good strategy for us and we'll keep adding more categories, so we don't have any to announce today. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott McConnell with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So a question on tariff. In the event the next round of tariffs is on everything out of China what could you do to mitigate the risk and maybe such as moving your manufacturing out of China or possibly negotiating manufacture thanks. This is Anthony. So far we haven't seen any with the tariffs that have been announced so far, we haven't seen any impact on our business there in applied, so televisions or streaming players. Our monitoring the situation carefully, but we don't have anything other than that to say. Okay. And if I can get one follow-up, so you shared your impressive market share gains with Roku TV in the US smart TV market any comments on how smart TV market shares gains are going to international markets thanks? Yeah, so, so far we've launched Roku TVs in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They're doing well in all those market. There's obviously a lot more countries in the world than those three and like as we said in the past our goal is to keep expanding internationally, but we don't have any plans.
I will say that I think the same strategy we use in the U.S. for TVs will also work internationally, which is the focus on a purpose built Roku operating system, sorry, a purpose billed operating system for TV specifically versus porting a mobile operating system that has some fundamental event is that will result in TVs that cost less to build, that have a more TV optimize user interface and they're just letter TVs.
And so we think that strategy will be effective internationally, but we don't have any plans yet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. First, can you maybe provide an update on the Samsung partnership, give us a sense of how it's progressing versus your expectation? And then a follow-up question, Steve I think in the remarks, you talk about managing the business at actually breakeven in 2019. As you look at '18 you'll do about $25 million in EBITDA.
So just trying to get some more color on the '19 comments and perhaps is it contemplative step up in spend? Thank you. Hey Ralph. This is Scott here. I don't have any specific updates on the Samsung partnership except the comment that it's early days. We do think there is value proposition of great free ad supported programming exports beyond our set of Roku devices and that's what drove us to write the Samsung partnership. So it also got an ad relationship to it as well, but it's still early days for us in that relationship. Hey Ralph. It's Steve. Just talking about some more color on '19, yeah correct so as we mentioned before, our plan is to continue to run the business at around just an EBITDA breakeven, that was our goal this year and again in '19. So we are -- our plan is that as we generate incremental gross profit, they were funneling that back into the business.
We're fortunate to have a great set of roadmap for the business. We're the leading streaming TV platform in the U.S. and we're in the early days of a massive shift over to OTT and so we feel great about the opportunities for high ROI investments to continue to grow the platform, improve engagement and drive up monetization over the long-term.
We'll have a lot more detail in the next call as we unveil more specific 2019 outlook but I'll point to you since you mentioned the expense side, if you think we mentioned today we're continuing to hire, grow and hire great talent, there is a trend based on our transition from private to public company of our stock-based comp is increasing rapidly and then as we mentioned in last call and that was in our Q is that we've also factored in our new headquarters building or set of buildings or leases on that, which will phase in over '19 and '20.
So those are some factors and we'll give you more detail on the next call. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is now open. Hi, it's Rich Greenfield. Just real quick on when I think about the cable operators Anthony, you talked about how cord cutting obviously is accelerating or losing a lot of subs, There's been a lot of increased discussion Charter is leading the way that they're looking, I think they signed a deal with Apple where they're looking at basically shipping or leasing out Apple boxes versus their own boxes.
On the LT's call I asked them about it and they said they're open to working with third parties instead of their own LT’s one box. If I go back in time you were actually the first company to ever do that when you signed a deal with Time Warner Cable for one of their IP-based platforms. Just wondering as you think about kind of becoming the box that actually cable operators roll out, where are you -- is that a significant opportunity as we move into '19 for Roku?
You've got bigger market share than Apple and I was just curious like how people or how the cable companies are thinking about working with you versus Comcast has sound like it's building their own version of a box. Where do you fit in all of that and how big of an opportunity could that be as they get rid of their antiquated hardware? Hey Rich, thanks. So operators are an important channel for us. We distribute our players through operator channel today. If you're an operator and you're launching a streaming service, one of the things you quickly figure out or even not just operators, but virtual MVPD's other services, one of the things, one of the first thing they figure out is consumers who use that service and watch it on TV through our streaming box versus just our streaming TV versus they just using a mobile device to access it or laptop have much higher engagement and higher retention.
So it's a common promotion for a service or an operator to offer discounted or free Roku player or other streaming device when a customer signs up for our cable operator as when the end customers signs up for their service. And we win those deals and those deals are usually competitive. The reason we often lend the usual reasons we have, we have a very low cost structure. So we often have an attractive price they can purchase the boxes for.
Also our products are incredibly simple to use, our customers love them, they get great reviews and in the streaming world even from operators it's much more competitive situation for having a great streaming player as part of the offer is important and for us this is the fundamental that we focus on; value, ease-of-use, content, just a great experience winning the reviews, help us win those deals as well. Thanks very much. Thank you. And with that, I show no further questions. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wood for some closing remarks. Thanks. So I'd just like to close by reiterating how pleased we are with the quarter's results. We're making great strides in growing active accounts, engaging added TV viewers and helping content publishers and brands reach there in efficient ways.
I'm particularly excited about how quickly we are bringing innovations to market from the new Roku TV and player models for the holidays to Roku TV wireless speakers ad measurement tools, enhancements to Roku channel and more. So thank you for your support and joining today's call and I look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded for replay purposes.
It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. I am pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, the GM of our Platform business, who will be available for Q&A.
Please be sure to review our shareholder letter, which contains much more details then we will cover in the introductory remarks. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflect management's view as of today, February 21, 2019 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. Some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the first quarter and full year of 2019 and the future growth of our business.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today's shareholder letter and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.roku.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for important content. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Anthony. Thank you, James, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. I'll take a moment to highlight a few points from our shareholder letter. First, we had a great 2018 wrapped up by a strong Q4. 2018 revenue was up 45% from 2017 and our U.S. market share lead grew. I credit our success to a combination of the incredible talent of the Roku team having the only purpose-built OS for TV, the unstoppable shift to streaming and consistent excellent execution.
Second, I am excited about our plan for 2019. We expect to pass $1 billion in revenue, two-thirds coming from our Platform business. I'll conclude by putting out three trends that cause me to believe we're still in the early days of our growth and why I expect our leadership position in streaming to continue.
First, smart TVs are adopting a licensed OS, just like phones did. Our OS, which we have been developing for the last 10 years, is the leader in this shift because it is incredibly user-friendly yet powerful and built solely for the TV ecosystem. Second, TV advertising is a $70 billion market. And it is in the very early stages of transitioning to streaming. We had built advanced features for advertisers into our OS and independent studies show that Roku TV advertisements are more effective than traditional linear ads.
Our leading TV streaming OS market share will allow us to capture a large part of the advertising market as a shift to streaming from linear TV. And third The Roku Channel become a larger aggregator of content on our Platform. A change that benefits our users, content publishers and advertisers. I expect The Roku Channel to grow from a relatively small share of viewing hours to a larger percentage, owning and operating The Roku Channel allows us to control the promotion and presentation of content and to monetize an increasingly large supply of video advertising inventory.
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Louden, Roku's CFO. Thanks Anthony. Our strong fourth quarter results capped off another great year. We executed well and delivered record results. Before taking your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and address the outlook.
We saw a continued strong demand for players and TVs in the fourth quarter which resulted in an incremental $7.8 million active accounts for the year and ending 2018 with 27.1 million active accounts.
Our scale has expanded rapidly over the last several years. We added just under six million active accounts in 2017 and nearly eight million more in 2018. In addition to increasing our scale, we continued to see growing engagement on the platform with 2018 streaming hours, up 9.2 billion year-over-year to 24 billion.
As we mentioned in our shareholder letter, Roku users streamed more in the last year and a half than in the entire prior nine years combined. Not only are more people choosing Roku as their streaming platform, but they are also streaming more than ever. Please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter. But I'll highlight a few items and provide our Q1 and full year 2019 outlook.
Total Q4 revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $275.7 million with platform revenue up 77% to a record $151.4 million, representing 55% of total revenue. Player revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, again, came in ahead of our expectations with another strong quarter from retail channels and a well-executed holiday season. Player units were up 30% year-over-year and ASPs were down 8% as we continue to see strong demand for sub-$50 players.
Our key financial performance metric is gross profit which was up 53% year-over-year this quarter to a record $112 million marking our first quarter above $100 million.
Gross margin was 40.7%, up a 170 basis points year-over-year driven by solid platform margins, partially offset by the impact of player promotional activity during the holiday season that drove high unit growth in active accounts.
We had a record number of net new hires in the fourth quarter and ended the year with over 1,100 employees up 36% year-over-year. We are attracting outstanding talent and believe the investments we are making in R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A are bolstering our market position now and strengthening our future growth opportunities.
One of the key ways we attract talent is through competitive salaries and equity compensation. In 2018, we transitioned to an RSU-based comp structure and provided existing employees with their first post-IPO equity refresh brands. This created a step function increase in our stock-based comp which increased from a $11 million in 2017 to $38 million in 2018.
We expect stock-based comp to increase to roughly $73 million in 2019. When compared with benchmarking data, we believe our stock-based comp is in line with our peers.
OpEx in the quarter grew 67% to $106.8 million. Excluding stock-based comp, OpEx was up 49% year-over-year which is more in line with revenue and gross profit growth.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 70% year-over-year to a record $24.5 million in Q4 and well ahead of our outlook as a result of higher revenue in gross profit. With that, let's turn to our outlook for the full year.
As you saw in our letter, the midpoints of our 2019 outlook call for just over $1 billion in revenues and $450 million in gross profit. Each of roughly 36% year-on-year. Included in our outlook is platform revenue growth to roughly two-thirds of total revenue and roughly flat player revenue growth. For modeling purposes, you should plan for full year platform gross margins in the low 60s as a percent of revenue driven by continued mix shift to video advertising and introduction of premium subscriptions.
For players, for modeling purposes, you should expect us to manage the player gross margin to low single-digit margins in 2019. We remind you that we are not optimizing for player gross profit given our focus on account growth and our strategy of trading player margin for account growth and platform revenue growth is working well.
In prior forward-looking statements, we have consistently discussed managing the business to adjusted EBITDA breakeven, and our 2019 outlook reflects that continued approach. We are more confident than ever about Roku's fundamental competitive advantages and the huge opportunities that lie ahead and we have carefully prioritized a robust list of opportunities to pursue. While a meaningful portion of our OpEx is discretionary, we believe reinvesting gross profit back into the business is the right thing to do to drive long-term shareholder value.
Our outlook calls for an $85 million net income loss in 2019 at the midpoint. But as a reminder, this includes expensing $73 million of non-cash stock-based comp and $12 million of depreciation and amortization.
Q1 is seasonally the lowest revenue quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect player revenue to drop nearly 50% sequentially and platform revenue to fall nearly 20% sequentially.
For Q1, our outlook is for year-over-year revenue growth of 37% at the midpoint. Platform revenue growth of roughly 60% year-over-year includes a tough comparison with Q1 2018 from the delivery of a new product to one of our Roku Powered partners. Excluding the impact of this item in the prior year, platform revenue growth would be more closely in line with Q4 growth rates. On the player side, our Q1 outlook factors in roughly high single-digit player revenue growth.
Continued mix shift to video advertising is expected to be a drag on platform gross margin and when combined with a single-digit player gross margins, our gross profit growth outlook for Q1 is roughly 39% growth at the midpoint.
One of the challenges that the Street seems to be struggling with in modeling Roku is that our OpEx is not seasonal. Headcount related expenses account for roughly three quarters of total OpEx and we have been and we'll continue to grow headcount throughout the year. As a result, Q1 OpEx is expected to be roughly $10 million higher in Q1 than in Q4 as we recognized the full quarter impact of the hiring that took place in Q4 as well as new hires in Q1.
As a result, we expect to report an adjusted EBITDA loss of roughly $10 million at the midpoint and net income loss of roughly $30 million, which includes stock-based comp of $17 million and $3 million in depreciation and amortization in the quarter. We encourage you to factor in the seasonal revenue dynamics we have discussed and the sequential growth trends for OpEx going forward as well.
I'll summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business by sharing a little perspective on where we have come from and where we are going.
In 2015, Roku had nine million active accounts and a $50 million platform business and a $6 ARPU. In 2018, Roku had $27 million active accounts with a $417 million platform business and an $18 ARPU.
As we look to 2019, we expect to achieve $1 billion in revenue with roughly two-thirds of that coming from platform monetization. The fundamentals of our business, the difficulty in replicating our strength and our laser focus on streaming, all give us confidence in our ability to deliver significant long-term shareholder value.
With that let's turn the call over to for questions. Operator? Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. This is Shweta for Mark. Two questions please. One, could you please talk a little bit about the platform revenue and potentially providing any visibility within the platform revenue as it relates to content distribution and licensing?
And then two, on International strategy, it’d be great to hear a little bit more about progress that you made so far, understood that a contribution will come next year. But what -- where are you right now? And what do you expect to do this year? Thank you. Hi, this is Anthony. I'll take the international question first, and then Steve can talk a little bit about the platform revenue. So international, so just in summary Roku has more than 27 million active accounts globally today. Most of those are in the United States. But we believe many of the assets we built for the U.S. market will help us expand into other markets. And clearly streaming is a global opportunity with one billion households worldwide. And that put us more International than domestic subs.
So in 2018 we started to invest more substantially into our international business. We created the International CU. We're in 20 countries today. But there’s a lot more we can do. We're adding more local content, expanding our relationships with international retailers. And we think that you'll start to see -- we'll start to see the results of this increased investment bearing fruit in 2020.
And then Steve, do you want to talk about? Yeah, sure. Hi, this is Steve. Yeah, in terms of the question on the platform revenue. We think of the platform segment as the segment that really speaks to our monetization strategy. And in terms of the big drivers, one of the things we pointed out was that our Roku monetized video ad impressions more than doubled in 2018. And that's one of the key drivers along with other parts of advertising and then the content distribution.
In terms of the segment, there are a lot of those pieces of business are interrelated in agreements and relationships regarding our content publisher relationships. And so we look at that more on the ARPU basis overall and then we -- like said the driver we've disclosed where we think is a key part of that is the video ad impressions that Roku monetizes. Okay. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Is there any way that you can help quantify the amount just looking for more details around the international expansion efforts? Maybe two parts, can you talk a little bit about what countries and kind of the go-to-market strategy there? And is it possible to help quantify the amount that you're investing this year? How much is that effort dragging on EBITDA? Thank you. Hi Mark, this is Anthony. We haven't announced -- we haven't really outlined our International strategy at this point. We're not ready to do that. We also haven't broken out the numbers. I mean I would just reiterate, we think it's a big opportunity. We are starting to invest in the team and projects. And again, we haven't broken out the amount, but it's one of the -- International is probably one of the top four areas we're investing in along with Roku TV, The Roku Channel in International. So we'll have more information as the year plays out. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Thanks. I was just wondering on the Platform business. Can you give us a bit more insight into the components of the guidance for the year in terms of accounts versus ARPU? And sort of how you expect the seasonality to shakeout of those mechanics based on what you know today? And then the follow-up question would be on The Roku Channel, you referenced adding features and content in the letter. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on kind of what you're expecting there? And Anthony, I think your comment was that's a relatively small percentage today going to a larger percentage. Wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit further for us? Thank you. So this is Anthony. So yes I'm super excited about The Roku Channel. It's a big opportunity. And why don't you start with that. And Scott can take that. And then maybe Steve can talk a little bit more about your Platform question. Hey Evan Scott here. Roku Channel is off to a great start and has exceeded our expectations in many ways. It's already a top five channel on the Platform in terms of the number of accounts it reaches each month. We started in late 2017 with about 1000 free movies and TV episodes. And have expanded that now to around 10000.
In September of last year, we added live new services with partners like ABC, Cheddar, People TV. And we just launched and are still rolling out premium subscriptions with partners like Showtime, Starz, Epix and others. So it's been a pretty dramatic expansion not just as the consumers consuming inside The Roku Channel, but the content that's available.
The Roku Channel is an essential part of our overall Platform's strategy. It's not just a major source of ad inventory for us but it's a highly strategic one. The power of O&O ad inventory as opposed to ads that we access within third-party channels are that we own that inventory outright. We think it's a best-in-class consumer ad experience in terms of ad loads frequency new ad formats. If we're just better targeting than is available to us in third-party channels.
And it allows us because we're licensing the content and have the opportunity to promote it to really fan the audiences that we know are in demand by advertisers. And finally, it affords us the opportunity to create new ad products whether that's sponsorships or trinity commercial interruption movies. So overall, we are very excited about the progress that we've made on The Roku Channel and we expect to continue to fan those points. Hey Evan, this is Steve. Just on your Platform question. So I've mentioned before the overall guidance for revenue for 2019 includes $1 billion of total revenue, two-thirds of that been in Platform. In terms of some of the other components around ARPU and account, what I would say in there right is, we've seen great growth in the active accounts adding almost 8 million accounts to 27 million right now. The streaming hour growth has been strong. We don't traditionally provide guidance on the key operating metrics and aren't doing that this time. But in general, we're very happy with the growth path of the business.
On thing I'll remind folks is just, the monetization continues to grow faster than the streaming hours and the active accounts, although there is not a direct correlation between those things. In terms of seasonality throughout the year, we did mention in the comments that a reminder that there's quite a bit of seasonality on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
We mentioned that Platform, we expected to decline about 20% quarter-over-quarter. Seasonally Q4 is the heaviest quarter both from Player and Platform. So just a reminder to everyone not just when you're looking at Q1 but throughout the year to study that quarterly seasonality because I think Q4 has been the strongest quarter and sometimes the seasonality can be a bit disconnected there. This is Anthony again. Let me just add a couple of comments about streaming hours and monetization. Streaming hours the way, I think about streaming hours is they're loosely coupled for monetization. And overtime they're probably more tightly coupled. But monetization tends to lag streaming hours.
The streaming hours have been -- streaming hours are I think an important indicator of how important Roku is to our customers and to their lives. And that's how I kind of think about it. And just one step there that I like is the Roku users stream more hours in the last 18 months than in the previous nine years combined. So customers are streaming.
That we said about -- the drive -- one of the drivers of the ad business is there -- I would say there's two drivers. The one important one is that, viewers are moving to streaming and advertisers are following, but they haven't caught up yet, right. I think we said this consistently and it's still true.
A lot of viewers are shifting to streaming. But advertising dollars are still relatively small compared to the number of viewers that shift. So we are starting to see that change, I think as for example, our monetized ad inventory last year more than doubled. And we expect that to happen again this year. Thanks guys. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. I have a two point -- two part question with an add-on. So when we talk to the senior people and some of the bigger agencies both on kind of the TV buying side and on the digital, and we ask kind of how is OTT doing how is Roku doing? They still universally say how difficult is to buy OTT and not preferring to use specifically, but broadly. So what are you trying to do to simplify the buying process on your own and kind of potentially with other industry initiatives?
The second question and I think this keeps coming up is, the sustainability of that $30 CPM particularly since there is inventory that can be bought around you at price is lower than $30 kind of how you're addressing that? And I know you made some moves toward the end of last year around beta. So maybe elaborate about that about kind of what you're doing with data exclusivity?
And then lastly, now a question we continue to get and I think you get is about increasing transparency around video advertising specifically. And I think the commentary in this shareholder letter was pretty consistent with last shareholder letter as far as that doubling year-over-year. But if there's any plans to expand further transparency around that? Thank you very much. Hey, Jason, it's Scott Rosenberg here. I'll take the first two of your seven-part question here. Great question though. We're making great progress on the street with the ad community. We're in the early stages of a secular shift at a TV linear ad spending into OTT. I think Roku is driving this transition better and more smartly than anybody in the market.
One of the most essential ways that we do that is by showing advertisers the reach arithmetic, the number of users who left linear who are now in OTT and only reachable on the Roku Platform.
Multiple third-parties will tell you that well more than 10% of TV viewing is happening in OTT. And yet nowhere near 10% of TV ad budgets are yet spent in OTT. Said that another way if your brand that is still spending a 100% of your budget in linear, you're wasting more than 10% of your budget.
So, we are regularly in market, helping advertisers understand that reach arithmetic and plan around it. Just two quick examples, I'll offer, by a way of example of both Baskin-Robbins and RE/MAX in the latter parts of last year bought with us. We showed them that respectively 86% in the case of Baskin-Robbins and 81% in the case of RE/MAX of Roku users never saw their linear TV ad. And that when they invested with us, they delivered again respectively 10.6% incremental reach and 9.2% incremental reach over their linear ad buy. That kind of planning tool that kind of research is the elixir the kind of data that the buy side is looking for in order to get through this transition that you're referencing. And I think Roku is unique in showing them that math.
With regards to your question about the sustainability of rates, we continue to command premium rates. That is at the end of the day a testament to the significant increases in demand for OTT. And ultimately the -- a proof point of how powerful and how much better Roku Media performs relative to linear TV.
Do you want -- Steve, do you want to take the question around? Yeah, sure. Yeah, just in terms -- Jason, in terms of video advertising and transparency. One thing I'll note is as part of our monetization strategy, and as I mentioned earlier to the Q&A the Platform segment is the segment that connects to the monetization strategy. One of the things that is the key driver of that is this Roku monetized video ad impression. So that's something that we haven't specifically talked about trending on that. And that is the key driver. So certainly understand that there is a thirst out there, but one of the things for us is that there are a lot of components within Platform those are all very interconnected with these relationships we have within the ecosystem. And so we wanted to highlight that Roku monetized ad -- video ad impression because that is the critical driver. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. In the shareholder letter you laid out sort of four areas of reinvestment in 2019 between advertising Roku Channel Roku TV and International. Just curious, if there's one area in particular that you might have some outsize reinvestment in 2019? Or is it going to be evenly spread?
And then just a follow-up to that question would be occasionally you provide an update in terms of what percent of your hours are ad supported? And just seeing if you could perhaps provide an update to that step? Thank you. Hey, this is, Anthony. Let me -- I'll talk about the investment areas. So the four that we outlined in the letter are our top four. There's other areas that are -- we're also working on that are also, we think, high ROI. I mean, we haven't broken out how much we're spending on each area. But they're listed in order of how much we invest. And they're not that too far apart. And then, sorry, what was the second question? Yeah. Hey, Ralph. This is Steve. I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, we don't have a specific update to the ad supported hours. But obviously there continues to be strong interest in that. And certainly with the growth of The Roku Channel continues to speak that free-ad supported content is a strong interest for consumers. And certainly, I think, a lot of the industry is catching up to us in terms of understanding that that's a key component of the OTT offering. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is now open. Hi. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hi Laura. A couple of things. I think the first one, Anthony, if I add your operating expenses in 2018 it gets to that $340 million. You're projecting $1 billion of revenue and the zero EBITDA, which means you're going to add $250 million, I think, to that cost structure, which round numbers is nearly a double. Okay, not quite steep but more. But can you add -- can you double your cost structure practically in a year, looking at these investment categories that you're making? Yeah. Hey, Laura, it's Steve. I'm going to take a crack at that and Anthony can add some color on the top. Just in terms of the guidance, we're excited about the top line guidance of a $1 billion as you mentioned, that's a huge milestone for us. Our total gross profit guidance for the full year 2019 is around $450 million-ish at the midpoint. And then we are -- our outlook does anticipate running around adjusted EBITDA.
One thing to note on that -- and so it's -- I think your math is a bit off when you look at the 2018 OpEx number versus what the implied OpEx is for a gross profit guidance of around $450 million. But it is a increase certainly.
One of the things I'll just note on that is that OpEx increase includes significant year-over-year uptick in a stock-based comp, which is non-cash. So that's going from $38 million in 2018 up to $72 million, as well as there's another $12 million of depreciation and amortization on that. So that's about $85 million of non-cash in that number.
But we certainly continue, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, we certainly do continue to grow headcounts. We grew our account in 2018 and specifically in Q4, we had a record hiring as well, that headcount grew 36% year-over-year. We'll continue to hire around that same pace in 2019.
So between the full year impact and in some of the investments areas that will be an increase. But we think there's a great opportunity out there. We're the leading TV platform -- streaming TV platform in the U.S. and Anthony talked a few different ways about some of our key investment areas around ad The Roku Channel, Roku TV and International. So we think it's the right time to continue invest into the opportunity and to strengthen our advantages. Yeah, this is Anthony... Anthony, yeah. I'm just going to add that we have created some fundamental strategic advantages for us. The reasons that we win in the market things like our purpose-built OS, our large engaged user base, The Roku Channel, our ad platform, and low bundle cost et cetera. And we'll just leave it the right call at this point. So you keep investing both to grow those advantages that we've already built, increase our lead but also create new opportunities. And there's a lot of opportunity in streaming right now. Okay. All right. So my next question is you said in the press release here that you had 3 million U.S. households cut the cord and you added 8 million. So by implication that implies the other 5 million in your mind are being added to the big bundle? That's the first A. And then B, do you still think you have the 10 million cord cutters that can't be reached on linear TV they're just on Roku/OTT? Yeah, I think what we said in the letter is that we the industry had 3 million cord cutters in the U.S. Yes. And that we added 3 million -- 8 million active accounts. I mean some of those they're not obviously we didn't add 8 million cord cutters. I mean we said historically roughly half of our subscribers are cord cutters and the rest are -- I would characterize them as cord shavers. So it's a mix of that. And then your second question I think it was one for Scott... There's 10 million. You still have 10 million cord cutters? Cord cutters remains a key targeting segment for us as we're working with advertisers. As I mentioned earlier the opportunity to reach consumers who cut or shave the cord are more basically who simply no longer reachable through a linear ad campaign is why advertisers invest with us. And are you using 10 million, Scott? Yeah, we never broken out that exact numbers. But we have said roughly half of our viewers I believe we said roughly half of our viewers plus or minus are cord cutters or... Do not have a traditional pay-TV subscription. Yeah. More actively they don't have a traditional pay-TV subscription. Okay. So that's half of that 27 million. So my 10 million is way too low right now. Because I guess that -- so that will imply right? Yes. Okay cool. Best Buy and Amazon there was a lot of headwinds earlier in the year that because Amazon was doing an exclusive with Best Buy and they're introducing a new 4K TV. But that might hurt you. Did you any impact on that in the fourth quarter? Or is your -- did your Best Buy performed just as well for Roku that has in prior years? We don't break out by reseller. But we are very happy with both our Player sales and retail in general across the Board. And also our OEM partners sold a lot of Roku TVs we're also very happy with that. Over one in four smart TV sold in all of 2018 were Roku TV. I mean at Best Buy specifically you can get a TCL 6-series right now which you've seen as Editor's Choice for $550 for 55-inch TV it's a great -- its an awesome TV. We do sell a lot of TVs at Best Buy. Okay. And finally TCL reorg there were a lot of headlines earlier in the year that the TCL reorg might negatively affect you. Have you seen any negative impact from TCL? It sounds like not from your prior answer? No, there is no impact. I mean there was a lot of confusion around that. And but it had no impact on us or their dedication to the TV business. Perfect. That's what just I needed. Thanks so much guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon. Anthony just picking up the tvOS part of the business, you talked about the house brands being increasingly uncompetitive in the market. Are you expecting or should we expect some significant ramp in your share of smart TV sales in 2019? Is that sort of underpinning part of the guidance? Or is this sort of assuming kind of status quo with the partners that you have? Any color you can give us on the outlook for a new partnerships on the OEMs front would be helpful. And then just as a follow-up for a different topics for Steve, can you help us at all on the OpEx in 2019? How much is tied to International plans where we're really not seeing any revenue yet. Just might be helpful sort of understand kind of be underlying non-International OpEx trends even if it's qualitative, but I'd just be interested in how substantial that is this year? So, I'll go first. This is Anthony. So regarding our tvOS. Well first I would just say that and you asked about our outlook I would say that our outlook obviously incorporates kind of all aspects of our what we expect to happen to our business over the year including growing monetization and including growing active accounts. And I would say another -- in terms of active accounts, one of the best things to happen to us in 2018 was our market share in Player. We're number one -- we believe we're number one in market share Players in the U.S. and we believe that market share actually grew in 2018. We believe same is the case for TVs that we believe that we're number one in market share for tvOS. And we believe our market share grew. Now most of that growth -- the biggest untapped segment of TVs for which the license -- which might end up licensing our OS are TVs that are used -- you called it -- I'm not sure you called it but those TVs are using what we call homegrown operating systems. So yes, I said house brands homegrown house brands. Yes, right. So house brands -- homegrown meaning the offer stack that the TV company made for their TV. And that's still the majority of TVs out there. And we still -- and I still believe that those TVs overtime will end up moving to a licensed OS. And in the license OS we are the number one license OS and we have a large lead there. So I think again our growth in active accounts will come from Players. It will also come from TVs. And it begins to the TVs a little bit -- it will come from TV companies getting more shelf space for their Roku TVs for their Roku OS-based TVs. As one of the factors that drives our business is that our partners all tend to be partners that the growing market share in the TV space. And so as they grow market share and they get more retail that grows our number of TVs out there. So that's one factor. Another factor is we do regularly add more OEMs. So we're not ready to talk about any new OEM at this point. Thank you. Go ahead, Ben. Just to the operator moving on to the next question. Our next question will come the line of Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Great I want to talk a little bit about your long-term investment spending beyond 2019. So I was wondering when you think about your investment spending, how much of an advantage do you concern are going to be short-term and strategic versus call it long-term in nature like your International investment spending? Thank you. Yes, hey, Tom, it's Steve. I'll start. I think we on the road maps, we have a mix of short-term feature or capability ads and the longer-term capabilities or new product categories that we're working on. So it's always a mix. I think there is a material amount of OpEx that goes to stuff that will not pay off in this year and it is a mix of stuff that traditionally or generally will hit in the next year or two. So I don't have a specific break out but we are managing the business in the long-term. And we do have a vision where we think we're going. And we're putting resources against that.
And one thing just to clarify based on an earlier question is sort of this longer-term investment is not just happening in brand new categories like or newish categories like International, even on an existing businesses, be it on the Player side or TVs or advertising, there is long-term investments that are happening on capabilities that won't pay off in this year certainly much less maybe a year or two. Yes, this is Anthony. I’ll just add. In the letter, we called out four specific areas. I mean there are other areas that we're investing in. But Roku advertising, The Roku Channel and Roku TV were three that we called out. And those are the examples of areas that are already very important to our business. But there's still a tremendous amount of room for innovation and we're still in early days in what's possible in those categories. So those are examples, which are actually our top three reasons, they're following both categories, they're both important today. And they're both important in the future as well. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of quick ones, if I could. And I apologize if I missed these. But did you talk at all about -- you're active accounts, the percentage that came from smart TV versus Players. If you could give us any update on how that trended this quarter? I know it's usually kind of above or below 50% roughly?
Secondly, similarly on the Platform business in the past you quantified, advertising as a percent of Platform, roughly 70% give or take. And within advertising bigger versus audience developments and sponsorships? Again any quantification there. And then just on housekeeping. On the Players, the 4Q number was very strong, the outlook for 2019 is very strong. So I'm just curious as if you're seeing any of that strength driven by whether it's speakers or the Roku Powered White-label program or that is to pure just retail Player driving that strength? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks guys. This is Anthony. I'll take the player question and then Steve can take the first two questions. Just in terms of Players, I would say that the drivers there are that people are streaming more than they used to. And they're buying streaming player. So that's the big driver. And then our market share is growing as well. So that's helping as well. Yes, Matt, just on the first two. In terms of the mix of active accounts similar to before kind of 50% plus of the new accounts are coming from licensed sources. So which is predominantly TVs, so since TVs that are contributed to the new accounts continues to be very strong, but as you mentioned, the Player Business especially, I mean the holiday season on Players was great. 30% year-over-year unit increases. So very -- the Player business is doing very well as Anthony mentioned.
Turning to the Platform business, the disclosure we mentioned this time, we're focused on talking about the Roku monetized video ad impressions that more than doubled in 2018. And we think that will more than double again in 2019. And so kind of where we're focused on that driver and just talking about the Platform overall in our monetization strategy. So no updates on those other things. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon guys. A couple of questions. First, how does Viacom's acquisition of Pluto TV impact your business if at all? So, if Viacom were to sell Pluto inventory directly, for example, would that have any impact on your revenue and profitability?
And then maybe more broadly on that just what's your view of competition in that AVOD space right now? It seems like anytime we get a headline that says that Amazon might want to participate and that people seem to worry a bit about The Roku Channel. And I'd be curious your take on competition there? And then I do have one on the MVPDs If I could. Hey this is Anthony. So, in terms of the Viacom-Pluto merger, I mean, we don't comment on third-party acquisition. But I guess just in general there's a lot of M&A activity in this space. Because I think streaming is obviously becoming even more important to both new streaming companies like Roku as well as the incumbent. But I'll let Scott talk about your AVOD question. Yes, we are excited to see all the activity in the space. We are the original, original in terms of bullishness on AVOD both in terms of its value to consumers and its importance in the OTT business model. We see AVOD growing pretty nicely on our Platform and clearly a growing recognition in the industry as the importance of AVOD.
Just a quick reminder on how we monetize in AVOD. As a content owner, there are really two ways onto our platform. You can publish an app and then work with us to promote that app through ads, through featured free. And Roku participates in that process typically by selling a portion of the inventory.
Or you can syndicate that content directly into The Roku Channel in which case we drive the promotion and awareness of that content in the monetization and share back with the content owners.
Ultimately, we win in both models and view ourselves as a key partner for any entity in the space is going over the top with an ad supported business model. The winning factors here in our view in the end ultimately are having a relationship with the consumer and the rich data that flows from that in order to power targeted advertising and power the marketing of that content. Roku has these fundamental advantages as a platform and we think it makes us an essential partner to anybody in the AVOD business. Thank you for that. Maybe if I could follow-on that a little bit but on virtual MVPDs can you help us understand how they benefit you? So, if a consumer signs up for a service away from The Roku Platform but uses Roku as a primary interface. Do you have a relationship that allows you to monetize that? Like are you able to monetize any portion of their live advertising inventory? And is that material for you if so? This is Anthony. So, I would just say, in general, virtual MVPDs are great for Roku and I'll give you some specific examples of how. One is they convince some people -- people moved to streaming for a variety of reasons. For many people a virtual MVPD is sort of the thing they need to move to streaming. So, it drives more streaming usage on our platform which makes which means that Roku is more relevant to consumers our consumer's life.
If they sign up for the subscription service through Roku then we generally get a rev share that's our general subscription business model. If they sign-off off of Roku, then we don't generally get a rev share, but there are ways we monetize. For example, virtual MVPDs are customers of ours for our audience development business. So they are often buying promotion placement in Roku's user interface or other audience development products that we sell. So they're a big customers of audience development even if they -- the customer comes off of Roku.
And then we have a variety of ways we participate on the advertising front with our partners including virtual MVPDs and those don't always have a direct relationship to where the customers signs up for the service. So in general, they're great customers and partners for us. Great. Thanks for the answers. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got a couple. One, just quick follow-up. Just to be clear Anthony in that the vMVPD answer, there is no ad revenue share that you get. So out of the time that our YouTube TV or Google Live, you're not sharing any portion of that ad revenue stream. Even if you can help them sell ad that isn't currently happening. Do you think there is an opportunity overtime to help them? Hey, Rich. It's Scott here. I'll comment on that. Without getting into the details of any specific virtual MVPD partnership, I will say that we do have partnerships where we are helping with monetization of their ad inventory. And have you ever qualified how much you -- Anthony just mentioned on the platform side that you're getting some form of a benefit when somebody signs up for a YouTube TV or a Slinger or whatever it may be through the Roku platform. Have you ever qualified how much of platform revenue is advertising versus non-advertising? Yes. Hey, Rich. It's Steve. We don't have an update on that. Okay. And then just final question. There's obviously this massive wave of shifting to streaming. And it seems like every single media company or even tech and media company is now talking about streaming. Apple is coming in, Warner, NBC, Disney everyone doing it. Some like NBC are obviously moving in the ad direction although a lot seemingly are not moving in the ad direction. How do you think about the mix between advertising and non-advertising? Obviously, Viacom is making a big bet on the ad side. But like where do you see that shaking out? Or do you think just the overall trend toward streaming works in your favor even if there are a lot of non-ad supported apps coming? Yes. So I mean, we found -- I founded this company on the belief that all television was going to be streamed. And it wasn't that many years ago when there was no streaming and then the only streaming was Netflix. And it was -- it took a long time for the incumbents to embrace streaming. But they have. And that's very gratifying to see every major media company in the world developing streaming strategies, which is great -- it’s great for us, because we're the leading streaming platform. And so that helps our consumers that helps our business.
We said before that we think advertising is -- that on Roku advertising is not that we think -- on Roku advertising is the fastest growing content category and we believe that just like in the sort of legacy world of linear TV viewing, the business model, the mix of subscription in advertising we think that same business model applied for streaming as well. Yes. I'll just add on to… Very helpful. …that Rich that our view as we win in either case. But certainly over the last year, there's been a growing awareness of the opportunity around ad supported OTT and that's what causing all the activity we see in the space. And we're particularly bullish on our ability to add value as AVOD grows as a category both as a seller and an enabler of the kind of advanced ad capabilities that these parties are going to need to succeed in this next-generation of TV advertising. Thanks very much guys. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thanks for putting us back on the queue. A quick question, Steve can you please clarify may be we didn't hear it right. The Q1 revenue guide for Platform revenue, you mentioned down 20% sequentially and for Player down almost 50%. But if we do that based on Q4 numbers, it's still coming below your lower end of Q1 guide. So can you please clarify that? Thank you. Yeah, well that again those are directional sequential guidance to give you a little bit of sense of the mix. I would focus on the actual revenue outlook range in terms of where we think we are going to end up. Okay. Thank a lot. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Anthony Wood CEO for any closing comments and remarks. Thanks. So around the world the business of TV distribution and advertising is changing more rapidly than ever and at Roku we're laser-focused on this opportunity and the fundamentals of our business are strong. I'm super excited about our market position and plans for 2019. So thanks for your support and joining in our call today. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Thank you and good afternoon and welcome to Roku’s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31 2019. I am pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku’s Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, GM of our Platform business who will be available for Q&A. Please be sure to review our shareholder letter, which contains much more detail than we will cover in the introductory remarks. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management’s views as of today, May 8, 2019 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.

And I encourage you to visit our IR website periodically for important content. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons of this call will be against results of the comparable period of 2018.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Anthony. Thank you, James and thanks everyone for joining today’s call. Roku is off to a great start to the year. Q1 results beat our outlook across the board and we are raising our outlook for the full year. Our growth continues to be driven by our singular focus as consumers, content publishers and advertisers embrace streaming, Roku is winning. We have an exceptional platform, an unmatched team and we deliver compelling value for viewers and partners alike. In recent weeks, some of the world’s largest media publishers have announced massive new investments in streaming, new services and customer acquisition campaigns from Disney, Apple and others will help fuel Roku’s growth for years to come. One of the themes at this quarter’s shareholder letter is the scope and scale of our Platform business, which connects the entire streaming ecosystem. Our large and growing Platform business supports content distribution, audience development and advertising. The Roku OS is uniquely purpose-built for TV screaming and is a key enabler of our Platform business.
Before handing the call over to Steve Louden, I would like to highlight a milestone that I am particularly proud of. In less than 5 years, the Roku TV has gone from a disruptive idea to the market leader. We estimate that more than one in three smart TVs sold in the U.S. in the first quarter, were Roku TVs. We have taken the leads from Samsung and are now the number one smart TV OS in the country.
I will now turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. We executed well in the first quarter and delivered particularly strong results. Before taking your questions, I will walk through operational and financial highlights and address our outlook. Strong Roku TV demand and continued strength in player sales delivered an incremental 2 million active accounts in the first quarter to 29.1 million active accounts. Our scale and per user engagement drove 1.6 billion incremental streaming hours sequentially to 8.9 billion hours in the quarter. Roku users streamed more content on our platform in the last 6 months than they did in all of 2017. ARPU increased another $1.11 sequentially to $19.06 driven by broad-based growth in content distribution, monetized video ad impressions and audience development spend by our content partners.
Total Q1 revenue increased 51% year-over-year to $206.7 million with Platform revenue up 79% to $134.2 million to a record 65% of total revenue. Player revenue growth of 18% year-over-year again came in ahead of expectations driven by strong core retail channel sales growth. Player units were up 21% year-over-year and ASPs were down 4% as we continue to see strong demand for sub $50 players. Our key financial performance metric is gross profit, which was up 60% year-over-year this quarter to $100.9 million marking our second consecutive quarter above $100 million despite this being our seasonally lowest quarter.
Gross margin was 48.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year with continued mix shift to the higher margin Platform business partially offset by declining player margins that helped drive rapid unit and active account growth. OpEx in the quarter grew 59% to $111.6 million driven by 33% growth in headcount and higher stock-based compensation. Excluding stock-based comp, OpEx was up 43% year-over-year, which was below our revenue and gross profit growth. OpEx came in below expectations primarily due to the timing of new hires coming in later than planned, which when combined with gross profit upside delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $10 million in Q1.
With that, let’s turn over to our outlook for the full year. Based on strong Q1 results and momentum into Q2, we are raising our 2019 outlook to $1.04 billion in revenue and $470 million in gross profit at the midpoint up 40% and 41% year-over-year respectively compared to roughly 36% year-over-year in our prior outlook. Included in our outlook Platform revenue mix is expected to be roughly two-thirds of total revenue, up from 56% in 2018. For modeling purposes, you should continue to model full year Platform gross margin in the low 60s as a percent of revenue driven by continued mix shift to video advertising and the introduction of premium subscriptions.
For players, we expect player gross margin to be in the low single-digits in 2019. We remind you that we are not optimizing for player gross profit as our strategy of trading player margin for account growth and platform revenue growth continues to work well. We plan to manage the business to roughly EBITDA breakeven in 2019, so some of the Q1 upside is expected to flow through to the full year. Stock comp of roughly $75 million and depreciation and amortization and net other income of $10 million, are reflected in our outlook for roughly $70 million of net income loss in 2019. For Q2, our outlook is for year-over-year revenue growth up 42% at the midpoint with Platform revenue representing roughly two-thirds of total revenue.
Continued mix shift to video advertising is expected to remain a drag on Platform gross margins and when combined with mid single-digit player gross margin, our combined outlook for Q2 is for roughly 45% gross margins. As a reminder in Q2 of 2018, player gross profit benefited from a release of accruals of $8.9 million related to potential IP licensing liabilities that did not materialize and are not expected to be realized. Excluding these accrual releases in Q2 of 2018, gross margin would have been 44% versus 50% as reported. Q2 OpEx is expected to be roughly 15% higher than in Q1 as we recognized the full quarter impact of the hiring that took place in Q1 and new hires in Q2.
We also recently signed a new lease agreement that was not in our prior outlook and adds an incremental $2 million to $3 million per quarter. As a result, we expect to report an adjusted EBITDA loss of roughly $7.5 million at the midpoint and a net income loss of roughly $27.5 million which includes stock-based comp of $18 million and $2 million of depreciation and amortization and net other income in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $290 million of cash equivalents and short-term investments, which included net proceeds of $98 million from the sale of Class A common stock. Subsequent to the quarter end, we upsized our credit facility by $50 million to $200 million consisting of $100 million revolver and $100 million of available term debt, but neither has been drawn. I will summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business and the strong momentum we are seeing across the broader streaming landscape that benefits Roku.
With that, let’s turn over the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Wingren with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Platform in the first quarter, what you saw the key drivers as like we saw some acceleration sequentially and I think we are facing a tough comparison in the licensing side there year-over-year. So I just wanted to understand the drivers? And then the outlook for the rest of year does seem to imply a bit of decal, just trying to understand why that might be? And then just finally what of the share gains that Anthony mentioned 2 to 1 in 3 smart TVs just trying to understand the drivers there that ultimately where do you think that can go to? Thank you. Hey, Evan. This is Anthony. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had a strong quarter with Platform revenue up 79% and the drivers were very broad-based. The industry is increasingly adopting streaming that’s driving a lot of interest in our audience development business for example which is where we help partners promote their services. Advertising monetized ad impressions more than doubled again in the quarter and people are streaming more and that’s driving our content attribution rev shares. Then in terms of the outlook, I will let Steve talk about that. Yes. Hey, Evan. So, yes, we are very happy with the pace and trajectory of the business. So we have increased the outlook for the full year reflecting Q1 as well as good momentum into Q2. Obviously, the closer in we have better visibility, the outlook is or the viewpoint into the back half of the year is still forming in terms of the holiday season, but we have increased the outlook from kind of mid 30s sales growth, which what it was in the prior outlook to roughly 40%. So, we feel good we are on the right track, but this reflects kind of the best thinking and the best estimates we have at this time. So we are happy where the business was at. Evan, this is Anthony again. In terms of smart TVs, yes, I mean it was a huge milestone for us becoming the number one smart TV OS in the country in the United States. So that’s excellent. And as a reminder last year was one in four smart TVs sold were Roku TVs. Just last quarter Q1, it was one in three, so a pretty big increase and that share increase is coming out of homegrown TV software solutions right, which is still most of the TVs sold are homegrown solutions built by the TV companies. And that we really think those in almost all cases those solutions are probably uncompetitive and that we will just continue to see gains and share of licensed OSs and we are the number one licensed OS. So there is a lot of room to grow. It’s a big opportunity. Thank you both very much. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. Can you talk about the impact of Viacom acquiring Pluto, perhaps the acquisition of Cheddar as well, because I believe both of those were there were ad relationships etcetera. And will you continue to sell the inventory? When would you see an impact, because I assume there was something contractual and then perhaps in situations like that can a relation shift more to data licensing if they want to sell the ads themselves? So, that’s question one. And then question two, how are you thinking about the pending privacy legislation, particularly CCPA as it relates to next year both positively and negatively for the Roku Platform? Thanks. Hey, Jason. It’s Scott Rosenberg here. Thanks for the question. We will comment on the Viacom and Cheddar deals or relationships specifically except to say that we are excited about the increased investment and focus by major media companies on bringing great free content over-the-top. When they do this, they ultimately accelerate the consumer move into OTT and expand the economic pie for all of us. We share in their success. We have got a great relationship with these entities. And as a platform, we are uniquely positioned to both help them drive the expansion, the consumption of their services on Roku through our audience development tools as well as drive monetization through both an ad sales relationship as well as you referenced a data relationship so that they can leverage some of our data and ad tech capabilities to better monetize. So overall, we view these as good indicators on progress in making more great free content available over-the-top. With regards to your question about privacy legislation, we continue to watch it closely as we have done with GDPR. In general, we are broadly supportive of things that help consumers control what information is shared. As a platform, we have a first-party relationship with our consumers, which allows them to directly communicate their preferences what information is shared and used and we think in general this legislation is both good for consumers as well as good for platforms like Roku who got a direct first-party relationship. Hey, Jason, this is Anthony. I just want to add for me the most exciting thing about the Viacom/Pluto tie-up is the fact that Viacom is taking content that was previously only available through pa-TV subscriptions on MVPDs and making it available free over-the-top streaming through AVOD services. And that not only will that drive viewing on the platform, I think it will also help accelerate the shift of ad dollars over to streaming. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Okay, I will just ask one question. Anthony, you talked about how these new OTT launches Apple, Disney could really help Roku and I know you have talked about in the past, but just give us a little bit more updated thinking on why and how that would be and when? So Apple put out what looked kind of like vaporware, but they are going to come out with streaming, Disney put out a really impressive performance, but that’s not going to be launching until December. Are there already some sort of commitments to advertise to market on with Roku, just talk about why and how and when those will be impactful to Roku? Sure. I mean, obviously we can’t talk about specific deals, but these new services are absolutely positive for Roku and we are excited to bring them to our users. For starters with 29 million active accounts and some very effective audience development tools we are an increasingly important partner for these kinds of services that are trying to reach viewers, build audience, increase engagement. We have a lot of tools that they can use to do that and they are buying them. And they of course drive interest in streaming, it drives more cord cutters, it just propels the whole industry generally. So, it’s all very positive for us. Okay. Thank you, Anthony. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is now open. Two questions. First on the quarter, you talked about Roku channels being strong, just curious if that was given more from engagement and awareness or if it was some of the new premium subscription channels driving that? Maybe a question more philosophically for Anthony, when you look at Netflix they have about 150 million global subs about 60% today is international and international is the fastest growing channel. Obviously Netflix has only paid subscription, whereas Roku includes both ad supported and paid subscriptions. You had roughly 30 million accounts today. And as you are launching internationally do you think the market opportunity in terms of subs could be as large as international and just curious on how you think that growth progresses for Roku? Thanks. Sure. I will let Scott take the CRT question and then I will come back on the Netflix international question. Ralph, it was a great quarter for The Roku Channel. We continue to see nice growth. As you pointed out notably premium subscription has also seen great growth. We have got over 30 partners now in the Platform. We launched HBO in time for the Game of Thrones season premiere. Our view of The Roku Channel and its opportunity is that there is both great opportunity in AVOD and ad supported programming. We are still early days, but have added lots content over the last 18 to 24 months of TRC. And then on premiums subscription, while it’s early days we think the value proposition for consumers of one bill, one login combined recommendations across these services as well as the value proposition for content owners to more quickly acquire subs and retain them through an easier-to-use interface is strong. So, in general, we are very excited about the continued growth and opportunity for The Roku Channel. Today, it’s a top 5 channel in terms of reach and just as a reminder it’s under 2 years old. Hey, Ralph, it’s Anthony. So in terms of international, I think in the last quarter newsletter in Q4 we highlighted four strategic areas of growth and one of those was international it’s a big opportunity. It’s a 1 billion broadband households worldwide. And we believe that all of televisions worldwide will be switching to a life of operating system like the Roku OS. And so it’s a big opportunity. We are putting resources into it increasingly, but we don’t have anything specific to announce this quarter about it. Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Hi there. Can you hear me okay you guys? Yes. Slide 3, Scott, upfront, next week, last year was the first time Roku, went to upfront. I’m interested in what you’re going to try to achieve this year at the upfronts for Roku. Secondly Steve are you sticking by your breakeven EBITDA? Feel that you guys are doing better here do you want increase guidance? And Anthony is it actually possible to launch an OTT channel in the U.S. without being on Roku? Because, I would say not. But my question then is are you being able to negotiate better deals even though bigger players are coming like Apple and Disney? I don’t know how they can launch a service now that’s basically 30 million over-the-top subs so can you put that into your pricing and negotiating leverage even though these are getting to be bigger players coming to the OTT market? Thanks guys. Hi Laura. Yes, as you point out this is Scott here, this is the second year where we are actively participating in the upfront processes. As a reminder for other folks in the call the upfront windows the window during which national TV buyers plan the majority of their media, I think what’s different this year relative to last year is that agency executives and brands are talking more openly than ever about their frustrations with the decline in audiences. Adults 18 to 34 audiences are down more than 50% over the since 2010 yet rates are going up. Promises made around the reduction of ad loads new ad capabilities new targeting capabilities just aren’t happening in linear TV like the buying community would like to see. So, advertisers are getting very direct about their intent to move money out of linear in OTT. Agencies all across town are hosting OTT education days as they go into the upfront. We’re a key participant and leader in that process. We are equipping agencies with case studies to understand the more the increased impact that OTT can have and most importantly planning tools to help them accurately model the incremental unduplicated audience that they can deliver in Roku relative to their linear investment. So overall, it’s an exciting window for us and a chance to really influence the commitments that brands are going to make through the rest of their year of TV buying. Hi Laura it’s Steve. Just on your second question about breakeven EBITDA. So, in general we still believe that we have we’re the leading streaming TV platform in the U.S. we’ve got a great strategic position. And as we’ve said the shift to streaming is only accelerating. So, the philosophy of running the business around EBITDA breakeven is still relevant to us as we invest in our core areas like international as Anthony mentioned on a prior question. We also talked about the advertising business the Roku Channel for continued expansion of that and growing breadth and depth as well as the Roku TV program that hit its big milestone of becoming the #1 smart TV operating system. So, there’s a lot of growth rate opportunities to continue to invest and that philosophy is still appropriate. Given where the business is and given the industry trend. Having said that we did update our EBITDA guidance and so there is a slight positive just given the outperform on an EBITDA basis in Q1. So, we’re our outlook is for $10 million to $20 million. But on one billion, outlook for the year we would still consider that roughly breakeven. And this is Anthony. Just on your question of the importance of Roku as a platform. Yes, we are an essential partner for anyone launching a streaming service there’s no doubt about that. But we’re also a great partner. I mean we have a lot of tools that allow streaming services to build audience grow subscribers. And you know our competitive competition not only do they have smaller scale in the U.S. but they also don’t reference of building these tools services need to grow their audience. So, we have a lot of ways for them to do that. And these companies have a large marketing budgets they’re putting a lot of effort into this and we’re in a very efficient use of those marketing budgets. So yes, we’re obviously an important partner for launching the streaming service. Do you feel that Disney will market before it actually launches its service on November 12 or will we only see upside from the Disney marketing after it launches it’s, streaming service do you think? We can’t we don’t have any comments on what Disney might do in terms of launching their service. Okay thanks guys very much. Our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. Anthony, I think in your prepared remarks you spoke about how much with a long way you’ve travelled in 5 years with the business. And now of course it’s changing with all these massive companies moving in. So, and you just spoke about all your business partners in terms of partnerships that you are partners. So, I wanted to ask are you not nervous a little bit that these guys like Viacom Disney who have had years of adversarial experience with their distributors and that’s in their DNA that do you think the spirit of partnership will continue with them, because it’s different dealing with Cheddar two years ago and Disney in a year. So, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on how this plays out in the future? Sure. Yes so, I think that first of all the milestone was specific to Roku TVs we’ve been selling players longer. But it’s important to remember that actually we weren’t the first company to launch Internet TV. Google Android TVs were shipping well before us. And we’ve been competing with large companies like that and others for years very successfully. We’re now the #1 streaming platform. And that competitive landscape the reason we do well there is because of our singular focus on the fact that we built purpose-built platform from the ground-up for streaming. It’s just a superior solution for building streaming devices and streaming TVs and we were executing well. In terms of content companies launching services they’re absolutely not competitors. They are direct-to-consumer services but they need a platform like Roku to reach consumers in the living room on TVs. And we’re a great platform for doing that and we built our platform to do that exact thing. So, they are important partners for us and we’re important partners for them as well. But can for example Pluto TV say in a couple of years that the Roku channel does compete with us in a way you compete for the U.S. time you complete probably for advertising budgets? And that will influence your relationship and shift it more to the adversarial side of things? I don’t think so. You know it’s obviously it’s a complicated industry, with different facets. But in general, our goal is to help our partners be successful in our platform help them our we view our biggest competitors as linear TV and our goal is to move as much television advertising as we can from linear TV to streaming. And we do that in the lots of different ways including working with partners like Pluto so we’re basically on the same side. I don’t know Scott if you want to add anything? Yes. I would just add and emphasize as Anthony said these are partnerships. We’ve got the tools to help these services grow their audience on Roku to better monetize on Roku it’s not a zero-sum game. Also, increasingly the other Roku Channel will be another vehicle by which content and IP owners can reach consumers in addition to standalone apps. We’ve got a first-party relationship with our customers that power that powers our audience development our marketing capabilities on behalf of content partners as well as the advanced ad capabilities. So, all of these capabilities that Roku has accrue to our mutual benefit with services with these new services as they come into OTT. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from line of Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. This is Brandon on for Shyam. Just a couple of quick ones. Just in terms of the monetizable ad hours growth, can you just talk about like some of the underlying drivers there in the quarter? And for your outlook like how should we kind of think about sort of increased allocation from content partners versus contribution of GRC or anything else you would call out? And then just on the ad tech side you guys kind of referenced it in the last question. But sort of where are you guys focused on in terms of building out additional advertising technology capabilities and going to market with that in 2019 and beyond? Brandon, Scott here. With regards to growth in monetizable ad impressions on the platform our growth is broad-based with more than doubling of monetized ad impressions. We’re seeing growth in where we place ads in both The Roku Channel as well as broadly across the platform. That monetization function process is growing faster than overall growth of the platform. And so, our share the economics of advertising on our platform is growing as well. Overall the fundamentals are very strong we continue to command premium CPMs, our biggest focus though of course just attracting net new ad dollars into the ecosystem. We are doing that by bringing in net new TV advertisers broadening our client base extending our ad products and capabilities with new targeting new measurements new interactive capabilities. You asked about our focus in terms of ad tech we continue to significantly advance the platform in terms of our ability to sell not just on a direct reserve basis but also programmatically to deliver incremental reach for advertisers to prove mid and bottom funnel impact through both research that we offer as well as through our partnerships with research vendors. There’s a lot of work to do. Already we’re in a great place to demonstrate that ads on Roku drives significantly more impact than linear and other forms of digital advertising. And yet we’re continuing to add new research partnerships new insights new planning tools to help advertisers continue to shift the budgets out of linear TV. Great. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple for me. First what percentage of platform revenue in the quarter came from advertising? Second Steve when you were listing the growth drivers at the Platform segment you referenced content distribution first. And I’m wondering if we should take that to assume or to mean that content distribution was the largest driver of growth in the quarter particularly relative to advertising? And then third bigger picture, what is your view of developing your licensing exclusive content for The Roku Channel at some point? Thank you. Michael, this is Steve. I will take the first couple and others can chime in on the third. In terms of Platform segment, we don’t break out the advertising piece. But we have said in the past that it is the biggest component. It means that the thing to note there is the robust growth in the over performance was broad-based amongst those different businesses advertising the audience development and the content distribution. Certainly, my ordering of that was not intended to be a specific prioritization of the biggest driver. They were all great. But certainly, the tremendous growth in the Roku monetized video ad impression has historically been the biggest driver of the Platform segment and we think, it’s advertising overall is the biggest opportunity with those $70 billion of traditional TV budgets moving over and following viewership over time. But in terms of how the breakdown works I think one of the things to just remember is that our agreement and our relationships with our content publishers on the platform are broad-based and these deals are largely intertwined right? So, there’s take virtual MVPDs as an example their components about SVOD rev shares or TVOD they could include access to inventory they may have audience development spend coming the other way sometimes they even include some kind of wholesale purchase of players. So especially on the Platform side we look at it more on the relationship side with these players as opposed to a specific sub-segment within there. And then in terms of licensing original content we have no plans to license original content. In TRC our focus is on adding more content categories deepening our content categories adding live content adding different business models like premium subscription as well as free content. And the big advantage we have with TRC is that we control our platform so we can integrate it into our user interface we can make it front and centre. We can have a single bill we can do great targeting. We can make it the best a great aggregation point for content and that really helps brings viewers to content and content to viewers. Great. And just on the premium subscription portion was that a material contributor to the growth in the first quarter? It’s early days on that. We don’t have a specific update but it’s just rolling out now. Okay great. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thank you. A couple for Scott just sticking on the theme around OTT opportunity and competition. I’m sure you’ve noticed really, I’ve noticed a lot of new businesses and a incremental focus in OTT from start-ups and other players thinking along the ad-tech line like a Trade Desk or even some former Roku employees starting businesses. And I’m just wondering, Scott, when you look at the ecosystem, do you see these sort of value-added services or ad-tech platforms that are involved at the agency level or elsewhere as a positive in terms of driving adoption of the ecosystem or has potentially competing for economics with you guys? And then secondly, I know we’re focused on moving linear TV dollars over, that all makes sense. I’m just curious if you just think about YouTube at all as an opportunity in terms of shifting dollars, there’s a lot of dollars there, just obviously it’s been focused on brand safety stuff, and I’m just curious if you ever see Roku positioned as a alternative on sort of the digital video side? And then lastly, I just wanted to ask about the international strategy for you guys long-term. Should we be expecting sort of OEM partnerships like we have in the U.S. with TCL and others to appear for Roku outside the United States? Is that sort of the plan at some point as you guys sort of formalize your international plans or might the strategy be different? Hey, Ben, I’ll take the first two questions and then pass the international question to Anthony. In general, with regards to your question about all the activity around ad-supported viewing and OTT, we view it as a net positive as bringing net more great content to Roku driving consumer attention, raising awareness, creating opportunities for advertisers. And, of course, when those apps, when that content comes to Roku, we participate in the economics of that content. So, in general, we are excited about it. And as a platform, we add tremendous value to their efforts on the Roku platform, both in terms of being able to market and grow their audience on Roku, as well as help them monetize through ad sales and data relationships.
So, in general, we’re excited to see that. And our focus as a company is in moving people out of linear TV into OTT and we view these services as helping accelerate that trend. We are as you point out in your second question very focused in helping TV advertisers reallocate their TV spending, but that’s not the end of the opportunity for us. There are a lot of digital video dollars spent throughout the ecosystem that often are also looking for a better home whether because it’s longform, its premium content, it’s in the living room, it’s brand safe.
And so that is also part of our ad strategy is to be engaged with direct-to-consumer brands, digital-first brands, helping bring them to the Roku platform and invest. At the end of the day, our strength, our power as a platform comes from our first-party relationship with customers from control of the OS and the ad stack from our broad reach across the ad ecosystem. And so again back to your first question, we view those capabilities as helping us to participate and benefit from all this increased activity in AVOD OTT. Thank you. In terms of – this is Anthony, in terms of international, I don’t have much to add except to say that Roku TVs are currently available in Canada and Mexico, as well as the United States and that we believe that every smart TV needs an operating system and that’s an important trend that we’re part of, and there’s obviously a big opportunity internationally. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Evans with Stephens. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. You guys had the best net add of active accounts in the quarter that you’ve ever had outside of the fourth quarter. Could you comment on the churn in the period and how the growing importance of being embedded in smart TVs might change the churn numbers going forward? Yes, hey Kyle, it’s Steve. Yes, so yes, we had a great quarter in terms of adds. We added two million active accounts and that’s continued robust growth there. In terms of a reminder on seasonality, it was a strong quarter, but also the kind of Halo effect of the holiday season, where a lot of people get their players or TVs at the near the end of the quarter. The active accounts sort of run over into Q1. So, there is a bit – it’s a seasonally strong quarter although the performance was quite strong.
In terms of churn and stuff, one of the things that’s interesting to us is because you don’t pay Roku directly the kind of binary churn is not a metric that we pay a lot of attention to. We really talk about that active account generation and the engagement on the platform. And so for us, the important thing is to focus on the fact that the average Roku user is up to about 3.5 hours a day, which is an acceleration of engagement on the platform and that for us is one of the key indicators that we look at and that’s roughly 50% of kind of the average U.S. household time on TV, which is getting to be a substantial mix of TV viewing. So, we’re happy with the trend there. It’s great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I’ve got a few. One, when you look at the featured apps on the Roku channel, sorry, not the featured, the featured content that you choose to put up top across the either on your Roku devices or on the website, what are we actually looking at like is that being programmed based on viewer interest, is that being paid for by content owners that you’re selling almost as ad placement? What are you – what’s actually happening in there and what’s the kind of driver of that business? And then related to that, just a housekeeping point, how much of Roku channel usage is off platform? And then I got a couple of follow-ups. Hey, Rich, Scott here. Regarding how content percolates to the top, it’s still early days, but we’ve been quite aggressive in rolling out recommendations and other features to try to anticipate what you want to watch. And so in general, the content that you see in the Roku channel is optimized based on our machine learning driven estimates of what you’re likely to watch. We’ve seen good success in those algorithms driving increased engagement. And we have a lot of interesting work we’re doing on that going ahead. The vast majority of Roku usage is still on our platform, where of course, we’ve got fundamental advantages to drive consumption and monetization. And then on – I’ve noticed on the button side of the business, I’ve noticed that ESPN+ showed up, and I’m just curious, someone asked earlier about rising SVOD competition, which I think we’ve all noticed in the industry, which is great for you all. But I’m just wondering, how valuable is that button real estate on your remotes? Is it – and does that – do those buttons drive and so is there any way to think about how those buttons drive usage or the benefit historically of having buttons? Hey Rich, this is Anthony. We have a bunch of tools in our audience development toolkit. They’re all very effective buttons, it’s one of them. There is four partner buttons per remote they sell out, they are in high demand and they do work. We’ve done a lot of test to gauge the increase in sign-ups, increased engagement from having the button in there – we don’t – they’re well worth it. We don’t – but we don’t disclose what the rate card is for button. And then just a last high-level question for you, Anthony. As I look at the most-watched Roku channels in any given day that you publish on your site, it looks like an increasing percentage of the top most-watched apps, our vMVPDs with YouTube for the first time showing up in the top 8. Just wondering is that – how do we think about vMVPDs rising in overall usage? Is that a net positive for Roku versus the kind of AVOD applications, a negative, I just don’t know how to think about the relative size of those moving up versus others moving down? Yes, it’s a great category for us. It continues to grow healthily as consumers cut the cord and they look for other options, other bundles in OTT. Those are great relationships for us because all of those parties, all the virtual MVPDs are very much in user acquisition mode. And so they work very closely with us to drive consumption of their platform. With regards to your observation that they’re percolating up in terms of popularity, the general usage pattern of those services is, they drive very intense usage once a consumer subscribes to them. And it’s additive on top of whatever the consumer was doing on their Roku device before they subscribe to that virtual MVPD service. One thing we’ve noticed that’s interesting is that virtual MVPD users also watch a lot of other streaming services as well. It’s not – their behavior is different than when they were a traditional pay TV customer. Yes. It really does though fill out the dial to what consumers are looking to watch in TV. It services that appetite for live TV and viewing for sports and it sort of seals the deal for the consumer cutting the cord and moving all their viewership to Roku. But the point that Anthony just trying to make just to be clear is that if you were to, let’s just say, if you watched 100 hours of TV in the linear world, you shift to a vMVPD, you watch your vMVPD on Roku, but you also watch a lot of other channels and so your actual linear view of usage may go down, but Roku benefits because you also end up watching all of these other applications on Roku? Absolutely. Yes, that’s right. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. Thank you. Appreciate it. I don’t think this has been asked yet, but, if so, just let me know, in terms of new accounts in the quarter, can you talk about how much of them came from connected TV deals versus standalone players? And are there any segments of the TV OEMs industry that you feel like Roku under-indexes in meaning where you think you have a particular opportunity to grow your share? I don’t know if it’s based on premium, SKUs versus non-premium or however you might look at it? So, sort of those two questions kind of on the TV market.
And then on the platform gross margin and gross margin outlook, for quite a while now you guys have been guiding to kind of the incremental 50% margin, but that was a trend there for a while, but the last 2 quarters, it’s been in the high-60s and close to 70%. To get to the low-60s on a full-year basis, it’s got a really kind of trend down pretty dramatically. So, what is going to change over the next couple of quarters versus what you’ve been seeing the last at least 2 quarters? Thanks. This is Anthony, I’ll take the first two. So, in terms of the new account mix, it’s rough, it’s still roughly half of new accounts coming from TVs and half coming from players. TVs historically have been the fastest growing part of that. In terms of the TV OEMs and other under-indexed areas, I would say that we started – when we first got into the business, we started with more entry-level TVs and more 2K TVs and over time, we’ve continued to move, I mean, when I say we, I mean, us with our various OEM partners have continued to move upmarket. The percent of TVs that we – that our partners sell that are 4K TVs that’s generally growing, there’s now lots of different SKUs, includes traditional good better, best and the best is the best, Roku TVs are excellent picture quality, they compete with the best brand for picture quality, so, moving upstream.
And then another – I think another important factor is that if you look at the TV market for OEMs, those OEMs that are not licensing Roku TV are almost all losing in market share and Roku’s OEMs are gaining in market share. So, that’s another trend that’s just helping us as time goes on as well. And then number 3 I think on – it sounds like that’s a Steve question. Yes, so just on the platform gross margin, I mean, the two pieces that we talked about, which can put pressure on the platform gross margin are the video ad business that tends to be at a 50% plus margin and then as that continues to grow and we’ve mentioned now for the last couple of quarters about the Roku monetized video ad impressions more than doubling, so certainly that is the fast growing piece of the business.
And then the other piece, which again – it’s early days, but has a very large margin structure, because it’s a premium subscription business, because it’s handled on a growth basis and then the payment to the content provider is considered COGS, that can have a potential effect as well. So, those are two factors that are included in our outlook and that – that we think are – have the potential to drive the platform margins down over time. But it’s obviously the company margins have been ticking up over time and we’re very happy to keep mixing into that faster growing higher margin platform. Can you talk to us about why these factors haven’t impacted platform margins in the last couple of quarters though? Well, premium subscription businesses is just in the process of launching, so that is a new piece. And like I said it’s early days and so the rate of growth and how big that becomes this year versus down the road is an unknown. So that can change some things. And then I think frankly it’s a great problem to have but we’ve had like we said this quarter we’ve had great growth on the advertising front but also very strong growth on audience development and content distribution and those are extremely high-margin businesses. And so the mix of those things have kept the margins higher than what we would have expected. But that’s I’ll take that problem any day. All the different pieces are working really well together and again they are connected with our relationship with these different content publishers. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chaim Siegel of Elazar Advisors. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Talking about the EBITDA that you raised your estimates this year, looking out to next year and kind of the trends with the gross margins and revenues I am just wondering if you could talk about profitability going into next year. It looks like that you have some leverage going in favor? Yes, this is Steve. We haven’t provided specific EBITDA guidance for 2020 and beyond. As I mentioned earlier we think given our leadership position given the trends in the industry and our the strategic positioning that we have in the middle of all these trends that continuing to invest in the business is appropriate. But certainly the business has been accelerating on a revenue basis. We have a very robust gross profit. But we have a lot of great areas to invest that we think pay long-term great returns. So for 2019 we think running at adjusted EBITDA breakeven roughly is the right case. However how we do think that over time and again we haven’t provided specific guidance for 2020 right now that there is a lot of leverage in the business. As I mentioned mixing into a faster growing higher margin platform business is a great long-term position further business and there’s a lot of leverage in that business model overall as we continue to grow. It sounds great. Best of luck. Thank you. I am showing no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Anthony Wood for closing remarks. Thanks. I just want to say thanks to everyone for joining today’s call. Our first quarter results were strong and we are pleased with the outlook for the full year. You know I found Roku because all TV and all TV advertising would be streamed. The world’s largest and most successful media companies now share that conviction.
We’re excited to help their new services connect with the millions of average streamers that you struggle to thus with as the millions more who will become active accounts in the future. It’s not only scale that sets us apart. The Roku Platform is powerful. We are executing well. And we have achieved this strategic position a strategic position as the number one smart TV OS in the U.S. So again thanks for your support and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.","the first quarter ended march 31 2019 and we are raising our outlook for the full year . we have an exceptional platform, an unmatched team and an outstanding platform . the call is based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions .",1.0

[Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Tricia Mifsud, Vice President of Communications. Ma’am, please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Roku’s financial results conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019. I am pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku’s Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A. Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.roku.com.
The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management’s views as of today, August 7, 2019 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. Some of the statements made on today’s call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding the future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the third quarter and full year of 2019 and the future growth in our business. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today’s shareholder letter and the company’s periodic filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on our Investor Relations website at ir.roku.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for important content. Finally, unless otherwise stated all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Now, I would like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Tricia and thanks everyone for joining today’s call. Our second quarter and first half results show the great progress we are making. I am particularly pleased we passed two significant milestones. The first is that active accounts exceeded $30 million. We reached 1 in 5 U.S. households and our domestic scale rivals the biggest MVPDs. The second is that ARPU was above $20 on a trailing 12-month basis. ARPU has expanded 88% in the 2 years since we went public. Achievements like these show our strategy is working and our execution is strong.
Q2 financial results also exceeded our expectations. We had the highest Q2 growth rate since going public and we are raising our outlook for the full year. Strong performance allows us to continue to reinvest incremental gross profit in ways that extend our strategic advantages and build even greater preference for Roku among consumers, content publishers, OEMs, and advertisers.
Before handing the call over to Steve, I would like to draw your attention to a distinguishing characteristic of our ad business. There was a growing understanding that having first-party customer relationships at scale is a fundamental advantage. Our ad business is thriving as we offer a superior solution providing precision targeting, access to premium inventory, unique sponsorships, and OTT reach that an individual publisher of third-party ad tech provider cannot match. The Roku OS was built to create value for advertisers and content distributors. We are proud of the value we deliver for their business.
I will now turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. We delivered exceptionally strong results this quarter in both the platform and player segments. Before taking your questions, I will walk through financial highlights and address our outlook. Please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter.
Overall revenue growth accelerated to 59% year-over-year, the highest level since Roku went public in 2017 as both platform and player segments outperformed expectations. Platform revenue growth of 86% year-over-year increased sequentially from 79% year-over-year last quarter. This was driven by increases in the estimated value of content distribution agreements based on improved visibility and performance trends, which resulted in a larger-than-expected recognition of revenue in the quarter. As a reminder, revenue recognition of our content distribution agreements can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. In addition, robust growth in advertising continued as Roku monetized video ad impressions once again more than double year-over-year, and we expect that trend to continue throughout 2019.
The player revenue growth rate of 24% year-over-year increased sequentially from 18% year-over-year last quarter driven by strong core retail channel sales growth. Player units were up 36% year-over-year and ASPs were down 10% as we continued to optimize for account growth. Total gross profit of $114 million was up 47% year-over-year as reported. Excluding the $8.9 million benefit in Q2 2018 from a release of accruals related to potential IP licensing liabilities that did not materialize, total gross profit would have grown 66% year-over-year, which is faster than the revenue growth rate. As anticipated, overall gross margin declined sequentially from 48.8% to 45.7% due to the continued mix shift to video advertising, the introduction of premium subscriptions, and our strategy of driving down player ASPs.
OpEx in the quarter grew 60% year-over-year to $125 million driven by a 33% growth in headcount and higher stock-based compensation. Excluding stock-based comp, OpEx was up 46% year-over-year, which was well below our revenue and gross profit growth rates. Our strong revenue and gross profit performance allowed us to deliver a better than expected adjusted EBITDA of $11 million in Q2. We ended the quarter with $387 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, which included net proceeds of $81 million from the sale of Class A common stock in an at-the-market offering transaction during the quarter.
With that, let’s turn to our outlook for the full year. Please note that our outlook does not include the impact if any of new tariffs that maybe imposed on foreign sourced goods as there are still too many uncertainties related to the timing, scope, and level of potential near-term changes in this area. We along with our partners are taking steps to mitigate potential adverse impacts. Based on strong first half results and momentum in the second half, we are raising our 2019 revenue outlook to $1.085 billion at the midpoint, representing roughly 46% year-over-year growth, up from 40% year-over-year growth in our prior outlook. We expect platform revenue to represent roughly two-thirds of total revenue. We are raising our total gross profit outlook to $485 million at the midpoint, up from $470 million previously.
For modeling purposes, you should continue to model full-year platform gross margins in the low 60s as a percentage of revenue driven by the continued mix shift to video advertising and the ramp up of premium subscription as the year progresses. We expect player gross margins to be in the low-single digits for 2019. And similar to last year, we expect player gross margin to be the lowest in Q4. As a reminder, we are not optimizing for player gross profit as our strategy of trading player margin for account growth and platform revenue growth continues to work well.
Our strategy is to reinvest incremental gross profit in our business to further strengthen our competitive advantages and growth drivers. Given our performance in the first half, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $30 million to $40 million. We anticipate sequential increases in operating expenses from our continued investments in talent, product development, and sales and marketing efforts as well as the impact of increased facility costs. The stock-based comp estimate for 2019 has increased to roughly $90 million from $75 million in the prior outlook, largely due to higher stock price and additional equity refresh grants. Depreciation and amortization and other net income of $10 million are reflected in our outlook for roughly $66 million of net income loss in 2019.
Our Q3 outlook calls for 46% year-over-year revenue growth to $252.5 million at the midpoint and 47% year-over-year gross profit growth to $116.5 million. We anticipate a particularly large sequential increase in operating expenses in Q3 primarily due to increased headcount related costs, facility costs, and timing of expenses shifting from Q2. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss to be roughly $8 million in Q3 at the midpoint and a net income loss of roughly $37 million, which includes stock-based comp of $26 million and $3 million of depreciation and amortization and other net income in the quarter. I will summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business in the first half of the year and with the strong momentum we possess going into the second half.
With that, let’s turn it over for your questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Great. So for my first question, I want to talk about for the OTT advertising market, I wanted to know if you thought if the increased focus on privacy including at the regulatory level was going to at all have a negative impact on advertising spending for OTT? Hey, Tom. Scott Rosenberg here. Great question. As you know, on balance, we of course take privacy very seriously as a company, but we have a first-party direct relationship with our consumers and it puts us in a unique position as a platform to both explain to consumers how the data is used and to control it, and I would just contrast that against third-party entities, intermediaries who don’t have that direct consumer relationship and who are going to be more challenged to articulate and justify the uses of data. So, on balance of course, we take it very seriously, but feel that as a platform with a first-party consumer relationship, we are uniquely positioned. Great. And then for my follow-up question I wanted you to give I guess a sense kind of if you thought this was may be a 3-year potential, 5-year potential, 10-year potential. So, as a long time follower of the industry for an extended period of time, there was a large disconnect between mobile usage and mobile digital ad spend as a percent of total spend. You see it today and over the top, so when do you think you will see more parity between usage and percent of advertising spent for OTT? Thanks. Good question. I think that we are still in the early stages of the secular shift, the consumer TV habit moving to OTT, and that move is very fast. You can see it in the growth of streaming hours on our platform. So, I do think it will take more than 3 years to play out. That said, we are making great progress as shown by our revenue growth, our ARPU growth, and it really owes to progress in our ad products, measurement, proof points that they work attracting TV ad dollars, as well as progress on the content distribution side of our business through things like Roku Pay. At the end of the day for us, this really is going to come down to proving to advertisers and content providers that Roku delivers incremental substantial reach over traditional linear TV, and we are more effective at both the ad products we deliver and at helping content companies acquire subscribers. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Great, thank you. This is Shwetha for Mark. Two questions please. The first one is on content distribution. Steve, could you please elaborate on the comment of increase in estimated value of content distribution agreements based on the improved visibility and performance trends which led to strong performance in platform revenue as one of the reasons. Could you please talk a little bit more about that, what do you mean by that? And then the second is on the Roku Channel. Last quarter you said over 10,000 movies and shows over two dozens of live channels and over 30 subscription services. So my question is what is the team focused on most, is it growing the content, ad inventory availability, product improvements, and you touched on machine learning and personalization, and how are viewers spending their time on the Roku Channel when you compare ad supported content, which grew really well that you noted in your shareholder letter versus the subscription channels? Thank you. Yes. Hi, this is Steve. I will take the first question on the content distribution agreement. Yes, just as a reminder, each quarter we value the major agreements that we have – there are multiple element agreements and we have few models where we have certain assumptions related to those, and we are evaluating the whole deal value, say in a 2 or 3-year deal. As a result, to the extent that we have positive performance trends and we have confidence that we have visibility into those potentially continuing that will increase the value of the deal over time and when the deal value increases then that incremental revenue is recognized in that quarter, which can lead to a comment we also made where on a quarter-to-quarter basis those revenues related to content distribution agreements can be lumpy. And so that was the situation we had this quarter, and so we had greater-than-expected revenue recognition in there and the deal value in some of our deals went up, which is a great trend, but again can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter in terms of how it gets recognized. Steve, just a quick one, can you quantify that please? We haven’t given a specific value on that, but it was definitely a contributing factor to the acceleration sequentially in the platform revenue growth rate. This is Anthony. I will take the question on the Roku Channel. So, I would say overall the Roku Channel is doing great. It’s working well. Our strategy with the Roku Channel it has – is in place, and the Roku Channel usage is playing out the way we expected. It’s a great experience for our customers. It’s a great way for content publishers to increase distribution in our content or more effectively distribute their content. And it’s a great advertiser experience as well. So, those three things together creates this virtuous cycle that just drives more and more engagement in the Roku Channel network we are seeing. With the top 5 channels on the platform, you mentioned premium subscriptions. We have AVOD, we have premium subscriptions. We have live content. Just like, for example, I used Roku Channel last week, I went in and watched an episode of Chernobyl on HBO, and then I thought that Die Hard was there. So, I ended up watching Die Hard as well. So, it’s very complementary. People come in for one reason and maybe end up watching something else. So, the strategy is working well for us. We are very happy with the Roku Channel. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you, Steve. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is now open. Hey guys. Can you hear me okay? Yes, Laura. Great. These are excellent numbers. These are awesome and I love the EBITDA guidance upwards, Roku could not be more excited about that $40 million. So Anthony for you, what I am really interested in learning is when you go into a new market like I think you guys have announced Brazil. Are there like operating systems you have to displace, because you are getting there later than when you went to China 6 years ago or are you able to go into sort of where again it was owner operator and you are going to go in and save these guys a ton of money. So I am wondering about sort of the pace, I know you have a roadmap from the U.S., but the pace of international rollout is it harder than the U.S. or is it easier, because you know exactly what you are doing and you are just going to bring our cost down? That’s the first one. Steve for you rev rec on like Disney Plus, right Disney did earnings yesterday. My understanding of rev rec to tell me if this is wrong is, if you sell a Disney subscription, Roku controls the consumer name, you recognize the $7, you hold on your distribution and you payout whatever the $5 or $5.50 to Disney. Is that the rev rec? And then my last thing is somebody needs to ask about these China tariffs and whether if these tariffs, I don’t know the tariffs, but if these tariffs go through, because they are on the list, how does that affect your business? Hey, Laura. This is Anthony. I will start, I will take the question on international and tariff. So on international, it’s a big opportunity. Obviously, it’s 1 billion plus TVs around the world. Regarding your question of is it the other incumbents we have to displace, in general, I would say international is still wide open. There is no leader yet in international and license operating systems like Roku has not really made a lot of – has not really started focusing on international in a big way yet. So the big opportunity is wide open. Obviously, we have been super successful in the United States and our lead is growing there and we’re number one. We think that the – I believe that the technology we developed, the skills we have, our strategy applies directly to international. So we think we will be successful there. But we actually haven’t announced any countries, I think you mentioned Brazil. We haven’t mentioned anything about Brazil officially. And what I would say is that, we’re not ready to reveal our plans for international yet, it’s still a bit early. I would say that I personally am spending more time on international and so, for example, I’ll be giving a keynote on EFA later this year.
Now on tariff, tariffs are something that there is still a lot of variables around and – but I’ll try and provide some color to what we expect from tariffs. So in general tariffs might impact our future results. Depending on their exact timing scope, rate, another variable. We are of course taking steps to mitigate any potential impact of tariffs, as well as our partners are doing the same. For example, we’re looking at relocating manufacturing over time. But I think the big picture on tariff is just that regardless of what happens with tariffs in the short term, it doesn’t affect the size of our opportunity or our strategy or our execution and is still – there is still a huge opportunity in the streaming business. Hey, Laura. Perfect. Thank you. Let me hit the rev rec question. So without talking about any particular deal, there are two types of ways to recognize the revenue, if it’s in the subscription services app and it’s part of a multi-element content distribution deal then the subscription rev share there would be a net treatment. So we would just recognize the portion of that monthly fee that we get in terms of our revenue share. And that’s traditionally how we’ve done it and it’s consistent with part of the content distribution revenue recognition and that can be lumpy over time, because we don’t recognize that as it’s incurred, it’s part of the deal value and your expectations on the deal value can change quarter-to-quarter. I will contrast that by saying in general the premium subscription business, which we have within the Roku Channel, so if a SVOD service was part of that and we have 40 plus premium subscription partners within the Roku Channel then because we’re effectively the wholesaler there, then we recognize that on a gross revenue basis, say the total monthly consumer cost of that is revenue and then the COGS are what we pay back to the content owner. So that’s a gross revenue treatment versus the net revenue treatment before, both are good models in terms of driving incremental gross profit for Roku but they’re treated very differently. Super, helpful. Thank you very much. Sure. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you about advertising pricing and CPM. Every quarter you call out the improved monetization but it seems from your language that pricing seems to stay stable and I think around a couple of years ago, you mentioned that your CPM is slightly over $30. So my question is – two part is it true to infer that your CPM hasn’t changed much through this really strong advertising revenue growth, and even though you list all the data and a targeting capability improvement. So my question is why do you choose to keep it where it is and do you have pressure from your publishers because your rev share 50% back to them. And then do you think – you’re thinking about how your advertising will change with Fire TV given that they charge publishers 10% for advertising and they have – they said they will open to third party demand, at least the trade desk. So if you could tell me how you are thinking about that and what we should expect? I would really appreciate that. Thank you. Hey, Vasily. Scott here. We do continue to command premium CPMs, it’s a function of it being a great product that prudently performs better than the alternatives more so though than the top line CPM, more focused on dragging net more demand out of the TV ecosystem into OTT, by showing TV advertisers that they can buy not just using traditional currencies like Nielsen digital ad ratings but also buying on much more granular targeting characteristics, interactivity, better ways of measuring that advertising and OTT drive in store purchases, for example. So we continue to drive great pricing but we’re much more focused on the larger prize in our view, which is attracting TV ad dollars generally. With regards to your question about third party demand and activity and I’m not sure I fully filed followed the question in the Fire ecosystem. As you may know Roku for years now has been an open IIB based, standards based ecosystem. We implemented the Roku ad framework years ago, made it available to publishers, as well as to our own media sales team. There are over 40 DSPs that are connected into the Roku ecosystem. We work in our own media sales with many of the biggest DSPs in the ecosystem. We think operating an open ecosystem, a data driven ecosystem is essential to the success of OTT advertising and are highly committed to it and we think that the numbers demonstrate the attractiveness of our offering to advertisers. Alright. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. Two questions. The guidance implies strong but slowing fourth quarter platform revenue. Given that Disney did not mention Roku on their earnings, I think they listed Apple, Amazon and Google as far as initial launch partners, should we assume that there is no impact yet from Disney plus or ESPN plus on the full-year guidance. And then the second question – and this has been coming up [indiscernible] clients, it would seem logical that over time you would pay some type of revenue share to TCL? Could you talk about the puts and takes of that relationship, and for example, would you agree to pay them a rev share if they’re willing to support you more broadly on an international rollout in Europe and Latin America? Thanks. Hey Jason, it’s Steve. I’ll take the first question on the outlook. Yes, We’re really pleased with the performance of the platform business. I think Q2 was an exceptional quarter both in terms of player and platform segments exceeding the expectations. And certainly I talked about in another answer earlier about the lumpiness that can occur based on the rev rec. And that was a contributing factor to the acceleration we saw sequentially in platform revenue in Q2. So we have increased our guidance over time, but a lot of it has to do with the relative quarter-to-quarter based on the the lumpiness and the confidence we have in some of the business trends quarter to quarter. Just a reminder, we’re growing very rapidly. The market is evolving very quickly. It’s impossible to accurately predict these things at this scale, but we feel better about where the business is at versus our prior outlook. So we have raised the expectations for the back half of the year. This is Anthony. I’ll take the question on TV OEMs. So you know the Roku TV program is going well. I mean it continues to be very successful for us. One in three smart TVs sold in the US are Roku TVs. It’s great to see our OEM partners taking market share, but I would say to answer your question we bring a lot of value to our TV OEMs across a lot of dimensions. We provide a very low cost hardware platform. We have what we believe is the best software in the industry. We provide a lot of content relationships. We actually help market the products, we help retail, and there’s lots of other ways we help them as well. So we consider a good partnership with our OEMs and we’re very valuable to them. I would say in terms of the specific to the commercial deal that’s just not something that we don’t comment on commercial term. Alright. Thanks. Very helpful. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Scott, one of the things I was curious about is how much time or emphasis Roku places on things like buffering and ad completion and sort of ad product innovation from an advertiser perspective. I asked because in the OTT world you do get sort of drop off at certain points in the advertising and I’m wondering if you think the 30 second spot is still the right product for OTT or if that needs to get shorter. And how much do you think Roku is differentiated in the eyes of advertisers around how quickly ads load and how – what percentage of those are complete, some of those sort of blocking and tackling things that are starting to matter more and more to advertisers? And then I just had a follow up. Yes, it’s a huge part of our focus actually. It’s a big part of why we got into the ad business in the first place. It was not simply the revenue opportunity, but the chance to deliver a better ad product for marketers and a better ad experience for consumers. That’s about the quality ad buffering completion rates and also new formats interactivity, new sponsorship brand integration opportunities. There’s just so much opportunity in this space to create new touch points for marketers. With the new TV viewer, we are very heavily invested in not just the consumer ad experience, but all the back-end behind it. The targeting the measurement proving that OTT ads can drive true incremental lift in terms of site visitation, product purchase, retailer visitation. So it’s a huge push for us and we do think it’s a big part of our success. Great. And then – sorry, go ahead Anthony. I was just going to say that we consider the ad experience part of the Roku platform and there’s a lot of effort in the Roku platform towards things like performance and customer satisfaction. Makes sense. Just a follow-up over on a different topic, I think historically you guys have generated higher engagement and higher ARPU on active accounts that use your players versus the smart TV OS Roku powered active account. I guess is that still the case or is that gap narrowing? I’m just wondering as you’re active account mix shifts more and more towards TVs over time versus players if that has any impact on it or if its actually there is some sort of kind of mean reversion going on? This is Anthony. I’m not sure about the mean reversion. But I would say it’s more complicated than just players versus TV, there is a lot of factors to drive engagement, everything from the retailer, the devices sold through to the size of the screen to the model of the player. So those are all things that we’re monitoring and – but in general those are the things we monitor and we optimize and we use when we determine campaigns and so forth. But overall, all our devices have excellent engagement. 3.5 hours a day on average and growing. And I would say TVs no matter exactly what the specifics of the engagement are but they’re in a more strategic position to be in the players, players sales are obviously very important to us and growing nicely up 36% in terms of units in the quarter. But with the TV where the primary user experience for that TV experience, for a player we’re not on device. So we obviously sell both, but we view TVs as more strategic. Yes. Makes sense. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. A couple of quick ones if I could. I guess, first, you guys talked a little bit about just the programmatic channel in the press release. Any update you can give us on just how that breaks out these days? In terms of programmatic direct versus private marketplace versus kind of open exchange without which I assume is very small, but any color just the mix would be helpful. And then just secondly two accounting questions, coming back to the deal rev rec, when you are working with in SVOD or virtual MVPD and they raise their price or change their own economics. Can you talk about how that impacts you – are you getting a flat fee per sub. Are you getting a percentage of subscription revenue? Any color on how that changes? And then similarly on the remote buttons every time you sell a player or TV, you’ve got the remote buttons that content producers can bid for. Is that a one-time rev rec upfront when the device is sold, just trying to refresh my memory there? Thanks guys. Hey, Matt. I’ll take your question on programmatic. This is Scott. We continue to be very invested in programmatic as a sales channel. It is not the majority of sales for us today, and that’s a function of the fact that most of dollars flowing into OTT advertising today are coming out of TV budgets. But we’re here to trade with advertisers and help them by the way they want to buy, we’re big believers in programmatic and automation more generally. We’ve got a great stack to support programmatic buyers, and in particular we think our programmatic offering is uniquely situated in terms of the premium broad reach that it can deliver as well as the premium targeting, the advanced proprietary targeting available because of the data that we have as a platform. Programmatic is growing significantly faster than our already fast growing ad business. So as a sales channel, it’s an important one for us. Yes, I’ll take the deal rev rec question. So as I talked about earlier in these content distribution agreements we have multiple elements, so those could include if you’re an SVOD service a rev share on the subscribers that we sign up for. So it’s not a bounty. The standard model is the rev share that comes in over time in terms of how we make money. The accounting is a little different though, because what we do is we look at the total value of the deal, let’s say, we signed a 2-year deal, we are making estimates of how many subscribers we might sign up for that as SVOD service or virtual MVPD. If they have some requirements on spending on our audience development toolkit which could be things like buttons, it could be display, minimum guarantees on display ad spending, etc, then that goes into the mix as well if we’re getting advertising access and that can be part of it. So we value the entire deal and there is expectation around how many subs we might sign up or other factors. And so it’s not recognized upfront, it’s recognized when the value of the deal changes and when we meet certain performance obligations in the deal. So it’s not directly tied to the underlying business – business occurrence, if you will and that’s why it can be lumpy over time and can change each quarter as we revalue these assumptions for each of these major deal. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions or two topics if I can. First on audience development and the opportunity there, it seems that there are going to be a number of new over-the-top services launched over the next 12 months, which should create some incremental demand. How are you thinking about meeting that demand? Is it – assuming it does materialize. Is it a situation where you can sort of expand your inventory to meet an increased amount of demand or is it something where your inventory from kind of a display basis would be somewhat fixed and you would expect to see the value through some pricing power there. And then second, in this shareholder letter, you called out sponsorship and the growth that you’re seeing there. Can you maybe give us an example of a successful sponsorship that you saw in the quarter, and maybe a little more detail on how that building – how it’s growing some frame of reference or how big that is and can be. Thanks. It’s Scott here. With regards to your question about audience development we are excited to say the least about the coming services into OTT and believe that we are an essential platform for these new services, not just because of our scale, but because of the tools we’ve got to help these content partners build a big and vibrant audience on the Roku platform. We have a whole array of audience development ad products and capabilities starting from when you’re setting your Roku app to ads in the home screen featured placement in the channel store, email units, we recently launched a video ad unit that lets you drive a download off of a 30 second spot. And we continue to create new ad products like that to help our content partners build audience as they launch these services on the platform. We also continue to innovate in the backend technologies, machine learning technologies to better predict who is likely to subscribe to that service, which helps us not just deliver a better more efficient product to client, but being more efficient in our use of inventory and driving the results. In terms of your question about sponsorships, we’re very active in creating sponsorships throughout the Roku user experience. For example, around the Super Bowl, we had an experience with TurboTax where we showed users all the different ways that they could watch the big game. That’s just an example of a breakout experience we had sponsors in and around the national streaming day as another example. And one of the great opportunities for us as a platform where we own the home screen is that we can craft these [indiscernible] breakout experiences in partnership with the brand helping them meet their objectives in terms of the content that they want to be [indiscernible] up against and whatever their KPIs are. We just think at the end of the day for content partners and for brands that are leaning into advertising and OTT that we are an essential partner because of our scale and our data. Is there any direct response or interactivity that you provide or can provide in those sponsorship partnerships? Yes, there are lots of new ad formats that we’ve been developing and testing. For example, the ability to fire an email or an SMS off of a video ad is an example, that’s an exciting rift on a traditional ad spot, bringing interactivity to a 30 second spot. Our sponsorship experiences have similar capabilities. We view interactive as still emerging capability for TV advertisers, it’s not a capability they have traditionally had, but it’s an exciting new dimension to be able to bring to TV advertising. That’s great. Thanks a lot. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. It’s a couple of high-level questions. First on account, if you think about just $100 million so broadband only homes, which you’ll be solely closing in on close to 40% here over the next 12 months or so, I am curious, what you think about is addressable and obviously acknowledging Fire and Apple TV and sort of what that might imply in terms of the ceiling on your accounts, kind of growth. You’ve obviously had incredibly impressive growth over the last several quarters, but would be helpful your perspective there. Thanks. This is Anthony. If you think the way I think about it is over the long run every TV shipped to a broadband United States is going to be a smart TV, is going to run a smart operating system, a licensed operating system. And it will come down – and so it will come down so things like devices, player role over time, it could be some long period of time, but over time it will slowly fade away and important because you’re TV will come with a great solution. And so, what it really comes down to over time is what’s the market share. So, I think the addressable market is every TV household, every broadband TV households, and then the question is what is our market share for TVs. And I think the contenders are, we’re number one and our lead is growing. Samsung has Tizen. And then there is Amazon and Android TV. Okay, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on hours, again pretty impressive growth that you’ve seen here now closing in on roughly four hours a day. I’m curious, a lot of your user sort of pull it a much higher hourly usage rate closer to five, six or even beyond that in terms of hours of viewing daily. So, I’m just curious, what is sort of keeping that number down is and whether new ads that you’re bringing in are sort of watching, I guess the number of sub that daily rate or if they’re above that average daily that you report. Thanks. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Can we answer the last question there before we go to next? I think hours for a particular user vary a lot, right. So, for example, cord cutters, what other, TV on Roku. Roku [indiscernible], it’s going to be a lot higher than 3.5 hours a day on average. And then you have then you have on the other hand you have customers that are just watching the occasional movie, but watch most of their cable on watch most of their TV with their pay TV subscription. But the trend we see is as more Americans cut the cord and as more content comes to streaming then the amount, of hours viewed through the streaming platform grows. Yes. And specific answer to your question, Mark, older cohorts continue to grow and engagement and each new cohort coming into the ecosystem is generally coming in at a higher level of engagement in the prior cohort. And then on your third question where you asked about market share, we have a great chart in the shareholder letter this quarter that shows market share and how it changes. Okay, thanks. Thanks guys. I appreciate the color. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. I’m hoping to get a bit more color on your international expansion, I gather, you’re not seeing a whole lot about it yet. But could you help us try to understand if it’s a bit more of a push on the player side or on the platform side, i.e. integrations with other TVs. My understanding is the market share of the OEMs that you’re not in the U.S. is lower in many other countries. Therefore, it might be a bigger opportunity for you to integrate with other OEMs. So, just any color you could give us maybe on the split between player and smart TV integrations and the opportunity on the OEM side, please. This is Anthony. We really don’t have any more detail on international. We’re just not ready yet to reveal our plans for international expansion and how we expect that to work. Alright. We have to make our own assumptions then. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thank you. I had a couple of questions. The first one on the Roku Channel, can you guys talk a little bit about just kind of where you are with ad load there relative to where you think it can be over time. And then second question is, I know you don’t guide too active accounts, but any way to kind of think about active accounts in second half, especially given the press reports suggesting that you guys had a very strong Prime Day? Just wondering if there’s anything to keep in mind there? Thank you. We are pretty passionate about our low ad load on the Roku Channel. We think, it’s part of the recipe of delivering not just a better user experience with a more attentive user, but delivering a more impactful ad experience for marketers. So, we run at about eight-minute target ad load per streaming hour in the Roku Channel, and I think more so than what you’re suggesting lifting that ad load we’re much more focused on how do we deliver even better more effective ad products within that load. And I think we’ve made great progress on that. Yes. And the biggest driver is just add TV dollars moving to streaming, that’s one thing like ad load and CPM. Yes. Hi, this is Steve. Number two, we don’t provide any outlook on any of the key operating metrics. But in terms of active accounts when we passed a great milestone in the quarter in terms of we passed 30 million active accounts for the first time, ending at $30.5 million and certainly we’ve seen continued robust growth in both Roku, TVs and players, and so we’ve been very happy with the increased scale that we’ve been building over time on the active accounts. As well as on the monetization side we hit another milestone as well with ARPU getting above $20. So, both the increasing scale and increasing monetization is progressing nicely. Yes, I’ll just add, I mean our strategy is working. You can see it in the results and our strong execution Roku TVs are doing well and players are doing well. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess from maybe if we just step back for a second, Anthony, you made a comment about as cord cutting picks up people spend more time streaming and I think that I think everyone probably on this call would totally agree with that. I guess what I’m curious about is as they stream more and as all of the apps that we see that are launched already this year, but we’re also, I think a lot of people are talking about how many apps are coming from major media companies over the next year? As people spend more time streaming, do they actually spend more time using more apps or is it really like a mobile phone where you tend to years the three or four apps that dominate 80%, 90% of your behavior. How lopsided is it even if you add apps you just tend to spend more in your favorites versus actually increasing the number of different apps that you use that’s question one and then two, you have that chart on market share, which is very helpful in the Investor letter, just curious when you lose a customer, when somebody walks into a Best Buy or a Walmart and buys a Fire TV or an Apple TV. What do you attribute the number one reason why you’re losing that customer to a competitor’s device? Hi, Rick. It’s nice to hear from you, again. I would say on your app question, I think the big picture here is that we believe there is too many apps. I mean there’s thousands of apps on Roku and that’s hard for customers one of the strategies behind the Roku Channel, it’s also one of the reasons we think just in general, there is going to be some content consolidation in the industry. And so, for us our goal is to allow any publisher whether it’s a humongous content publisher or whether it’s a mid-size or a long tail to be successful on our platform. And one of the ways we’re doing that is allowing them to distribute their content to the Roku Channel where we provide a unified experience with machine learning and recommendations and so that eliminates the problems of the publishers that it’s hard to get viewership in their ad. In terms of why do we lose customers, I’m not really focused on that, I mean we’re focus mostly on getting more customers, third of a more active devices in the U.S., we’re ahead of all our competitors. We’re third more active devices and the number two player we are the number one streaming platform in the United States. So, we’re just focused on keeping our customers happy and bringing in more customers. And just to follow up on your first answer, because I think it’s really important when someone is making a trade-off. So, on the new NBC streaming app on Disney Plus, I am HBO Max and I’m going to market, the choice to just be in the App Store versus to be embedded in the Roku Channel, you obviously spoke to the benefit is there any things that the publisher is giving up or any reason why they wouldn’t want to be part of the Roku Channel versus simply being in the app store? First of all, they don’t have to decide, we allow both. It’s pretty common so ABC News, for example, is a very popular brand in the Roku Channel. They also have their own app. What we find and whether they show that they get more streaming in the Roku Channel and it’s usually incremental. I think the main reason to not do an app is it’s just difficult to build audience, its expensive, it takes an R&D, it takes a direct to consumer experience including customer acquisition, churn reduction, it requires machine learning, it just requires a lot of expertise that are that is hard to build, and so that’s why we are seeing publishers increasingly up into using just the Roku Channel. The overall economics are going to be better for that. Thank you. I’m showing no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Wood for closing remarks. Thanks. We had another very strong quarter and we are pleased with the outlook for the full year. The company is executing well, attracting outstanding talent and become stronger in fundamental ways. While we passed two big milestones in account growth and ARPU, we are still early in the far-reaching changes that will reshape how the world watches TV. Thanks again for your support and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen thank you, for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",our second quarter and first half results show the great progress we are making . we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time .

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tricia Mifsud, Vice President of Communications. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am. Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, GM of our Platform business, who will be available for Q&A.
Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.roku.com. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, November 6, 2019 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise such information. Some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include but are not limited to, statements regarding the future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 and the future growth in our business.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today's shareholder letter and the company's periodic filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on our Investor Relations website at ir.roku.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for important content. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Tricia, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. Roku is well positioned as content publishers and advertisers shift to streaming. We continue to execute well against our plans and our Q3 financial results beat our expectations. Our performance allows us to continue to reinvest in ways that extend our strategic advantages and build even greater preference for Roku among consumers, content publishers, OEMs and advertisers.
I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter. We launched our new streaming player lineup in North America, Latin America and key markets in Europe. Early reviews have been positive. For example, CNET named the Roku Streaming Stick+ the best overall streamer for a third year in a row. Our focus on TV streaming and our large, highly-engaged audience make Roku an essential partner for content publishers, advertisers and TV manufacturers. We build big audiences for major new services and brands. And when our partners succeed, we succeed. Just last Friday, Apple TV+ launched on our platform and we expect others to follow soon.
Roku monetized video ad impressions more than doubled again on a year-over-year basis. The Roku Channel contributed to this growth as ad impressions within the channel are growing faster than the ad impressions in the overall platform. We continue to be pleased with the growth of The Roku Channel.
Finally, we recently announced an agreement to acquire dataxu, a demand-side advertising platform. While we work with many leading DSPs and will continue to do so, we believe the dataxu acquisition will accelerate our OTT advertising road map and enable Roku to provide marketers a single data-driven software solution to plan, buy and optimize their ad spend across TV and OTT.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to go through the financial details. Thanks, Anthony. Before taking your questions, I'll walk through financial highlights and address our outlook. Please see our shareholder letter for more financial details from the quarter. Q3 revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our outlook, driven by robust growth in our Platform segment and continued strong demand for streaming players. Both revenue of $261 million and gross profit of $118 million grew 50% year-over-year and gross margin of 45.4% was similar to the prior quarter as well as the same quarter in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA of roughly breakeven and the net loss of $25 million were ahead of our outlook due to better-than-expected revenues and lower-than-expected sales and marketing expenses due in part to timing of retail and merchandising cost as well as headcount cost, primarily stock-based comp expenses. Strong platform growth continued as revenue of $179 million was up 79% year-over-year and Roku monetized video ad impressions once again more than doubled year-over-year. Player revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in player units, with ASPs down 9% year-over-year as we continue our strategy of attractive player pricing in order to drive unit sales and active accounts. We ended the quarter with $388 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.
Before turning to the outlook, I'll mention a new Roku OS feature that we began rolling out in Q3. This feature identifies when the channel has been continuously streamed for an extended period of time without user interaction. It prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching and closes the channel if the user doesn't respond. While we continue to expect robust growth in our aggregate streaming hours as we increase active accounts and user engagement, we believe our 2020 year-over-year streaming hour growth rates are likely to be lower than 2019 growth rates. Some of Roku's leading channel partners like Netflix have already implemented similar features and we think it is positive for Roku, our customers, partners and advertisers to have a level of consistency across our platform. We do not expect this rollout of this feature to have a material impact on our future financial performance.
With that, let's turn to our outlook for the full year. Reflecting our Q3 performance and the inclusion of dataxu for part of Q4, we are increasing our revenue and gross profit outlook for the full year 2019. Our raised revenue outlook midpoint of $1.106 billion represents roughly 49% year-over-year growth, up from 46% year-over-year growth in our prior outlook. We expect Platform revenue to represent roughly 2/3 of total revenue, including approximately $13 million in revenue from dataxu. We are raising our total gross profit outlook for 2019 to roughly $492 million at the midpoint, up from roughly $485 million previously.
For modeling purposes, we continue to expect full year Platform gross margins in the low 60s percent, driven primarily by continued mix shift to video advertising. For players, we expect Player gross margin to be in the low-single digits for 2019 and we expect Player gross margin to be roughly 0% in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 is seasonally our strongest quarter and is back-end loaded with a significant portion of our revenues related to Black Friday through the end of the year. So Q4 is still heavily dependent on how the holidays stack up, given a highly competitive retail environment.
Similar to last year, given a seasonally higher mix of Player revenues in Q4, the overall company gross margin is expected to be sequentially lower in Q4, between the upper 30s and 40%. We have updated our 2019 adjusted EBITDA outlook midpoint to $30 million from $35 million previously, reflecting continued investment in the business as well as roughly $5 million negative impact to adjusted EBITDA in Q4 related to dataxu operations and dataxu acquisition-related expenses. We plan to publish historical pro forma financials related to the dataxu acquisition prior to our next earnings call, which will provide some additional detail.
Given the relative size of dataxu in our integration plans, we do not expect to break out dataxu going forward, but rather it will be included in our Platform segment. As we have done previously, we plan to provide outlook for next year on our Q4 call.
In Q4, we anticipate a greater sequential increase in operating expenses from our continued investments in talent, sales and marketing efforts, the impact of increased facility costs, as well as the inclusion of dataxu. The stock-based comp estimate for 2019 has decreased to roughly $84 million from $90 million in the prior outlook. Depreciation and amortization and net other income of $10 million are reflected in our outlook for roughly $64 million of net income loss in 2019. I'll summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business in the quarter.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Two, if I could. Just first on the EBITDA guide. Steve, it sounds like perhaps there were some more expenses in Q4. Is there anything specific in Q4 that you'd call out for expenses? Because it looks like the guide, even with a beat and contemplating dataxu, has maybe decreased relatively to the prior outlook, first question. And second question, just on ARPU. I know that could bounce around, but it looks like it lagged account growth in the quarter. Any color you can add to that? Anything from 606 you'd call out? That would be helpful as well. Ralph, it's Steve. I'll take the first one on EBITDA. So as I mentioned in my remarks, part of the Q3 overperformance on OpEx relative to our prior expectations related to the timing of certain costs. And so similarly, Q4 reflects some lower - some expectations in Q4 related to the timing of certain costs that are shifting in Q4 as well as the expected SBC difference. In terms of the ARPU, the ARPU growth rate on a trailing 12-month basis has been growing in a similar range in the high 20s and 30%. So there's not anything in particular I would say on that. It's been on a fairly consistent ARPU year-over-year growth trajectory as of the last couple of quarters. This is Anthony. I'll just add that at the beginning of the year, we set a goal to operate the business at roughly EBITDA breakeven for the year and that we are on track for that. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. I wanted to ask a question about the expectations in terms of relative growth of ad-supported versus SVOD viewership, given that you have Disney+, you have Apple TV+. Are you not worried - or should we not be worried that they will take share of viewing on Roku and then that would impact your ability to monetize advertising inventory and that would somehow impact advertising revenue growth? How do you think about what's going to happen in the next 12 to 24 months with viewing on your platform? And what will be the puts and takes between the SVODs and AVOD apps? Sure. This is Anthony. Overall, we're excited about the launch of all the new services coming to the industry and to our platform. We think that they are good for Roku in a bunch of ways. They are obviously going to drive viewing overall on our platform or engagement, which is good. We can discuss why, but engagement on our platform is very good for us. They're going to increase the interest in viewership moving from traditional TV to streaming. We think that eventually, all TV is going to be streamed and that this will be a - the rise of all these new services will help encourage that transition.
So we have customers that want to watch paid premium services. We have customers that want to watch free content. We have customers that want to watch both. And so we think all those business models are supported on our platform. We monetize all those business models. We see advertising as growing the fastest, but they're all generally good for our business. So I don't know, Scott, if you have anything you want to add? Yes. I'd just like to add to Anthony's comment that we think our biggest competition is attracting linear TV ad spending out of linear into OTT. That's the competition. Today, according to Magna, only 3% of TV budgets are spent in OTT, but 29% of audiences are already there. That's the big opportunity. That's what we're focused on over the next 12 to 24 months. And there could be lots of winners on our platform, including these new services. So in other words, you think that the conglomerates that are behind those AVOD apps, they would be pushing advertisers to shift budgets and that's how you will benefit in the long term? I do think that in the aggregate, yes. The more attention and energy that's put into OTT advertising, the better for everybody. I think Roku especially is uniquely situated to serve TV advertisers as they move their budgets to OTT because we can prove incremental reach. We've got the tools to prove the measurement and effectiveness of that spending. We've got a first-party relationship with our consumers. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Two. So first, can you say if the guidance assumes any impact from Disney+, Apple+ in the fourth quarter? And then there's just been a lot of - still part of this question. A lot of questions just around the accounting treatment, particularly kind of in ASC 606, because Disney, for example, becomes a very large customer over a period of time, kind of how that flows into the numbers on a quarterly basis? So any help or commentary there I think would be helpful. And then can you just say what the impact - what you are assuming the impact of dataxu is on gross profit in the fourth quarter? Yes. Jason, this is Steve. I'll take those. In terms of guidance, our outlook does anticipate Apple+ has obviously just launched. And we anticipate other services to launch soon. So they are included. You noted the accounting 606 impact. I think, a reminder that the - in 606, these multiple element arrangements are valued for the totality of the arrangement, which could be a couple of years. And there's different elements and different performance obligations. And so there isn't necessarily a direct 1:1 and immediate revenue recognition when these services launch or when we sign up people. It's more complicated than that and the timing can be lumpy as we've talked about in different calls.
In terms of the impact of dataxu, we mentioned that the inclusion includes roughly $13 million of revenue for a subperiod in Q4 based on the anticipated close date here soon, as well as a $5 million negative impact to the EBITDA. We'll be publishing some pro forma financials related to the dataxu acquisition between now and the next call and so you will have more detail on the shape of the P&L there. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Great, and thank you, Jason, for asking my accounting question. And I think, Anthony, you're on track to actually earn $40 million of EBITDA this year, but forget that. So I want to go back to dataxu, Anthony. So I'm interested, are you going into competition with Trade Desk? Are we pivoting the business a little bit so that dataxu isn't going to be captive to Roku and instead we're going to be a demand-side platform and compete in the open Internet? I am very interested in how you see dataxu progressing over the next 3 to 5 years. Let's start with that one and then I'll do my follow-up. Okay. Sure. So we haven't closed the deal with dataxu yet or begun the integration. But with that sort of disclaimer aside, it's a very strategic acquisition for Roku. It's in line with our strategy of how we expect the market to play out over the next several years. Today, our ads that we sell are mostly sold direct. But we think the ad buying is going to become more automated over time and this acquisition's primary goal is to accelerate our road map for our ad tech. I will let Scott talk a little bit more about that. Laura, I'll make a couple of points here. First is this is a natural progression of our strategy more generally, to provide advertisers with better planning and buying tools. Our goal ultimately is to present a holistic TV and OTT planning and buying solution for TV advertisers and help support them as they migrate their spending out of traditional linear TV into OTT.
Our real goal in this deal is to both expand the business we do with current clients, give them new data and measurement products, prove more efficacy across a broader portion of their media. And it also helps us work with a broader spectrum of clients who may want to participate more in OTT than they can today and would value, programmatic, API, self-serve type access to OTT.
We are combining the unique advantages of Roku's first-party consumer relationship, our scale, our proprietary data and inventory, together with some great talent, device graph technology, data science capabilities from dataxu. And we do think that will present some unique opportunities to our buyers. But I do want to emphasize that being an open ecosystem is essential to how we operate here. It's both good for the ecosystem and good business. And so we don't anticipate any slowing down of the work that we do with folks like Adobe, the Trade Desk, et cetera. Okay. That's super helpful, Scott. Let's go to your gross margins. So your gross margins were a little light this quarter and also next quarter, they're a little light. I just want to make - there's a couple of good reasons that gross margins might be down. The Roku Channel has 50% margin, anything you guys are probably doing on the subscription revenue side, which is diversified revenue sources, lower gross margin. Tell me what's going on with the gross margin line, please? Why is that under pressure? Yes. Laura, it's Steve. Yes, in terms of the gross margins, in our prior outlook, and we mentioned it for Q4, that the Platform margins would be in the low 60% range. So it actually was in that same range that we assumed it would be. The primary driver is - and we talked about this phenomena, is the continued mix shift over to the video ad business, which tends to operate at a 50-plus-percent gross margin versus some of the other components within Platform that are significantly higher margin because there's little cost in our UI of some of these things like sponsorships or rev shares. Okay. Good. And Scott, I guess Roku Channel continues to - is it any higher in the ranking than fifth? It continues to be fifth in terms of reach and growing much faster than the platform as a whole. It's also growing as a contributor of ad inventory into our overall sale. We just launched Kids & Family this quarter, that was a great new addendum to our overall content offering. And our goal here is to keep feeding this virtuous cycle of bringing more users in, that enables us to invest more in a broader array of content which then, of course, brings yet more users in. And we are executing on that strategy very well and it's an exciting growth story. Scott, this ARPU of 30% is like blowing everybody else away in TV. So you guys are doing great work on the CPM side. So congratulations, guys. Thanks. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Just staying on the dataxu topic, can you guys give us a sense for how fast that business is growing and whether you expect the integration of the asset into Roku to accelerate that growth rate? And I'll just ask my follow-up on the international side. Anthony, you noted that you've announced some new partnerships heading into the U.K. Can you just help us think about sort of the international opportunity in the context of what you guys have been doing in the U.S.? Is the business model broadly the same? What - how quickly might you start monetizing? I know you have to build audience scale. Just any help on thinking about that ramp would be great. Ben, it's Steve. I'll take the first one on dataxu. As Anthony mentioned, the deal hasn't quite closed yet and we haven't started the integration. So in terms of kind of overall aspects on integration and growth rate, we'll talk more about that in the next call, where we'll also be providing overall 2020 guidance. And then as I mentioned before, we will be publishing pro forma financials, so you will have a lot more information soon regarding the historical growth rates of dataxu. Fair enough, thought I'd try. Yes. This is Anthony. I mean just to add to that, I mean the primary reason that we acquired dataxu was for the talent and the technology to accelerate our technology road map. So that's how it's really - I mean we already have a very strong ad platform, but this makes it even stronger. In terms of international, there's obviously a lot of potential in international, 1 billion TV households around the world. It's a greenfield with a lot of potential. These big new services that are coming into the market, like Disney+ and Apple and already Netflix, are - have global ambitions, so - and we are making progress. Now we said in the past that the first thing we're going to focus on international is building our scale and then monetization will follow, the same trend that we saw in the U.S., in building out the U.S. market.
In terms of building out active accounts, we announced that the Roku TVs with Hisense coming to the U.K. and we just launched in last quarter, our new lineup of streaming players. The first time - this was the first time that we launched our Roku Express with a global launch in multiple countries around the world at the same time. So we are - so that's an example of how we're getting more serious about expanding our reach with - in the international markets. Our next question comes from Elliot Alper with D.A. Davidson. I wanted to ask if you guys have any more plans on launching more apps outside of The Roku Channel? This doesn't mean content like The Roku Channel, but maybe interactive apps or platforms on your platform that could drive more traffic and ad inventory. This is Anthony. So the way we think about The Roku Channel is - the way I think about the Roku platform overall is its primary purpose is to distribute content to viewers. And there are multiple ways - if you're a content publisher, there are multiple ways to distribute that content. One way is to write a streaming channel, and companies are still doing that, obviously. Another way is - that's becoming increasingly popular is to publish your content in The Roku Channel. And so we're continuing to add more and more content to The Roku Channel and more and more content categories. So for example, we just added Kids & Family, which was a great launch for us.
The Roku Channel, we continue to expand in multiple dimensions. There is, at this point, over 80,000 free and paid movies and TV shows. We've added live linear services like ABC News. There's over 40 live linear services now. Premium subscriptions we added recently, so over 40 million - 40 different premium subscriptions now, like HBO and SHOWTIME. Nearly 30 Kids & Family content partners. So we think that you'll - well, not we think, you will see more and more content coming to The Roku Channel, different categories and you will see it integrated into different points in the UI. And so that's really our approach for - in terms of being a one-stop distribution channel. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Let me try two, please. First, just on the - I think it was Ben who was asking about the way to think about the duration or the timing related to international and I guess revenue contribution or profit contribution from international, do you want to set out any - help us with any expectations there? And then just back to the streaming launches. And I want to ask the question this way, if you think about the revenue you get from Disney+ and Apple+ and everybody else who's launching, it seems like a slew of them, do think that's going to be showing up in your - for you more as customer acquisition ad revenue, subscription ad revenue shares or advertising revenue share? Like of those three buckets, where do you think the impact to you from these streaming wars is going to be most likely seen? So I'll take international. I think Scott will take your second question. We don't really have much more to talk about in terms of our plans for international than we've already disclosed. Obviously, we have a lot of work going on under the covers. But we haven't announced any specific timing related to revenue for international. On these new service launches, Mark, Disney+, Apple, et cetera, we're excited. For us, this is ultimately about giving consumers even more options in OTT and we're partnering very deeply with these companies to help launch their services, acquire subs, drive engagement. And I won't comment on the economics of any specific partner except to say that our relationships are multifaceted. We're mutually incented to drive the success of these services through the Roku ecosystem. And then one follow-up question for Anthony. Anthony, do think it's possible that this could lead to a scenario whereby you can actually start seeing material revenue shares from Netflix if the environment becomes a lot more competitive, which it's clearly doing, that may increase their incentive to actually start sharing economics with you? Any thought on that? Well, we have business terms with them, with all of our partners. But I don't want to comment about any specific deal or any specific partner. I will say that one of the benefits of, at least in our platform, for these content partners that are launching, these new services that they're launching, is that we have built into the platform a lot of tools for them to be able to promote their services and sign up subscribers. And so - and they're taking advantage of those tools, right? So it's kind of like when you go into retail, you pay a percentage of your revenue to the retailer for placement on the shelf, and then there's a lot of other options that they have, do you want to be in the circular, do you want to buy endcaps. And so for us, with the subscription service, it's the same model. There's a rev share for customers that we sign up and that is going to continue to grow. But there is also a lot of marketing opportunities and ways for them to build their subscribers and they're very effective, more effective than probably any other way they spend their marketing dollars. And so that's the big way that we make money for new content partners. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. I want to come back to - and maybe this is for Steve. If we think about the fourth quarter, obviously we've got a lot of new services coming, you can certainly see how they would contribute to content distribution revenue, certainly audience development revenue makes a ton of sense. But you can also see because they are kind of shiny new objects, they could pull some engagement away from other channels, including The Roku Channel, so you can actually see some headwind to video ad revenues. My question is, is that something that is kind of contemplated in the forecast? And then secondly, given the ASC 606 accounting, would we even see that? Would that even matter in the short term? Any color there would be helpful. Yes. Matthew, this is Steve. So yes, as I mentioned before, I mean because of 606 and because these are multiple element arrangements and there are performance obligations, there is not an immediate - necessarily an immediate and direct correlation between sort of the underlying actions like signing up subscribers or spend from these services into that quarter's revenue. So it's more complicated on that and that's why we often talk about as a result of these 606 models and the treatment, that the associated content distribution revenue can be lumpy. And so I would just make sure that people are aware of that fact because there are some big new services that are launching or will launch soon, but that won't necessarily connect into this quarter's revenue.
We have factored those into the outlook. We - the outlook is strong. We did increase the outlook for the full year for revenue and gross profit. The revenue at the midpoint is now $1.1 billion, that's 49% revenue growth at the midpoint. And so we feel pretty good about the business. But certainly, we want to make sure that people understand the accounting that underpins these services and the deals that we have. This is Anthony. Let me just add a couple of points. These new services as well as existing services that have come onto the platform over the years, they're in no way negative for Roku. They're all just very positive. We're an essential partner for these services. They'll drive more people to adopting streaming, we're the country's most popular streaming platform, that will drive Roku viewers. There's lots of room to grow engagement on the platform. And our primary competitor is not other services on the platform. The primary competitor is linear TV. Most TV in the country is still regular linear TV and people are moving to streaming and cutting the cord and this will help drive that. So they're all very - for our business, they are all very, very positive. Maybe I'll just ask 1 quick follow-up, if I could. Ad load on The Roku Channel, number one, I guess, just any changes there? And just kind of what you are observing maybe other AVOD services across the platform? Are you seeing any trend, stable, up and any color you could provide there? Matthew, Scott here. Our goal with The Roku Channel and its ad load has not changed. We still believe it's - that about half of the linear TV ad load is the right recipe for monetization and consumer experience. In general, we think that's going to be proven to be the case broadly across OTT, that ads have got to get smarter and fewer in order to hit that balance right. But every provider on the platform has a different mix of program to ad time. Our next question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. It's Ryan on for Shyam. So first, how do you feel about your ad tech after the dataxu deal? And do you think it might make some sense to add some further technology on the supply side? And then secondly, how do you see the acquisition impacting dataxu's Fire TV partnership? Ryan, Scott here. I'll take that. dataxu is a natural progression, a natural step in the road map we've been pursuing. We have already started to provide planning and buying tools to advertisers to help them proactively plan their spending across TV and OTT. We launched Roku reach insights going into the upfronts to help advertisers basically simulate plan their spending across TV and OTT in order to optimize for reach and frequency. We wrote a partnership with Innovid this quarter to help measure reach and frequency and audience across multiple video platforms. And so we look at dataxu as another important step in that progression that will help us not only activate our data and aid buyers in allocating their spend more aggressively to OTT, but also prove the effect through better data science and attribution, which we think ultimately is a long-term goal for - as TV advertising dollars move into OTT.
And I won't comment on the Amazon Fire TV partnership, except to say that dataxu is an omnichannel DSP. And our focus with it - with the dataxu assets and the people and the capabilities is really to enable our advertisers to spend smartly in OTT and to better measure the effect in terms of reach, in terms of ROI as they move TV ad spending into OTT. Our next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Maybe just a follow-up on dataxu. I'm curious how it will work alongside your network sales team. So if we think about sort of nondirect business, will this run - will you have sort of a media take rate through the standard DSP model and sort of run that through the agencies at a sort of media take rate on sort of lower-end - longer-tail type inventory? That's on dataxu.
And then maybe just a follow-up on gross margin. As you look at 4Q and potentially into 2020, I'm just curious if there's any changes in the pieces there? Obviously, the pieces are content distribution, audience development and video. Maybe specific to content distribution, are you seeing The Roku Channel, that content distribution business ramp faster, which is potentially putting a little bit downward pressure on gross margin? Just maybe some puts and takes there. Mark, I'll take your question on dataxu. You are right, that dataxu is ultimately a SaaS or platform or tools play. And so it is a different model generally than a media sale. The power we think though, is we're already in a position where we're something of a category captain with our advertisers, advising them not just on their spending with Roku for Roku media, but on Roku more broadly with our publishers and across OTT generally. And so dataxu is a new tool in our toolbox that will help us help advertisers to better plan and spend their money in OTT. Steve, do you want to take the gross margin...? Yes. Sure. Mark, it's Steve. Just in terms of the GP, so in terms of 2020, we'll be providing guidance on that in the next call. But we did mention for Q4, we expect Platform gross profit to be in a similar range of the low 60s sequentially. And then we talked about the guidance around Player gross profit operating around 0 for Q4, just given the promotional environment, which is similar to prior years, where that's been kind of the lowest quarter usually.
But in general, the biggest thing to think about in terms of the gross margin trend has just been - within Platform has been the increased mix of the video ad business. As the video ad business continues to grow fast, that tends to be at that 50-plus-percent gross margin level versus some of the higher ones as I mentioned earlier.
And then within TRC, as Scott mentioned earlier, TRC in terms of a source of Roku monetized video ad impressions, is growing faster than the network as a whole. But really, the margin difference is more around video ads versus other parts of Platform versus a specific TRC, non-TRC mix. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ziv Israel with Merrill Lynch. So maybe first on gross margins. How much of the year-over-year decrease in Platform margin is due to higher mix of premium subscriptions, if at all? And then you mentioned investments driving some of the change to your adjusted EBITDA guide. What areas are the investment in? Any color there would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. Ziv, it's Steve. Just on your first question with gross margins. We didn't - we have mentioned previously that the premium subscription business, because that has a - that is on a gross revenue stream and that's good for revenue and gross profit dollars but it does show up as a lower margin. In terms of this quarter, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the primary driver of the sequential gross margin change was around the mix shift in the video ad business. So that's the key driver there.
In terms of investing in the adjusted EBITDA, as Anthony mentioned earlier, we had a goal that we set out at the start of the year that we're going to operate around EBITDA breakeven, just given our strategic position and that it's early days with a big opportunity. The four investment areas we talked about are around the ad business, Roku TV, The Roku Channel and then international. And in terms of Q4 specifically, it's really in the form of more talent, sales and marketing as well as some of the other options that we have to kind of secure our position going forward. Yes. This is Anthony. Let me just add in terms of investment, I'll give you some examples of products and services that we shipped in Q3 that were invest - that we weren't talking about necessarily before but were investments that we've made prior to Q3. So for example, we launched Roku TVs in the U.K. with Hisense in the quarter. We did our first global launch of players around the world. We refreshed our entire player lineup. We launched Kids & Family, a new content category in The Roku Channel. We launched Smart Soundbar as a new product category, a new way for us to build active accounts. And we did a lot more than that. So we are pushing our business forward on multiple fronts and these are all areas that are going to pay off in the future. Okay. That's helpful. Just quickly on dataxu. As you grow in programmatic and it becomes a bigger percent of sales, how do you see that impacting maybe the overall profitability of the Platform segment? Do you expect higher or lower CPM in programmatic versus a more direct relationship type of business? Well, we look at it primarily as a vehicle to continue bringing significant new demand into the ecosystem from TV. I think that's the main and first cut of the strategy behind dataxu. We do anticipate that programmatic as well as other forms of automation, API-based buying, self-serve will become a growing part of OTT. It is still a minority of total spend. Magna Global has commented that there'll be about $5 billion in OTT spending in 2020. Majority of that will not yet be programmatic, but over time, we see that growing very significantly.
We also look at these technologies as a way to onboard a broader class of advertisers who would have invested in TV but for difficulty in accessing it or the inability to prove ROI. That's really the power here for us. So I wouldn't characterize dataxu in terms of pressure on margins or pricing as much as a broader array of clients and an acceleration of spending into OTT. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. A couple from me. Can you share how streaming hours that you guys are able to monetize with advertising, how those hours are pacing relative to that growth in overall hours streamed? Is it growing faster or more slowly? Can you share how much of your available inventory that you have access to that you're delivering at a premium CPM? You talked about this gap between sort of dollars in the industry and streaming in the industry overall. Does that look a lot like how much you monetize relative to what you have access to?
And then on the international side, you guys just mentioned the global player launch and refresh again. Were there any new markets there? Or were there expanded sort of retail partnerships, more inventory? Anything you can help us with specifically on how that moves you forward, based on those comments you made, Anthony? Michael, I'll take your first two questions. First, I'd described it as a funnel. Ad supported viewing is growing faster than underlying than the total platform viewing. And then our monetization of advertising on the platform is growing faster than that. So we are growing, in some sense, our share of - or our participation in advertising on the platform significantly.
As we've commented before in prior earnings calls, we generally would not characterize the business as supply-constrained as much as demand-constrained. We're in the process of bringing over significant new demand from TV advertising. And so we view our task as primarily driving that demand function. We have, in the case of The Roku Channel as well as our ad-supported channel distribution agreement, access to sufficient inventory to support that very aggressive growth. Anthony, you want to take the question on international? Yes. I'd also just add, monetized video ad impressions more than doubled in the quarter. The ad business is doing really well and - yet most of that TV ad dollars has not started to move over to streaming yet. So it's still a big opportunity for us. In terms of international, I think we covered most of the points there. I mean we launched our new streaming player lineup in the United States, obviously, but also Canada, Mexico, Latin America, the U.K. and a few other countries as well.
So I guess I would say the main way we think about our international expansion is not about adding more countries, because we are already in most of those countries. It's about bringing more focus and more dedicated resources to international, being more competitive international, accelerating the active account acquisition in the international market. That's really what we're focused on. So does that mean hiring people on the ground in those markets? Or what kind of resources are you speaking of? Yes. That involves hiring more people in market, that involves writing more partnership deals, that involves more manufacturers that are focused on specific regions, that involve content partners for specific - in region, it involves more engineering and talent inside Roku focused on international. We think our strategy that's worked for us in the U.S. with just TV players works internationally as well. And the technology we've built also works internationally. We just need to take the formula and apply it more aggressively to international markets and that's what we're starting to do. Is the runway for players outside the U.S. longer, like early in the life cycle than operating systems in the TVs - Roku-branded TVs? I think both players and TVs are great opportunities for international for us. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for any further remarks. Thanks. We had another good quarter and we are pleased with our outlook for the full year. Roku is getting stronger in fundamental ways. We are executing well. Our streaming devices continue to stand apart and we are attracting impressive content publishers and advertisers to drive our Platform segment. The world is transitioning to streaming faster than ever and we are well-positioned to capture the benefits. We look forward to the holiday season and sharing more with you in the New Year. Thank you and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, SVP and GM of our Platform business, who will be available for Q&A.
Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.roku.com. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 13, 2020 only, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise such information.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Tricia. And thanks, everyone for joining today's call. In Q4, we exceeded our outlook for revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA. Moreover, 2019 was a tremendous year, both for the streaming industry and for Roku. Our revenue tops $1.1 billion and our customer stream roughly 40 billion hours. In only two years, we've doubled our topline and increased streaming hours by 170%.
Streaming has come a long way in the last decade. 10 years ago, Netflix was about all I could stream on my TV and in fairly low resolution. But recently, I enjoy streaming the Super Bowl in brilliant 4k via Fox Sports on my quantum Roku TV with my Roku wireless speakers and subwoofer. In fact, streaming is often the easiest and sometimes the only way for people to watch in 4k.
Most TV is still delivered the old fashioned way, streaming still has a long way to go and the streaming decade lies before us. I couldn't be more excited about the innovation we have planned for our TV software, our advertising platform, the Roku channel and international expansion.
I will now turn the call over to Steve, to discuss the financial details and our outlook. Thanks Anthony. Our strong fourth quarter performance, which exceeded our outlook, capped off another great year. We executed well and delivered record results.
Before taking your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and address outlook. We saw a strong demand for our players and TVs in the fourth quarter, which resulted in the incremental 9.8 million active accounts for the year. And we ended 2019 with 36.9 million active accounts. Our scale has expanded rapidly over the last several years. We added just under 6 million active accounts in 2017, nearly 8 million more in 2018, and almost 10 million more in 2019.
In addition to increasing our scale, we continue to see growing engagement on our platform, with 2019 streaming hours up 16.3 billion year-over-year, to a record 40 billion hours. In Q4, the streaming hour growth rate moderated somewhat versus Q4 of 2018, due in part to the timing of Black Friday, only in a week later in 2019, and the partial roll out of the ""Are you still watching"" feature, which prompts users to confirm they are still watching after a period of inactivity.
Leading channel partners like Netflix, have already implemented similar features that we think create a level of consistency and establish a best practice across our platform. As of early Q1, we have completed rolling out this feature to our entire installed base and estimate that it will moderate our streaming hour year-over-year growth by approximately 10 to 15 percentage points in 2020. We do not expect the rollout of this feature to have a material impact on our financial performance.
Please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter and fiscal year. But I'll highlight a few items and provide our Q1 and full year 2020 outlook. Q4 total revenue, exceeded our outlook increasing 49% year-over-year to $411.2 million with the platform segment revenue up 71% year-over-year, to a record $259.6 million, and represented 63% of total revenue. Player segment revenue growth of 22% year-over-year, again came in ahead of expectations, driven by strong player sales with units up 33% year-over-year. A highly effective holiday promotion strategy led to a 10% decrease in ASP.
Our key financial performance metric is gross profit, which exceeded our outlook and was up 44% year-over-year in Q4, to a record $161.6 million. Gross margin was 39.3%, reflecting solid platform margins consistent with the prior quarter, partially offset by our decision to run the player business at roughly zero gross margin.
Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million exceeded our outlook. Q4 OpEx was $179 million, up 68% year-over-year, as we continue to invest to extend our strategic advantages. Excluding approximately $13 million of dataxu related OpEx and deal cost, OpEx would have grown roughly 56% year-over-year. To-date, we're making good progress on our integration of dataxu's operations with Roku's ad business, and its Q4 performance was consistent with expectations.
As we mentioned on the last call, given the relative size of dataxu, and our integration plans, we do not expect to breakout dataxu going forward, and rather it will be included as part of our platform segment. We ended the quarter with $517.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, which included net proceeds of $151 million from the sale of class A common stock in an at-the-market offering transaction during the quarter. Net proceeds of $100 million from drawing on our term loan as part of our credit facility, and reflecting the use of $68 million in net cash as part of the funding for the dataxu acquisition.
With that, let's turn to our outlook for the full year 2020, which calls for $1.6 billion in revenues at the midpoint, up 42% year-over-year, and $730 million of gross profit at the midpoint, up 47% year-over-year. The mix of revenue will continue to move towards the faster growing platform segment, which we anticipate will generate roughly three quarters of total revenues.
For modeling purposes, you should plan for full year platform gross margin in the high 50s to 60% as a percentage of revenue, driven by continued mix shift to video advertising, inclusion of dataxu and growth of premium subscriptions. For players, you should expect us to manage full year gross margin to roughly zero. We remind you that we are not optimizing for player gross profit, given our focus on device sales as an important driver of account growth. We believe that our strategy of trading player margin for account growth in platform revenue growth is working well.
Given our strong position within the shift towards streaming, our goal for 2020 is to continue to invest our incremental gross profit back into our strategic growth opportunities, and to manage the business to roughly breakeven on a full year adjusted EBITDA basis. For modeling purposes, please note that 2020 adjusted EBITDA excludes stock based compensation a roughly $135 million, and an estimated $35 million of depreciation and amortization and net other income.
Implied in our 2020 outlook, is roughly $905 million of GAAP operating expenses and while our revenue and gross profit can be quite seasonal. Our OpEx is not particularly seasonal, but instead, is better looked at on a sequential growth basis, due to headcount and facility related expenses, traditionally accounting for roughly three quarters of total OpEx.
Approximately 60% of our anticipated increases in operating expenses in 2020 are related to the full year impact of the 32% organic headcount growth in 2019, increased facility costs primarily related to our new headquarters and the inclusion of dataxu operating expenses. In addition, we also plan to hire new employees at a similar organic rate to 2019.
Turning to our Q1 outlook, we remind you that Q1 is our seasonally softest quarter from a revenue perspective, with revenue that is roughly 25% lower sequentially than our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our Q1 outlook calls for a similar seasonality with the midpoint of total revenues of $305 million, up 48% year-over-year, with platform accounting for roughly three quarters of the mix.
Gross profit of roughly $145 million at the midpoint, is expected to be more than offset by higher operating expenses, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA loss of roughly $20 million. In Q1, we expect player gross margins to be in the mid to high single digits, reflecting a traditionally lighter promotional period within the retail calendar.
Please note that our outlook does not include any material impacts resulting from the current novel coronavirus outbreak. We are closely monitoring this outbreak and today to have only experienced minor impacts, but there is potential for more significant manufacturing and supply chain disruptions if the outbreak becomes more severe, which may hamper our and our partners abilities to replenish inventory after a strong holiday season.
I'll summarize by saying how pleased we are with the trajectory of the business and I would like to share a little perspective on our historical and anticipated revenue growth. Our 2020 revenue outlook of $1.6 billion at the midpoint represents roughly two times 2018 revenue, three times 2017 revenue, four times 2016 revenue, and five times 2015 revenue. The sustained level of robust revenue growth speaks to the fundamentals of our business, the difficulty of replicating our strategic advantages and market leading position and our laser focus and leadership in streaming.
In addition, we are encouraged by the significant opportunities ahead, as we are only just beginning the streaming decade.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Elliot Alper with D.A. Davidson. Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit on duplicate ads and how it pertains to Roku? And how ACR technology is allowing you to do that? And secondly, have you spoken on the number of active accounts that are equipped with ACR? Hi, Elliot. This is Scott Rosenberg. Can you just repeat the question around ACR, please? Yes. Mainly on duplicate ads and kind of how it pertains to Roku and how the ACR technology is maybe allowing you to do that. And also kind of if you've ever spoken on the number of active accounts that are equipped with ACR? Thanks. Okay, got you. So just for background, ACR is a fingerprinting technology. It helps us to determine what programs and ads a user is being exposed to. It's broadly deployed in our televisions. It's a very important component in our ad business. And it's central to how we help advertisers figure out the incremental reach delivered on the Roku ad platform. That's one of the core value propositions of an advertiser investing in OTT is knowledge that they're reaching users who are no longer reachable in linear television.
So we use the ACR information together with OTT ad exposure to produce a deduplicated view of who an advertiser is reached. Does that answer your question, Elliot? Yes, thanks. And then also, you spoke more about the shareholder letter about adding more content onto the Roku channel in 2020. Could you expand or add any more color on that? Would be helpful? Thanks. Sure. The Roku channel had an amazing 2019, we reached to active accounts with - about 56 million viewers, Parks Associates called it a top three ad supported service in the U.S. It's growing significantly faster than our already fast growing platform. We added 40 premium services, 55 linear channels, kids and family. This is just a demonstration of the growth of content available to consumers in the Roku channel. Every quarter, we've had new announcements in that regard. And it's led the Roku channel to be one of the largest channels on the platform and to deliver great reach for our advertisers.
It's also a place where we can deploy new ad capability sponsorships and other types of brand integrations. Those types of integrations are exciting for brands because they go beyond the 15 to 30 seconds spot and create a new way for them to reach viewers in this new streaming experience. This is Anthony. I'll just add that the Roku channel is an example of an area where we're investing in and it's a strategy that's working really well for us. It's driving a lot of engagement. The content you asked about in the Roku channel, obviously that we've been improving that and that gets, a deeper library and more breadth every quarter. But, a big part of our focus is improving the capabilities of the Roku channel, making it more integrated with our platform, things like machine learning. And so, there are many ways we can drive viewership as well as content in that particular application. Great, I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Thank you. I have a clarification and a question. In the shareholder letter, you say that advertisers can use your capabilities to buy ads from publishers directly. Can you clarify what that means? Does it mean that you sell third-party apps inventory using dataxu DSP? And if so, what is the economics of this relationship? Sure, thanks for the question, Vasily. The Roku has built a leading ad platform on the core value proposition of our scale, our first party consumer relationships, our data our measurement or targeting capabilities. And the dataxu acquisition really helped to accelerate our ability to provide those same capabilities to an advertiser as they buy media more broadly across the Roku platform and off the platform. It is a DSP, a demand side platform. So, it's ultimately a tool set to help brands plan and buy advertising programmatically across the platform. And while they will buy Roku media through our DSP, they will also buy third party media. That's what we meant by the comments in the shareholder letter. And do you get a commission for that or you don't participate at all in that? No. We definitely participated, I mean it's part of the core business that we as an artifact of adding data and transactional capabilities of machine learning and optimization to help an advertiser optimize to outcomes, those are all things that we earn from as an advertiser uses our tools. But one of my favorite anecdotes of an early execution was with the direct to consumer brand called ThirdLove, it's a women's underwear company.
And just as an example, they're now using our DSP to both by media on Roku and then follow-up with exposures on desktop and mobile. And they showed a 319% improvement in conversion rates by doing that one two punch. That's just an example of the kinds of executions that we're able to offer advertisers with this new capability. Well, great. So the follow up - sorry. I was just going to say that the dataxu acquisition was a big milestone for us and it is going well. We started integrating the team. The teams are actually mostly integrated. And we're starting to see some early success. It's obviously, shows that we believe that the TV advertising world will eventually move to data driven self-serve programmatic tools like traditional web and mobile industries. So the follow-up to this is then, while since you bought dataxu, Amazon publisher services, has been actively onboarding Fire TV apps on its private marketplace to sell their inventory. So, it seems like that a completely different new competitive dynamic emerged in the past several months here. So, would it be correct to say that it's more that is competition to the service you just described? And if so, what gives you confidence about your positioning in this situation and the ability to win budgets and hopefully grow share going forward with ATS competing against for budgets, most probably? Sure. Amazon of course, is both a partner and a competitor. The thing I'd remind you of is our main competition here is inertia is the traditional TV spending pattern. We offer a platform that scale with a logged in user, proprietary data, and broad reach across the platform. These are all the hallmarks of leading ad platforms and what we think positions us uniquely to help marketers reach Roku users on their Roku devices as well as off the platform and the example I just gave you with ThirdLove. So, we think we're uniquely positioned to compete aggressively in this space. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Hey, there, can you guys hear me okay? Yes, we can hear you. Okay, great. Great numbers, you guys. So, I got a couple. Steve, the most important one is you. 606, when you sell a Disney, if you signed up in the hypothetically Disney Plus sub, do you have to owe Disney the five bucks but then accrue on this cash flow statement, the deferred revenue because you can't recognize it. And is that why we're seeing these big swings in deferred revenue? And please just remind us every single line item, not only income statement, where a Disney Plus sign up happens, please? Hey, Laura, thanks for really not the sixth question, I appreciate that. Well, not talking about any specific terms in any one deal. In general, our content distribution agreements are multiple element arrangements. Certainly, for us, by the services our traditional structure is a rev share, but there's often other components of that be it minimum guarantees or promotions that we might give. As a result, the material agreements under 606 come under the multiple element arrangement accounting.
So, it really just depends in terms of the different elements, the value that we've described for these elements, and then the performance obligations that are basically put against these revenue streams. And so, that can lead to some lumpiness within the life of the deal where we're valuing the entire agreement and placing value on that. And so it's not necessarily immediately and 100% correlated with the underlying cash or business stream to your point so.
So, it can be lumpy over time, and certainly with some of these new services that can lead to a bit of a disconnect between the underlying driver and how it shows up on the P&L or the balance sheet. Okay. So, can you give us the line items that it mostly affects? Well, again, it depends on the deal, but certainly there can be on the P&L, a revenue or a COGS impact, hence a gross profit impact from content distribution agreements. And then there can be an impact on the deferred side on the balance sheet. Again, it probably depends on the deal. On the deal, okay, just wanted to make sure. And then Anthony, one of the things you've told us in the past is that, I'm interested in an update to A, number of TVs sold in Q4 that were Roku TVs, and B, number of people that you reach that linear TV does not reach any longer, if you have those two numbers? Yes. Well, Roku TV obviously is a great program for us, hugely successful. We've seen consistent growth there in terms of driving our active accounts. For the full year, last year, just under one in three smart TVs sold in the United States where were Roku TVs, making Roku TV the number one streaming TV brands in the United States. And that was up from the prior year, it was one in four smart TVs sold. So, it's going well, it's been a great business for us. Hey, Laura, let me take your question about reach. So, we've mentioned in prior calls, about half our user base doesn't have a pay TV package in their home. So, by definition, they're not reachable through linear television. The other half tend to be very light, linear TV viewers.
So, on the whole across dozens and dozens of campaigns, really 100s, we've been able to show advertisers that the vast majority of the users that they reach when they buy advertising from Roku, have not actually been reached through linear, there's very little duplication between the executions. Okay. And that is super helpful. And that's up a lot from a year ago. So thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Okay, thanks. Two questions. Platform gross margins have been trending down and you gave guidance for this next year but platform gross margins were flattish Q3 to Q4 any particular reason why they weren't down. And then secondly, International; is international contributing at all materially so far to any of the metric streamed hours, active accounts of those two in particular? And if not, do you want to layout any benchmarks in your guidance for this next year? Is there some sort of fudge number in there for international or early guess number when is it become material especially those metrics? Thanks a lot. Hey Mark, this is Steve, I can hit those and we can get some color from the other gentlemen if they want. Platform gross margins you referenced, the outlook there which is for a high 50% to around 60% in the quarter. Q4 it was very similar on the platform gross margin side to last quarter in the low 60%. A lot of it has to do with just the relative mix of the video advertising business. And so it was similar between Q3 and Q4.
And we've got to the outlook for 2020 assumes that, because of video advertising business is the biggest opportunity and it's been fast growing that the mix of that continues to shift. 2020 is also factored in the premium subscription business which is on a gross revenue treatment, hence, the lower gross margin is great for revenue dollars and gross profit dollars, look, because of gross treatments, it shows up to the lower gross margin. We assume that that will continue to grow. And then also include the dataxu business, which historically has been a mix of net in gross treatment. So, that's what on the margins. Those are some of the contributing factors.
In terms of international, we haven't broken out the metrics. The vast majority of the active account base is still in the U.S., although international is growing. And we are continuing to expand our presence in existing international markets. We mentioned that our share of TVs continues to increase and it's now one in four, TVs in Canada, which is great progress there. Mexico, we're going from two TV brands to nine, we just signed up recently seven. So, there's a lot of progress on international and as we go, we'll have more announcements. And I do think at some point we’ll be breaking that out, although probably not for a bit. Okay. Thank you, Steve. Thanks, Mark. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shyam Patel with Susquehanna. Thanks. It's Ryan on for Shyam. So first, I was wondering if you could talk about how we should think about OEM deal economics and how those might evolve over the next few years. And then secondly, can you just talk about your progress on the dataxu integration so far, kind of where are you in that roadmap? And how long will it be until you get to where you'd like to be? Thanks. This is Anthony. I'll take the question on OEMs and then Scott will probably answer the question on dataxu. So, I assume you're talking about TV OEMs, like where we license our TV operating system to TV manufacturers. Obviously, as we discussed, it's been a great program for us, it's doing extremely well, as well as the progress we've made in market share and active accounts, we believe we’re the best partner for TV manufacturers. We have a lot of advantages of purpose built operating system for television that brings them a lower cost structure, lower returns, automatic software updates and it's a brand that consumers love.
In terms of, what attracts OEMs to the Roku program, I mean, the number one, the primary reason that the Roku TV program is so successful - obviously, it's the number one streaming TV brand in the United States. And the primary reason it's successful is that it's very valuable to our partners, for the reasons I discussed. It brings them a lot of benefits in terms of technology, customers, retailers, managing the content and the software updates and consumers and retailers are asking for it. So that's the main reason that we see partners attracted to the Roku TV program. Ryan, I'll take your question on dataxu. We're about 90 days in post-close. The integration is going great. It's a testament I think, to the clarity of vision we had in acquiring them and integrating them into our plans and accelerating our ad tech roadmap, as well as the strength of the team. So, we've already released a number of features, enhancements. For example, the ability to use Roku data, I wrote that in the info. And there's a whole very compelling roadmap of things that we're doing together as part of the new combined roadmap.
The teams, as Anthony mentioned, have already been fully integrated into Roku. And we're in market, although, it's still early, and the core proposition I mentioned earlier of having Roku's data, measurement targeting capabilities natively available in a planning and buying platform is really resonating with our clients. So far so good, and we're executing well on that integration. This is Anthony. I'll just add that, I'm super excited about the dataxu acquisition, it's going extremely well. I think it's shaping up to be one of our best investments yet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I could. First just going back to the question on OEM kind of economics, Steve, remind me, I think you guys typically recognize some licensing revenue from a TV OEM partner. And then, I think there was also probably some co-marketing and you've got a retail channel support that would flow back through, I think the retail, the marketing line, if I'm not mistaken. I think the net output was kind of like a zero.
So I'm just curious if you think that that will change as we go forward here from having been may become a neutral economic to maybe by the shift towards the TV OEM or towards you guys, any color there. And then just secondly, the 2020 guidance, just curious what that assumes for A, political spend for the year any lift there. And then also some of the new services that are coming online whether it's HBO Max or Peacock or obviously, Disney Plus going international, just any color on what you're thinking there in the 20 guide? Thanks guys. I'll start. This is Anthony with just some more color on the OS licensing business. And I'll let Scott or Steve take the rest of the questions. The business deals obviously vary by OEM and we're not really going to get into the details of the deal. It is true that the biggest reason that they come to us or that we strike the partnership is that they bring a lot of value, a lot of non-direct monetary value to their business.
We help them gain market share. Roku OEMs are generally gaining market share. We help them with retail placement, we do have a retail merchandising budget that we spend to promote Roku TV with retailers and they benefit from that. And then of course, all the other reasons I mentioned, we also have for example, very strong reference designs for hardware, we take a lot of the engineering load, there's just a lot of benefits.
And I think the result of all these benefits and just generally in the industry is that we expect all smart TVs to end up licensing in OS, it's just a much better economic model for the TV business. This is Steve. Just in terms of 2020 guidance, I mean, certainly, factors like anticipated new service launches and the upcoming elections are factored into the outlook. We do sell some political ads, it's not a major focus for us. And so, really the opportunity there is largely around bringing more traditional TV ad spend over as they need our viewership. And certainly, the new services are good for Roku in general, the more content we get on the platform, the more it attracts people to streaming on Roku in particular and drives engagement, so that that's all good and reflected in the numbers that we put out today. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Thank you. Scott, I was curious if the shorter holiday period last quarter had any impact on fourth quarter advertising? And secondly, just to go back to the Roku channel content discussion earlier. How do you guys think about sort of the pitch to publishers moving their content, out of their apps into the Roku channel, and the opportunity that offers them versus maybe their own desire to keep the consumer in the app.
There's been a lot of press coverage recently about your relationships with your publishers and that's come up. So, I'm just curious about maybe you can shed a little bit of light on how you think about that and what the sort of pitches to publishing partners on bringing content over into the Roku channel for monetization? Okay. Hi, Ben. So on your first question about the Thanksgiving, basically coming a week later than it typically has, we didn't see that as a major factor in our ad business in Q4. With regards to the Roku channel, we had a great year. The best way to think about the Roku channel is it's ultimately another tool to help content owners succeed in streaming. It's got a best in class user experience, machine learning driven recommendations, best in class marketing and monetization capabilities.
And our view is it can play an essential role in helping content owners reach yet more audience and monetize more effectively. It's not an either or proposition to having a channel on our platform. But it does represent a large incremental opportunity to purely having a standalone there. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nolan with Macquarie. Hi, thanks. I would like to come back on the topic of international if I could, please. Is there anything you could tell us about whether it's more player devices or whether it's more TV, OEM integrations that are leading the way in your early phases you move into more international sales? And then how long does it take to establish an installed base, so that you can then build and monetize an ad business or are you already doing some good work, monetizing that on the advertising side?
And lastly, and relatedly, again on international, can we assume that a good chunk of the investment that you laid out in 2020 will be for international expansion or have you already taken care of a lot of that cost in 2019? Thanks. This is Anthony. I'll take the first question on players versus TVs. Generally, we believe that the strategies that have worked for us in the United States to become the number one streaming OS will work for us, and are working for us internationally as well. And so obviously the two big components of that are players and TV. So they're both tools that we will use internationally.
And the order and the specifics are country dependent. So, we recently launched TVs and Roku TVs in Brazil, we don't yet have players in Brazil. So, I think that's probably the first market where we led with TVs. We've added more TV partners in Mexico, which is a very fast growing market for us. We mentioned that Canada, we have a market share of one in four. So, I think just generally you're going to see us use both tools in our international expansion. Hey, Tim. This is Steve. Just on your last question about the investment, certainly, international was an investment area in 2019 along with Roku TV, Roku channel and the ad business. And those investments have been working well, and we're continuing to invest in them in 2020.
Certainly, we've made great progress internationally. Anthony described some of the milestones we hit. But international is the big opportunity for us and there's certainly more countries and more parts of the Roku ecosystem that we can bring to bear. I think, Canada might be a good one to just talk about the different phasing rights. We want to gain scale in the market, we want to drive engagement, and then we can start to monetize. And in Canada, we've gained good scale, with most notably that one in four smart TVs sold stats, this represents great progress on that market share size.
But in addition, we've launched the Roku channel in that market. We are starting to ramp up the ad sales post component of that. And TRC is already top five by reaching Canada. So you can start to see that a model of scale engagement and monetization is going. Canada is a bit farther ahead of some of the other ones. But I think it's a good proof point about that the model can work. Great info. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Thanks. Two questions. So, you talked about the Canada Smart TV market. So, just think about when you first entered Canada and what competitive landscape look like, Samsung versus Android, supported TVs versus others? And obviously, you said where it is today and how successful you've been, do you think that's representative of what UK, Brazil and Mexico look like today?
And kind of that was the point for the example. And then the second question, just to dig a little bit deeper into publisher deals. Maybe, just talk about how you think about AVOD versus SVOD and Roku's role in monetization. And so, for SVOD it's reasonably straightforward with respect to revenue share for signups and retention, obviously, differs by publisher but I think we all get it.
For free AVOD services, are you drawing a red line in the sand that requires economics for every channel perhaps maybe, YouTube being the early, early exemption? So just any color, specifically on how we should think about monetizing third-party, AVOD services besides the Roku channel? Thank you. This is Anthony, I'll take the international question. I would say that every country is quite different. So, in terms of like, where they are on their streaming curves, what are the factors that go into making us successful, we really do customize it by country. So for example, I think, Canada was a bit more mature when it comes to streaming then say, Brazil is, but Brazil, on the other hand, still has a lot of streaming. The dynamics of the type of streaming are also different.
So, I think our strategy is, if we have one is to customize the approach by country and figure out the right instead of local partners to be successful in that country. And that's working for us. Jason, with regards to your question about publisher deals. First, I'll say that, our philosophy is the same across both AVOD and SVOD, which is that, we're an essential platform we can play a key role in helping streaming services exceeding our platform. And as we help them create value, we look to participate to share in that upside. So philosophically, that's our goal is to first help them succeed and second, participate in the upside.
In the subscription services model, its rev share and marketing relationship, and in the AVOD model, its participation in the ad business that publisher runs. It is an important part of our relationship with publishers that we participate in those economics. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Sakai with Singular Research. Hi, everyone. I had a question on Mexico. I wanted to see, if Mexico your fastest growing country right now? Yes. Hey Chris, it's Steve. We haven't broken out that it certainly, we have been growing fast in Mexico and many other markets. And certainly, the player business has done well. Historically, we launched the TV business for the couple of OEMs. And we've had great reception there. And we've signed up seven new TV brands for this year or so. And certainly, the engagement on the platform is growing nicely. So, it's in the last year or so, Mexico has been a very strong growth market for us. This is Anthony, I was just going to say that in terms of Mexico the birth rate that we experienced last year is the fastest rate of growth in Mexico since we launched there. Okay. And you mentioned that you have nine 9TV brands with Roku in Mexico. Are you guys going to cap it at some point, or are you going to keep adding and adding? Yes. We said that we've added seven brands last year in Mexico to bring the total to nine. We don't have a hard cap, it just depends on a lot of factors and it's not just a number. I mean, we're obviously proud that we have nine different brands selling Roku TV in Mexico and the Mexican market is growing well for us. But, there's a lot of factors including retailers retail demand, these market shares, OEM. So, there's a lot of different factors that drive the number of brands we do deals with. Okay. Thanks for that. Sure Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Gould with Loop Capital. Thanks for taking the question. Three questions, please. First, Scott, a few years ago, advertisers were buying you I think more in their experimental pool. So a few years later how that relationship changed? Are you getting into an upfront buying cycle with the advertisers? And the agencies, is there any change on the CPMs, et cetera?
Second for Anthony, I was interesting that you hit off with talking about watching the Super Bowl on Fox, there was a little issue with you and Fox, right before the Super Bowl. Is that a one off or should we expect more of those similar to how we see happening with the cable operators in cable networks?
And lastly for Steve, I know you came back to breakout dataxu, but can you give us some color as to what portion of the growth, some sense of how much of the growth rate in the going forward in the model and the outlook is due to adding dataxu into the platform revenue? Thank you. Alan, I'll take your first question. We're years past the mode of advertisers buying us in an experimental fashion. We've got annual up fronts with all the major agency holding companies. Most brands that are buying with us are in multiple years of renewal with us. Often an advertiser will come to us and their first goal in working with us is simple, it's incremental reach. Its reaching people are no longer available in linear television. And then they get to see the outcomes, the measurement, the advanced capabilities of OTT and they expand their business with us. That's the general flow of our relationships with advertisers.
I should also mention as well, that we're significantly diversifying the client base with the acquisition of dataxu and new capabilities, we felt we're making great inroads in performance direct to consumer brand, advertising, mid-market, local advertising. Basically, anybody who invests in TV and then brands who historically have been digital only but now can participate in TV advertising, because it's a digital medium are buying from us; so very significant progress on our ad business. This is Anthony. You asked about the relationship with partners and content partners. I guess I would say that, we've invested a lot in building our platform, aggregating a large audience, developing the tools that partners can use to reach that audience, sell them subscriptions, sign them up, reduce churn. So, we've built a lot of capabilities into our platform and our business model and our philosophy is to help our partners or streaming content partners, build their streaming business, reach this large audience, help make them make their business very successful.
And then, when we do that, when they succeed, we succeed. We participate in some of that upside that we help to create. In terms of deals, I mean, we renew thousands of deals a year and generally we're able to reach mutually agreeable terms. It's not a zero sum game, like comparing contrast it to the traditional distribution deal on Roku versus say, a traditional pay TV deal. And the pay TV world, there was a fixed size bill, consumer would spend let's say $1,000 a year a bundle. And then there would be a fight between the distributor and the networks over how to split that bill.
In the case of streaming, it's a new business for everyone. It's just a different dynamic. The dynamic is we're trying to help build businesses and we're trying to succeed when our partners succeed. So, it's just a different business, it's not a zero sum game at all.
You mentioned Fox, I mean, we have a long-term relationship with Fox. I'm happy that we recently dealt with Fox. It was a deal that was good for both parties and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them. Like I said in my introductory remarks, I enjoyed streaming the Super Bowl in 4k on Fox Sports on my Roku TV. Hey, this is Steve. Just on your question around dataxu, as you mentioned, due to the integration plans Scott was talking about there is already largely been integrated into various Roku departments in the relatively small size. We will not be breaking that out. We published historical performance with dataxu, so you can see their standalone growth trajectory which was basically fairly flat and running at a bit of an EBITDA loss. But we think integrated into the offering that there's a lot of synergies overtime. And so, those expectations are encompassed within the outlook we've provided. Okay, thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. I'll start with the first one, which is Disney Plus added 26 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about how that impacted your business financially and how it might impact you going forward? Hey, Michael it's Steve. Certainly, as new services come on that's good overall for Roku in terms of driving folks to the platform and increasing engagement. And certainly, our business models are set up so that when partners create value on our platform, and we're well positioned to bring them a large audience and best in class tools that that they can create value and we can share in that. As I mentioned in Laura's question, certainly these are multiple element arrangements. And so that there can be some lumpiness on there. But in general, the new services are good for us. But, nothing specific in terms of Disney in the quarter, whether it was being able to participate in those signups, whether it was their advertising on your platform, anything like that representative step up. Yes. Again, we don't talk about specific commercial terms. But certainly, we sign up subscribers for Disney. And there was dollars in the quarter and dollars in the outlook related to new services like Disney Plus or Apple or others. This is Anthony, I'll just add, hats off to Disney for reaching 26.5 million subscribers in three months. That was incredible. I think, an important sign that the streaming decade has really started. And, they have great content, effective marketing. But, one of the things Disney did, is they really lean into the tools that we have available on our platform. And when companies do that, I mean, we've built a lot of great ways to sign up subscribers. So, I think we were an important part of them reaching that milestone. Great, thanks for that. They did it in six weeks, actually. It's maybe more. Even more impressive. And my second question is about Flex from Comcast. They talked about having a good success with that product and leaning into it more going forward. What's your view of the competitive dynamic there, especially, given that they can deliver that with their broadband subscriptions? How do you compete with that if it's being delivered sort of for free with a broadband subscription? Our customers love the Roku experience. It's sticky, they like the content selection we have, they like the fact that we're built into their TVs often. We just don't see competing with traditional cable distributors, it's a big part of our competitive dynamic. But, I think, I would say that, there's a lot of reasons people love their Roku and price is one of them. We offer a great price but there's a lot of other reasons as well. We also have the Xfinity app on Roku. And I have it on my Roku, and that's what I use to watch TV sometimes. Would you also expect them to conversely have the Peacock app on Roku? We're an essential partner for any streaming services trying to build a national audience in United States. So, I think it would be natural to assume that there will be some sort of deal down there. But I don't think, we've announced anything. We haven't announced anything yet. Great, thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ziv Israel with Bank of America. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. So, following the introduction of Disney Plus and Apple Plus, have you seen any users shifting away from watching free content, even temporarily? And maybe more broadly, is it still true to say that AVOD is going faster than SVOD despite new asset services coming to market? Ziv, I'll take that question. So generally, these new services are additive that they create yet more reasons for consumers to cut or save the cord and spend more time streaming. And we've seen that for years now across lots of new service launches, and I would say that's the case here as well.
It's stealing time from linear from traditional TV viewing rather than from streaming. And yes, it is still true that AVOD is growing faster than other segments, 70% of Roku users watch AVOD on the platform. And so, the prospect of free, that value proposition is very powerful with consumers. Great, thanks. Sorry, this is Steve. Streaming hours were over 40 billion hours last year. So it was an incredible year and ARPU increased over $5. A lot of that was driven by advertising. Yes, that's great. And then for Steve, so you mentioned the video ads should continue to grow with percent of platform revenues in 2020. So, how do you balance that with the growing opportunity for content distribution revenues, given new SVOD services recently launch and new ones that are already announced? Yes. So, we have a strong outlook and certainly, we said that platform overall, the mix was continuing to move forward that given that’s faster growing. And so, it was about two thirds of overall revenue in '19 and we think that'll be about three quarter.
I think it's an opportunity. There's a big opportunity on both sides of the equation, right. Certainly the move to streaming in terms of the account growth, we signed up almost our net increase of almost 10 million active accounts in 2019, and we still have ways to go in the U.S. and then certainly International. And I think both are important components of the value proposition of streaming.
So, I don't think it's a zero sum game in terms of that AVOD or SVOD need to steal from one or another. What we see on the platform is that the per user engagement continues to pick up overtime. We're a little over half of the - if you believe the estimate of about seven hours of household viewing per day, our streaming hours per account is I think, roughly 3.6 hours per day and that's been moving up overtime. And so, I think it's a matter of the pace that both of them are moving up as opposed to one has to take from the other. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Hi, thanks. I know it's still early and you're clearly not going to break dataxu out, but you do sound very pleased with it. I wondered if there were other parts of the ad tech stack that you might look to add in the futures, and I'm specifically interested in commentary around data management platform or supply side platforms. Sure. I'm not going to comment generally - this is Scott - on forward looking product capabilities. I will note we have our own DMP. We built it a long time ago and it's pretty powerful asset for us in terms of understanding our users, applying machine learning to recommendations and ad targeting.
We continue to innovate broadly in our ad strategy. For several years now we've helped the advertisers understand their incremental reach they can achieve when they buy ads on Roku. For example, with Arby's as an example, we are able to guarantee incremental reach. So that's an example of taking the next step and delivering an even richer ad product to a partner.
We also are innovating a lot in the sponsorships area. The video ad business remains the backbone, the core of our ad sale but the opportunity to cozy up against cool content is very attractive and brings deep involvement with the brand. So, Jaguar and Discovery, for example, sponsored the red carpet preshow with People TV and we've done dozens of sponsorship executions in the quarter.
So we continue to innovate not just new placements within the home screen, but also new interactive formats around video ads themselves as well. Great. And I feel like I'm probably taking this sixth crack at international. But, could you talk about any R&D engineering hurdles that you still need to clear so you can get broad European launch? Thank you. This is Anthony. So, in terms of engineering, I mean, generally speaking, the software capabilities we've built over the last several years are generally applicable to international markets as well as U.S. markets. I mean, there is some region-by-region specific engineering work we often have to do and as necessary, we're doing that.
So, in terms of Europe, specifically, I mean, there's a few things. There's GDPR, but in general, we take our privacy with our customers very seriously. We're happy to implement the kinds of features that GDPR requires us to implement. It has a lot of overlap, but the California privacy law, for example. So again, those kinds of features are generally globally applicable. So, yes, I think that there's a lot of leverage in the engineering that we've built in our product. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And our final question will come from Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt. Excellent. Hi, guys, just a couple questions on audience development and also positive ad mix. I think, I've been seeing a lot more Netflix 50 plus sort of email marketing. I'm wondering if that's a trend line that will continue with other platforms. And then on the sponsorship ad mix side, can you give some direction in terms of what that mix looks like relative to video and sort of the premium level of CPM there relative to the core video as well. Thanks. Sure. This is Scott. Audience development remains a core and significant part of our ad vertical. It’s a key way that we partner with content providers on our platform to drive awareness of their channels and their content. And if you use the device, you'll see us messaging to you every day, in the in the home screen through ads on the right rail of our home screen for example, the placements in the channel store. If you're a new user we're talking to you about these services buttons. There's all kinds of placements throughout the Roku lifecycle where we're helping partners drive discovery of the platform, I mean, all of these new services.
With regards to sponsorship executions, we just have a whole myriad of ways in which we place brands next to cool content. I mentioned the Oscars, Red Carpet execution. We do executions like limited commercial interruption, movies where you'll just get an ad, one ad in a break. We'll do content unlocks.
We showed an example in the in the earnings letter and with Energizer sponsoring a discounted movie on Fandango. And we're constantly innovating new ways to put brands creatively in front of users. The brands love it, consumers love it because they get great value out of it. It is a minority part of the ad business, but it is also growing very quickly. And it's a central way that we get advertisers to invest in OTT advertising. Thanks, Scott. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on audience development, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether there's an acceleration there. And perhaps as it relates to more marketing around more competitive marketing, if you will, kind of speaking to that Netflix, Disney Plus scenario there, are you seeing as you get more larger platforms on board that they may be using you given your scale at you know 35 million as a critical competitive tool on specific shows, et cetera? Thanks. Absolutely. Audience development is the central way in which we partner with content providers to help them succeed. And the most sophisticated partners are the ones that are really taking advantage of it. This is not your linear tune-in form of old linear channel marketing. We've got data that helps us predict who's likely to be the next CBS our access to next Disney Plus the next Apple viewer. And we deploy those capabilities in partnership with content providers to help them do better, faster customer acquisition and retention. It's an essential tool for content providers to build big streaming services. Got it. Thanks so much. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions from the phone lines at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any further remarks. Thanks. In summary, I would say we had a strong fourth quarter and increased active accounts by 4.65 million, our largest increase to-date. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion revenue milestones and streamed 40 billion hours for the first time. The company is executing well, attracting outstanding talent and becoming stronger in fundamental ways. Roku is well positioned as the industry enters the streaming decade.
Thank you again for your support and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded.
Now it’s my pleasure to turn the call to Tricia Mifsud, Vice President of Communications. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Roku’s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. I’m joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku’s Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, SVP and GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A.
Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.roku.com. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management’s views as of today, March 7, 2020 only and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise such information.
Some of the statements made on today’s call are forward-looking and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include but are not limited to, statements regarding the future performance of Roku, including expected financial results for the second quarter and full year 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry business and financial results and the future growth in our business and our industry.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons. Please refer to today’s shareholder letter and the company’s periodic filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures discussed today in our shareholder letter, which is posted on our Investor Relations website at ir.roku.com. And I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for important content.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Now I’d like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you for joining today’s call. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a tremendous amount of pain, disruption and uncertainty around the world. We recognized that the pandemic’s effect on Roku’s business is a top question for this earnings call and so we have focused our shareholder letter on that topic.
Let me summarize what I believe are the main impacts on Roku and streaming in general. The pandemic is accelerating the shift to streaming by both viewers and the industry. People are spending more time at home and so TV viewing is increasing. Viewers are selecting streaming because of its excellent content and value. Increased unemployment and a likely recession are making value more important than ever. These factors have driven dramatic increases in our new account growth rate since the pandemic took hold.
In the short-term, the pandemic is slowing the growth of Roku’s video advertising business. While advertisers are spending less, reduced budgets mean marketers are looking for ways to invest more effectively and this should accelerate the shift to streaming ad bytes. Our large content distribution business continues to perform well and is seeing a surge in SVOD trials and increased TVOD activity. We believe that the pandemic is accelerating secular trend source streaming and that these changes will be permanent.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Steve. Thanks Anthony. In Q1, 2020 we exceeded our outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and continue to make significant operational and financial progress while also responding to the initial impacts of COVID-19. Before taking your questions, I’ll walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our approach to outlook given the current level of uncertainty.
We added 2.9 million incremental active accounts in Q1, ending the quarter with 39.8 million active accounts and subsequently passed the 40 million active account mark in April. Sales of player units continue to be robust up 25% year-over-year while average selling price decreased 7% year-over-year. Roku user streamed 13.2 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 49% year-over-year.
We completed the rollout of the Are You Still Watching feature in late January, which prompts users to confirm they’re still watching after a period of inactivity. We estimate that the rollout of this feature add roughly a 7 to 8 percentage point negative impact on the year-over-year streaming hour growth rate in Q1 and we expect a slightly higher percentage point impact on year-over-year growth in subsequent quarters in 2020, given the rollout of this feature is now complete.
Platform modernization continued to increase with ARPU to $24.35 on a trailing 12-month basis up 28% year-over-year. Please see our shareholder letter for full financial details from the quarter. But I’ll highlight a few items. Total Q1 revenue exceeded our outlook increasing 55% year-over-year to $320.8 million reflecting the fastest Q1 revenue growth rate in over five years. Platform segment revenue was up 73% year-over-year to $232.6 million and represented 73% of total revenue. Player revenue growth of 22% year-over-year again came in ahead of expectations driven by strong player sales especially in mid-to-late March as stay at home orders started to take effect.
Gross profit grew 40% year-over-year in Q1 to $141.1 million resulting in a gross margin of 44%. Platform gross margin of 56% was somewhat lower than expected due in part to COVID-19 related adverse impacts on video ad sales and higher margin sponsorships in audience development spending as well as higher than anticipated mix of gross revenues from our DSP ad platform.
Player gross margin of 12% was higher than expected due to less promotions owing impart to tight inventory and some fast selling products during the quarter, due to COVID-19 related spike change disruptions as well as lower return rates. Player gross margins were higher despite increased air freight costs as we thought to rebuild inventory levels. We anticipate higher air freight cost in the short-term. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of negative $16.3 million exceeded our outlook due to slower than expected OpEx growth resulting from hiring slowing down in March. Q1 OpEx was $196 million up 76% year-over-year. As a reminder Q1 was the first full quarter including the impact of acquiring dataXu operations in personnel. Q1 also includes approximately $3.4 million in intangible amortization related to the dataXu acquisition roughly two-thirds of which is included in platform COGS and one-third in sales and marketing OpEx.
Roku ended Q1 with $590 million of cash, cash equivalence, restricted cash and short-term investments. This includes a $70 million draw down in March from our revolving credit facility, which we believe was a prudent move in light of current financial market conditions. Given the significant level of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we previously withdrew our full year 2020 outlook and are not providing revised outlook ranges at this time. Instead we would like to highlight some data points we’re seeing so far in Q2 as well as provide some thoughts on how these short-term trends may manifest to sell into longer term shifts in the TV landscape.
Acceleration in new accounts and viewership have continued in April. Active accounts grew roughly 38% year-over-year driven by an increase in new accounts of more than 70% year-over-year. Streaming hours grew approximately 80% year-over-year in April driven by an increase in streaming hours per account of roughly 30%. Platform monetization has seen a range of impacts since mid-March. We have seen an uptick in SVOD trials and subscriptions as well as increase in TVOD purchases as studios have brought new releases concurrently to streaming in light at stay at home orders.
On the other hand, our advertising business has seen cancellations as some marketing budgets have declined. But this has been partially offset by new marketing budgets moving to Roku from traditional TV given cancellation of high profile, live sporting and entertainment events. As more curious followed viewers and increasingly seek targeted, measurable forms of advertising. Ad cancellation levels were most pronounced in late March and have since decreased in early to mid-April. We anticipate that our ad business will continue to grow substantially on a year-over-year basis albeit at a slower pace and lower gross profit than we originally expected for the year.
We believe the behavioral changes by TV Ad buyers are likely positive for us in the longer term and that with more time spent at home in many households curtailing spending in light of economic hardships, cord cutting and the shift to streaming will continue to accelerate. We remain committed to our strategic investment areas and to extending our competitive advantages.
At the end of Q1 however, we took steps to slow the rate of growth of our operating expenses and capital expenditures, so progress maybe slower. Depending on the impacts of COVID-19 we’re likely to run at an adjusted EBITDA loss for the full year of 2020. Given that much of our operating expenses are headcount and facilities related and therefore are generally committed in the short-term.
We will continue to monitor conditions and the trajectory of the business and adjust accordingly. While Q1 was another strong quarter, I’m most impressed that how well our Roku employees have been adapting for the rapid and significant changes occurring in our industry and the world at large. Roku has always been a company of problem solvers who have a bias toward action. These characteristics will be immensely helpful as we all navigate the current uncertainty.
With that, let’s turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and our first question is Laura Martin with Needham. Can you hear me, okay? Yes, we can hear you. Great numbers. A couple of things. Cash from ops was almost all $46 million in the quarter almost all offset by a PP&E. Can you just remind us what the purchase of purchase and equipment was in the quarter? That’s one for Steve. Then you say in both the letter and you just said it, that you think your advertising is going to have lower gross margins and I couldn’t figure out what’s driving the margins lower? And then my third is, I see that you’re still continuing to sell one out of three TVs in the US and one out of four in Canada, which is awesome. Does this help your negotiating leverage with like TCL and these other TVs who had been sort of trying to get you guys to rev share? Do they need you more now post-COVID? Thank you so much. Laura, this is Steve. I’ll take that first one. The PP&E, the expenditures on that are largely related to the headquarters build out. We’ve been scheduled to complete the next phase of our build out here in Q2 so that’s largely related to that. Okay. Steve, you want to take Laura’s second question? Yes, sure. Well on the second one. We actually said that relative to original expectations that the ad business would substantially grow, but be at lower expectations in terms of revenues and gross profit. We actually said gross profit, not gross margin which is related to the fact that the revenue growth will be slower than originally anticipated. We didn’t give a directional call on the actual margin itself. Got you. Okay. And then the strong TVs negotiating leverage with your TV makers? Yes, this is Anthony. Roku TV that program is doing really well. In general we’re seeing very strong demand for Roku products, new accounts are up over 70% in the last few weeks which is tremendous growth both players and TVs are doing really strong. In general, the Roku TV program brings a lot of benefits to our partners both retailers and OEMs. Everything from strong consumer demand, low returns, great software, we manage the software updates, we help with bringing in the factories, we do all the engineering, we do retail promotions. I mean there’s lots of benefits that it brings. And there’s a lot of reasons why OEMs love the program. We think there’s still room. We have a share of over one in three smart TV sold in the US are Roku TVs these days and I still think there’s room to grow that. Thanks for all the post-COVID read-through’s Anthony. Super helpful to have your opinions on a lot of those big issues post-COVID. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. It’s also in the letter and in the prepared remarks about budgets moving from linear to Roku. I’m sure you’re not going to quantify how much moved over. But can you just give us relative sense, in the growth rate either sequentially or year-over-year that moved over? And then perhaps more important perspective on the stickiness of these ad dollars post-COVID particularly anticipation of why sports eventually coming back at some point?
And then just a follow-up clarifying question for Steve. You talked about obviously through mid-March and late March that improved them all to add supported models cancellation. But I believe you talked about seeing decreased ad cancellations in April. Can you just maybe provide some more color, are you start to seeing your advertisers come back and if so, some of the video advertising coming back and any color you could add there will be great? Thank you. Ralph, Scott here. Let me take that in parts. First, I’ll just say that the overall ad market places down and Roku is not immune to that. That said, we’re much better positioned than linear television just to couple stats. Primetime linear consumption is down 18% year-over-year from mid-March to late April, for adults under the age of 35 half of their TV time over the last month has been done on OTT in streaming instead of linear. Meanwhile streaming in Roku is up 80% in April.
Right there in microcosm [ph] you can see a significant shift in consumer habits. What we’re observing here and we believe is happening is that major disruptions are going to accelerate the change that was already on the way here between liner and OTT. A disruption of the order that we’re seeing here we believe is going to force marketers to reassess their assumptions about how to invest in linear and to not overlook, the caveats in the growing relative audience of OTT relative to linear. I think we’ll see this disruption play out in the upfronts for example which are already being significantly disrupted.
The best analogy that I’d offer for what we think will play out here between linear and OTT is what happened to the print business in the early 200s. Print has been ceding audience significantly to digital media 2000 through 2008. But it took the 2008, 2009 recession to really reset the investment levels in print. It has been sustained through 2008 and coming out of that recession. The investment levels never really came back to prior levels in print. I think that we’ll something similar to that play out with linear, where certainly linear television will remain a major medium. Spending will come back, but it’s likely in our view not to come back in the way that it had been and certainly, but even - you mentioned sports, but even in the case of sports we think that this disruption will force the reassessment broadly by marketers. Great and then and just Steve on the comments or anybody want to answer around anything that you saw capping back in terms of ads spend in April? Why don’t I take that question as well, we did see, sorry I missed that part of your question. We did see an uptick in cancellations and pipeline slowdown in mid-March since then in April we’ve seen it stabilize. We had a great Q1, our monetize video ad impressions would have doubled, came close but for COVID and while the rest of the years uncertain, we still expect substantial growth in the ad business through the year. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Ziv Israel with Bank of America. So first another question on gross margin. Can you quantify how much of the impact is due to mix shift between video ad-driven subscription, content distribution [ph] versus the impact of just lower gross margins for the video ad business. And then how should we think about gross margin in Q2 and potentially after advertising budgets normalize? Ziv, its Steve. Yes what we said was in Q1 on the platform side it was lower than anticipated there. Couple factors, one was COVID-related cancellations and weakness hit a combination of our advertising businesses including the ad sales business which generally operates around 50% plus gross margin. Profile as well as higher margin sponsorships and audience development and that’s why there is a bit of a headwind on the margin. We also had greater than anticipated mix of gross revenue versus net revenue within the dataXu DSP, so as a reminder that does not impact gross profit dollars from the DSP. But rather the revenue profile as well as the margin. So those were the biggest pieces. You made comments about the video ad sales margin being down. It actually was in line with expectations or slightly ahead of expectations for Q1 so that was not a contributing factor for Q1. Okay that’s helpful and then on active accounts. You obviously have seen pretty strong active account growth and you’re talking about even stronger like the growth continuing in April. I’m just wondering with active accounts at 40 million. I’m hearing that view that it’s approaching kind of saturation in the US. How far do you think you can keep on growing active accounts in the US? And in order to free [ph] you previously also talked about sharing some additional metrics on your international growth, the COVID-19 kind of impact your decision there and sharing any additional information. Thanks. This is Anthony. I’ll take the growth potential in US. I mean there’s a lot of room for Roku to grow both domestically and internationally. There’s probably a billion households around the world that have broadband and they’re all going to switch to streaming. So I mean if you just look at the recent numbers. I mean definitely being accelerated by COVID. But over 70% new account rate growth year-over-year is very strong. So I do think there’s room to continue growing active accounts. I don’t think we’re - reach saturation. Ziv, this is Steve. I’ll take the second part. We did mention that we thought at some point it would make sense to break out the international results and provide a little more color on that. But that likely was sometime in the future. We remain committed to international as well as our other strategic investment areas although the timing on such plans may get impacted depending countries specific conditions as the COVID pandemic and the resulting economic issues roll forward. But as we said previously that disclosure likely will not occur in the short-term. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question - apologize, Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt. Steve thanks for the commentary on the gross margin and particularly the video margins are upholding that’s very helpful. Maybe just a bit more detail on the gross profit side. You mentioned the DSP mix of revenue, just trying to get a sense of - I know that’s early and I assume you’re talking about the OneView ad line. So maybe specific question in terms of the mix you saw in Q1 sort of what your objectives are near term and long-term with that, OneView platform in terms of go-to-market pricing and how that may impact gross profit going forward. And then also on the TVOD, SVOD I’m just curious again the mix there, you mentioned in the shareholder letter that was, that stepped up. In the quarter just trying to get a sense of maybe how much of a step up that was and how much of that was Roku channel versus off Roku channel given the margin differential there. Thanks. Mark, this is Scott. Let me take the more strategic end of your question about the OneView launch then I’ll hand it for Steve for some commentary on the financial aspects. We did do a very substantial relaunch and rebrand for the DSP, the dataXu capability that we bought in November. We’ve tightly integrated the capability into our ad stack we’ve integrated our first party identify info, our beta targeting data, ACR. Our Roku media and measurement capabilities. It’s a big milestone for us as company and realization many of the goals that we set out to achieve when we acquired dataXu. It’s going to allow advertisers to reach four out of five US households across Roku media, other OTT platforms, desktop and mobile and it’s equipped with fundamental capabilities that we think strongly differentiated relative to other DSPs namely that identity and data info that we have as an ad scale platform where the first party consumer relationship in that, that data equips us to help advertisers reach more users, reach more inventory, do better measurement and optimization.
So specifically in answer to your questions our goal with that product is really to expand the set of business we do with advertisers to not just sell them media. But sell them a platform that helps them investment in OTT and all media more effectively. I’m very excited about the progress we’ve made on that platform. Steve, do you want to take the follow-up questions from Mark? Yes, sure. Thanks Scott. Mark, just on platform margins in general. If you think about the different pieces you have, the video ad business which traditionally has run at 50% plus margins, sponsorships and all these development as I mentioned, higher margins and then the other side of the equation is the content distribution pieces of platform that’s the subscription rev shares TVOD those run at very high margins so certainly it’s a short-term trend. We’ll see where it goes. But an uptick in SVOD trials and subscriptions as well as TVOD will increase those high margin segments. Those are for third-party apps. Within the Roku channel, the premium subscription basis is on a growth basis and so that would be a different margin profile.
You mentioned the DSP platform as Scott mentioned with the OneView that’s getting tightly integrated and so we anticipate that kind of gross to net will stay the same or potentially shift more to net treatment overtime as it gets more integrated into the standard Roku advertising business. We’re not providing formal guidance on that, but those are some of the different pieces and how trends might affect them. Excellent, thanks Scott and Steve, appreciated. Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. A couple from me. Can you talk about maybe what percentage of your advertiser base users that you’re targeting functionality and perhaps even you direct response functionality compared to maybe just more of a broader television buy [ph]? I’m also curious if you can talk about how you’re approaching the upfront this year given the dislocation there. I know it’s something that you’ve been more focused. So how are you approaching that and are you expecting to grow your mix there? And then just finally, you talked about audience development spend perhaps being negatively impacted by COVID. I’m a little bit surprised just because of the demand for streaming it seems like a great play to put advertising dollars to work. So I’m just curious if you were surprised as well and maybe what you’re seeing in terms of the trend there. Thanks. Sure, Michael. Scott here. So first off, I’d say that our advertising clientele has diversified rapidly over the course of the business and especially with the advent of a DSP offering and the ability to access advertising across a broad number of platforms with data and optimize to results. It is accelerating the breadth of clients we serve as well as diversification into more performance or DR type advertisers, as you suggested. So historically our business is very Fortune 500 heavy but that’s rapidly diversifying as we grow and data and targeting, machine learning are essential ingredients to advertisers as they chose to move their TV budgets to OTT and we have that in stages at scale platform with deep first party relationships.
Your second question was about the upfronts. It is our view that the traditional TV upfronts will be significantly are being disrupted. I mean the live pictures will be going on now. Most TV networks have flipped that to a virtual presentation. Programming production is paused. A lot of fall programming will not be available and many folks are talking about shifting the traditional TV upfront to a calendar year, which you can hear basically as a quarter shift out of the big investment decisions that brands typically make in the upfront.
All of this we think spells uncertainty and ultimately a catalyst for marketers to reconsider, what is traditionally a very heavy investment period for them and we do think that the fundamentals of OTT will shine through as marketers reconsider their upfront investments and ultimately money will move out of the upfront in the scatter and especially into OTT as an alternative. So we plan to continue to as we have for the last few years participate in the upfront process and be aggressive there and we think our offer is especially strong and the stats and the shift in consumer behavior during COVID speak to just how important it is for marketers to move money to reach consumers who are no longer reachable in linear television. Anthony. Yes, go ahead. I was just going to jump in and then say, I think one of the trends that the current pandemic and has impacted the economy is accelerating is the desire for free TV, which is an area that Roku leads in. So products that we have like the Roku channel are super strategic to us and very important and we think that their growth is going to probably improve, above this already robust grade. Thanks. Any thoughts on the audience development trend and given the greater streaming? Yes, I’ll comment there. I would say audience development is part of our category of entertainment marketing and we’re seeing mixed effects right now broadly. But you’re right that and as we’ve highlighted in our shareholder letter. We’re seeing a surge in subscription services in free ad supported services that’s especially clear in the premium subscriptions offering inside of the Roku channel, which has seen a significant growth in trials especially the services have offered extended free trials. And so we do see our content partners leaning in, to work with us to market their services and in general see a fair bit of robustness in the content side of our business. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. This is Oliver for Shyam. So I just wanted to ask, given the cancellation of sports budgets. Can you talk about how you’re seeing the new TV sports budget move over to Roku or OTT in general? And what it could like into coming quarters? Yes, we did see a lot of action, this is Scott here. Thanks for the question, Oliver. We did see a lot of quick movements by brands who realized that there are heavy investments against sports needed to get reallocated. Moreover some of these brands had messaging challenges, they might have messaging or creative that weren’t relevant or feel less relevant while people were sheltering at home and so that actually drove a lot of interest in working with Roku to create new ways to reach consumers especially at surging streamed.
We launched within a week of shelter at home kicking off something we called Home Together which is an aggregation of free content news and free movies and TV shows. And we have brands like T-Mobile, TurboTax, Chase Marriott [ph] come in and sponsor that experience. It helps solve a problem for them which is how to reach consumers during this phase. But it also helped us bring forward a bunch of awesome content for our consumers. This is Anthony. I would just add that, a clear trend that we’re seeing here is that the pandemic and all of its various aspects are accelerating trends that we’ve already - started before the pandemic particularly the transition to streaming. So things like lack of sports, a desire to save money, a move towards value. Those kinds of trends are accelerating streaming and they’re accelerating cord cutting and sports will come back. But all those cord cutters are not going to resign up for their cable. So I think a lot of these changes are going to be permanent. Got it. And can you talk about how ad pricing trended in 1Q and how you expected to trend into coming quarters? Well OTT in our view remains a premium product and has historically commanded premium pricing and we think frankly that’s just the function of it being a more effective media that performs well. It’s got better data, better measurability and with technology like OneView the opportunity to optimize to down funnel results that marketers care about. So we’re not certain how pricing, how the markets plays out over the next couple of quarters. But we’re much more heavily focused on attracting TV ad dollars into OTT that’s our focus as a company and we do see that there’s an opportunity to accelerate that transition. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Two questions. So first what will Roku advertisers be able to do through the dataXu assets that they cannot do before? And then what can you offer what the advertisers who were historically were not Roku advertisers and let’s say they were price sensitive advertisers? And the second question, any thoughts on when and if you might provide more details on international active accounts and streaming hours, so we can get a sense of your progress there? Thanks. Jason, I’ll take the first part of your questions. There are fundamental advantages behind the OneView platform. For example in our recent relaunch, we anchored the device graph in our first party identity info and we think that our data into the system so that marketers can use that toolset to achieve better scale, when you got more accurate identity info you can more confidently reach a large consumer base and you can access more inventory, so that’s a key advantage. And then the identity is of higher quality and so it will enable marketers to measure better and ultimately to optimize to results.
For example buying an ad on Roku and then optimizing it based on a site visit to the advertiser’s website or the purchase of a product. So those are fundamental new capabilities for Roku to be able to offer and they’re differentiated from the market place because they’re anchored in our app scale first party data. The other essential difference that I’ll point out is by making this data available in our DSP. We’re enabling marketers to use it, not just when they’re buying media from Roku. But when they’re buying from publishers on Roku as well as media off Roku and that is also a fundamental and new offer for us that we’re very excited to take to market.
I’m going to let Steve take your second question. Jason its Steve. So in terms of international I mean as Anthony mentioned before it’s a very big growth opportunity for us. We’ll focused initially on building scale. Right now the new markets aren’t particularly material amount. The vast majority of our accounts are in the US, although international continues to grow nicely. So it will likely be down the road when we provide some breakout and when we do it, it will likely be in the form of some of our key operating metrics kind of breaking out international versus domestic on account growth and in ARPU. Thanks. All right. Thank you so much. Our next question is from Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson. Glad to hear that everyone’s doing well. So the first question I had, Anthony touched in this little but I was hoping if we can maybe expand on his comments on the mix of SVOD versus AVOD consumption and then I have a follow-up after that. This is Anthony. I think Scott will take that one. Thanks Tom. They’re both up significantly relative to overall streaming hours growth which is of course robust itself. So we’re seeing strength in both segments. On the subscription side it’s in part consumers moving a bunch of their viewership to OTT, shopping for new subscription services and taking advantage of the extended free trials that are available in the Roku channel and from services like Disney+. We’ve seen a significant uptick from consumers in those services as well as although it’s early good conversion of those consumers into paid. And then value matters a lot to consumers, it always has but it matters especially now and so free really resonates. We’ve seen a surge in family viewing and news. And then when people get tired of news, in entertainment and so that’s driven a significant increase in ad support and services like the Roku channel and elsewhere. So they’re both up and both driving the significant increase in streaming hours that we’ve seen since COVID set in. Great and then for my follow-up. I wanted to know because I wasn’t sure how to think about this. So to the extent that you have new TV and film production stocked. How could the disruption in new content affect Roku down the line? Yes, go ahead Anthony. I think it’s going to take a while before those changes start to have a material impact. There’s just so much content that’s already been produced and a very large backlog. I don’t know, Scott if you have any thoughts on. Yes what I’d add to that is, it’s particularly problematic for services and networks that are whose core proposition is original and new programming. For us its levels the playing field and as Anthony said there’s just such a wealth of great content out there and a desire for free ad supported content. So for its stay in the course and continue doing best in the breadth and depth of content available in the Roku channel. Great, thanks for taking my question. There’s over - thanks. I was just going to comment there’s over 40,000 titles in the Roku channel. So there’s a lot of content. Wonderful. Thanks. Thank you so much. Our next question is from David Beckel with Berenberg. I’ve two sort of related to bigger picture ecosystem trend. The first being, we’ve seen increase in M&A activity among AVOD service provider that are featured prominently on your service. I was wondering if you could comment on how the purchase of those services by bigger media companies might affect your monetization going forward and if you’ve already seen a change in those relationships, thus far. And second related to TV manufacturers there have been a couple of high profile manufacturers that have announced that they’re investing heavily in their own operating systems. Which ones a little bit counter, Anthony to what you’ve said in the past about expecting most TV manufacturers to have an outsourced operating system in the future. Are you seeing this shift in any way in that dynamic and that TV manufacturers to source, to do their own operating system? Do you still believe going forward that most will be outsourced to providers like yourself? Yes, so on your first question. Free ad supported television is an area that we pioneered and we’re a leader in. I think a lot of companies are realizing it’s going to be a big growth area in OTT. In terms of our economics, if I take a step back. One of the key value propositions that we try and bring to our customers are end users is that we provide a lot of free TV and a lot of options. One of those options is the Roku channel and it’s a great option but there are other options on the platform as well that also have great content.
Our business model is such that we win when our partners win and we monetize content in our platform irregardless if they’re watching a Roku channel or if they watch it on another ad supported channel that’s also available on Roku, we generally have economics in all those situations. So big picture for us, is more free content is good. It’s a key value proposition for our users and we monetize advertising in a bunch of different ways in our platform and free content on our platform.
In terms of TV OS’s. I’m not sure which TV companies you’re referring to, but in general I think the amount of R&D and effort and expertise, it takes to build a competitive platform in today’s world for television it’s huge and it’s something you sort of need to have started years ago and so I just think that the economics don’t allow any single company to invest in OS and just run it on their platform. It needs to be amortized across a large base of TV to be - to be viable economically and to be viable for content partners. I mean content partners are not interested these days building a bunch of different apps they’ve already gotten too many platforms that they need to support.
So I feel strongly skilled at the numbers of OS are going to consolidate in the TV space and we have a leading position today and that we’ll keep that leading position scenario we’re incredibly focused on. And Roku TV is doing really well. I would also just add, we’re actually the only company still to build on operating system purpose built for TV. Every other operating system is either using HTML or it’s designed for desktops or it’s using Android which is designed for mobile first and so it’s just gives us fundamental advantages the fact that are we completely focused on purpose built operating system for TV and it’s working well for us. Great, thanks guys. Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Okay, thanks. Scott, I wonder or Steve, could you talk a little bit more about the ad business and I know in the back of your - and somebody may have asked this earlier on and then I apologize, you can quickly answer the question, if that was the case. But if they didn’t, I know at the back of your press release you talked about near term challenges in the ads business. But earlier on you talked about seeing substantial revenue growth on a year-over-year basis and I don’t know if anybody out there except for Amazon that’s doing substantial year-over-year ad revenue growth. So it sounds actually like your business is really holding up.
Can you comment what happened to your ads business during the course of the March quarter? Did it really, did the growth rate stay relatively robust and if you can’t talk about - if you don’t want to talk about the linearity of it. Talk about which areas are you seeing signs of the short-term challenge or near term challenges of the particular verticals that have done dark on you, that sort of thing. There are very few, I don’t think there’s any company that’s doing substantial revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. So that actually sounds very positive but what I’m missing here. [Indiscernible] warning set at same time. Thanks. Yes, I think you got it right there, Mark. That’s just it. We are seeing strength year-over-year growth. It’s not what we had thought it would be at the start of the year, but it’s still robust and for us it’s just the clearest indicator that the fundamentals of OTT of streaming advertising are strong as ever, this disruption that we’re in the middle of highlight the consumer trend and the acceleration towards streaming and it also sets up some tough choices for marketers as they scale back their budgets. They got to be a lot more discriminating about where they put their money and in times like this performance, measurability, ROI matter. And you go back and revisit all your assumptions and caveats and those have been piling up in linear television.
The reality is, investment in linear television is held up for years now even as linear television is suffered double-digit ratings declines year-over-year. And we all know it’s not sustainable and it’s disruptions like this that we think are encouraging brands to rethink their media mix. At a macro level the business is going to be down but we think that we come out the other side relatively speaking stronger. I don’t know if that answers your question. But that’s the next time we see, go ahead, Anthony. Yes, I was just going to comment that prior to COVID the staffs worked 29% of viewing that’s happening steaming but only 3% of TV ad dollars were going through streaming. So that’s clearly something that’s going to change and to me that’s the biggest takeaway from what’s happening right now is that the pandemic is forcing things that we are going to change anyway to change now, to make for companies and buyers to make those decisions to change their behavior and I think that’s going to be the big outcome of this. Can I follow-up Scott. Are there any particular areas, so just on the negative side? Are there particular verticals or where is the most pronounced weakness from where you look at in terms of ad spent? Well our business is very diverse, it looks like advertising generally with some caveats. We are over index on entertainment because we’re on entertainment service, entertainment platform. But we saw a downtick in categories like everybody else travel, you know. Quick serve restaurants these are verticals that had to make quickly recalibrate their spending, as their revenues went down. But there are other verticals that are still going strong and still investing and looking at the movement to streaming as an opportunity to remix their investment and change up their messaging to reach consumers who just can’t be reached in linear anymore. Okay, thank you very much, Scott. Thank you. Our next question is from Tom [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. This is Thomas calling in Ben Swinburne. Two questions, first. Following up on the point on acceleration of the linear TV budget reallocation, has the pricing differential between the Roku’s video advertising business and traditional TV widened in recent months and what’s been your philosophy on the opportunity to hold or even widen that premium CPM [ph] given the accelerated share shift that you’re seeing and viewing behavior and the value that you’re delivering. Well I think the shift is not driven or impeded by pricing as much as marketers following the audience and, in the case, or COVID circumstances being prompted to revisit most aggressively their allocations. As I’ve mentioned in previous calls, we’re less focused on pricing more focused on providing the solutions, better measurability, better ROI that marketers can achieve with OTT. I think the value proposition of OTT is strong and sound as ever and it’s ultimately that’s fundamental advantage of capabilities as well as the growing reach and the unduplicated audiences that OTT alone can deliver that is going to bring dollars over to OTT. It’s not really about pricing. Yes, that makes sense. And secondly on the long-term growth margin trajectory. As you wave a long-term balance of growth drivers, advertising likely remains the biggest growth opportunity. Do you still see platform margins stabilizing the 50% plus range or does the growth that you’re seeing on the transactional VOD or the premium subscription side change your view on how the long-term mix could look like over there? Yes, this is Steve. Yes in terms of right now we’re not providing any updated outlook at this point. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And our last question is from Chris Sakai with Singular Research. Just quick question. I know last quarter you guys mentioned that you had nine smart TV brands in Mexico. I was just wondering if you could shed some light, how things are going there? And how things are going even with the Coronavirus? This is Anthony. Things are going well in Mexico. I mean there obviously we have challenges like everyone else. But we’re still selling TVs and players in Mexico and we’re bullish on the future. I mean the short-term little less clear. I think it’s going to be a huge streaming market for us overtime. Okay, great. And I know you mentioned you went into Brazil. Is Brazil sort of your latest market that you want to reach? Well I mean markets that we’ve launched in most recently are Brazil and UK. We launched the Roku TV, we launched the Roku channel in the UK recently. We launched TVs in Brazil. We launched in Mexico before that and we’ve been adding more SKUs and more content as well in the Mexico market. Canada of course we’re in. We’re adding, we’ll continue to add more countries and we continue to build the depth of our offerings in those countries, where there’s adding more TVs or more players SKUs or more content partners, more retailers that sort of thing. Can you share, I mean where are you guys targeting next. Like is there a specific continent that you’re going to go to? We just don’t about our future product lines and launches. Okay, all right. Thanks. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. And I would like to turn the call back to our CEO, Anthony Wood for his final thoughts. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining today’s call and your ongoing support. Wherever you’re listening from I hope you’re staying safe and healthy.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2020, Roku Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like turn the conference over to Ms. Tricia Mifsud. Ma'am, you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Roku’s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended June 30, 2020. I’m joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku’s Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, SVP and GM of our Platform Business, who will be available for Q&A.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Now I’d like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you for joining today's call. Streaming is the most powerful force shaping television today. It is unleashing innovation and bringing greater choice, value and control to consumers. We are also seeing that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the macro trends that will define the screaming decade.
For example, consumers are streaming more and they are turning to services that offer good value. Also, more and more content owners are adopting a growth marketing mindset and partnering with platforms like Roku, to acquire, engage and retain valuable audiences.
And brands are re-evaluating where their ads need to appear in order to reach consumers, while looking for ways to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Against this backdrop, Roku delivered strong results and exceptional account growth in the second quarter. We are increasing platform scale and extending our competitive advantages, while helping content owners, advertisers, retailers and TV OEMs capitalized on the shift to streaming.
The strong relative performance of our ad business also stood out during the quarter. It grew as the overall TV ad market declined. Of course, the outlook for the ad industry remains highly uncertain for the balance of this year, and we believe it will be well into 2021 before TV ad investment recovers to pre-pandemic levels. Despite these headwinds, we believe we are very well-positioned to increase share in the very large TV ad marketplace over time.
I'll wrap up my comments by saying that I'm delighted that Steve Louden will be staying on with Roku as CFO, and we have ended the search to find a successor. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Steve, and our talented leadership team as we guide Roku through the pandemic and into the streaming decade.
With that, I'll hand it over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. First off, I'd like to express how pleased I am to be continuing on as the CFO of Roku. We have a great team, strong execution and a significant opportunity ahead, as TV viewing continues to shift to streaming.
Before we take your questions, I’ll walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our viewpoint looking forward.
We added 3.2 million incremental active accounts in Q2, a record for a non-Q4 holiday quarter, and ended the quarter with 43 million active accounts, up 41% year-over-year. Sales of player units continue to be robust up 28% year-over-year, while average selling price decreased only 2% year-over-year, given less promotional activity due to strong demand and tight inventory levels for certain products.
Strong, active account growth has continued into early Q3. Year-over-year engagement on the platform also accelerated in Q2, with Roku users streaming 14.6 billion hours in the quarter, up 65% year-over-year versus 47% year-over-year growth in Q1. Streaming hours per active account peaked in early Q2 and has since moderated but remains above pre-COVID levels.
Please note, we have made revisions to historical streaming hours, and I would encourage you to review the details in our shareholder letter. There is no financial statement impact of these changes, and no revisions are required to other key operating metrics.
Now, I'd like to highlight a few financial items. Total Q2 revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $356.1 million, reflecting robust growth in both platform and player segments, despite external headwinds, including the overall advertising environment.
Platform segment revenue was up 46% year-over-year to $244.8 million, driven by strength in SVOD subscription, and TVOD transaction trends, as well as continued growth in our ad business, with Roku monetized video ad impressions, growing roughly 50% year-over-year. Player revenue grew 35% year-over-year, the highest growth rate in over five years.
Gross profit grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 to $146.8 million, resulting in the gross margin of 41.2%. Platform gross margin of 56.6% with similar to the Q1 gross margin. Player gross margin of 7.5% was higher than the same period last year, due to fewer promotions as well as lower return rates. Player gross margins were higher despite continued elevated usage of air freight. We anticipate higher air freight costs to continue in the short-term, as a tight supply environment persists.
Q2 adjusted EBITDA of negative $3.4 million benefited from a sequential decline in OpEx from $196 million in Q1 to $189 million in Q2, primarily due to lower T&E and facilities operating costs. While hiring rate slowed significantly given the initial reaction of potential candidates to shelter-at-home orders, we've seen a recent increase in the hiring rate.
As a reminder year-over-year OpEx growth rates reflect the impact of acquiring dataxu's operations and personnel in mid Q4, 2019, including approximately $3.3 million in Q2 for intangible amortization, roughly two-thirds of which is included in platform COGS, and one-third in sales and marketing OpEx.
Sales and marketing expenses are up 75% year-over-year, due to growth in headcount, including the inclusion of roughly two-thirds of acquired dataxu personnel, as well as increased marketing retail and merchandising costs.
G&A expenses are up 56% year-over-year, driven by headcount growth, as well as increased legal costs, primarily related to IP litigation and international expansion. Roku significantly increased its cash and liquidity position in Q2, raising an incremental $350 million in equity capital, via an at-the-market offering. We ended Q2 with $887 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments and have $70 million of available liquidity under our credit facility.
We're pleased with the recent performance of the business against the backdrop of the global pandemic, and the significant economic fallout that it has caused. In the short-term, however, the macroeconomic environment remains both variable and uncertain, and we are not issuing a formal financial outlook at this time.
We expect strong consumer interest and the shift to TV streaming to continue, but we are mindful of the potential for both retail and supply chain disruptions, as well as changes to consumer buying behavior during important shopping periods in the second-half of the year, including back to school, and most importantly the holiday season.
The ad industry outlook remains uncertain in the second-half, and we believe that total TV ad spend will not recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, until well into 2021. We remain committed to our strategic investment areas and driving future growth. We will continue to prudently manage expenses based on the performance of the business, but do anticipate that OpEx will grow on a sequential basis, as we continue to hire, and given that headcount and facility costs, which make up roughly two-thirds of our OpEx are largely fixed in the short-term. This approach will likely mean that we run at an adjusted EBITDA loss for the year.
Despite this uncertainty, we remain confident in our ability to grow our ad business in the second-half, and believe that our overall revenue will grow substantially on a year-over-year basis, in the second-half and for the full year 2020.
In summary, we are very pleased with the performance and relative strength of the business in the second quarter, despite the macro challenges and uncertainty. Roku's competitive advantages make us extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the shift of streaming and the large economic opportunity, created by the replatforming of television.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of the Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Your line is open. I have a question, Scott, I think for you. Now that you launched OneView, can you maybe speak a little more detail about what kind of offerings you have for advertisers right now? Because it's a much more complex, I think, situation than it used to be. And specifically, as I understand advertisers can buy OTT advertising through one view but that's not necessarily a Roku inventory. And can you please confirm if it's true? And if it is, doesn't it seem to be like a channel conflict there? How do you go about that? So would appreciate your thoughts on this? Hey, Vasily. Thanks for the question. Great question, actually. So, you may recall that in early Q2, we relaunched and rebranded OneView. And the main effect of that was to negatively integrate Roku identity and data into OneView, so that users of OneView could have many of the same benefits, the targeting the measurement, the performance optimization, when they buy through OneView that they've had when they bought media from Roku. Important to that and to your question is that it really expands the book of business that we can do with an advertiser.
Now they don't just think of buying media from Roku specifically, but using our tools, our data, our identity, the power they're buying from publishers directly. So it actually, rather than produce a channel conflict actually enables us to work more broadly with advertisers across their broader spend in OTT, in desktop and mobile.
It's also expanding the set of clients that we can work with. OneView, one of its strengths is data and optimization. The ability to help a marketer optimize their campaign to bottom funnel results, like site visits or product purchases. And so that's actually bringing in a class to performance advertisers, who may not have traditionally invested in TV. Maybe they invested heavily in social platforms where performance is a key capability.
So OneView there is actually bringing in new clients, whereas in the case of TV advertisers, it's actually expanding the set of business that we can do with them.
Altogether, it's been great progress in integrating the OneView tech and team. We're very proud of the progress and OneView is featuring very prominently in our advertiser upfront discussions this year. A quick follow-up, would it be fair to assume that the revenue contribution from OneView grew compared to Q1? Well, we don't break that out specifically. But we monetized impressions on the platform, which now include OneView has grown more than 50%. You'll see that continue. OneView, again is an opportunity for us to participate in the transactions that are occurring in the Roku ecosystem, even when it's between an advertiser and a publisher on Roku. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Okay. Echo on a couple of questions, please. Could you comment at all on whether you think you've seen any pull forward of demand? I think your comments, Steve about active account growth continuing strong in Q3 suggests that there wasn't a pull forward. I'm just trying to compare those comments with what Netflix said.
And then can you comment at all about the linearity of revenue growth during the quarter that mid-40s platform revenue growth was kind of constant throughout the quarter, and continuing into July did it ramp up as you know advertisers came out of their freeze at the end of March? Or did it decelerate? Anything about the linearity of the quarter would be very helpful in terms of helping us think through what substantial means in the back-half of the year. Thank you. Hey, Mark. This is Anthony. I'll take the first part and then Steve Louden will take the second part of your question. In terms of pull forward versus just an acceleration of active account, it's difficult to say. But the indicators that we look at seem to indicate that everything is -- it's not just a pull forward during the year that the shift to streaming and the growth in active accounts has just accelerated. So, it's a little bit -- our graphs a little bit different than Netflix's graphs in that regard. Hey, Mark it's Steve. Yes, as you mentioned, we said on the active account side that we thought continued strong growth in active accounts and player sales and TV into early Q3, which is encouraging.
In terms of engagement, we noted that the streaming hours overall have accelerated significantly from pre-COVID levels. On a streaming hours per active account per day basis, they spiked dramatically during the initial lockdown phase and have since moderate -- the year-over-year growth of that metric has been moderated a bit, but it is still above pre-COVID levels. So, we do see very strong active account growth. In fact, that 3.2 million active accounts that we added in the quarter was the largest sequential quarter growth that we've had outside of the holiday period.
Now, in terms of revenue, we haven't provided a lot of detail within that, other than to note that the Roku monetize video ad impressions had grown 50%. So, on a year-over-year basis, which is showing our relative strength to continue to grow Roku. The Roku advertising side of the house plus extremely strong content distribution, after COVID in the landscape, where the overall U.S. advertising spend is down significantly. Yes, this is Anthony. I'd just add that we added 3.2 million accounts in the quarter, which we mentioned in the letter, which was exceptional. But the other interesting fact was that existing accounts purchased another 3 million Roku devices, which I think shows the strength of the affinity for our customers to their Roku system. Okay, that's very helpful. But Steve, nothing on whether that exit rate of the quarter was higher or lower than that 46%. I know, it's a very impressive growth rate. I don't think there's anything growing faster than that, actually. But just curious if you can comment at all on the linearity whether the growth is consistent throughout the period or not? Yes, we haven't broken that down, Mark. Okay. All right. God it, Steve. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Laura Martin from Needham. Your line is open. Hey there, I'm glad I get to ask this question. So, Anthony, you are an aggregation platform, that is how you create value, and yet Peacock and HBO Go or HBO Max, I guess they're not on your platform. So, could you walk us through as an excellent execution entrepreneur, how you think about the money issues on the table compared to your role as an aggregation platform for ad driven and SVOD services?
And then Scott one for you. Kroger, very interesting. I'm very interested from you, Scott about how you think about the Kroger opportunity to roll out? And how big that could be for Roku over time that product? Thank you, guys. Hey, Laura. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Scott to add some details. So, in general, I think when it comes to content, we want to add all the content that we can that's available to us to our platform. What we've said often that we're not always the first, when it comes to adding new services to our platform, because it's important to us that we establish, a win, win, win relationship, that economic model with our content distribution partners, as well as with our advertisers is what funds are a business.
And it's what allows us to invest in innovation and bring low cost excellent devices to consumers. So, it's important that we get that right. But in the particular cases that you asked about, Scott is a lot closer to that than I am. So, I'll let him comment on it more specifically. Yes. Hey, Laura. Let me just comment on the content side of the business and then I'll come to Kroger. I mean, one thing I'll just say is that partners that embrace Roku are winning. I mean, we've had an exceptional quarter of growth in terms of engagement, every segment subscription, transactional, AVOD has grown significantly. And partners who've been invested and working with us have benefited from that growth, benefited from our scale and our marketing tool.
So, as Anthony said, it is our goal to carry these services. We look for that win, win, win relationship, something that's great, and new content for consumers, helping new content providers get scale and OTT and economics for Roku. We're not always going to get the deal done first, but that's our recipe. We think it's achievable and we're excited to be a platform for these new services.
As to your question on Kroger, I agree it's a really exciting deal. It's an example of a kind of partnership, you'll see more of where we've basically partnered with Kroger, who's a leading aggregator of shopper data to onboard that data and enable it for both measurement targeting and ultimately optimization of ads, according to what CPG what the consumer packaged goods products are leaving the shelves.
We've got Campbell's in already, participating. So for CPG advertisers, it's a big win. It's the opportunity to ultimately optimize the media that they buy from Roku, the media that they run through OneView to the thing they care about, which is product sales. So, it's an exciting example of a partnership and what's possible with some of our ad tech capabilities with OneView. Thank you. Hey, Laura, this is Anthony again. Let me just add one more comment. I think another good example on the content partner relationships with Disney, I mean, Disney just announced that they have reached 100 million direct to consumer customers on platforms like Roku. And in fact, when they streamed Hamilton, we were the largest streaming platform of any of the streaming platforms, including phones.
So, we're an important partner to those companies and we're proud that we can help them. We've built a lot of tools to help them, acquire customers, stream to customers. And I think this is a good example of what a win-win partnership looks like for us. We want to do more of those kinds of deal. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Just want to kind of circle back in some of the ad spend and certainly comments that you highlighted today. Just curious how that uncertainty might compare to last quarter? And if there's any improving visibility, even if it's on the margin and to that spend with some of your advertising partners.
And then maybe just to kind of bolt on to that, the upfront forecast to be down pretty significantly around $7 billion or so. Just curious what you're hearing from your advertising partners in any sense of the benefits you might see in the back-half? And just generally speaking, how you are thinking about that opportunity? Thank you. Scott will take that. Hey, Ralph. Two points here, I'll just talk about the kind of larger market backdrop, platform revenues grew 46%. Video ad impressions were up 50%. We had strong client retention, strong new client acquisition. We're making good progress on new verticals, performance driven campaigns. This is against the backdrop of when your TV declining 15% to 25%, depending on which TV networks earnings you were listening to this week.
So, it's a challenging TV market overall. But I think our growth, both in terms of monetization as well as viewership into OTT highlights the shift in ad dollars that's occurring at linear television into OTT. I think we're well-positioned through the end of the year. It is an uncertain market, as you point out upfronts are in a bit of disarray in terms of the timing and when the dollars will get committed.
But we think we're well-positioned with our offer into the market in terms of the strength and growth of our audience, our ad capabilities, OneView, things like the Kroger partnership and we'll continue to capture share through the end of the year. This is Anthony. I'd just add, in terms of our ad business, I think that a key thing to think about is that we're growing, our ad business is growing strongly in what's a down market for the advertising business. And also, if you just think about the fact that all television is going to stream that of course, news, all TV ads are stream, all the advertising is going to switch to OTT for video. And we're just still in the very early days of that. It's the huge opportunity ahead of us. Great. Thanks, Anthony and Scott. And Steve, good to hear you sticking around. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Shyam Patel from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hey, guys, it's Ryan on Shyam. So first could you talk about international a little bit? Just how you gained traction there? And if the pandemic is driving count internationally like it is domestically?
And then secondly, you recently added a bunch of channels to the Roku channel. Have those driven more interest there? And are there any other kind of key initiative to call out on the Roku channel? Thanks. This is Anthony, let me take the international question and then maybe Scott can talk about TRC. So, the international generally is going great. We're making good progress. The position we built in the U.S., the advantages, the technology and the skills we built in the U.S. is working for us internationally. It's a huge market, internationally. It's a billion broadband households. They will all be streaming eventually. And we're seeing good progress.
So, for example, in Canada and the UK, in the quarter player sales doubled year-over-year. TV sales are strong in Canada. Roku TV sales, one in four smart TVs build in Canada. Our Roku TVs -- Mexico, we're making great progress. We announced TV partnership with Sharp today. And so we have a total of six OEM partners in Mexico now. Brazil, we started shipping Roku TV models recently with AFC, a local TV manufacturer that's off to a great start. And we also recently expanded our relationship with TCL to include more geographies around the world.
So, international is going good in terms of -- versus the U.S. I mean, international active account growth is stronger than it is in the U.S. because the U.S. is a more mature market. And then on, I think the TRC question, Scott, did you want to take that or? Yes. Hey, Ryan. Two points on TRC. One is the service continues to grow very significantly more than doubling reach year-over-year, reaching active accounts with 43 million households in the quarter. We added a live EPG, a grid like experience in the quarter added 30 new linear services for a total of 100. And that's just an example of how we're expanding the content offering in order to broaden the reach, despite the users who find something interesting in their Roku channel and deepen the engagement.
But TRC is not just an app, it's an integral part of our platform, and one of the key ways that content partners are starting to publish content into OTT. For many partners, it is a source of similar or greater audience than they can achieve in a standalone D2C experience. It's not mutually exclusive with doing a D2C experience, but it does bring to bear personalization, data, marketing, faster content, on-boarding, monetization help that content partner doesn't necessarily get in, if they're going it alone in the D2C experience.
So, TRC has grown very significantly, not just in terms of consumer engagement, but the set of content partners who are looking to TRC to substantially grow their OTT audience. And that growth has been driven not just by advertising supported content, but also subscription content as well. We've had very strong SVOD growth with Roku premium channel recently as well. Great, thanks. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks. Steve, glad to see sticking around. Two questions. One, can you talk a bit about more of the factors that weighed on platform gross profit margin, when you think about it on a year-over-year basis, including dataxu? I mean, in the release, you mentioned content distribution being stronger, and monetized video ad impression, but just any other color and if there was any other benefits that you saw high margin kind of revenue streams a year ago that were weaker or this year?
And then just secondly, you did say in the release, that you intend to expand your partnership with TCL beyond North America to include international markets, if there's any other color you can provide there, if there is any economic change to that relationship? Steve can take the first part of your question and I can -- I'll talk about TCL. Yes. Hey, Jason. Thanks for the shout out. I appreciate it. In terms of platform margin, for the segment overall, we ended up at 56.6%, which was very similar to where we were last quarter. You're right, we did note a strong content distribution performance in the quarter. And that tends to have higher margin profile in terms of the SVOD and TVOD rev shares that we have.
We also noted, strong premium subscription performance, which, if you remember is on a gross revenue treatment basis. And so that is good for revenue dollars and gross profit dollars. And I'm happy about the progress there within the Roku channel for premium subscriptions, but on the margin basis, that's at a relatively low margin. So, that was one of the other factors.
And then in terms of the ad business, certainly there's some different factors in there. There was kind of a similar gross versus net phenomenon in terms of the mix, similar to last quarter within the ad platform basis, which is the dataxu's this side of things, and then the kind of traditional Roku business was similar to last quarter in terms of the margin.
And then on TCL, I have few comments. We have a strong relationship with TCL. They're a good partner. We just expanded our current relationship to move to more countries. We recently announced the co-project with them to create an 8K Roku TV. So that's been a long-standing relationship and is continuing to be a very strong and good relationship for us.
But in terms of Roku TV, we have many Roku TV partners. TCL is probably the biggest, but we also have some other large and growing partners as well. So for example, Hisense and Walmart's house brand on both had strong growth in the quarter, taking a lot of market share, so we're seeing a lot of growth there.
And then, I mentioned internationally markets like Brazil with AOC, adding Sharp in Mexico.
So, it's a broad array of partners that participate in the Roku TV program that brings them a lot of value in terms of allowing them to grow their market share, deliver an excellent solution for customers at the lowest possible price points with the most amount of content. So, Roku TV continues to be a great program for us. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tim Nolan from Macquarie. Your line is open. Hi, everyone. Thanks very much. I'd like to come back to dataxu. I think one of the many reasons that you liked and acquired this asset was its people and its technology. And it always struck me as ironic that in your business a lot of your ad sales is done sort of kind of an old-fashioned way, if I can say that not necessarily to real time bidding, which I know is very, very small in connected TV in general. I just wonder if you could address maybe some of the progress you may have been making. And how the connected TV ad process in general can become a more automated process using more real time bidding? Thanks. Scott take that. Hey, Tim. Great question. Look, the bottom line is we're here to sell how that buyers want to buy. And most of the budgets coming into CPV are coming out of television. And they're still bought in the old-fashioned way or however you positioned it. So it's important to be able to sell that way. And there's a tremendous amount of scale and efficiency that actually comes from selling that way.
But also many of the benefits of data and targeting and measurement and optimization are really only available to you when you have machine help you do it. Ultimately, if you're going to work with a marketer to suss out the audience and optimize to site visit or product purchase, you need machines in the mix. And that's a big part of what we're doing with the OneView asset and our ad product roadmap is laying the rails, so to speak to give marketers that level of automation and optimization that we know that they need and want ultimately.
There's also a whole class of advertisers. Of course, you have grown up primarily in highly automated machine-driven ad buying, especially marketers that invest in social media. We highlighted in the shareholder letter significant growth out of our performance segment performance advertising segment, which is B2C brands, CR brands. Brands have spent a lot of money in social media because of the high ROI. This segment was up 346% year-over-year.
And that itself reflects ultimately the power of being able to sale in programmatic machine-driven winning. So, the answer is both. We need both to play in both fields, but we're investing very heavily in enabling these more advanced ways of trading and optimizing marketing. Thanks. And I would assume this would be a positive for your ad revenue growth in general, as the ecosystem evolves toward you. Would there also be cost efficiencies and doing this in a more automated way? For sure. And also, as I mentioned earlier, there are some tasks that just can't be done with you. If you're trying to use machine learning to find the audiences that really deliver a marketer's ROI, you really need machines to help you do that. And so that's why our investments in ML and optimization in our ads back are so important, so that we can deliver those outcomes that marketers are keeping. Great. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon. I have one question on OEM partnerships and then one on performance advertising. On the OEM partnerships, we get asked this question a lot. I want to present it to you. Do you have revenue share relationships with those OEM partners, where you are compensating them on a variable basis, based on the revenue that you generate on the platform, therefore, you have a rev share and you have a payout to them? Is that in your OEM relationships, any of them all of them or not?
And then second, on the performance advertising side. There's clearly a lot of enthusiasm for this format in general, especially on social media platforms, where sort of makes more intuitive sense in a feed to stop on an ad perhaps. It seems a bit more complicated on TV in terms of disrupting the experience. I'm curious how you make that a great experience for the consumer? How it adds value? And what steps you're taking to get traction there? Thanks. Let me talk for a second about the Roku TV, and then Scott can take the second part of your question about performance advertising. So just in general, the Roku TV program has been very successful for us, as I mentioned before. It continues to be successful. It brings a wide range of value to a TV company in terms of the partnership.
For example, with our purpose-built operating system, the only purpose-built operating system for streaming one of the things that we've optimized around is the cost to build a TV and so it costs less to build Roku TVs than all of the other competitive options they have available. So that's one way, for example, we deliver a lot of value to them.
We also have a lot of passion from our customer's strong consumer demand low return. And we really help them both on engineering and on factory support. So there's a lot of ways we add value. We don't talk about our specific business model. In the past, we said that rev shares is not part of our business model, but we don't talk about our business model generally.
And it's been very successful, a third of the TVs sold in the U.S. are Roku TVs now. We're seeing Roku TVs continue to sell well, I mean, in that we have an outstanding order in terms of active accounts. And a lot of those -- a very strong part of those active accounts came from the Roku TV program. So it continues to be a big success for us. And then Scott your question. Yes. And Michael on your question about performance advertising, I think one of the things you're getting at is, of course, television advertising is still a heavy branding medium. You got that 15 or 32nd spot and a chance to really influence how a consumer thinks about your brand. And that's one of the great and most powerful things about OTT about connected TV advertising is the opportunity to blend that brand impact together with data and targeting and measurement.
So, I think really the way this plays out is that OTT can be both a top funnel, powerful branding medium that competes headlong with traditional television, because it's got that play sound emotion of TV advertising, but also can compete with more performance driven media like social media, because it's got data and optimization to bear on the problem. So that's one of the reasons we're seeing good strength there.
Does it change up you know how an advertiser approaches the creative, it's not a matter of like adding a few pieces of techs in one graphic. You've got to produce a video. But even there, we're leaning in as a company to help brands quickly produce a video creative, so they can participate.
So overall, it's an exciting new segment for us. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, it's a way to expand the set of clients that we're able to work with. That's helpful. Thank you, both. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Well, thank you very much. Scott, maybe just to follow-up on that last point you made. I'm just curious if you think maybe looking at this linear topic a little differently. How would you -- what would you characterize as a tipping point? And I mean, it was helpful. This is how you characterize it in terms of -- and you offer both top of funnel and bottom funnel. But where's the tipping point here? Obviously, sports linear or sports picture looks more and more dire every day as we look forward. Obviously, those dollars need to go somewhere.
So I'm just kind of curious how you see it flowing in? Maybe you can talk about where your dialogues are with some media buyers, where they may be perhaps behind or past the learning curve in terms of getting just to the table, talking about CTV versus those that's still -- is still kind of a pull to get them to sit down with you at the table. Thank you. Yes, great question. Well, despite what Malcolm Gladwell would tell you, tipping points are always easiest to observe and retrospect. But our view is that the tipping point is here and that COVID ultimately has pulled forward a bunch of cord cutting that was going to happen anyway.
I mean, linear television was already experiencing double digit ratings declines year-over-year. We see that in most TV networks, their ad sales are down significantly. The spending was already significantly disproportionate to the audiences that have already left linear television.
And so, our view is that the tipping point here, it's driven by cord cutting. And the pandemic has really forced marketers to come to grips with something that was coming anyway, which is that there's been a significant departure of audience out of linear television and it's not coming back.
Roku ran a streaming study last quarter and found that of consumers who cut the cord, only one in five actually intend to go back to a traditional pay TV package. And if they go back, they're going to go to a virtual MVPD service. So, our view is that the movements afoot, certainly with consumers and marketers are following and that the pandemic has really just helped accelerate that reckoning. Okay, thanks, guys. Just maybe an unrelated follow-up. As it relates to the Campbell's partnership with your Kroger, is there anything you could talk about yet in terms of metrics, ROI metrics. Or how early are we there? And sort of what does that that funnel look like? Do you have a specific team that is sort of on boarding, CPG, other partnerships there would be helpful? Thanks. Yes, it is early in the partnership. We've had a team for a long time that's focused on CPG as well as our DSP. And the Kroger partnership plays to the existing business we do and our technology capabilities. But we need partners like Kroger who've got unique data assets to pull off some of these optimizations.
We're very excited about the partnership that it's indicative of what's possible. And you've gotten ad scale, OTT platform with first party consumer identity info and a great partner like Kroger. So it's still early, but we are excited about the partnership and bullish about the long-term proceeds of it. Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Thank you. I have two questions, I guess one first for Scott and one for Anthony. Scott, so when we were doing our research on this opportunity, we talked to a lot of traditional TV buyers. And the feedback we got about Roku is consistent, which is we'd like to have more transparency about where the inventory is running.
So can I ask you what are the gating factors to maybe opening up their transparency, letting the buyers see where their inventory is running? And when can that possibly change?
And Anthony, the question we get a lot is Android TV and Google moving into this space. You did a deal with one of your partners. What do you think is the long-term impact of them getting into connected TVs? How can that change the dynamics in this market globally in the next couple of years? Sure. Scott, do you want to start? Yes, Mike, I’ll take the first part of your question. The constraint on unfolding fully where ads ran usually actually comes from our publishers, who are sensitive to channel conflict. Although, I will say that there are tons and tons of data and insights that we breakout and ultimately for a market what they care about is performance and results.
One thing I’ll also highlight is that with OneView it’s a chance for a marketer to leverage all the Roku identity and data assets that we have, while still trading directly with the publisher. And so, certainly it is the driving strategy for us behind the OneView dataxu acquisition, but having that asset, having that ability to trade with marketers and give them the ability to leverage our data, while trading with all the other folks that they trade with, in the media space and in OTT enables them to have that transparency, while still taking advantage of Roku's unique capabilities. In terms of competition, I guess I'd say this is a competitive industry. We've been competing very successfully with large companies for the entire life of the company. I think a lot of people don't remember but actually, I mean, you mentioned Android TV, Google TV was actually the first platform to ship as a licensed platform for TVs that ship well before Roku TV as the program came into being. And yet now Roku TV is by far the number one streaming platform in the United States.
And it's because we are just -- well, first of all the foundation is that we built a purpose-built operating system for TV, whereas they're using Android, which is designed primarily for phones and imported TV. And that just offers lots of fundamental intrinsic advantages, including a better cost structure, a better user experience, great return. And the result of that has been, -- the Roku has become a very strong brand for streaming. We're the number one streaming platform in the country in the United States.
We also offer a full line up of products. We have a variety of players, different price points, a variety of TV partners, a variety of TV capabilities, and even whole home product. We have almost probably over 1,000 engineers that are, I believe the best engineers in the business of streaming business focused every day on building the best streaming products. So we've been competing for a long time. We compete successfully. We're growing market share. We're number one in the U.S. and we're making great progress internationally as we enter new countries as well. I'm very confident in our ability to compete. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Beckel from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Hey, thanks so much for the question. I have two actually. So the first would be on monetizable impressions delivered growth of over 50%, which is obviously an incredible pace, but if memory serves, quite a bit slower than prior quarters. So I'm wondering is that more a function of ad supply or overall demand? That is, were monetizable ad viewing hours, did they also decelerate meaningfully? And why would that be the case?
And the second question is just about -- thinking about the big picture advertising opportunity. You often talked about the switch or the shift in ad dollars from linear TV to digital TV. But with things like performance marketing and enhanced data capabilities, should we also be thinking about a bigger pie that also includes many forms of digital advertising today? Scott will take that. Hey, David. The growth of 50%, which we're very pleased with and considering what's happening in the broader market is absolutely a function of demand. We did see an AVOD consumption, along with SVOD and TVOD consumption really surge in the quarter during shelter at home policies. So this is a function of demand. As I've mentioned earlier, we remain bullish on the market's continued recovery and our ability to continue capturing and increased share of the market as marketers redeploy their TV budgets.
In terms of your second question. Yes, we do focus heavily on TV ad budgets because that is a very large pocket of marketer and CMO investment that is going to get redeployed in the coming years. And it's a set of budgets that we think we're uniquely situated to compete for. But it is also reality. As you allude to that the capabilities of our ad platform are also attractive to a broader class of advertisers, who are interested in optimizing to the bottom funnel effects, things that they really actually can't do in linear television. It's just not possible as a B2C Harry Shave Club type brand. If your sole KPI, I'm making this up by the way, I can't speak to them and their strategy specifically. But if your sole KPI is sale of a product is very hard to get linear television to do that for you, whereas OTTs has all the capabilities of highly measurable, high ROI digital platform like you might see in social media. And the key takeaway for me during the quarter was just how strong of a growth we had in our ad business and the TV market -- ad market is down, down quite a bit. Great, thank you. Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. I've got the two. First for Scott, I think that's the first time I've seen you mentioned social media in your shareholder letter. How big is social media? I assume it's tiny. What's the opportunity there? And now that we're into August, how much did you benefit from the Facebook boycott?
And then secondly, for Anthony, when you look at the traditional media companies, they seem to be finally coming around. Viacom will be talking about Pluto tomorrow and Fox is talking about Tubi and NBCU has its Comcast -- has its Peacock and its flex devices. How is the competitive environment changing now that traditional media guys are at least getting somewhere into streaming? Hey, Alan, I'll take your first part of your question. In referencing social media, really, my main intent here is just to highlight that many of the same capabilities and criteria that performance marketers look for and get in social media are available in OTT. I was trying to put too fine a point specifically on social media, and we're certainly not -- I would not characterize Roku as a social media platform. But the capabilities that we're building are very attractive to performance advertisers, which is why we've seen such strong growth out of that category. This is a class advertiser whose main KPIs is visiting a site and buying a product and that's a core capability of OTT.
I can't comment on the Facebook boycott, in terms of like whether it's had a real effect on them. But certainly we've seen lots of interest from advertisers who today spend the majority of their budgets in social media. In terms of competition, I talked about device competition, and how we're competing extremely effectively there. In terms of media companies, I mean, those companies are not our competitors. They're our partners. We're a content distribution platform. We offer a variety of ways to distribute content over the top in the streaming world. One way is they can publish apps on our platform, and most of them do, and in most cases, we're probably their largest platform for streaming hours.
We have a lot of tools built into our platform that we built from the beginning to allow and to make it possible for content publishers to attract and build audiences. We have lots of tools around tune-in promotions for content companies, content publishers.
One of our roles in the world is we are the glue that connects the ecosystem together. We aggregate very large bases of customers. We connect them with companies that want to stream customers to those stream content to those customers. And they can do it a variety of ways, they can do app, so we talked about that. But they can also publish content directly in the Roku channel, where we handle all the heavy lifting of getting customers interested in doing the content, that is subscription content, handling all the payments systems.
For example, Roku Pay our billing system, in the quarter, we more than doubled the amount we build year-over-year. There's a lot of customers take advantage of our tools that we've integrated into our platform. So, customers can publish apps, they can distribute content to the Roku channel. So, it's their option on how they want to approach it, and we have a lot of partners that do both, they have an app and they distribute content through the Roku channel. And they can be very effective doing that.
So, they're definitely not competitors. They are our most important, one of our most important partners in our content company. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions. Scott, I think to sticking with the Roku channel, I think it's what maybe 18 months old, something like that. Can you give us a sense for sort of where that product is relative to your expectations? Where it goes from here? And any kind of engagement statistics you can share? I know the reach numbers you've provided. And I'm just wondering if you could share a bit more about the evolution of that offering? And what it does for the business over the next several years?
And then I don't know if this is for Steve, but, through earnings, we've sort of heard from most companies in the advertising space that the second quarter was sort of the trough. It's odd to call 50% growth a trough. I think you know what I'm referring to. I'm just wondering if you think that in the third quarter, we'll see an acceleration in your ad business versus the Q2 growth? Or if you're willing to comment at all about what you're seeing near-term. Thanks, guys. Scott will take that. Hey, Ben. On your first question about the Roku channel, I think we're actually coming up on three years. We launched it in September maybe '18 actually. So, yes, the growth continues to be really exceptional. And to beat our expectations, it's a function of the broadening of array of content that we put into it. Our investment in the user experience with the launch of our EPG with live linear channels, and it's what's allowed us to double reach year-over-year and reach active accounts with about 43 million people in them.
So, we are both broadening our reach, which is important as an ad offering that we help advertisers get in front of a larger and larger share of their user base. But as we add more varied content, we're deepening our engagement with our user base. And then of course, we're taking TRC international, in Canada and UK. And it's a pretty essential part of our platform and our approach to both engaging consumers as well as providing content providers with a new path to publishing OTT.
Steve, do you want to take the second question? Hi, Ben. Actually let me just add a couple of points on the Roku channel, and of course, Steve kind of takes the second question. I think it's important to recognize that the Roku channel is an important part of our strategy. We think that having the capability for a content owner or content publisher to decide whether they want to write an app and the heavy lifting that's associated with that, or have a full service to one stop publishing solution for their content. Having both of those options is very important.
And, we're experts to both, and we've been building a lot of capabilities into the Roku channel, everything from machine learning recommendations to building systems to different business models, whether it's a subscription or AVOD. And we're also integrating it to key points into the platform. So we'll continue to do that.
And, my belief is that the Roku channel will continue to become to be an important part of our distribution mix, and probably a larger part of the mix over time.
It's very difficult for any company to replicate, especially a content company. There's a ton of engineering that goes into the Roku channel. Steve, do you want to talk about the second part? Yes. Hey, Ben, just on your second question. I think, first, I mean, we're really pleased with the strong second quarter and I think we're cautiously optimistic. We mentioned some continued strength on the account side in the player and TV sales side and that the engagement levels are still above pre-COVID.
I think for us and certainly the relative continue growth of the business, albeit lower than what we would have expected pre-COVID has been significantly better than the overall market. I think the trick for us and the reason we haven't provided formal guidance for Q3 and Q4 is just, while we have a lot of positive trends and we think we're relatively well positioned and resilient in the face of a lot of these headwinds is that, because you have these other factors in terms of the holiday season, how advertisers relate to continue economic uncertainty if the world goes into lockdown.
So I think the short-term, we feel pretty good about where we sit. I think this the part that we have less visibility and less control into these potential broader shocks out there. And that's really what we're monitoring. Understand. Thank you, both. Thank you. We have time for one final question, our final question or comment comes from the line of Richard Greenfield from LightShed Partners. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of topics. First, Disney is clearly signaling that they agree with you in terms of the global shift to IP based TV with what they're doing with the launch of Star, and the continued rollout of Disney Plus. You sort of talked about the faster growth of your overseas business, but, is there any way you can frame like, -- are we at the point now where 10% of your active accounts are international?
What's the ARPU look like of international versus domestic? And is engagement meaning streaming hours per user? How does it compare overseas to the U.S. given obviously fewer services overseas? Just any way of framing it and then I have a follow-up on TVOD. Sure. So, in terms of international, obviously, that's a big investment area for us. It's an important part of our business. We haven't broken out the numbers. I would say that the different countries are in different phases. I mean, if you think about kind of the phases of our business model, the first phase is really just focused on building active accounts. And there's countries where that that's our focus. We're just focused on building active accounts.
Then there's the phase where we shift from building active accounts and engagement to monetization, and there's countries where we're starting to do that. Like we've launched the Roku channel in Canada and the UK, for example, which is primarily about monetization.
So overall, I think the way I think about it is that there's a lot more people outside of the United States and inside the United States, and so it's a bigger market overall. But the U.S. has a very high GDP, so the ARPU is probably going to be lower internationally. But in any case, it's still a huge, huge market and we're making good progress. Okay. And then the second question is, when I think about TVOD, obviously what happened with Mulan is front and center. And a lot of people are thinking about what it means. And I think in your press release, you even talked about trolls and scooped in the quarter being meaningful for you on the movie front.
With Mulan showing up inside the Disney+ app, I'm just wondering if a consumer comes into a Roku device where they bought or signed up for Disney+ inside of Roku. Do you get any benefit from that? Meaning is there any ability for you to generate or participate in the economics of that type of TVOD transaction? Or is that purely Disney, if they signed up on a Roku device? Well, first, we don't get into the specifics of any deal, but we said and it's still true that generally, for TVOD transactions anywhere on our platform, we get a rev share and we get a piece of the transaction. That's still very true. Sorry, go ahead. Yes. I was just going to say I mean; I think it's a huge win for consumers for Roku for Disney to see the sort of loosening up here of the theatrical windows. Obviously, it's of necessity, people aren't going to theaters right now. But I think it's also just a broader signal that big players like Disney are going to exercise these windows more aggressively. And the consumer is the winner here, as is Roku, as is Disney. Optionality is awesome for the consumer and I think it's a sign of even more interesting things to come. Do you think you're getting an opportunity to sell that as well? Meaning like, do you think it's only going to be inside of Disney+? Or do you think Roku will get a chance to sell directly some of those titles as well? Well, without, again, not talking a specific deal, but that is one of the primary things we do is help our content partners merchandise content across our platform. That's one of our -- that's a super important part of our business model. And I couldn't agree more with Scott that it's incredible to think that a TVOD title would be released direct to video, direct to streaming.
It just shows how far the industry's come from when we started. When we started the only partner, we had was Netflix. And big media companies didn't even believe that the world has switched to streaming. It was kind of weird and that's changed. The world is all in on streaming now. Thank you very much. That's helpful. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any closing remarks. Thank you, operator. We had a strong quarter with exceptional active account growth that increased platform scale. Despite the many challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Roku is executing well, attracting outstanding talent and becoming stronger in fundamental ways.
I believe that the streaming decade has begun with a period of fundamental reassessment. Major content owners are going all in on streaming. Advertisers are shifting budgets to OTT. TV OEMs are licensing operating systems like ours on a global scale, and platforms focused on meeting consumer needs are thriving. Thank you again for your support, and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Now, I’d like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you for joining today’s call. Q3 was remarkable for our industry and for Roku. More American consumers streamed to their TV than ever before. This included free ad-supported services, as well as live programming and subscription. The Roku Channel benefited from offering all three.
Major media companies continue to reorganize around streaming. They embrace Roku because of our scale and content marketing capabilities. Partnering with Roku is an efficient way to build and retain large and valuable audiences.
Advertisers reassessed their TV upfront advertising commitments and moved significant portions of their investments to connected TV platforms like Roku. Advertising with Roku gave marketers significant incremental reach over linear TV, as well as advanced capabilities to target their advertising and to measure its effectiveness. Streaming is stoking innovation and giving greater choice, value and control to consumers.
Despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Roku’s long-term prospects are strong and our outstanding financial and operational performance in Q3 shows the inherent leverage in our business model.
With that, I will hand it over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. Before we take your questions, I will walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our viewpoint looking forward. We added 2.9 million incremental active accounts in Q3 and ended the quarter with 46 million active accounts, up 43% year-over-year.
Sales of player units rapidly accelerated, up 57% year-over-year, while average selling price decreased only 1% year-over-year, given less promotional activity due to strong demand resulting in tight inventory levels for certain products.
This extraordinary level of player unit growth was driven by a confluence of factors, including significant retailer channel inventory replenishment after strong Q2 player sales, continued robust demand for streaming players in Q3 and a portion of holiday inventory arriving at the end of Q3.
Engagement on the Platform continues to grow, with Roku users streaming 14.8 billion hours in the quarter, up 54% year-over-year and streaming hours per active account increasing at a more normalized rate of 9% year-over-year, as COVID-related restrictions were lifted during the summer.
Now, I’d like to highlight a few financial items. Q3 saw record total revenues of $452 million, up 73% year-over-year, driven by robust growth in both the Platform and Player segments. Platform segment revenue was up 78% year-over-year to $319 million, driven by broad-based strength in both our advertising and content distribution businesses.
Roku monetized video ad impressions reaccelerated to almost 90% year-over-year in Q3 versus roughly 50% year-over-year in Q2, as advertisers leaned into Roku, shifting dollars to streaming as they follow TV viewership and take advantage of increased flexibility given disruptions to the traditional TV upfront process.
The content business benefited from our rapid rate of active account growth, as well as strong consumer demand for ad-supported viewing, subscription services and premium movie rentals. Reflecting these factors in our content distribution deal model led to some significant increases in the estimated lifetime deal values with an outside portion of that value change accounted for in Q3.
As a reminder, revenue recognition for our content distribution agreements can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Player revenue grew 62% year-over-year, the highest growth rate in over seven years, which was driven by an extraordinary level of player unit growth, as mentioned previously.
Gross profit grew faster than revenue, up 81% year-over-year in Q3 to $215 million. Gross margin of 47.6% increased on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong segment margins.
Platform gross margin of 61% expanded over 400 basis points versus the first half of 2020 due to margin improvements in both ads and content distribution. Player gross margin of 15% was significantly higher than the same period last year due to fewer promotions as well as lower return rates.
Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $56 million was a record, eclipsing the total adjusted EBITDA in 2019 by more than 50%. This outsized level of adjusted EBITDA was the result of several positive trends combining in the quarter, but also highlights the inherent leverage of the Roku business model as the platform continues to gain scale and monetization increases.
We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position, raising an incremental $148 million in equity capital via an at-the-market offering, resulting in over $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. We also have $69 million of available liquidity under our credit facility.
Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide formal guidance for Q4, given that the short-term macro environment remains both variable and uncertain. We are closely tracking the potential for COVID-19 or economic related disruptions, as well as the potential impact to historical consumer spending levels or shopping patterns as we enter the holiday season. Instead, we will provide a framework on how we believe the quarter could develop.
Coming now to Q3, we are pleased with the resilience of our business and cautiously optimistic about the holiday season. Barring any significant external risk factors materializing, we estimate that the overall Q4 year-over-year revenue growth will be roughly in line with the last few holiday seasons, which was in the mid-40% range. We expect platform revenue to account for roughly two-thirds of total revenue.
As I mentioned earlier, Q3 revenue benefited from material deal value increases that we do not anticipate will be replicated in Q4. Also, this quarter, we will be lapping the anniversary of our dataXu acquisition, along with certain content distribution launches.
Like past holiday seasons, we plan to keep Q4 player gross margins close to breakeven. While we anticipate Q4 platform gross margins to be between the mid-50% and 60%, which is similar to levels seen in Q2 and Q3 this year.
We anticipate the sequential growth in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4 to be in line with last year, driven primarily by headcount and sales and marketing growth. As a reminder, quarterly operating expense levels from Q1 to Q3 remained relatively consistent in part due to steps we took at the outset of the pandemic to slow the rate of growth of our OpEx.
In summary, we are very pleased with the overall resiliency of our business and with our outstanding Q3 performance. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our business into the future and believe that pandemic has only accelerated the long-term trend towards all TV beam streams.
With that, let’s turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is open. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, just wanted to get some perspective on the Q4 guide, if I could. Obviously, mid-40% growth is great. But just sort of looking relative to what you posted 73% growth in Q3. Just curious if there’s just added conservatism there. I am sure there’s a big element of the outsized portion of the deal that got recognized in Q3. So, just any extra color there and if you could perhaps give some quantification or some more color on how large the outsized portion of the deal was in Q3 would be great? Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Rob. Thanks for the question. Yeah. As you mentioned, I mean, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. It’s a confluence of very positive trends, record player growth, TV sales were great with our partners, and then strong performances on both the advertising and the content distribution side, including calling up on several of our deal models, the lifetime values there.
In terms of Q4, I think, the important thing to just focus on is, there’s a lot of uncertainty and variability that remains out there in the macro environment, everything from COVID-related resurgences in the U.S. and around the world to the shape of the holiday season, as well as consumer spending levels. So that’s -- these are all things we are tracking, which is why we are not giving a formal outlook.
So certainly, you reference some of our color. I mean we are very happy with the trajectory and the resilience of the business to-date and so we are cautiously optimistic on the holiday season and think it could look similar to the last couple of holiday seasons, which were in the mid-40% year-over-year growth range on a revenue basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, we don’t anticipate significant deal value changes in Q4. Although that’s -- obviously, we do that analysis every quarter.
The other thing I will note just that’s factored into those thoughts is the fact that in Q4, we are lapping the dataXu acquisition, which came on board mid-Q4, as well as launches of some certain new services in Q4. So those are also factors that are -- that were included in our thinking there. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open. Great results guys. Scott, let’s start with you. I am very interested in this certain -- the question I get the most is dataXu. Why did they buy it and why does it matter? And I am very interested here in these words that say, focused on new products like incremental reach guarantees. Could you talk about how dataXu is giving you new products that weren’t available before with this one view platform? And then for you, Anthony, you guys stay in the letter, 75% player growth year-over-year. Does that imply that our mix of TV ads is now pivoted towards player -- away from the 50-50 mix towards players and our sound bars having an influence on that extra outperformance or not? Thank you. Hey, Laura. It’s Scott here. Thanks for the question. I will talk a little bit about the context around dataXu and then provide some broader color on the newer ad products you referenced. We bought dataXu really to bring the same unique advantages we have had in the Media business to a broader platform to a broader scale.
Since acquiring dataXu, we have re-branded it and re-launched it as OneView, the OneView ad platform and we have been layering in a bunch of new features, including, for example, as you referenced the ability to manage reach and frequency broadly across the marketers.
Complete buy, so whether they are buying media from Roku or media from a publisher on Roku or media off Roku entirely. They can manage that and orchestrate that all within OneView and leverage our identity and data in -- at the same time.
The incremental reach product that you are referencing is actually something we took into the upfront and it was a -- we stepped it up. For several years now, we have been highlighting our ability to measure reach and frequency across linear and OTT, which is a key trigger for marketers to choose to invest into OTT.
This year, we stepped it up and offered guarantees in the upfront. We would guarantee that we would deliver true incremental reach over linear to marketers. So, overall, tons of progress on OneView, significant media spent through OneView occurring in the quarter year-over-year and we are really just getting going.
We have got brands like DraftKings, for example, who is a big sports spender, had to shift budgets out of TV as sports was canceled and delayed. Has moved a significant portion of their budget into OTT and is yet now managing most of their spend -- their cross channel spend through OneView.
That’s just one example. Lexis, the national team, is really leaning into our unique capabilities, adding it on the home screen sponsorable experiences and then using OneView to reach consumers off Roku for that one-two punch of cross-platform reach. So, overall, we are very excited about progress we have made with OneView. Anthony, do you want to take the second question? Yeah. Hey, Laura. So I think the stat you are referring to is player unit sales were up 57% year-over-year, which is a great number for us. In certain international markets, like in Canada and the U.K., players unit sales actually doubled year-over-year. And then Roku TVs also had an extremely strong quarter. They continue to perform very well.
So we saw -- and then audio products like we just introduced, the Streambar and we have some other audio products in the market. Those are still not -- still a lot smaller than player unit sales, but those are growing as well.
So I think we are seeing our active account growth engines on all fronts doing really well and the result was active accounts in the quarter were up 43% year-over-year to $46 million, which is great.
And we also -- I mean, we also sell lots of units that don’t result in a new active account, but they result in more Roku is going into existing Roku households, which strengthens our relationship with those customers as well. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Thanks. I have a couple. Whoever wants to please do? Can you talk a bit about The Roku Channel this quarter? It looks like streaming hours slowed down a bit. That makes sense. But Roku Channel picked up a ton of share. So what’s behind that? And then I thought it was interesting that you guys announced a deal with Amazon to move Roku Channel across to their platform. What does that do to perhaps your content strategy and your partner’s willingness to work with you? And do you see one day maybe moving to more original content as you build that Roku Channel further? Thanks. Hey, Michael. This is Anthony. Yeah. So the Roku Channel is doing extremely well. It’s an important asset for us and reach doubled in The Roku Channel in the quarter. But I think, Scott, will be best to answer most of your questions. Yeah. It really was an incredible quarter for the Roku Channel, active account growth now reaching active accounts with about 54 million people, double the pace of an already fast growing underlying platform in terms of hours and reach, growing faster than any other top 10 channel.
Some of this was driven in part by the launch of our EPG, our live channel grid, which we began rolling out in June. It’s a great product, a great way to channel surf. All this growth really accrues to Roku’s benefit, but also, of course, our partners who are participating and putting content into the Roku Channel. So partner earnings within the Roku Channel are more than doubled in the quarter. So, overall, really strong performance for the Roku Channel.
As -- in answer your question about sort of content and off platform, as the Roku Channel grows and generates even bigger and better financial outcomes for our partners, it just attracts more partners, more content, depth, more verticals. It opens up yet more possibilities for programming for us as a platform. So it’s a real vehicle for us in terms of the value that it creates for our users, for Roku and for content partners participating in it.
Regarding off-platform syndication of the Roku Channel, our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages about the Roku Channel. Our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages, the marketing tools, the reach, data, but free, especially AVOD is a powerful recipe and so where we see an opportunity to take the Roku Channel on to other platforms, we will explore it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping to get a finer point on the shopper data program with Kroger. How has the uptake been with CPGs and how many other opportunities like this, could you envision out there down the road? Thanks so much. Hey, Scott, do you want to take that? Yeah. Well, of course, CPG as an advertiser category is an enormous category, and especially, I think COVID has taught us just how much consumers are willing to move their shopping online. The Kroger deal has been a very strong deal for us in terms of signaling what we are capable of given our scale and our data.
We mentioned in the shareholder letter that Snyder’s, for example, saw a 250% return on ad spend. We have a bunch of brands now in and leveraging that program and there are lots of opportunities. It is a big market.
The key for us as a platform is that first-party customer relationship and our reach into our platform with advertising. So we anticipate lots more to come on that. CPG became our fastest growing vertical in the quarter, just as an indicator of how much potential there is. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Mr. Helfstein, your line is open. Thank you. So, Steve, just can you go into a bit more detail? I mean, you called out that you had an -- you recognize an outsized portion of the content distribution lifetime value in the quarter. I think second quarter kind of also benefited, maybe you didn’t call it out as much in the letter, but I recall, I think there was something in the Q about it. I mean, just help us understand kind of what those triggers are, because it feels like this kind of is actually a pattern, because it’s a strong part of your business? And then just with OneView, I mean, how do we think about the sizing, if we think out over the next two years? I mean, you gave some commentary in the letter with DraftKings, but I mean kind of how meaningful could that become over the next two years? Thanks. Hey. Steve, do you want to take the first question? Sure. Hey, Jason. Thanks for the question. Yeah. In terms of the content distribution deal models and this is a similar quarterly view that we -- or analysis that we do for other types of deals as well. We are -- in 606 accounting we are valuing the lifetime of the deal and the content distribution deals are generally a year or two.
And so we see trends, what we are trying to better understand is whether those trends are sustainable and whether we should reflect them into the future periods. And in those cases, that can increase or decrease the overall level of the deal if they are positive or negative.
In this case, in Q2, we obviously had trends that were in the early days of the pandemic in the lockdown. At that time, we didn’t feel comfortable creating -- extrapolating those out too far. But certainly, with more time, what we are seeing is a sustained acceleration in active accounts, as Anthony mentioned, driven by very strong player and TV sales, as well as just very strong consumer demand for not only ad-supported viewing but also subscription services, the premium movie rental business that was pretty nascent has increased with some titles kind of notable titles there.
And so in this case, we reassess these material deal models every quarter, but what we had was a portion of those increasing in deal values and so that’s reflected in that -- in the quarterly results because when you reflect an increase in deal value, an outsized portion of that is impacted to the current quarter.
The results can be lumpy with that, and certainly, as a reminder, that is increasing our assumptions for not only the current period but in future periods as well, which is why that can be lumpy on the quarter-to-quarter.
So, again, I think for us, I would say that, that process of looking at the deal model is definitely a quarterly part of the business, but it can go up or down and in any given quarter a lot of them kind of stay the same. Jason, let me take the second part of your question about OneView. It’s a great question. Let me just -- without getting too frothy here, let me just take it in parts to highlight how big an opportunity this is for you, so -- for Roku.
So on the Roku platform we are fast growing, of course, as an ad sales team. OneView allows us to access the yet additional, but still significant majority of impressions that are not sold by us, they are sold by publishers on our platform. It enables us to enable a marketer to use the same identity and data when buying elsewhere within the Roku ecosystem in the same way that they have been when they are buying media from Roku. But of course, as big as we are in OTT, there are other video OTT media to be accessed outside of Roku. So that’s kind of a part two in terms of additional opportunity.
And then, of course, there’s omnichannel, there’s desktop and mobile in tons of use cases of marketers who reach a user online and then want to retarget them in OTT, reach a user in OTT and then want to follow through on desktop and mobile. The opportunity here is really very significant for any marketer, and TV and OTT is a centerpiece in their marketing strategy.
The key success factors, in our view, the right to win in our view as a platform and as a DSP really comes down, in our view, especially in this world of cookie challenges, device ID challenges is that first-party customer relationship, a platform at scale, advanced targeting and measurement, unique ad products. These are all the things that we think make OneView strongly appealing to our clients. Jason, this is Anthony. Let me just add a couple of things. I would say from my point of view, the most interesting thing is that even though we have a nice robust ad business, the vast majority of advertising spend is still in linear television it’s not -- it’s still not in streaming.
And one of the interesting things in the quarter was the fact that advertisers are increasingly seeing streaming is something they need to start allocating a bigger portion of their budgets towards.
So it’s still -- there’s still a lot of opportunity, because, of course, all those ads are going to switch to steaming eventually and we think they are all going to be programmatic eventually as well through platforms like OneView. Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about the maturation of the AVOD market. So you talked about the changes to the upfront. I thought that adding Roku Channel to Amazon Fire TV was a real milestone for the company and on its earnings call, Amazon made very positive comments about the AVOD market and its own efforts. So I wanted to, in particular, talk about the maturation of AVOD, but two things in particular. What do you see as the opportunity for political ads on AVOD and how did they perform in the quarter? And then what are your current thoughts on your international opportunity for AVOD? Thanks. So -- this is Anthony. I will just say that AVOD is obviously a huge opportunity. We are very bullish on it. But I think Scott’s best equipped to answer those questions. Yeah. I mean, AVOD is vital to the OTT business model. You framed the question as maturation as though we are reaching maturation. I mean I think it’s really still an extremely fast growing and very high potential market. We see that in the pace of growth of the Roku Channel itself. We highlighted some stats in the shareholder letter.
And I think if you look at new services coming to OTT, a majority of them are actually hybrid business models. They are subscription-based, but they are keeping the price down and they are augmenting their revenue model through advertising.
I think also consumers have a somewhat limited budget for the number of services they are going to sign up where they are looking to save money as they leave the pay TV ecosystem. All to say, it just makes ad-supported experiences in the OTT environment that much more important.
You asked about a political -- we had a strong participation in that category. Our capabilities are a key differentiator for political marketers. But that said, it was a relatively modest contribution to an otherwise really big quarter for us in advertising. It was an important segment, a newer segment for us as a younger ad business, a great tenant to participate in, but certainly not anywhere close to a large share of our overall ad business. And then on international -- I can just say a few words on that. So if you just think big picture, what is our international strategy? Well, a big part of it is -- a lot of it is to replicate -- most of it actually is to replicate what we have done in the U.S. internationally. And in the U.S., we started by just focusing on building active accounts and then as we started to reach scale, layering on monetization options and that’s what we are doing internationally as well.
So we are focused primarily in this phase on building scale in the key markets and then as we start to reach scale, we will start to layer on monetization options. And that started, but it’s still pretty nascent. For example, the Roku Channel is available in the U.K. and it’s available in Canada. But that’s our overall strategy.
And then I would say, thinking about AVOD. I mean, SVOD is fairly pop -- pay TV is popular in the United States. But in almost all international markets, AVOD is by far the dominant business model. Free is very important worldwide. Thank you. And our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is open. Thank you. So I have been hearing some concerns from investors about the press reports about Walmart selling TVs with Comcast operating system. So it does feel a little bit like the scare from last year with the Xfinity Flex. But I would appreciate your view on how this potentially can or cannot impact you? And then I have one for Steve. Thank you. Sure. This is Anthony. So we are the number one TV OS in the United States and now in Canada. And we have achieved that position despite a very dynamic marketplace with intense competition from large tech companies and large TV companies as well. And there’s a few reasons we think we are successful or the most successful in the TV OS business.
And one, of course, is just the Roku OS itself, our software. We have built a platform that’s purpose-built for television. It’s the best software platform for television. It has lots of advantages for the entire ecosystem and for manufacturers, in particular. It allows them to build TVs that cost less and so price -- it gives them a pricing advantage. So that’s the big advantage and we continue to refine that advantage. But we do -- so software of course is a big part of what we do.
The other thing I would say is we have just world-class TV engineers. We have a great talent base. Those engineers come to work every day with the goal of making streaming better for our customers. We are a very focused and have a great engineering team.
And then the Roku -- I would say, the Roku brand itself is a very strong brand and for customers, it stands for streaming and great value. And so for those reasons and others, we have been very successful competing in the TV space. It’s a very competitive market. It’s been competitive for a long time. But we are then number one streaming OS and I believe we are going to maintain that position.
In terms of Walmart, I will just say a few words. I mean, Walmart is a big retailer, a very strong partner of Roku’s. We have a great relationship with them. They sell millions of Roku players a year. They sell millions of Roku TVs for various Roku OEMs, including TCL, Hisense, RCA, Philips, JVC.
We build -- we help them build on branded, which is their house brand, Roku TVs, smart TVs, and that’s a business that’s been growing extremely well for them. So it’s a great partnership and it’s a long-standing partnership, and we have put a lot of work into making sure that it stays strong. All right. Thank you. Steve, I have a question about OneView revenue recognition. I think on the last quarter call, you said that, you recognized at least the majority of it on a gross basis and that had an impact on the margin in the quarter? And then you said that going forward, you will be recognizing an increasing proportion of it on a net basis. So I was wondering if there was a change in impact from Q2 to Q3 from that on the margin and the Platform segment. Yeah. Hey, Vasily. Yeah. Thanks for the question on that. Yeah. You are right. I mean what I said was that the historical dataXu business there are effectively two parts, the kind of typical DSP business, which was net revenue treatment and then a historical dataXu managed service business, which was on a gross revenue basis.
And that as part of, as Scott mentioned, rebranding and sort of integrating the operations to the OneView, we were shifting people over to new service agreements and those were kind of net revenue treatment.
So that is an ongoing process. That wasn’t a significant factor in the quarter. The increase -- or the expansion of the platform gross margin, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis was largely a result of just strong margins in both the advertising and content distribution business. So that trend will continue over time as we continue to shift more of the existing client base over to the new service agreements. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks. Just wanted to dive into the ad revenue a little bit, how do we think about the funnel for your ad buys between self-service, upfront deals and maybe buys through agencies that might be using their own DSPs? And I was wondering if at some point, you might look at restricting some of your high-value inventory to dataXu? And then could you give us some color as to how much your ad revenue is more like these brand marketing campaigns or upfront campaigns versus how much is more ad hoc reach extension and how do you kind of convert somebody from a reach extension customer to something more strategic? Thank you. Scott, do you want to take that? Yeah. Sure. Well, I guess, Steven, in answer to your question, we are here to sell how marketers want to buy. It’s why we have got a media business and a DSP. It’s why we also support third-party DSPs who want to be buying on the platform.
And it’s really being able to participate in all those different ways of buying that allows us to keep expanding the segments that we serve in the ad market. We are strongest in all of those segments when a marketer comes to us and wants to take advantage of our deep first-party customer relationship, our identity, our data on users, our ability to optimize in a way that third-party ad tech cannot.
And we can employ that value proposition, whether they are buying media from us, which for example, many TV marketers do. They are IO, guaranteed Nielsen demo-driven often when they first come to the platform, all the way through to programmatic buys transacted through OneView.
Our long-term view is that most TV advertising. This will take years to play out, is transacted programmatically. And referencing back to Laura Martin’s question, that’s why we made the move in acquiring dataXu, incorporating and re-launching OneView is so that we could enable marketers to leverage our unique assets or scale regardless of how they are buying. So I hope that answers your question. I think maybe Steve wants to take the second part of your question on the -- more color on the revenue front. Yeah. It’s Steve. In terms of revenue recognition, that’s largely on the ad business related to when we run the ads. There can be some differences in the models themselves. So there can be a bit of timing, but it’s fairly straightforward. Was there a particular question within that? Yeah. I am sorry. Maybe I tossed it to you, Steve, and I think, and Steve Cahall, maybe we need clarification. But I think your question was, how do they come to the platform? Is it -- are they starting from a reach extension strategy or some other case?
I would say, what -- for TV marketers, their primary reason to come to Roku is the loss of reach within the linear pay TV ecosystem. There are just whole classes of consumers that are simply no longer reachable through linear television ad buys.
About half of TV time for adults 18 to 34 has moved to streaming. Those users are just not reachable anymore. So that’s typically what brings a marketer into the Roku fold is the desire to keep reaching them on the big screen. That said, with OneView we have the ability, of course, to help them run an omnichannel campaign to reach a user first on the television and then retarget them off-device.
And we have also seen significant growth in the performance marketing, D2C segment of marketers who have social budgets. They are optimizing to a bottom-funnel outcome, a site visit and add to cart, a product purchase, a shopper data outcome and those budgets come to us really from a different budget line at the client and they are taking advantage of our deep data assets and ability to optimize those outcomes. So I wouldn’t call those TV dollars as much as performance marketing dollars. It’s a significant growth segment for us. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open. Thanks so much. The buy side is very focused on the pandemic sort of causing a big shift in streaming and digital ad dollars and you guys referenced in your letter, some of the benefits you got as the linear TV ecosystem got gummed up with COVID. My question is how do you think this plays out once the world goes back to normal? Do you think prudent investors should be moderate -- sort of moderating their growth expectations sometimes next year or do you think the secular trends and all the steps you are taking will just allow you to power right through that without a deceleration? Thanks. This is Anthony. From my point of view, I think, what we are seeing is a trend towards streaming that’s been building for years now and I think there’s a lot of things that are causing it to accelerate and to continue to be a big trend, whether it’s better customer value, more options, the ability to save money.
There’s just a lots of content. The content that’s available on streaming has continued to build, and at this point, there’s really nothing that you can’t get by streaming. In fact, there’s more content streaming than there is on traditional pay TV now.
So I think the pandemic certainly helped accelerate that trend and maybe tipped over some things a little bit. But it’s a trend that was happening anyway and will continue to happen for some time because everyone doesn’t stream yet. So, I think, we have seen strong growth and it may moderate a little bit, but I think we are going to continue to see strong growth. I don’t know, Scott, did you want to add anything to that? Yeah. We are not going back to the way it was to be clear. I mean, I think, COVID did -- COVID triggered a lasting durable change in how CMOs and marketers are thinking about their TV ad spend. In Q3, we saw a 17% drop in linear viewing, Roku was up 54%, 92% of Roku cord cutters are very satisfied with their decision to cut the cord and aren’t planning to go back.
So I really think this is a one-way transfer function. We don’t go back to the older spending patterns, because the audience isn’t there, marketers need to follow the audience into OTT. And they stay, they stay because of the enhanced capabilities.
So I think that’s really what all this transition is helping teach marketers is that there’s a better way. There’s a more robust toolset in OTT and we see it in our own stats, nearly 100% retention among the advertisers who spend over $1 million. But these budgets are not flowing back to television, traditional TV. I mean, another proof point I got, I think, is just media companies, how they are increasingly reorganizing around streaming. And thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Rand with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. How are you guys thinking about advertisers willingness to spend, as the pandemic continues and are you seeing certain industries still holding back on advertising spend? Scott, do you want to take that? Yeah. I mean, certainly, there are some segments that are still slow to return. The ones you might expect, travel, quick-serve restaurants, things like that. But we saw a real strength in most other segments, I mentioned, CPG growing as quickly as it did. So I think that, the big news here is just the shift, the realization that COVID has helped accelerate the need to reinvest in OTT.
And of course, we are still early, proportionate to viewership. We are nowhere close to capturing the kinds of budgets that are spent in television. But the transition is very clear, in the ultimate cause of the acceleration of spending in OTT. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Hi guys. Maybe a 30,000-foot and a 5,000-foot question on the higher end, where is the measurement discussion trending in your discussions with linear buyers today? Is there any tangible measurement solutions that are on the horizon that you see more linear buyers talking about and essentially that’s loosening -- would loosen the broader bottleneck, obviously, you are seeing nice flow in linear today, but the broader bottleneck I am talking about? And then a little more micro, to what extent did political or its crowding out effect on nonpolitical spend, particularly in October, have on your pricing dynamics and where is that trending now? Scott, that’s another one. Yeah. Let me take the measurement question, in parts. So one of the reasons we invested and partnered with Nielsen years ago to enable demographic measurement in our platform is so we could provide marketers with a common currency across linear and OTT.
So -- and we have continued to add to that capability, the ability to measure reach and demographic holistically, across linear and OTT. We launched that capability years ago. We followed that with optimization using our data, to target specifically cord cutters and people who are harder to reach in linear.
This year, we followed it up with the -- with a guarantee that we would not charge marketers, if we reached somebody who had already been reached in linear. So I think we have been the market leader in providing TV advertisers with a common currency, and frankly, a bridge from linear television into OTT.
I think the really exciting stuff happens after marketers start to invest in OTT. OTT is a native digital platform that enables measurement up and down the funnel. It is an open IAB vast-based platform and so this enables, on any given ad, multiple simultaneous kinds of measurement.
We are not headed towards a world where there’s a single currency. Sometimes when people talk about measurement challenges in OTT, I think, it’s because they are harkening back to a day when there was one currency.
We are not headed towards a world where there’s one currency. There will be many and OTT will be all the more stronger for it because markets of all shapes and sizes will be able to pick and choose the currency that they care most about, which best fits their tactic.
And then you asked a question about political ad spend. As I mentioned earlier, it was a meaningful and a relatively new category for us. We weren’t particularly active during the last Congressional or Presidential cycle and so it’s an area where we have put good energy into.
And I think our platform offers powerful capabilities and was very attractive to political advertisers. That said, it wasn’t a huge portion of our overall business and so I didn’t have a substantial effect on like overall pricing or other dynamics. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Yeah. Sorry, I came in a little late. You may have already talked about it, so you can be brief. International, just give us an update on where you are in terms of rolling out both player and platform revenue, developing both player and platform revenue in international markets? Thank you. Hey, Mark. This is Anthony. I’d be happy to talk about international. We did touch on it briefly, but just to summarize, streaming, obviously, is a large international opportunity and phenomena, and we are making good progress.
And I will just give you some examples. We introduced players in Brazil, for example, following up from our TV launch several months ago in Brazil, which is off to a great start. We introduced the Streambar, which is a new 2-in-1 product that I am super excited about. The Streambar basically is a streaming player that also makes the app sound better on your TV and we launched that product in the U.S., but also in U.K., Canada and Mexico.
And so in certain markets like in the U.K., player sales doubled in the quarter, which was good progress. Canada, player sales doubled and Roku TV it’s been number one for a while in the U.S. in terms of operating systems, smart TV operating system share. It’s now number one in Canada. So good progress there. The -- then I would say the strengths that have made us successful in the United States are working as we use them in other markets as well.
If you look at our quarterly results, 43% year-over-year active account growth, which was great, I mean, I thought that was incredible, given the size of the base that we have to go on. But that active account growth came domestically, but also, there were strong international contributions to that account growth as well.
Our priority is to -- like I said, it’s to focus on active accounts first, build scale and then start layering on monetization. So really, that is still, in most markets, scale is still our primary focus. We are starting to -- we have got small ad teams in some markets, testing the market. We have launched the Roku Channel in a few markets like Canada and U.K. But the monetization really will follow and we are focusing on scale first. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got two. One is really a big picture for Anthony. You have seen this wave coming for many ways -- many years and have been predicting it. The challenge right now for big media companies, a lot of your partners, is that sports is not only one of the key parts of that whole ecosystem, but it’s also one of the biggest drivers of advertising and I think a lot of these big media companies are struggling to figure out an economic model for sports to shift to streaming. I guess, do you have any advice? I mean there’s so much money and so many ad dollars tied to sports and it’s sort of the last thing holding up the entire multi-channel bundle. How does sports -- how do they get sports into the streaming world, should they bundle it into existing channels, should they have true D2C sports streaming, like how would you advise them as they think about sports? And then I have got a follow-up on the Roku Channel. Sure. Well, I mean, I think, well, first of all, you can get sports in streaming. I mean it’s still part of the bundle, like you said, you have to sign up for a virtual MVPD usually. I mean there’s complicated deals, multiyear, 10-year deals in sports that I am not really an expert in.
But if I could wave my hand, I would -- sure, I think, the best thing for sports would be for them to start selling SVOD services like for regional sports networks as an SVOD service or the NFL as an SVOD service. I mean that’s what -- that’s, I think, the way consumers want to sign up and consume sports in a streaming world. That’s how they sign up and see other streaming products on à la carte basis. Yeah. Rich, I will just add to Anthony’s point. Yeah. Great question. And I don’t think we have a short answer for it, but just a couple of stats that you might find interesting. January to September, so sort of bridging sports going away and coming back, heavy sports fans on the Roku platform dropped their linear viewing 26% and grew their streaming 17%.
So, even as sports came back, the viewership didn’t come back, among heavy NFL viewers, we saw a 29% drop in linear and a 16% increase in streaming. So the disappearance of sports during COVID kind of accelerated the pressure on that vertical in the streaming. And the viewership, and I think, ultimately, the dollars are not going to come back in the same way long-term. That’s exactly what we are seeing in terms of the impact on ratings, and that’s why I feel like they have to figure it out. So I appreciate that answer. The other one, Scott, you have talked before about the fact that roughly three people per -- when we look at the Roku Channel numbers you released in terms of viewers, roughly three people per household is sort of the metrics so when you try to think about it relative to your active account base. So if I look at 54 million people who watch Roku Channel or reach Roku Channel. That’s like 18 million households or roughly 40% almost of your base of Roku active accounts. What do you need to do to get that base up from 40% to 75% or 80%, little on 100%, like, is it purely the content, is it awareness of the Roku Channel, like, how do you bridge that gap? I think Scott can add. But... Yeah. Go ahead, Anthony. I was just going to say like that’s getting to a big number, like 100% penetration, is obviously our goal, and that’s what we have been working on from the beginning. I mean, Roku Channel started out tiny, started out with 1,000 pieces of content, very small number of users. There’s this virtuous cycle where we promote it, we onboard more content, we get more users, we get more advertisers, then we get more content, we do more promotion, we get bigger titles.
And so that’s going -- we are just going through that virtuous cycle and it’s getting bigger and bigger as a result. It’s the fastest growing top 10 app on the Roku platform right now. So it’s -- I am confident we can get -- we can keep growing the Roku Channel. It’s still pretty small compared to where it can be. And when you say top 10, Anthony, is that minutes watched or times used or what’s the best way of thinking about that metric?
A
Reach and hours. Yeah. Both. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you both. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask Scott about social budgets and whether you think you are taking share there. Some of your peers or competitors, this earnings cycle have talked about a shift in social spend onto other platforms that are viewed as more brand safe and it would seem like that could be or is and could be a huge opportunity for Roku. So I am just wondering if that benefited the quarter, something that you are focused on even further kind of differentiating your platform versus some of those massive digital budgets out there. And then I wanted to ask Steve, just on the guidance for Q4, if I am doing the math right, I think you are guiding to platform revenue growth in the mid-50s or so. Is that deceleration just because you don’t have the sort of 606 impact that you had in 3Q, just looking for any color there? Thank you both. Hey. Ben, I will take the first part of your question. Yeah. I mean I do fundamentally think that we are able to compete for social budget. So we don’t always know which pocket the marketer is drawing the money from. But we have heard clearly that both because of exogenous factors, pricing pressure, what’s going on in the social platforms.
As well as like maybe, more importantly, the fact that we have the capabilities to optimize to the outcomes that these marketers are focused on. I mean TV has just never been able to compete there. And so that’s why our performance marketing segment, while still early, is growing much faster than our overall ad business.
And I think, by the way, that’s one of the most interesting things about OTT advertising is it isn’t just going to be a branding media or performance media, it’s going to be both all at the same time. There really isn’t an analog in any other media out there.
Linear TV is going to remain a top-funnel branding media, social media is very much a bottom funnel, OTT has the opportunity to be both and it just is going to make for a very rich ecosystem, as well as the opportunity to tap into very, very large budgets, not just TV, but also digital. And Scott, just to follow-up quickly on performance, how are you doing attribution? Is that something that you are able to tie back to mobile cross platform to really connect the -- close the loop for advertisers in performance? Yes. It’s a mix of both first-party and third-party. We have a wide array of third-party attribution partners. We have our own pixel and so marketers can pick their preferred solution in OneView. We can automatically optimize to pixel placed on an advertiser’s website according to the CPA, a performance target that a marketer provides to us. Thank you. And our last question comes from…. Yeah. Hey, Ben… I am sorry. There was a part two on that question, right? I am sorry. Yes. Sorry, Operator, there’s a second part to Ben’s question there that I want to hit. Yeah, Ben, so just on Q4, so just for the good of the order, we didn’t provide any formal guidance. But in terms of some of the color we gave in terms of how we are thinking about how the quarter could look barring in any of these significant external factors that could impact the short-term.
What I would say about the platform revenue is, certainly, we talked about how the content distribution deal revenue recognition can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. The other factors that we talked about that are platform specific was specifically lapping the dataXu acquisition, which came into the results kind of mid-Q4 of last year, as well as we are lapping some launches of new services from Q4 of last year. Thank you. And our last question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Just two quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. Just one on The Roku Channel again, so you have done a great job increasing the reach of the channel. Steve, if you can just talk about how the ad load is trending on the channel. Are you happy with that ad load as it is today? Is there room for growth? And can you address the CPM, do you think you can maintain the CPM and some investors think that over time, that has to go down, but just your thoughts on that? And the second question is, just on international expansion. You have done a great job in the U.S. You have got great distribution relationships. When we look at internationally, that’s a more fragmented market. So, are you having to hire more people on the ground who have these relationships and then in that vein, how should we think about OpEx going forward? Thank you. So I think the first question was actually for Scott on TRC and ad loads and CPM. Yeah. I will take that first question. We are quite happy with our recipe of half the load of linear television. We think it strikes the right balance between a great consumer experience, while also providing strong monetization opportunities. So we are not planning to tinker with that.
I think there’s lots of upside potential in terms of how valuable we make that inventory as well as opportunities beyond 15- second and 30-second spots. We have done some work in the market with pause ads and other ad units. So I think it’s a great consumer experience as delivered today.
Regarding your question about CPMs, OTT is just a better higher performance product and so I think it does reasonably command higher CPMs relative to, say, linear television. That said, I don’t think -- going back to the prior question, I don’t think there’s long-term one single CPM to rule them all.
In long run, in OTT, lots of different marketers, top to bottom of the funnel come into the ecosystem and compete in a common auction for ad inventory and just like you see in social media platforms, you don’t end up with a singular CPM across all users and all content. That’s one of the things I think is most interesting long term about the OTT media. There was a second part to the question, I think, Anthony would take it. Yeah. I can take the international question. As -- so, first of all, I will just reiterate that we are making good progress internationally. And yes, it was a frag -- it is a fragmented -- more fragmented market because -- and I would say, in big part because Roku was not into those countries yet. And so as we have entered countries and brought the full portfolio of our assets, we are gaining market share and consolidating a lot of the market around Roku.
So for example, Canada, I mean, a small country, but it was the first one we went into after the U.S. and now we are number one for TVs, and our player market share is very high. We have an ad sales team there. So it’s starting to look a lot like the U.S. for us.
But our -- in terms of investment, international is one of our key strategic investment areas that we view. Obviously, it takes people to do it well. We -- I mean, the way we focus is we pick our focus countries, which we keep expanding.
And then we make sure that we have local content. So we hire local people to do local content deals. We make sure we have local retailer relationships, getting into local channels, local distribution channels. We bring Roku TV to market, which requires a lot of localization. But also in many cases, specific features that are regulated or required by the government, so we add those.
We bring our players to market. We bring our audio for TV products to market. So we bring the whole portfolio of products and offer just a very complete and compelling solution. So that’s -- and then our market share starts to grow. So that’s what we are doing. Thank you. It’s working well. Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any closing comments. Thank you, Operator. I’d like to close by reiterating how pleased we are with this quarter’s results and wrap up with two concluding points. First, reaching 46 million active accounts at 43% year-over-year growth rate shows Roku’s momentum.
It reveals Roku’s scale relative to traditional pay TV providers who have continued to lose subscribers during the quarter. The pandemic is accelerating the shift away from traditional pay TV. I am confident that the shift to streaming will be permanent for the vast majority of consumers.
Second, the strength of our financial results illustrates the leverage of our business model. The leverage of our business model may deliver over longer term as we continue to execute our strategic plan.
I hope you and your families stay safe and enjoy the upcoming holidays. Thanks again for joining the call and happy streaming. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I'm pleased to report that Roku had both a record 2020 and fourth quarter. As the leading streaming platform in the U.S., Roku is more important than ever to the TV ecosystem. We connect viewers, content owners and advertisers at scale in a virtuous cycle that creates value for all participants.
In 2020, Roku active accounts grew by 14 million accounts to over 51 million, and streaming hours grew 55%. Monetized video ad impressions were up over 100% in Q4, rebounding to pre-COVID growth levels.
Across the industry the impact of streaming is increasingly evident. Consumers are cutting the cord fully-a-third of all American Homes are now non-pay-TV households. Leading media companies are reorienting around streaming and launching new streaming services. The traditional TV upfronts are beginning to crumble, as advertisers demand more flexibility, better measurement and a broader audience. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2020 and excited about the large opportunities that lie ahead in the streaming decade.
With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony.
2020 was the year that showcased our strong position and resilience. Along with rest of the world, Roku was forced to respond to wide-ranging impacts of a global pandemic. We executed well in the face of many challenges and delivered record results for Q4 as well as the full-year.
Before taking your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and address outlook. In Q4, we grew our active account base by over 5 million resulting in a record 14.3 million incremental active accounts for the year. And we ended 2020 with 51.2 million active accounts. Our scale has extended rapidly over the last several years. And to put it in perspective, Roku's U.S. active account base is more than twice the size of the video subscribers of the largest cable company in the U.S.
In addition to increasing our scale, we continue to see growing engagement with our platform, with 2020 streaming hours up 20.9 billion year-over-year to a record 58.7 billion hours. In Q4, we grew streaming hours 55% year-over-year, consistent with the year-over-year growth rate for the full-year. Furthermore, we grew average streaming hours per active account, 10% year-over-year in Q4, demonstrating the strong engagement of our user base.
As a reminder, please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter and the fiscal year. But I'll highlight a few items. In Q4, total revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $649.9 million. Platform segment revenue was up 81% year-over-year to a record $471.2 million, driven by strong advertising demand. Q4 player revenue growth of 18% year-over-year was slightly lower than the growth rate in Q4 2019, as COVID restrictions and economic uncertainty muted holiday store traffic and consumer demands.
Our key financial performance metric is gross profit, which grew a vigorous 89% year-over-year in Q4, to a record $305.5 million. Gross margin in the quarter was 47%, fairly consistent sequentially as improvements in platform margin largely offset the seasonally lower player margins, based on our holiday promotions.
Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $113.5 million produced the vast majority of our record $150 million of adjusted EBITDA for the year, and was the result of a confluence of strong performance. Robust revenue growth, strong gross profit leverage as we continue to move into higher margin platform business and leverage on OpEx growth in part due to our decision to be more conservative on account growth in 2020.
It also demonstrates the potential leverage in our business, as we continue to drive scale and increase monetization of the platform. We ended the quarter with almost $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.
With that, let's turn to our thoughts on the outlook. We believe we have sufficient visibility into Q1 to offer a formal outlook. But as we move further into the future, a number of uncertainties make a formal outlook for 2021 difficult, rather we have provided some directional color for how we see the full year playing out for Roku.
Historically, Q1 is our seasonally softest quarter from a revenue perspective. Typically revenue has been roughly 25% lower sequentially than our seasonally strong Q4. Our Q1 outlook calls for similar seasonality at the midpoint of total revenues of $485 million, up 51% year-over-year, with the Platform segment comprising roughly 3/4 of total revenue.
We anticipate total gross profit of roughly $238 million at the midpoint of 69% year-over-year, implying an overall gross margin of approximately 49%. Platform gross margin is expected to be roughly 60%, while player gross margin is expected to be similar to Q1 2020.
As a reminder, Q1 player gross margin is seasonally high, reflecting the traditionally lighter promotional period within the retail calendar. For the full-year, we will continue our established and successful strategy of managing player gross margins to roughly zero, given our focus on device sales as an important driver of account growth.
We anticipate Q1 OpEx year-over-year growth to be in a similar year-over-year growth range as Q4, and thus showing strong leverage against revenue and gross profit growth, which is expected to result in a Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $31 million at the midpoint.
For modeling purposes, please note that Q1 adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based excludes stock-based compensation of roughly $40 million and an estimated $10 million of depreciation and amortization and net other income.
In terms of the full-year, we are mindful that in 2021 year-over-year comparisons are likely to be quite volatile. In the first half of the year, we expect strong financial comparisons against the first half of 2020, which includes early impacts from COVID-19 and the resulting economic lockdown.
While in the second half of the year, we anticipate much tougher comparisons in part due to our record performance in the second half of 2020, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates.
We expect our overall 2021 gross margin to be in the mid-40% range as platform margin remains fairly stable, and we operate the Player segment at a gross margin close to zero. Given the size of our opportunity and progress to date, we will continue to aggressively invest in our business to enhance our competitive differentiation and seed future growth.
We anticipate the growth rate in operating expenses for 2021 to be more in line with 2019 year-over-year organic OpEx growth levels, versus 2020 when we took precautionary steps at the outset of the pandemic to manage down the rate of expense growth.
As I was preparing for this earnings call, I read my remarks from a year ago. It was very gratifying to read that we've materially surpassed our original outlook for 2020 revenue of $1.6 billion, despite an unprecedented global health crisis and the related economic hardships that took place over the course of the year. It was also very grounding to read a historical comparison from that call, which I will update and reprice here.
Our 2020 revenue of almost $1.8 billion represents over two times 2018 revenue, three times 2017 revenue, four times 2016 revenue and five times 2015 revenue. This sustained level of robust earnings growth speaks to the strong fundamentals of our business. The strategic advantages we have achieved through our investments, and our laser focused leadership in streaming. We continue to be excited by the significant opportunities for Roku that lie ahead.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Wanted to ask you about the Quibi content acquisition, I think it would be good to hear, just your thoughts on why now is the right time to make the move into exclusive content?
And then maybe more broadly, should we think of this as more of an opportunistic when our purchase or does that signal perhaps a broader ambition with exclusive content? And then just as a quick follow-up, any details you can provide for Quibi, specifically just on when it will be available on the platform or how long you have the exclusive rights? Thank you. Hi, Corey, this is Anthony. Thanks for the question. Let me start by just talking a little bit about the Roku Channel and then explaining how Quibi fits into that. It's a deal that we did for the Roku Channel. So if you just look at overall platform growth of the Roku platform, last year we added 14 million incremental accounts across 51 million active accounts, but if you look at the Roku Channel specifically its growing twice as fast as the platform overall.
So reach and streaming hours of the Roku Channel are growing twice the platform rate. We now - the Roku Channel now reach households with approximately 63 million viewers. So the Roku Channel is doing extremely well for us and we're adding content continuously to Roku Channel from a bunch of different sources. We added almost 100 - we added about 100 million linear channels in 2020 to the Roku Channel.
We added content from Disney, NBC, A&E, Discovery and more. So the Roku Channel is definitely benefiting from this virtuous cycle, where more viewers bring in more advertisers, more advertising dollars brings in more content, deeper content, better content, and then that cycle continues. So with that sort of backdrop that's - as our scale grows, we are looking - we're sourcing, different types of content and we're looking at different types of content.
So Quibi, the Quibi deal fits into that, in a sense that, its premium content was great content. We think it will appeal to Roku viewers. And so, and - it was a transaction where we acquired the global content rights on a cost-effective basis. We're disciplined about making sure the content we onboard into the Roku Channel fits into the AVOD business model for the Roku Channel, and there could be content fit into that model.
The growing scale of the Roku Channel allows us to do deals like this, where perhaps we couldn't have done them a couple of years ago. We expect that to continue as the scale grows, we'll continue to look more broadly at all the different types of content that we can acquire and we'll be disciplined about making sure that, that content purchase price fits into - whether it's licensed or purchase or whatever the financial details are fit into our AVOD business model.
In terms of rolling out the Quibi content, I don't think we've announced that, it will be fairly same. And I don't know, Scott, if you had - anything you want to add about the specifics of the Quibi rollout and the exclusive rights and that sort of thing? Yes, I will tag in here, Cory. We're excited about the content, 75 TV series, hundreds of hours. And any nominations we'll be rolling them out, those out progressively through the year. And Q have a multi-year exclusive rights to exploit the content. So we're excited to get it out there, stay tuned for our launch timing. And our next question coming from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Thanks so much and congrats guys on a great year. Just a couple, I guess, unrelated questions. First on the stable gross margin outlook for the year, Steve, I was just curious if there was any new upward or downward pressures on platform gross margin that you would like to point out that we should pay attention to? Yes, hey Mark. Yes, as you mentioned, we didn't provide formal outlook for 2021 overall. We did mention in the formal outlook for Q1, about the upper margins being around 60%, and then remaining kind of roughly stable for the year. As a reminder, there is a lot because in the platform, so there is always considerations of the underlying margin structures stay within the ad business, through the content business and then the mix of the different pieces.
But overall, I don't think there are any significant trends I would point out. I mean, the business in general has very good momentum and over the back half of 2020, we saw some good uplift in the platform margins. So we're very happy with where the business is, both in terms of strong growth on the top-line and stable margins looking ahead. Okay. And then real quick on - that's helpful. On ARPU, just curious how much downward pressure you're seeing there in terms of outside U.S.? It's obviously been strong and just curious if that implies that OUS has not have a lot of downward pressure or when do you expect to see that? And perhaps maybe break out OUS and U.S. separately there? Sure, yes certainly, the U.S. is by far the most lucrative ARPU potential market and the U.S. as a market is much further ahead, the rest of the world. And historically, the vast majority of our account base has been in the U.S. Certainly we are growing our international presence and we mentioned in the letter some great stats around the fact that the playbook - the kind of three-phase playbook around growing scale, driving engagement and eventually monetizing, is working well internationally.
And so that is true, but we are focused on driving scale and engagement in the international market. So the ARPU is significantly lower on that. So it is definitely is that dilutive effect on the overall ARPU. In terms of visibility yes, we understand that international is a strategic investment area and that visibility that would be helpful for investors. And so, we're working on breaking that out, so stay tuned, in the future we'll have some more visibility for you. And our next question coming from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. I think I have a couple for Scott. Number one, you used to - every quarter before the big [SWAT] services launched, you used to say that, this is our overall streaming hours growth, then SWAT streaming hours growing slower than that and then ad supported faster than that?
So now that you have this massive apps launching, I wonder what that, what those relative growth rates are? And also following up on that is, are you worried at all that Peacock's world and HBO prices will cannibalize ad supported streaming hours? And if not, where do you think their viewership is coming from? Thank you. Vasily, thanks for the questions. Yes, you're right, we have not delineated the growth of the different verticals recently, but if it remains true that ad supported viewing on the platform continues to grow faster than the platform overall and then the other segments. And just as a reminder, when we talk about ad-supported viewing, we would include dual revenue stream services, like Peacock, that are both subscription-based and carry ads.
Now with regards to your question about, whether these services will cannibalize AVOD consumption? First of all, they either in the case of Peacock already carry ads or in the case HBO Max plan to carry ads. I think we're led mostly by the fact that, these services launching are drawing more consumers into streaming. They're creating an even better case for consumers to cut the cord and move more of their viewership to Roku, to streaming.
And that then accrues to deeper engagement across the board, inclusive of ad supported viewing. And it's furthermore helpful that, all of the recent direct-to-consumer services have an ad supported strategy in place, because that bolsters the overall narrative in the market, that we've been on for years now, about the importance of advertisers investing in OTT. So all-in-all, we continue to launch of these services to be a good thing for Roku, for consumers and for advertisers. Thank you. Very helpful. A quick follow-up. And do you see in your data that viewership in general aggregating to the big apps like the bigger ones that keep getting bigger and the smaller ones falling by the wayside? Or does it stay equally fragmented? Wonder, if you have any comment on that. Well, what I'd say is that, it's a very vibrant market now, with all of these big well-funded services competing for consumer intention. That's good for Roku, because we're in the business of distributing these services and helping them grow.
So we've been able to partner more deeply with a broader set of content providers. And of course it's great for the consumer, because it just makes their streaming experience on Roku even richer. So we think it's good and has driven actually more robust competition among the services and the consumers ultimately the winner. Thank you very much. Vasily, this is Anthony. I'll just add that, we - as we've mentioned in the past and it still continues to be true. If we think about competition in our advertising business, really, it's not other services on our platform, it's - the primary impediment to our ad business growth, which is still growing obviously very nicely with monetized ad impressions doubled again in Q4.
But the biggest impediment to growth is just the behavior of TV ad buyers and how they traditionally - buy traditionally linear TV. And the shift of those behaviors to streaming which the pandemic, I think has definitely caused that to move faster than it was before. That's the big - that's probably the biggest obstacle to our - obviously it's not a long-term obstacle, but that's sort of biggest short-term obstacle to our ad business. And our next question coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong quarter. I was wondering if you can talk about programmatic ad spend. Do you see industry ad budgets moving more towards programmatic spend? And in that vein, can you talk a little bit about how the dataxu, OneView platform is performing? And what percent of your ad revenues are coming from that today, and how do you see that progressing over time? And I have a follow-up. Sure. That sounds like a question for Scott. Hi, Ruplu. Thanks for the question. Let me just take it in reverse order. So 2020 was a great year for OneView, a foundational year. And just a reminder of our value proposition with OneView, we have natively integrated Roku first-party identity data and measurement capabilities and enabled buyers through OneView to access the same capabilities, that have caused them to be buying Roku media for years. Now, applied to when they're buying third-party media.
OneView has deepened our agency holding company relationships. And licensing of OneView as a component of the upfront agreements that we wrote in Q4, with all the major agency holding companies. Just by way of example, we got brands like Lexus, using OneView to now measure and optimize their spend across linear television and OTT.
And using it to achieve better reach for the same dollar. So it's sort of a perfect use case for OneView, is optimizing your TV spend across dozens of apps and linear television all at the same time with Roku data powering it.
Now regarding your - the other part of your question, and the world is programmatic, it is true today that the majority of the spending in OTT is still a more traditional spending pattern. Insertion Order based, and that's largely because most of the money - the early money that's flowed into OTT has come out of TV budgets and that's generally the way TV has been spent historically. But programmatic is rising quickly, it's a key part of why we've been investing in OneView.
And we do believe long-term, although it's not the case today, that programmatic will be a majority of how OTT is bought and sold, not the least of which because programmatic is a superior way to leverage our data, to leverage measurement to do dynamic optimization of your spend. So in short, our strategy is to sell the way buyers want to buy, they're still buying both ways. It's still predominantly traditional, but we do believe that, it will be heavily programmatic over time. Thanks for the details on that, Scott. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask about international growth again, just to follow-up on a prior question. How would you measure success in 2021? So if you can just kind of give us your playbook for this year, I mean, what are your targets for international expansion? And overall, how would you measure success this year in international? I mean, if you can just provide any details on what your thoughts are for international, that would be great. Thank you so much. Yes. This is Anthony, I'll take that. Obviously streaming is a global phenomena, and we got our start in the U.S. and are doing extremely well here. But we are investing internationally, and I would say a few things, I guess, about that and how that's going. First of all, one of our strategy is to take the technology we developed, the strategies that have worked for us in the U.S., the products we developed.
And the market trends, we believe, which translate from the U.S. to international markets and translate those strategies and market entry points to international markets. And so that's what we're doing and that's working well for us. We're finding that the assets we have work well internationally, as well as in the U.S., as well as our domestic market.
Another kind of higher level point I guess is our international strategy involves the same, the same three phases business model that that we adopted in U.S., which is focus first on growing active accounts, then on increasing engagement and then our monetization. And so, internationally we're still primarily in the growing active account phase, although we are certainly making some progress on monetization.
I think just some examples of progress we've made recently in international, as well as being the number one TV OS in the United States. We're also the number one TV OS in Canada, with 31% of the TV market - smart TV market. We expanded in Brazil about a year ago, first with TVs and then also players. We recently added another TV partner to Brazil, which is also doing well. So our progress in Brazil is good, we're happy with that.
We recently introduced a new player product called the Streambar, which is a two in product that includes better audio for your TV, as well as streaming. We launched that in the U.S. and the UK, Canada and Mexico, all at the same time, that products is also doing well. So I think success for us, international is to keep doing what we're doing, which is adding more TV partners to international markets.
We also announced last year that we were going to be working with TCL more internationally, so continuing to add more TV OEMs, continuing to grow the scale of each of the existing OEMs international. We're obviously going to continue to look at TV companies. And then as our scale starts, as we're also - sorry, we're also going to continue to look at potentially new countries as long, does that make sense.
Then I think, just overall, as active account growth starts to build significant scale, lean more into monetization. So far, we've launched, for example, the Roku Channel in the UK and Mexico. So we'll be doing more of that over time as well. Our next question coming from the line of Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Thanks for the question. It looks like monetized impressions accelerated again this quarter. So maybe, could you help us think about the drivers of that growth in monetized impressions? It'd be great if you could kind of split that out between growth trends in home screen ads and the Roku Channel, and then the non-Roku content apps that have advertising. And if we wanted to kind of then layer in your ad revenue over that monetized impressions, maybe just help us think about, what like the effect of CPM is kind of doing in all that? And then I have a - just a quick housekeeping one. Sure. So, Scott, I'll take that. But before - I just want to correct something, I said. I think, I misspoke, I said the Roku Channel was in Mexico, it's actually in the U.K. and Canada. But Scott, do you want to take that? Yes. Hi, Steve, I'll take your question. The growth of our ad business is the result of - as we highlighted in prior quarters, just ongoing major secular changes, accelerated by the pandemic. Just for context in traditional television there is 21% decline in broadcast primetime ratings last year, according to Nielsen.
Even as rates in the upfronts have gone up, 13%, due primarily to scarcity. And the median age of the viewer of the top three broadcast networks is now over six years old. This pattern is not sustainable for TV marketers and the pandemic really accelerated the decision by marketers, by advertisers to right size their investment towards streaming.
And then on the side of streaming, there is all sorts of stats to support why there should be more spending, half of adults, 18 to 34 - half of their viewing is now streamed at 30 U.S. households and cord cutters.
In our universe, 92% of Roku accounts to cut the quarter very happy, and don't plan to go back. Streaming hours as we mentioned in the shareholder letter, up 55%. So all of these changes are really accruing to driving a major shift towards OTT streaming.
In Q4, we mentioned in the shareholder letter, the six largest agency holding company is more than doubled their spend with us. That's notable because, those are the same agencies that control the vast majority of TV ad spending. So I think that's a pretty good indication of kind of a permanent reallocation of TV money.
And then just digging down a level, we see strength in a whole bunch of categories beyond just traditional TV dollars, TV spending, sponsorships was a very fast-growing segment for us. Performance-based advertising, this is advertising, where the marketer is optimizing for something other than reach or demographics, nearly quadrupled in the year. We are seeing strength in retail as well, and CPG. And then our endemic category, app and content marketing is also seeing strength. So strength across the Board, but particularly strong growth in those segments. Sorry, go ahead, Anthony. I was just going to add that if I think about bigger picture, these changes that we - the progress that was made in 2020, more and more viewers shifting to streaming for their TV. More advertisers following their viewers to streaming. More content companies launching major new streaming services. I mean, these are enduring structural changes that we don't think are just being pulled forward. Some business being full forward, we think that the pandemic has accelerated and permanently changed the curve on the shift to streaming. That's great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the outlook for cost. So it looks like a lot of acceleration this year. Could you maybe elaborate as a lot of that going to be in either R&D or marketing or kind of shared both? And I think it implies that maybe you have a little less EBITDA this year than you did in 2020, is that conservatism? Or is that just that you really want to push the gaps on investing in the business with a really strong top line and active account growth trends? Thanks. Steve, this is Anthony. I'll just - I'll offer my thoughts and I think Steve Louden can provide some more color in detail. At a high level, streaming is a huge global opportunity. We're still in pretty early days. I mean, obviously its mainstream and we're seeing big changes. But given the fact that there is a 1 billion broadband households in the world and they're all going to watch their TV through streaming someday. So it's a huge opportunity. And scenario that, we're going to - and we're a leader, obviously the leader in the United States, and growing rapidly in international.
So it's an area we're going to keep investing in. We're going to invest in growth, investing and improving and expanding our competitive advantages. But - and scenario we're going to keep focusing on. I mean, we are focused obviously on building a large profitable business and that's what Roku will be.
But at this point, we are trying to keep funnel as much as we can back into improving our competitive advantages and growing faster. And some of our key investment areas like Roku TV, international, the Roku Channel and advertising.
But Steve, did you want to add something to that? Sure. Yeah, in terms of kind of the pacing of the OpEx, obviously, we have more control over that, than we do some of the uncertainties around the full-year on revenue growth and some of these external factors, which is why, we've given kind of more specific color on OpEx versus the top of the P&L.
And just a reminder, the end of Q1 of 2020 was when the lockdown started happening, when the scale of the pandemic started to reveal itself. And so ourselves and a lot of other companies - we proactively managed down the rate of growth that we have been doing. We primarily did that through slowing the pace of headcount. And then there is also some other OpEx and CapEx measures, that we took, that we thought were prudent at the time.
As Anthony mentioned, the business has proved resilient and we think there is a lot of great opportunity had, and some of these structural just have been accelerated from COVID. And so we feel more comfortable investing aggressively. I point you to the shareholder letter, we talk about some examples, The OpEx is broad-based in terms of how we're going to invest. Certainly we're an R&D company at heart and we have a lot of engineers though.
R&D projects on things like new features, technology, bringing more contents to the platform, growing the sales and marketing efforts. That's really around continuing to drive increased scale and engagement of the user base. And then the other thing we're investing for the future is, we think streaming is a global phenomenon.
And so we're building out the G&A infrastructure to support a global scale business. So there is a lot of - I mean, we're very fortunate, there is a lot of great things on our roadmap. And so there is no dearth of high ROI projects to go green light. And so, that's why we feel comfortable kind of moving the OpEx growth back to the pre-pandemic levels that we saw. Our next question coming from the line of Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Your line is now open It's Ryan on for Shyam. Just first, how are you thinking about your content acquisition strategy going forward after the Roku Channel on post the liquidity acquisition? And then secondly on offer through advertising. Is there any update there, how is that progressing? And what is the progress on the cross-selling of traditional Roku O&O advertisers to off Roku CTV advertising? Thanks. Hi, Ryan. This is Anthony, I'll take the first part of that question and then Scott can take the second part. I mean, like I said before, the Roku Channel is benefiting from this virtuous cycle of describing more advertising dollars, more content and we're viewing. And I think that, I'm confident that trend is going to continue for some time.
It's growing faster than the platform, overall, double the rate of platform, which is also growing quite nicely. And I would just say, we are not going to detail specifically our exact content plans and the strategy. But I think the big picture is that, one, we're focused on and AVOD business model, which means licensing or sourcing content that is profitable on a AVOD at supported basis.
But, two, as our scale grows, we have more options, the type of content that we can source that message, that whether it's licensing or an acquisition of global content rights, like we did for Quibi. I mean, we're open minded, and we're going to continue to look at ways to strategically source content, that will drive growth of the Roku Channel in a profitable AVOD business model. So that's what we plan to do.
Scott, I don't know if you want to add or take that? Yes, let me add to that and then I'll answer Ryan your question about advertising our platform. I mean, just to build on Anthony's comments, one important thing to know about the Roku Channel is it's another increasingly essential outlet for rights holders to able to reach an incremental audience, apart from or in addition to whatever D2C strategy they may have.
So there is a certainly inbound interest in participating in the Roku Channel, because of its scale, because of its user engagement because of our monetization potential. So it opens up just a lot of different avenues to source content for the Roku Channel over time. Beyond just say, for example, the Quibi type deal, that we just did.
Regarding your question about off-platform advertising, so our greatest strength in working with an advertisers data, the identity our optimization and measurement capabilities that we have both when we sell media and when advertisers use our ad platform, OneView. And one of the most potent way is that we go off platform, is to shown an advertiser, that we could deliver off-platform effects, resulting from their buying on Roku.
So just, like as an example, we've talked in the past about our Kroger, Shopper Data partnership, that's data - that's about actual in-store activity, the purchase of CPG products. And we've used that with Kroger, with brands like Jiff, The Peanut Butter brand to show that exposure of ads on Roku leads to a lift in site visits, in product sales. And ultimately for Jiff an increased share of wallet versus their competitors.
Likewise, with Winn-Dixie, the retailer, we've been able to show through our device graph, through our data and through both an examination of on-platform traffic and off-platform traffic, that their ads with Roku drove 56% more web traffic, and increase the likelihood of a consumer going to a Winn-Dixie store by 76%.
OneView is a full omnichannel DSP, and so it can execute simultaneously across media, that Roku is selling, on the Roku platform. Media, that publishers on the Roku platform are selling third-party OTT desktop and mobile. But the particular sweet spot for us as a company is when we're able to help a brand, bring data or activity off the platform, onto Roku to re-target the user or to follow user of Roku to be able to verify and show site visitation lifts, retail store visit lift, product purchase lift. That's where our off-platform advertising capabilities really excel. And our next question coming from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open. Maybe a couple of philosophical questions. Anthony, one of the big selling points when we are taking this company public was that, you didn't have channel conflict, you represented everybody equally. But when you do a Quibi deal, and you give them money, and you only have like a two or three-year license period. Doesn't that create channel conflict, because you're incented to drive viewers an ad revenue there.
And while that might not matter in the U.S., because you're huge and what's anything we're going to do, the minute you get offshore, if potential joiners to your offshore channel, think you're going to go into competition with them, because you're going to own or buy license local channel - local content. I'm just really interested in how you think about the economics of - because their data, I'm sure you can buy lots of content that makes money.
And then Steve for you, this is the call every year where you tell us that EBITDA is going to be breakeven for the year forward. And you were very careful not to say that during this call. So, I'm wondering philosophically [technical difficulty] number for Q4. Do we actually have - can we outlook a higher zero EBITDA this year in 2021? Thanks guys. Hi, Laura. It's nice to hear from you. So yes, philosophically, the way I think about our platform is that, it's a content distribution platform. Obviously, there is other important components to it. It's an ad platform, it's a great experience for reviewers. But the core is we help content owners and publishers distribute their content. And there is a lot of content out there, it's available on a lot of different business models. Content owners are looking for ways to monetize their content. So we - so we have multiple ways to do that.
We don't - you said, used the word channel conflicts, we don't view anything we do really as channel conflict. I mean, if we think - if you think about the Roku Channel, versus say some on building an app and publishing it in our app store or channel store. I mean, those options are both available to content owners, sometimes content owners like say ABC News, they'll be both, they'll distribute their content through the Roku Channel, or they'll write an app. Some content owners do just one. Some content owners - so some of them do, just do an app - just distribute the content to the Roku Channel.
I think the point is that, there is only so many companies that have the scale and expertise to launch a successful direct to consumers service. But there is lots of other midsize or large content services that won distribution in the Roku Channel, for many of those is a better way to distribute that service.
Because we build the audience for them, we provide the monetization whether it's billing or subscription or advertising. We managed retention, we do recommendations, I mean, we have an incredible UI team, I mean, it's very complicated proposition to build a successful AVOD or SVOD services. So aggregating those viewers and being that solution works well for a lot of content owners, so - and content services.
So I think we view them as all very, very complementary. I think you mentioned two or three years for Quibi - I'm not sure we've ever talked about what the actual deal terms were, but that's not two or three years. So, and then - so Scott, if you have anything to add to that before I move on to EBITDA, with Steve? Yes, I think that was great. Steve, you want to take Laura's EBITDA question? Sure. Hi, Laura. Yes, in terms of our perspective, we still think it's early days in the shift to streaming. But certainly we're getting more and more proof points that the - our position is strong and there is a lot of opportunity ahead in streaming. And so for us, one of the things that's important is to invest to maintain and grow our competitive differentiation, and to see future growth. And so that's why we're going to continue to invest aggressively in different aspects of the business model. And certainly we didn't give formal guidance around the top part of the funnel.
In terms of the revenue growth, obviously the business has had very strong momentum, especially in the back half of 2020. And we put out formal outlook for continued robust growth over 50% in Q1. But then we're going to be facing tougher comps. So difficult to say where the EBITDA will line up for the year.
But I do think, Q4 is a great example of, a confluence of - continue driving scale, robust growth on the monetization coming together and producing significant EBITDA in Q4. And it shows that, it really does show the potential leverage in the business model, and we think over time we'll grow a large and very profitable business. Our next question coming from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Thanks. I have a couple. Can I ask you a bit about the Roku Channel, you see it turned on Amazon? I know you announced the development of Amazon - Roku Channel on Amazon. Is there a noticeable difference of consumption, maybe on the Roku platform versus off the platform? That's one.
And two is, if you can help us at all, getting under the hood of maybe advertising revenue number. I know, people trying to ask that, which is anything to help us on maybe Roku sellout levels, fill rates there. And I guess, price per impression, how that's trended over 2020? That really will be helpful. Thanks. Scott, that's for you. Yes, okay. Hi, Michael, I'll take both those questions. So with regards to the Roku Channel, our biggest opportunity as we said in the past, is on our own platform, where we know the consumer deeply, where we have full access to the promotional tools, the ability to personalize the experience for the user and great monetization capabilities.
We do and will take the opportunity to take the Roku Channel off-platform where we see an opportunity. But to be clear, the biggest and best growth opportunity in our primary focus is on the Roku Channel, on our own platform. With regards to your question about the composition of ad revenue, where I'd say this yes, the sell rate - sell out levels.
We've mentioned in the past, that we still exist in that supply-rich environment. And that our biggest challenge or biggest competition ultimately is competing dollars away from the traditional TV spending pattern. We're making great progress there, as I mentioned earlier in the call, in tracking those dollars, and I do think there is a fundamental shift that was affected in 2020, as a result of the pandemic.
OTT remains a premium product. And so prices quite well relative to television generally. But I think it's also important to recognize that there is a whole other class of advertisers coming into OTT, who either couldn't invest or couldn't invest much in television, because as a medium, it didn't work for them. I didn't give them the performance credentials, the measurement that they needed.
And so these are advertisers who may have historically invested much more heavily in social media, in search, in display advertising. We're now able and interested in participating in OTT, because of the ability to measure and optimize. And those advertisers are not always going to be buying on a traditional CPM basis. Some of them are going to be buying on a performance basis, the cost-per-click, cost-per-action basis. And this I think is one of the most interesting characteristics of OTT, as a medium.
Is its future not simply a top of funnel branding medium like television or a bottom funnel performance media like social and search it's both? And so advertisers of all shapes and sizes are going to be competing in a, ultimately a common auction, to reach the user and the pricing models the variety of financial and marketing tactics, that those marketers use are going to be quite varied. I hope that answers your question. It does. Can I ask you a quick follow-up? When we see social, have really strong impression quarters, you see with Facebook, the price compression drops because of what you said the auction brings in a lot more types of advertisers, all different types of requirements?
So is it fair to assume when we see big surges in impressions is potentially the price compression is just get weaker simply by the supply of impression to the marketplace? Is that a fair assumption? We're trying to build a model to try to predict advertising growth? Right, yes, it is the case in social media, that when supply goes up a lot, auction prices go down. Also, that's not is a bad thing for the social platform, because the greater volume allows them drive more effect for the advertiser. And of course you can cut the other way, as pressure in the auction increases, it can drive prices up, and that may be disconnected from what the advertiser thinks the impression is ultimately were.
We mentioned in our shareholder letter, I think an interesting case study with friendly, a virtual MVPD service who, actually took social media money and moved it to Roku, their goal is of course to acquire subs. And they saw a near 16 times lift in sign-ups and 65% better return, relative to their social media investments. And so, while it's still early, I think in terms of OTT competing in that pond - in that bucket.
It has all the credentials, all the data and identity. It's been a big part of our investment, with OneView to be able to compete for advertiser budgets, when those budgets are mostly focused on bottom funnel impact. I recognize, that might not get you where you looking for in terms of the model, but that is the dynamic we see playing out. And our next question coming from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is open. If you're a brand and you want to reach connected TV viewers, I was wondering if you could just help us understand the difference between two different scenarios. One, you go out and you buy Hulu or Peacock direct. And a portion of that ad time that you're buying ends up on Roku devices?
Choice two as you buy Roku directly and a portion of your spend may end up on a Hulu or a Peacock or even both? I guess, if I'm thinking about this, if I'm a marketer or a brand, why do I buy Roku direct versus the other way around? And what is buying Roku direct achieve, that simply can't be achieved by buying from the program or directly and ending up on the Roku device? Scott, you want to take that? Yes, hey Rich. I guess the short answer is, it's a both in, not an either or. These content partners are our partners and our goal as an ad business is to complement, not compete with them. There are many reasons of course that you might buy directly with the network or an app on our platform. For example, it could be part of a broader cross-platform buy your upfront commitment. Good, if I leave that aside, if I just leave the upfront aside and say there is no upfront in a world where like, you just had to put a dollar to work. Why would I put a dollar into directly, what is the advantages that I get by buying Roku, that I can't get by throwing it into a broader buy? Yes. So, it's a - go ahead, Anthony, yes. I was just going to say, one advantage is the ability that we also have access to what linear ads that you've been seeing through our ACR in our Roku TVs. And so in terms of unduplicated reach, we can help you do that. And apps - say it doesn't have that data, can't really do that. Yes, so just to build on that. So one key reason Rich, is the ability to reach users that aren't going to reach just through those select couple of publisher direct buys. So one of the things we regularly do with our advertisers is produce it only both view of who they reached with each of their buys. And we do that with linear too. And we regularly show them that even though, for example, they're heavily invested in Hulu, they didn't reach this whole other big class of users.
Because they're either not active with those other publishers or they're not holistically optimizing across linear and their whole OTT buy. There are a lot of other reasons that advertisers invest directly with us. One is, we excel at optimizing for performance using data. We've been investing for years in our data, in our ad stack and we excel there. We're not in the business as you know of selling contact.
So if you got a buy the office, you got to buy a specific show, you're going to do that directly with the network. But if you're optimizing for reach and frequency and performance, investing with Roku is a key factor. The other thing I'll mention here is that, OneView is a key component in this discussion.
One of the reasons we've invested so heavily in the OneView feasibility is - so that in the case where you're doing a publisher direct buy, you could still leverage Roku identity, Roku data and capabilities to help optimize that publisher direct buy, against all your other activity. Right so, but I'm just thinking out loud like if the ultimate - what you just said Scott to me is the most important. But want to optimize for reach, frequency and performance. I can't think of anything else. Just optimizing, so that, I can be on this - as that seem sub-optimal to optimizing for reach, frequency and performance? Our focus as a company is on data and performance and outcomes for advertisers. But there are lots of reasons why advertisers also care about context and want to be in that show. And that's not our lot, that's the - focus and capability of a lot of networks. But look, we agree we're focused on leveraging our data in our tech and capabilities to drive outcomes for advertisers, and help them orchestrate their OTT investment, even in the case where they're doing it directly with the publisher. And that's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for closing remarks. Thanks. Before we end the call, I do want to say one more thing, 2020 was a challenging year for businesses, but it was also a difficult time for people everywhere. The team at Roku did an incredible job, under extraordinary circumstances. And I want to say thank you to everyone. Together, we have a great future ahead of us.

I'll your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
And I will now turn the call over to Conrad Grodd. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.
I'm joined on the call today by Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO. Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, General Manager of our Platform business, who will be available for Q&A.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Conrad, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. I am pleased to report that Roku delivered an exceptional first quarter, driven by strength in platform monetization. This quarter, we saw that advertisers are increasingly moving money to streaming. The Roku Channel's virtuous cycle is attracting viewers, advertisers, content partners and the creative community.
And streaming services are taking advantage of the tools Roku offers to help build audience and make their streaming business successful. We believe the inevitability of streaming is clear and that Roku's business model allows us to optimize streaming for all stakeholders, including viewers, advertisers and content partners.
With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. In Q1, we exceeded our outlook for revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA and continue to make significant operational and financial progress.
Before taking your questions, I'll walk through highlights and discuss our approach to outlook, given the current level of macro uncertainty. We added 2.4 million incremental active accounts in Q1, ending the quarter with 53.6 million.
Sales of player units were up 14% year-over-year, while average selling price decreased 2% year-over-year. Roku users streamed 18.3 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 49% year-over-year. Platform monetization continued to increase with ARPU of $32.14 on a trailing 12-month basis, up 32% year-over-year.
Total Q1 revenue increased a record 79% year-over-year to $574.2 million. Platform segment revenue was up 101% year-over-year to $466.5 million, representing 81% of total revenue, while player revenue growth of 22% year-over-year was in line with our expectations.
Our key financial metric, gross profit grew a record 132% year-over-year in Q1 to $326.8 million, resulting in a record gross margin of 57%. The player gross margin of 14% was higher-than-expected due to fewer promotions, owing in part to tight inventory related to supply chain disruptions.
As a reminder, Q1 is traditionally a lighter promotional period in the retail calendar, resulting in higher-than-average player gross margins. Platform gross margin of 67% and was also more-than-expected due to a favorable mix of higher-margin activities as a result of new direct-to-consumer launches with investments in audience development and positive 606 accounting impacts from increases in the estimated lifetime deal values of our content distribution agreement.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $125.9 million exceeded our outlook due to the outperformance in Platform monetization. Q1 OpEx was $251 million, up 28% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 was the last quarter before we begin lapping our actions in 2020 to slow the rate of OpEx and CapEx growth to manage COVID-related uncertainty. Thus, we anticipate more difficult expense growth comparisons going forward.
Roku significantly increased its cash and liquidity position in Q1, raising approximately $1 billion in incremental equity capital via an at the market offering. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.
With that, let's turn to our outlook. We believe we have sufficient visibility into Q2 to offer a formal outlook. But as we move further out into the future, a number of uncertainties make providing a formal outlook for the full year 2021 difficult.
Our Q2 outlook calls for robust growth with total net revenue of $615 million at the midpoint, up 73% year-over-year and total gross profit of $300 million at the midpoint, up 104% year-over-year, implying an overall gross margin of approximately 49%.
Strong gross profit growth is expected to outpace OpEx growth resulting in Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $65 million at the midpoint. Q2 OpEx is expected to be roughly 15% higher than in Q1, in part due to organic headcount growth and the inclusion of OpEx related to recent acquisitions.
For modeling purposes, please note that Q2 adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation of roughly $39 million and an estimated $12 million of depreciation and amortization and net other income. As we observed in our shareholder letter, we will face a mix of headwinds and tailwinds and for the rest of 2021 and into 2022 as we lap periods that were significantly impacted by COVID-19.
These volatile year-over-year comparisons will likely be exacerbated by decreased player inventory availability and anticipated cost increases associated with the global supply chain and logistics issues. We anticipate revenue growth rates in the second half of 2021 will be robust, but at a slower rate than the first half.
For the full year, we expect overall gross margins to be in the high 40% range. We anticipate that platform gross margin will be similar to 2020 levels as we expect the outperformance of content distribution to normalize in Q2 and in the back half of the year. Looking ahead at the player business, as a reminder, we do not optimize for player gross profit, but rather account growth.
As such, given the supply chain issues we face, we anticipate slightly negative player margins for Q2 and the likelihood of increasing negative player margins in the second half of 2021, given anticipated component cost increases.
I'll summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business and the strong momentum we are seeing across the broader streaming landscape that benefits Roku.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ralph Schackart from William Blair. The question on platform revenue, it accelerated again. In the letter talked about capturing larger share of TV budgets, but also talked about performance advertising, social budget. And Steve, you had mentioned some positive 606 impacts. So just curious what was driving that outperformance, if you could sort of give us a sense of that.
And then second, maybe more importantly, given that we're starting to see some sense of reopenings now. Just curious on the TV budgets that have shifted over since the pandemic give us a sense of sort of the scale of that, the durability of that and sort of the impacts of the business and the driver of future platform growth going forward? Ralph, this is Anthony. I'll just make a few introductory remarks, and then I think Scott can take this. Overall, the shift to streaming is in full gear. That is mainstream, but there's still a long way to go, a lot of growth ahead of us.
If we look at advertising, for example, which you asked about, we've said historically that the biggest impediment or governor of our ad business growth has been TV buyers buying patterns that they traditionally tend to prefer traditional linear TV versus new things like streaming. And there's a gap there as viewers move over to streaming versus the ad dollars.
What we saw, I think, in the pandemic was that, that gap started to close, but there's still a big gap and a lot of room to go but advertising momentum in general is very strong. But I don't know, Scott, if you'd like to add to that. Yes. Yes, I'll add on to that, Anthony. Thanks, Ralph, for the question. Would you believe that pandemic accelerated advertisers reallocation of TV budgets towards storage streaming. And I'd offer a couple of data points as proof that this reallocation was accelerated and here to stay to your question, Ralph.
So for example, according to Nielsen in March, ratings, linear TV ratings for adults 18 to 24 was down 22%. Q1 TV ad spending was down 11% and according to Media Radar. Meanwhile, we doubled, monetized video ad impressions on the platform, ad spending by major agency holding companies with Roku more than doubled. We saw strength really up and down the ad business, a couple of areas that I'd call out where we saw strength. One, of course, is the entertainment side of our ad business. We're now at a point where every major direct-to-consumer service has launched.
Those launches have created great opportunities for Roku to partner with these service providers, HBO Max, Discovery Plus, et cetera, and really to drive the adoption of these services, these partners are leaning in closely and investing with us to promote their services to our users.
So we saw very strong growth in the entertainment side of our business. We also are continuing to diversify the business, especially as you called out, with performance advertisers. So while we continue to aggressively grow our business with ad age top 200 advertisers. We grew business with non-top 200 advertisers significantly faster.
I think that's an indication of the broad appeal of our platform to all advertisers, both traditional, top of funnel, branding-oriented advertisers as well as mid and long-tail advertisers who are focused on performance I'd offer up an example with Home Chef, a very performance-based advertiser who invested with us and saw 2.4x return on ad spend and then came back and significantly invested more with us.
And we have case studies like that left and right. It's really a unique attribute of streaming that can both compete at a top of funnel -- as a top of funnel branding medium as well as a mid- and bottom funnel performance medium.
So overall, a really strong quarter for the advertising business and an indication, I think that the reallocation of TV budgets as well as digital and social budgets towards streaming is here to stay. So thanks, Ralph, for the question. Our next question is from Jason Olson from Oppenheimer. This is Sean on the call for Jason. Can you provide some commentary on how OneView has changed the overall ad sales effort of the Company? And then also, can you comment on volume versus pricing trends? Has demand started to offset the very large increase in supply to the point where CPMs are growing? Scott, do you want to take that? Yes. Thanks, Jason, for the question. So OneView is already playing a very prominent role in our advertising relationships. For example, we kicked off the IAB new fronts on Monday. And OneView was featured very prominently. Marketers are going to continue to accelerate their plans to automate their media spending and optimize that spending towards performance and a DSP platform, an ad platform like OneView is ultimately a better tool set for them to do that than the traditional way of writing insertion orders, the traditional way in which TV is traded.
Now the importance of OneView is it's not just a better way to take advantage of Roku's unique identity and data to optimize your ad spend for reach and frequency across a lot of different supply sources it's also a way to optimize the outcomes and drive better results for our advertisers.
It's also a way for us to add value in the transactions between an advertiser and publishers on our platform. So it's a way for us to work with advertisers, not just when they're buying media from us, but when they're buying media from third parties where that transaction would benefit from our data.
And so it's a significant new dimension in the way that we work with advertisers. And I'd just call out a brand like Lexus, who is using OneView and our ACR data to optimize how they spend in streaming in order to manage reach and frequency holistically across their whole traditional TV spend and OTT spend. That's exactly the kind of use case that we brought OneView into the equation for.
The second part of your question was about volume and to our product remains a premium product. If anything, we've added, better data, better targeting, better measurement, newer ad products over time. And I think that, that bodes well for continuing to be able to command premium CPMs, but I will also call out to the earlier question from Ralph that streaming is increasingly also a performance media.
And the reason I call that out is because advertisers will increasingly be looking not just at the top line CPM that they buy the media at. But the effective cost per whatever cost per site visit, cost per product purchase. And what that means long-term is that unlike traditional TV, streaming CPMs aren't just going to be sort of a one price rules them all type scenario, but rather a whole spectrum of prices where the pricing into the auction is ultimately dictated by the tactic that the advertiser is executing on and the outcome that they're trying to drive.
Jason, I hope that answers your question. Good. Jason, let me just add, it was an interesting analog. This is Anthony. I got an e-mail a couple of days ago from one of our smaller content partners. And basically saying that they spend close to zero on advertising with us, but they were going to increase that to $5 million because they could now buy on a CPA basis or cost per acquisition. So it does open up the market to a lot of companies that otherwise wouldn't be spending with us. Our next question is from Justin Patterson from KeyBanc. On The Roku Channel, you've made some nice progress in building its reach and adding originals. So there's more unique content comes with The Roku Channel. I'm curious how this is changing your conversations around attracting more advertisers, licensing from content creators and then working with the B2C streaming companies? This is Anthony. So TRC, yes, it's been doing really good for us. It's on fire, basically, it's -- there's this virtuous cycle where more consumers coming into TRC, more viewers is increasing our ad revenue, which is allowing us to spend more on content which is driving that flywheel.
Some examples, both reach and engagement, streaming hours grew more than twice as fast as the platform overall, which is growing fast than last quarter. So it's doing well. And what I'd say about our content strategy, we licensed today from almost 175 different companies that we license content from today. And we're going to continue to do that.
But as our content budget grows, and we're going to commensurate with the revenue, so we're focused on maintaining a scalable business model. Is growing -- content investment is growing commensurate with the revenue. But as those budgets grow as well as those licensing deals, we are doing more creative deals, licensing originals, for example, or through buying quibi, which brought some originals buying this old house.
And I think that better quality content is just bringing in more viewers, and so, just part of a diversified content strategy that will continue. Scott can comment on the advertiser relationship, but advertisers are interested in higher quality content as well. Scott, do you want to comment on that? Yes. Yes. It sounds good. I'll hit that. But also, before I go there, I'll just also say that, Justin, you asked about how this is changing potentially the conversation with our with our content owners. What I'd say is most of our channel partners, you've got an app on our platform are also working with us in The Roku Channel. So it's not an either/or proposition. A rights owner can be executing on a big direct-to-consumer strategy, even while they have parts of their catalog that they want to monetize elsewhere that maybe doesn't fit into the strategy of the D2C effort.
So -- or for example, they look at The Roku Channel as a place to help market their services and drive awareness, a free Tier by which to surface their content. So in general, The Roku Channel has broadened and deepened our relationship with our channel partners, our content partners.
With regards to advertising, the -- one of the core reasons we launched The Roku Channel nearly four years ago was the opportunity to wholly own and innovate in the user experience, but also the kinds of ad products that we could deliver to our clients in a way that's not possible when we're serving ads into a third-party channel.
And the way that manifests is, for example, sponsorships or integrations or now with the launch of our brand studio, the ability to surface advertiser experiences advertiser underwritten experiences that we might not otherwise be able to create. So it is -- it is in addition to a way to serve our consumers and our content partners, it's an important strategy for us in the service of our advertisers as well.
And it performs well as well, drive significant effect. Like Taco Bell, for example, found that The Roku Channel is five times more efficient at reaching adults 18-plus because of our ability to target and control frequency relative to a traditional linear TV investment. Our next question from Shyam Patil. Please go ahead. Congrats on a great quarter. I had a couple of questions. First, on the Nielsen deal, can you talk a little bit about how this enhances your value proposition and feedback you've gotten so far from advertisers and agencies? And then second question, you guys alluded to this a little bit in your shareholder letter but with the upcoming privacy changes with iOS 14 and then upcoming cookie deprecation, how do you think about that in terms of shifting dollars around? Do you think that CTV is going to be a beneficiary? Do you think it could be a positive catalyst for Roku to get maybe more of a budget shift than you might have otherwise have gotten. Let me -- I'll just talk a little bit about the privacy changes, and then Scott can add on to that and also maybe talk about Nielsen.
So in terms of some of the privacy regulation as well as changes to applications and operating systems that we're seeing, I mean, what those changes are generally doing is making it more tenable to have a targeted ad business or a data-driven ad business when you have a first-party relationship with your customers, like Roku does.
That relationship allows you to offer a lot of value to the viewers and allows you to get any kind of consent or opt-in as needed with fairly high take rates. When you don't have that direct first-party relationship, it becomes -- it becomes very difficult actually to do targeted ads in the environment that we're seeing to shape up.
So we think we're in a in a good position in that regard. And then, Scott, I don't know if you want to add or talk about the Nielsen relationship? Yes. I think on the privacy points. You hit it. We're uniquely positioned as a platform to leverage our identity and data to help advertisers reach our users and it is a more challenging environment for independent ad tech, for example, with the deprecation or more difficult access, I should say, to IDFA on iOS and the pending changes around cookies.
So because we have that relationship, whether you're buying media from us directly or through OneView, we're able to deliver more scale and more precision than you'd be able to get if you were buying through a third party. So is it core advantage for us.
Shyam, I'll go back to your first question with regards to the Nielsen deal. There are two reasons we did that deal with just closed in the last month. First was to acquire the ACR or video fingerprinting technology that we've actually had embedded in our televisions for the last five years. We've had a long-standing relationship around this tech with Nielsen.
So now we own the tech and the intellectual property around it as well as digital ad insertion or the ability to do linear ad replacement on the fly. That won't have a significant impact on 2021 revenues, but is a significant new development for us as a company on Roku TVS, for example, while streaming is growing significantly. There's still also a substantial amount of traditional linear TV consumption happening through the HDMI input or over the air.
And so the ability to dynamically on the fly use our data in partnership with the program or to swap an end that's more relevant to the user to optimize it using all the data and technology we use on the streaming side of our business, opens up a whole new class of inventory and additional reach that we can deliver to our ad clients in partnership with programmers.
So it's a significant new adjacency for us in the ad business. The second reason we did the deal is we expanded our measurement partnership with Nielsen to enable cross screen measurement. So this partnership will enable an advertiser to do holistic reach and frequency measurement across four screens, traditional linear television, streaming, desktop and mobile.
And to manage reach, frequency and audience measurement across those four screens and to do attribution across those screens, so to run media and be able to, again, holistically across those screens determine the effectiveness of that media at, say, driving a site visit or a product purchase.
So it was a significant deal for us and a great opportunity. Still early days, but we're excited about it. I hope that answers your question, Shyam. This is Anthony. Let me just add one small thing, which is that DAI, digital administration is something that's really relevant to television that has to be done inside of TV. And our position is the number one TV software platform in the United States, makes it especially valuable to us, and there's really no one else as well positioned as we are to take advantage of it. Next question is from Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Maybe two quick ones for me. Just following up with the last question on Nielsen. I'm wondering if there's an opportunity to license that technology out to other platforms as well, especially expand the scope of that opportunity and also whether you've kind of gotten any initial feedback from some from the networks and broadcasters?
And then just secondly, I'm wondering if you guys are thinking about if there's an opportunity around almost sponsor TV guide, if you will, on the landing page, something that could be almost like a sponsored listing type model or a feature that's always on the landing page. I'm just curious if there's any thoughts around that opportunity. Let's see. So in terms of licensing the tech, I mean, well, I'll let Scott talk about that in a second. But in general, I mean, in terms of like -- obviously, we license our software, The Roku TV operating system we licensed to TV manufacturers, and it includes technology and the IP that we've built over our many years in business as well as what we purchased.
And Scott can talk more about that. In terms of the program guide on the home screen, I mean, we do have -- we -- our live TV guide is something that we offer on streaming players and on smart TVS, and it's something that we've been enhancing we've been adding features. We just released
OS 10, which added several new features to our live guide or EPG, and we'll continue to be enhancing that, including adding sponsorships and that sort of thing.
But Scott, do you want to go about licensing? Yes, Matt, we remain open to licensing the tech to third parties. But I will say, we're just -- we're generally focused on making the promise of DAI, digital ad insertion or reality. It's a model that's been discussed for a long time in the business. But as Anthony said, we think we are uniquely positioned that we have the ingredients, the scale, the data, the tech, the number of TVs in the field, the depth of partnerships with programmers to deliver on the promise.
So we're just very focused on delivering against that promise. And as I said earlier, we don't think it will have a substantial effect in 2021, but is a bigger long-term opportunity that we're excited about. And the feedback from the programmers has been very positive. They're all keen. While linear television consumption is progressively on the decline, there's still a lot of it.
And they're keen to bring to that inventory at the same kinds of targeting and measurement and optimization that they now have in their streaming services. And so it's an exciting prospect for them to enrich that inventory -- command better CPMs and ultimately deliver to their advertisers a better ad product. And our next question is from David Beckel from Berenberg Capital. I have two questions. The first is around media and entertainment ad growth, which I think you have really brought up for the first time in a meaningful way this quarter. I'm curious if you can help enlighten us as to how that rate of growth this quarter as compared to prior because I would imagine that the dynamic here of direct-to-consumer apps and content competition will only grow going forward?
And then second question, I'm curious how material OneView's third-party business is, that is revenue for ads that are maybe placed outside of Roku's platform or third-party publishers using the DSP on the Roku platform. Is that becoming a material part of the business or more material maybe than it was when you purchased it? So on direct-to-consumer apps, yes, that's -- obviously, that's a huge thing that's happening. I mean during the pandemic, we saw all the media companies that hadn't already launched the direct-to-consumer app to launch those apps. And I would say, aggressively taking advantage of the tools that we've built into our platform to allow them to attract consumers, recruit viewers, increase engagement, reduce churn, that sort of thing.
And so we've seen these large media companies really make big changes reorienting their business models around streaming. Even to the extent of taking some theatrical releases and releasing them directly to streaming. I mean is this just kind of amazing that, that transition is happening in the industry.
For those of us that have been doing this for a while. I remember when it was difficult just convince HBO Go, HBO, but HBO Go, which was one of their original services that kind of -- if you had a cable subscription, you could also watch HBO on your streaming device, like just to add that service was a huge amount of effort.
Now we're seeing the actual releases go straight to streaming. So it's a huge transition in the industry for the business models of all the media companies, and it's obviously great for Roku and it's great for streaming viewers as well.
But it's still early days. I think you're right that there's going to be increasing competition for the fixed number of viewers. And that -- and we offer some great tools to do that. And that although streaming is mainstream, it still has a long way to go until all TV is streamed, so we expect that business to continue to grow.
And then, Scott, I don't know if you want to talk about OneView and kind of the mix of that business, how that's progressing? Yes. Dave, one thing I'll add to Anthony's comments on the M&E side of the business is we've seen such good growth in that segment of the advertising business, not just because of this surge in consumer interest and streaming through the pandemic, but also because of the launch of these services and because we keep getting better at the promotional products to drive the adoption of these services.
So not just the format, like a full-screen Disney sole theming of our background and other new ad products, but also the plumbing behind it so that we could deliver guaranteed outcomes for those services.
I mean that's a key attractor for them is that they can buy on a cost per -- trial start cost per incremental subscriber basis. So the outcomes and the ROI for them are guaranteed and strong and what better place to promote their services than on the screen where the consumer is actually going to end up watching the service.
So those are the factors that account for the significant growth there, and we're excited about the continued growth. In terms of your question about OneView, OneView, overall, the growth has accelerated significantly, well more than doubled, and that's across all media, not just media on Roku, but third party media.
I will say that the use of OneView to buy media on Roku, whether that's media we're selling, for example, a video ad that runs in The Roku Channel or an ad bought from a publisher on Roku through one year. That segment is growing even faster because, of course, we have data and identity and optimization capabilities to help them do that better than were they to buy through a third-party DSP.
But we also have really strong cross screen use cases that we can service. For example, using ACR data to retarget a user on desktop and mobile-based on what content or advertising they're interested in or conversely using site visitation information to inform what ads are run on the large screen. Those cross screen use cases are some of our most robust cross screen or omnichannel use cases and are part of what is driving the growth in spending through OneView on media off of the Roku platform.
Thanks, Dave. I hope that answers your question. I will just comment quickly. I think that another sort of unappreciated fact is that a big driver of our ad business in general as well, obviously, the M&E or median entertainment portion is our commitment to machine learning and AI. We've been investing heavily in and building out that capability. And we have a strong internal commitment to world class best-in-class machine learning algorithms that helps us correctly target and as well -- and allocate our limited display inventory most effectively. Our next question is from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. I have two questions. My first one is on the platform gross margin and the expansion you've seen there pretty consistently. We look back historically, and if you look at 2019, you did see that gross margin contract, and I think the explanation was the shift of more of the growth coming from The Roku Channel.
Now I'm looking at five consecutive quarters of expansion. And so I'm curious if you can share what's driving that expansion, whether it's better profitability or better margins at The Roku Channel? And if so, why? Or whether it's kind of mix shift maybe to more audience development or other third-party.
And my second is just a follow-up on privacy. The privacy question, I'm trying to understand a little bit in layman's terms. You say that Roku possesses deep direct relationship with consumers doesn't rely on third-party identifiers or cookies. I guess my question is, I understand I'm watching -- me is the consumer watching something on Roku and then your advertising back to me.
So that's all on platform. But I guess my question is, how are you getting the information to make your targeting so robust if it's not coming from third-party sources, maybe help me with that and how that progresses from here. So this is Anthony. Let me take the privacy question, and then I'll turn it over to Steve for gross margins. I'll just give you a simple example of how having a first-party relationship with the consumer helps in the world of increased privacy regulation. So often the way the regulation manifests itself is requiring that you get opt-in permission from consumers before you track your data or target them.
And so for example, we have a feature -- we have ACR in our TVs -- Automatic Content Recognition. And that's an example of a feature where we felt like, okay, we should really get -- the regulation is a little unclear, but we felt like we should have consumers opt-in for that feature before we start collecting ACR data.
And so we we ask them, we ask our consumers the first time they start using the product. Do you want to opt-in for us tracking your viewing data with ACR because you'll get more relevant ads but also will enable a feature called more ways to watch, which is a feature where based on -- let's say you're watching a rerun of the Rockford Files and on linear TV, and we might say, ""Oh, you can also watch all the back episodes in The Roku Channel, for example.
And so that's a feature that has direct a direct impact on a viewer and makes their experience better. And so they're more likely to opt-in because they get access to features as well as data tracking. So the ACR, for example, opt-in rates are very high on Roku TVs because of the way we do that kind of -- the way we create consumer-centric features as well is not just we're going to track your data.
So that -- there's lots of examples like that, like that's why having that direct relationship with consumers allows you to build trust with consumers and allows you to make it in their interest and beneficial for them to participate in data tracking and targeting. So that's as an example. I don't know, Scott, if you have anything to add? Yes. I mean, I would just highlight another example. These insights about consumer taste profiles aren't on our platform just for advertising. They also drive things like recommendations in The Roku Channel. And that's pretty significant. We've made huge gains in our ability to put the right tiles in front of consumers on that top row on The Roku Channel to drive increased engagement.
So as Anthony said, it's a mutual value exchange and getting relevant ads in front of the consumer is important to the whole business is going to move to a lighter ad load and for the math to work for consumers to still get free content, but marketers still be able to reach consumers and content providers still be able to make enough money.
The ads have got to get more relevant. And consumers have regularly shown that they're willing to experience ads that are more relevant and that, that's a better user experience. So all around, we think it's a good proposition in Roku as the holder of this direct relationship with the consumer is an unique position to achieve that value expense. Yes, that's right. I mean it's just a combination of building trust with your consumers because you interact with them regularly through the user interface and offering them value, making it worth their while to participate in targeting. Anyway, Steve, would you like to pontificate on gross margins for a few minutes. I would love to, Anthony. Thank you. Michael, in terms of platform gross margins, yes, we did talk about we had very strong platform gross margins in Q1 at roughly 67%. Just a reminder, the platform segment has a number of different businesses. Some of which are higher margin, some are lower margin in part due to the accounting treatment, whether they're gross or net.
And in Q1, what we pointed out was that the combination of these new direct-to-consumer services, strong media and entertainment spend that we talked about earlier those are high-margin activities, along with 606 deal model increases to the lifetime value of the deals for several of our content distribution deals also pushed the mix of that business up, and that's a high-margin business.
So a lot of times, the margin trending in any given quarter has to do more with the mix and how the relative growth is working within different parts of the platform. And then in terms of the kind of looking forward on that front, we did say that we thought the gross margins for the platform segment in Q2 in the back half of the year would be more in line with 2020 because we see that outperformance in the content distribution activities in Q1 normalizing throughout the rest of the year. And our next question is from Jason Bazinet from Citi. So you guys had really good financials, but the one area that at least missed our numbers was sort of just active accounts in the quarter. And I'm just wondering if if 2019 might be sort of a better sort of net add cadence versus 2020 given COVID? Or maybe given the chip shortages or both? Any sort of comment on that front would be helpful. Steve, do you want to take that? Yes, sure. Yes. So you're absolutely right. We recently started comping over the initial state home lockdown orders in the U.S., which hit in mid-March. So that certainly makes for some volatile year-over-year comps not only for the key operating metrics, but for other parts of the business as well throughout the rest of 2021 as well as into 2022.
In terms of the active account in streaming our key operating metrics, those initial parts of the pandemic did show very elevated growth in the active account year-over-year numbers. And as well as streaming hours and particularly in the streaming hours, there is a significant spike in Q2.
So whereas the year-over-year growth numbers are down a bit from Q1 or from Q4 sequentially what we said is that the growth rates prior to hitting those comps were actually tracking above the Q4 level. And I think you're right, it's probably more apt to look at the active account and streaming our metrics on the net change on quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year.
And we said that we think those will continue to grow nicely, but closer to pre-COVID levels. Just as an example, if you look at Q1 '19, we added roughly 2 million active accounts. In Q1 of this year, we added 2.4 million active accounts.
The other thing we noted just more of color on the outlook is we do see aside from just robust growth on active accounts and streaming hours. We did -- we do anticipate engagement continuing to increase over time. So we said that streaming our spear count in 2021, we believe, will be greater than 2020.
And against this backdrop, I think it's important to note that that obviously, the COVID-related impacts were significant for us and the rest of the industry but really, we're still very much early innings. And we do think that the long-term shift to streaming is very durable and have more proof points that, that will continue in our position as the number one streaming TV platform in the U.S. gives us a good position to continue to capture that -- the value of that shift over. Our next question is from Laura Martin from Needham. Could we now have three forms of advertising growth. We have brand advertising coming from television performance advertising, we have the content studio ads. So if you guys could talk about that mix as you see that changing over the next three years? That would be one. And then the other one I'm interested in is when you guys licensed -- when you licensed content, you said that this new show cycle was number one, is that because you're using data in order to make your decisioning around licensing content? Or is that because you actually, as you say here, put it on Page 1, and you're getting better at promoting content that's exclusive to Roku? Laura, it's great to hear from you again. This is a -- I'll take the second question, and then Scott can talk about ads. So yes, I think for sure, we use our knowledge of our viewers and the data we have to help inform what's going to perform well on our -- in The Roku Channel, and we also use that data to target promotions, the appropriate content promotion based on the user.
I mean, we use all the tools that we've built in for our partners. We use them for ourselves as well. And we use them -- and that certainly was something like Cypher helps help for sure helps drive viewing of that.
I would say that -- but the other thing that we've seen is that as we -- as our scale grows, we can buy more expensive content, which usually means more brand name actors or more recent and that on a cost per -- streamed hour basis, it can end up being cheaper if we pick the right content because it gets you'd buy more people because maybe it's just more appealing or maybe it hasn't been seen before.
So in the case of Cypher, that's a relatively unknown -- well, completely unknown title. No one has ever heard of it. But we use our promotion to target people that were interested in those kinds of shows. And the fact that they had never seen it before, it was something new was also helpful.
So those are the kinds of things. So yes, in summary, we use our data, we use our promotion capabilities, both to inform what we license, but also how to promote particular content and how much to pay as well. And Scott, do you want to talk about the different types of ads? The ad mix. Laura, thanks for the question. I think you're right, there certainly is the traditional linear TV ad budget that we've talked a lot about through the history of the Company that we're uniquely positioned to compete for as advertisers follow consumers the brand studio that we've launched is really an elevation of sponsorships and ad innovations capability we've been incubating for a long time and represents our effort to help advertisers reach consumers beyond the 30-second spot, the 15, 30 second spot. And it's an exciting dimension because many advertisers are investing significantly there.
Historically, those budgets have not gone into television as much as they've gone into interactive media, social, digital, online because that's where those brand experiences can be manifested. So we think connected TV is uniquely positioned to compete there. And then as we've been discussing in the last couple of quarters' earnings calls, streaming is uniquely positioned to both compete as a branding medium as well as a performance media you're asking what's the mix of those over time?
I'd say, frankly, we're not sure, but we are sure that those segments are quite substantial, each of them on their own. And I'd also add to the list of the three that you gave us, other very significant closely related add opportunities, linear ad replacement, the AI, as we've been discussing in this call, the opportunity to service small, medium business advertisers through self service tools, local advertising and commerce-related enhancements to advertising.
So there are many significant adjacent categories to the businesses that we're executing on. And I think at this point, we're bullish on the size of those opportunities, but uncertain as to the long-term mix of them. I appreciate the question, though, Laura. And our last question is from Shweta Khajuria from Evercore. Let me try a couple, please. One, how meaningful is international today? And can you help us think about how you measure success in international markets, maybe this year or next year? Some sort of color on how we should think about the materiality of international. That's first. And then the second is, Steve, you -- in your last shareholder letter, not this one, but the last one, you had said operating expense growth for the full year to be comparable to 2019 levels as we think about full year EBITDA, does that still hold? This is Anthony. I'll take the international question, and then Steve can talk about our OpEx. International is one of our key investment areas. We've outlined in the past that we have four key investment areas, international, Roku TV, The Roku Channel and advertising.
And obviously, streaming is a global phenomenon and will transform the way content is distributed and monetized around the globe. We've also found -- and our strategy basically to take the formula that's worked well for us in the U.S., our strategy, our products our relationships and which are often with global companies and use those -- use that same strategy in international markets and focus on kind of one market at a time and adding more markets.
And that's working well for us, and we're definitely seeing good progress. The first market we entered was Canada. And we're now the number one TVOs in Canada, one in three smart TVs sold in Canada are Roku TVs now. A market that came after Canada was Mexico. Mexico, we're also doing well. We're the number two licensed -- sorry, we're the number two smart TV platform in Mexico, number one is still Samsung, but we're making good progress there.
Brazil is a market that we entered not too long ago, first with TVs than streaming players and then recently another TV OEM, making good progress. It's still early days. We're in the U.K. as well. So the other thing we've done in the U.S. that we're doing internationally is we start by focusing on scale of active accounts.
And all those metrics I really just talked about are really active account indicators. So first, focusing on building up scale of active accounts, then engagement and then monetization and so success for us is becoming number one in a market for TV sales, which is going to result eventually in that's being number one in active accounts.
And so and then follow that on with monetization. So we're starting to do that in some markets. For example, we are now selling ads in Canada. We have The Roku Channel in Canada. We launched The Roku Channel in the U.K. And so in general, it's still a long way to go, but we're making good progress in international markets. And then, Steve, you want to take the second question. Yes. So can you repeat that last part? I'm not sure I followed that last part of your question about something around EBITDA in the Q4, what we said in Q4. Well, so in your Q4 shareholder letter, you said that you expect operating expense growth rate to be comparable to 2019 levels for the full year. Is that -- are you reiterating that still for the full year and in because that would impact full year EBITDA when we think about it? Yes. I mean we haven't provided formal guidance for the back half of the year. But this time, we mainly talked about from an OpEx perspective, that was part of what we discussed in the shareholder letter and in my prepared remarks about the year-over-year comps are pretty variable in different parts of the business.
In terms of OpEx, we proactively tried to bend down the cost growth curve and CapEx starting in Q2 of last year. So we anticipate the year-over-year growth of OpEx to go up starting in Q2 as we lap those actions. But in terms of overall OpEx level, we continue to -- I think sort of a pre covet comp is still a good comp in general, and we're continuing to invest in the business.
Especially now that we've got sort of better line of sight on how we've been performing. The momentum has been strong to date, and so we're continuing to invest in our traditional growth vectors around things like international with Anthony, you just talked about, the advertising business, of course, Roku TV and then The Roku Channel has been doing extremely well for us. So we'll continue to push forward on these strategic investment fronts. So the other thing I'll just mention on that is -- the other thing I'll just mention on that is just a reminder, we've done a we've done a few different acquisitions. And so we did mention that part of the sequential growth that you'll see from Q1 to Q2 include the OpEx from those acquisitions as well. I'll now turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for closing remarks. I want to end the call by thanking our employees, customers and partners for an excellent quarter. The shift to streaming will be global and will transform the way content is distributed and monetized, and we're excited about the road ahead.

Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Conrad, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. I am pleased to report that Roku delivered a strong second quarter with record revenue growth that was driven by exceptional performance in platform monetization. Audiences content and advertisers continue their shift to TV streaming around the globe. Roku is a key enabler of this long term secular trend. This quarter platform revenue exceeded $0.5 billion for the first time driven by significant contributions from both content distribution and advertising activities. On the content front, we are seeing direct to consumer streaming services lean into our platforms effective merchandising tools. Also of note, at the recent upfronts we closed commitments with all seven major advertising agency holding companies. We had a great Q2 and we are well positioned for the future. With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. In Q2 2021,, we exceeded our outlook for revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA and continue to make significant operational and financial progress. Before taking your questions, I'll walk through highlights and discuss our approach to outlook given the current level of macro uncertainty. We grew active accounts by 1.5 million in Q2 and then the quarter was $55.1 million. Q2 2021, net adds were higher than pre COVID levels in Q2 2019 but as expected, lower than the pandemic related surge of Q2 2020.
Sales of player units were relatively flat year-over-year, in average selling price decrease 2% year-over-year. Roku users stream 17.4 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of nearly 19% year-over-year. Platform monetization accelerated with ARPU of $36.46 on a trailing 12 month basis up 46% year-over-year. Total Q2 revenue increased the record 81% year-over-year to $645.1 million. Platform segment revenue was up 117% year-over-year to $532.3 million representing 83% of total revenue. While player revenue was relatively flat year-over-year following the pandemic driven demand spike in Q2 2020.
Our key financial metric gross profit grew 130% year-over-year in Q2 to $338.3 million, resulting in gross margin of 52%. Clear gross margin of negative 6% was lower than normal due to global supply chain issues, which are affecting logistics and component pricing. Platform gross margin of 65% was more than expected due to a favorable mix toward higher margin, media and entertainment spend by content publishers. Our strong revenue and gross profit performance allowed us to deliver a better than expected adjusted EBITDA of $122.4 million in Q2. Q2 OpEx was up 269 million, up 42% year-over-year. And we ended Q2 with approximately $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments.
Our approach to outlook will be similar to the last few quarters, but will provide formal guidance for the next quarter, and additional color on our longer term view for the business. For the third quarter, our outlook calls for 51% year-over-year revenue growth to $680 million at the midpoint and 49% year-over-year gross profit growth to $320 million. We expect adjusted EBIDTA of $65 million at the midpoint and net income of roughly $2 million, which includes stock based comp of $52 million and $11 million of depreciation and amortization, and net other income in the quarter. This robust growth is a result of the secular shift of viewers, content publishers and advertisers to TV streaming, which we believe will continue to drive growth whose growth over the long term.
Looking ahead to the rest of the year. Let me offer three key observations. First, we will take tough year-over-year comps across our business in the second half of 2021. Due to pandemic related outperformance in the second half of 2020. We will also face tough comps within the year-over-year growth rates of our active accounts and streaming hours given last year as demand spikes. In third, the secular trend towards streaming remains intact. And we will benefit from our strong position as the shift in TV streaming continues. I will now provide some additional color on each of these items. First, regarding tough year-over-year comp in the player and platform segment.
In our player business, we expect particularly tough your comps in Q3 given the surge in sales in the prior year period. In addition, while we're actively managing our supply chain, we're assuming increasing negative player gross margins during the second half of the year. Turning to our platform business. The mix shifts in TV ad budgets to streaming combined with the launch of multiple new premium DTC services in the second half of 2020 resulted in an exceptional growth in our platform revenue during that period. While this will create tough year-over-year comps in the second half of 2021, we still expect robust growth.
Second, regarding tough year-over-year comp in active accounts and streaming hours, in 2020, pandemic related lockdowns drove a surge in active accounts and engagement. For example, active accounts and streaming hours through nearly 80% and 100% respectively from Q2 2019 to Q2 2021. The surge in streaming player in for TV sales in 2020 contributors to this growth. In 2021 we expect the overall us Smart TV market to shrink on a year-over-year basis, as OEMs manage supply chain challenges. Third, regarding our strong market position, overall Roku remains very well positioned to benefit from the long term secular trends of audiences, content and advertisers shifting to TV streaming around the globe. Roku has been a leader in enabling the shift to TV streaming advertising, and it's benefiting as streaming ad spend increases.
We remain optimistic about our ability to grow over time, given the significant size of the opportunity it has in the early stage of monetization today. I'll summarize by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business and the strong momentum we are seeing across the broader streaming landscape that benefits Roku.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Great, thank you. Two if I can. First could you unpack the drivers around ARPU growth in more detail please. And then second, could you talk about learnings from the upfronts? It sounds like there were some healthy growth of new advertisers there, so curious to hear more about, who's coming here that you didn't have before, and how we should think about just that upfront strength trending that the second half of the year. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. I think the prior analysts had a question. Yes, sorry, I was on mute. Hey, Justin, thanks for that. This is Anthony. Let me I'll turn it over to Steven and Scott in a second. But let me just say that, you know, ARPU, obviously, is a function of active accounts and platform revenue in both groups, nicely in the quarter, you know, platform revenue, in particular, $0.5 billion was the key driver of our Q2 record revenue growth. So, we're just seeing strong interest in advertisers starting to follow their viewers to streaming that's one of the drivers. We're also seeing, the launch of all these new direct to consumer streaming services in ARPU becoming popular, and we're a great platform for merchandising, promoting and distributing those services. So both of those are contributing, to our overall platform revenue growth but, Steve, did you want to add anything about ARPU drivers? Yes, sure. So just on ARPU drivers, Scott can talk about the upfront. ARPU on a trailing 12 month basis was over $36. And that was up 46% year-over-year. That's actually the growth in ARPU has been accelerating over the last three or four quarters, which is great to see. And really, that's broad base increases in the monetization. We had strong quarter in both the advertising sides, as budgets follow the viewers and advertisers start to prioritize more of this ship to streaming and follow the viewer ships, as well as Anthony mentioned, strong competition, especially now that pretty much every legacy media company has shifted focus to their DTT services, we're seeing strong uptake, and use of our media and entertainment tools. And so that was a notable thing we mentioned in Q2. And so the combination of these things continues to drive the ARPU up and just show the strength of our monetization efforts. And so I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the up fronts. Yes. Hey, Justin, regarding your question about the upfront, it was a pretty transformative upfront season for us. We closed it several months earlier than we have over the last couple of years concurrent with traditional TV networks. I think that's an indication that streaming has arrived as a first class citizen in the way brands think about allocating their annual budgets, because it deals with all seven major agency holding companies and more than double commitments in terms of dollar basis, this is driven by a couple things, one of them is secular. So it's definitely coming out of the pandemic increased urgency by marketers to follow audiences, especially amidst steep ratings declines, Nielsen reported a 29% decline among adults 18 to 49 year-over-year. But it's also a function of our scale and our capabilities, including one view which played a pretty prominent role, our ad platform, our DSP, and our data. And this upfront season as well, our ability to offer originals exclusive content, the performance of that content in the time since as well as our new brand, branded content studio offering really resonated with brands and stuff, it not just brought in a significant uptick in dollars and earlier commitments. It also brought in a significant new set of advertisers who had not yet committed with us in the upfront. Over 42% of our advertisers were first time upfront advertisers with Roku. So overall, we're extremely pleased with how we did the upfront and also think it's a good Harbinger for how we'll perform throughout the year during the scatter period. Thanks for the question. Thank you. Our next question is from Shweta Khajuria of Evercore. Your line is open. Okay, thank you. Let me take two please. One is could you provide some context on the Roku channel in any way quantify the impact of the Roku channel in terms of dollar contribution growth, and how we should think about the scale and size of that. And then second is on what's the breakup of brand and performance marketing spend you are seeing and how do you think that will shift over time, with the impact of one view? Thank you. Hey, Shweta, this is Anthony. On the Roku channel that's obviously a very successful product for us is doing extremely well. It's owned and operated, streaming service that's primarily free ad supported. It's definitely benefiting from this virtuous cycle of viewers seeking out free content, advertisers following viewers, and that's reinvesting the revenue back into better and better content. And so that's creating this virtuous cycle is growing extremely fast. And it's a big driver of our P&L. It's a great source of ad revenue for us, sorry, add inventory for us as our ad business grows. And you know, there's doing well, in terms of the specifics of how it's affecting the size of our business. I'm not sure if we’ve broken that out. Steve, do you want to add anything to that? No. And then in performance marketing, Scott could talk about that. Yes. Hi Shweta. Others tag on the Anthony's comments about CRC about the Roku channel and say that it had an amazing quarter it's been growing leaps and bounds it more than doubled. In terms of streaming hours year-over-year, it's growing much faster than the overall platform and even the AVOD, yet supported segments overall. And so as a result, it is taking on increased prominence increased importance over time, just as a supply source for our video advertising, as Anthony alluded to, it's also a place where we can innovate, where we can create new ad units, new ad experiences in a way that are not feasible when we're placing ads into third party channels on our platform. With regards to the question about performance advertising, it's true that a majority of our advertising is still, your traditional TV top funnel brand advertiser but the performance segment where we call internally, our growth advertising segment, nearly tripled year-over-year. So it's coming on strong. And it's really a function of the fact that as a platform where the first party customer relationship, rich data, great ad tech, we can deliver for performance, outcome oriented advertisers, the kinds of outcomes that they seek when they're investing in search and social.
And so that's the segment we're very bullish on we're competing, in that case for budgets outside of traditional TV budgets. And there's a whole new adjunct to our growth opportunity. He's got some great case studies of brands like smartwool, where they use one view to combine both a streaming advertising strategy and a desktop and mobile advertising strategy. And the one two punch of combining those two media delivered, 72% increase in site visits, headspace another brand used our data to also target across both desktop and streaming and drove up over 200% increase in conversion rates to mobile app downloads. So right there, you have two examples of case studies where brands are using our tools exactly as we intended it, they're exploiting the fact that we've got that deep first party relationship on the biggest screen in the home. And then they're combining it together with our ability to help place ads on a multi channel basis and desktop and mobile to deliver a bigger outcome. So just a step back there we’re just very bullish on the opportunity in performance advertising segment in addition to our competing for traditional TV ad dollars. Okay, thank you, Anthony. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Our next question comes from Corey Carpenter of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Great, thanks for the question. Just maybe for Steve and Anthony just given the response to your original content thus far, could you talk about how this informs your thinking around your content strategy going forward? Does it make you want to potentially get more aggressive? And then maybe for your Steve specifically, you know, how should we think about this impacting platform gross margins, maybe both in the near and long term? Thanks. Cory, this is Anthony. So just a reminder that you know, the Roku channel is an primarily ad supported offering that we make to our customers and the content that goes in that channel comes primarily from licensing. We've got, a large number of licensing partners, we license, both sort of deep back catalogue content, as well as newer more expensive content. So there's a whole range of content that we license, short term and long term deals in place there. But we're also as the scale of that platform grows, and as the number of viewers grows, and the number of advertisers grow, we're able to invest in better and better content. So it's a portfolio approach, and the originals are part of that portfolio. You know, the primary source of content is still licensing, but originals have had benefits as well. And as part of the portfolio, they're a great addition. So we're seeing good performance with our originals, both liquidity, originals, we purchase them quickly. And then also, we bought this old house, as well.
And we'll keep investing in originals both from a variety of sources. You know, for example, we just recently renewed some of the [0:21:00] originals that we purchased, like Kevin [0:21:04] harder. And but the goal overall is to maintain a business model that works for us in terms of an AVOD business model. And so you shouldn't see any impact on from the Roku channel, expanding into originals on our gross margins. Because the overall portfolio we're maintaining the same, the same margin structure that we have internally. The other advantage of the originals is, of course, there's a halo effect. So helpful with the upfront is helpful with our advertising business. And it's helpful for bringing in new customers into the Roku channel as well. So I don't know, Steve, if you wanted to add anything, or [0:21:47]. No, I think you hit all the marks. I guess I'll need to find a new CFO gig. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffitt Nathanson. Your line is open. Thanks, everyone. I have one for you. So I got a question to you. Anthony on Alphabet call, I asked the CEO Sundar Pichai about their vision for Android TV. And he described you know wanting to make Android TV more of a computing platform. Sounds like they want to include gaming in a really robust ecosystem. I wonder, how is your vision compare to what Google wants to do. And then broadly, bring it back to the [0:22:36] you have with YouTube. And whether or not is any closer resolution to that. And Steve a quick number from you, you guys usually tell us the Roku channel, number of people reached, it was in the press release you haven't said so far? So that's a question that hopefully you're going to answer for me. Thanks. Hey, Michael, thanks. I'm glad you got a question for Steve. Let's see. So, you know, our vision. We've been competing with large companies, including Google in our space for since we started, and we compete extremely well. And the primary difference in the way we compete versus Google as we built from the beginning, a software platform designed specifically for TV, whereas they take their phone, operating system, Android, and they ported it to TVs. So if you look at the history of computing platforms, whether it's windows on PCs, or Android on phones, or Roku on TVs, purpose built, operating systems traditionally have always won in terms of market share. And it's because, when you build something from the ground up for a new user environment, for new business models, it's just more effective. And so that's really the kind of where the source of our competitive advantage come from. And it's working well for us and has worked historically, you know, we compete extremely well, we're the number one streaming platform in the US by a pretty wide margin.
And it's really those advantages that accrue from having a purpose built platform. So for example, you know, the cost structure of the TV is really important. TVs are super price competitive, and how much it cost to build a TV is very important in terms of market share, because it affects the price you can sell the TV for. And, we've put a lot of effort into making our software platform run with less memory and smaller chips than our competitors. And so right now, for example although the entire industry is suffering from the supply chain issues and the shortage of chips and the related increases in pricing, it's impacting us less than others, because we use less memory than all our competitors products, for example. So, I think our vision is that most TVs are not a licensed operating system that we are the leader net, and we'll maintain that leadership by being very focused on building the only purpose built operating system for TV. That's what we do. So in terms of YouTube, I'll let Scott take that one.
Yes, I'll answer that question. But let's make sure to get a question back to see [0:25:13]. We really don't have new information to provide on the YouTube situation. You know, just as a reminder, this is not a carriage dispute. We're not seeking more money or economics in this relationship. We want Google to agree not to try and dictate search behaviors on Roku or access data. We don't make available to others or require hardware, software changes to our platform that would harm our competitiveness with other competing platforms, including your own Chromecast, we think these are pretty fair and reasonable asks, we're working to resolve it in a way that's good for Roku and consumers and Google, but we don't have a resolution today. Steve do you want to take your part of the question. Yes, ironic, because the TRC reaches more of a Scott question that I'll do my best Scott impression here. Yes, in terms of TRC reach, we TRC continues to grow nicely, as others said, the streaming hours doubled year-over-year there, again, which is great. We didn't update the reach number. It didn't hit a particularly different milestone. And that's kind of why we didn't add that. So in general TRC continues to do well. And, the other thing to mention here, the content, the flywheel just continues to be very good, right, more content, we talked about Roku originals, driving more engagement, which drives more advertisers, which then in turn gives us more money to invest in more content and fuel continued increase in scale and growth. So that we're very happy with the reach and growth of TRC. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya, Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one relates to active account growth and international expansion. So Roku had strong active account growth last year, I think you groove active accounts 14.3million. So that's a tough compare sort of for this year, but at the same time, you're expanding internationally. So do you have a sense for how much of the active account growth this year can come from international expansion? And what's a reasonable level of penetration that we should expect over this year and next year in key markets like UK and Brazil that you're targeting? And overall, how do you measure your success in international expansion? This is Anthony, I'll take that in terms of our international expansion. I mean, obviously, streaming as a global business. The US is ahead of most countries, there's still room to grow in the US. And there's even more room to grow internationally in terms of active accounts. And I'll come back to that. I mean, the other way we grow, it's not just active accounts, we also grow by increasing the monetization on existing accounts. You know, a big difference between a company like Roku and a subscription service, is that subscription services, active accounts correlate directly to revenue. Roku is growing and investing in building the monetization on a per customer basis, just as much as we are on growing our active accounts. And so and actually, I mean, in places like United States, there's a tremendous amount of room to continue to grow ARPU, and that'll be a big driver of growth as well as active accounts.
In terms of growing active accounts globally. You know, the strategy we're using is the same. That worked for us well, in the US, which is focused on building active accounts. Well, in terms our business model internationally is to focus on building active accounts, engaging those users, and then monetizing those users. And the way we are building active accounts is through selling our streaming players and licensing our operating system to TV manufacturers and coming to market with Roku TVs. Both of those are working well for us, we're starting to see, we're definitely seeing success there. So for example, we are already the number one operating system in Canada. You know, things are going well in Brazil, in Mexico, in the UK, we just launched TV with TCL and new TCL, Roku TV bring increasing the number of OEMs that are selling Roku TVs in the UK and that TV is getting excellent reviews. It just got a five star review. So that's going well. And then we just announced that we'll be launching products in Germany scenes as well. So, you know, we're going to continue to build out reasons that ran and go deeper in the reasons that we're already in. Okay, thanks for all the details on that. Anthony. That's helpful. Maybe for my follow up, I wanted to ask you about the new brand studio that you have. How many advertisers are making use of it now? Can you talk about like what type of programs or commercials is it producing? And is there a way to quantify the revenue benefit from having this studio and just overall reception that you've seen so far? Sure. Scott, you want to talk about the brand studio? Yes, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. So a couple things. One is, we have been doing some form of sponsorships or innovations with advertisers for several years now. Earlier this year, we acquired a team that of [0:30:39] really upsize to supersize that so that we could not just produce new executions off of our home screen that were sponsored by brands, but also produce content that in partnership with advertisers. And I would say it's got a double effect, indirect answer to your question. One is revenue effect, there is question that brands come and invest with us that they're being driven primarily by the ability to target and measure and optimize all the benefits of streaming advertising relative to traditional TV. But they're also looking for breakout executions, and execution, for example, that would reach a viewer who may be in that session isn't going to watch an ad supported stream, they're going to go into Netflix or some other ad free experience.
And so we're still early in that production exercise. But it's going very well. We just launched a show called The Show Next Door featuring Randall Park with Maker's Mark where he mixes up, Maker's Mark cocktail at the start of the show, and then brings in a bunch of comedian and athletes friends for casual conversation. We, you know, that's a quick hit kind of production that's totally aligned with their brand. And it's a fun format, it's valuable for consumers, that's exactly the kind of experience that we aim to be able to produce. A bigger production, something that I think is a perfect fit for who Roku is, our Roku recommends shows topical weekly show where we review top five shows last week, that's performing extremely well, right down the middle of the kind of thing consumer might expect from Roku, and also a highly sponsor horrible experience, Walmart was our launch sponsor there.
So you know, what I'd say about the brand studio is has direct economic impact, it makes their deal sizes bigger, but it also has a halo effect, because it brings in a lot of brands, it reinforces our client direct relationships, because it's often the CMO, the client, himself or herself who is driving the creative execution as opposed to a pure media execution, which often originates out of the ad agency. But overall, great progress with the brands today. We're excited about it. Okay, thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks. I was wondering if we could dive into ARPU and ours a little bit. So I think the streaming hours per account was about 3.6 per day in the quarter that's ahead of ‘19. It's below the last four quarters or so obviously, the pandemic really skewed things in the last four quarters. But I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the trend might be there. Is there more live sports coming back? Is that a bit of a mix headwind for you, if folks are using their cable box a little more, so maybe just unpacking the streaming hours per account would be helpful. And then the flip side is the ARPU, which was really strong in the quarter, I have it up about 66% year-on-year, per account. And so if people are watching, you know, no more US dollars are going up, then that says to me that there's either some pricing going on there, or more Roku channel or an effective CPM that's really strong. So maybe you could just help us unpack the trends in ARPU a little bit that would be helpful. Thank you. Well, this is Anthony, in terms of screaming hours, you're right. Because of all the variability around the pandemic and year-over-year stats, we saw that the industry saw television overall saw 19% decline year-over-year in viewership. Our viewing was up 19%. So well ahead of you know, the overall industry. We're very happy with that. That even compares favorably to streaming as a whole streaming was down to streaming all platforms was down a couple percent in terms of streaming hours. But I think the big picture for me is that we're still in the middle of this transition where viewers, advertisers and the industry is moving 100% for streaming, we're just not there yet. But it's moving and it's happening. If you look, one stat, I think that's interesting from Nielsen is that if you look at 18 to 45 year olds, 39% of their TV watching is streaming. So, that means this still, the majority of TV is traditional TV. And that's all going to move to streaming.
You know, on our viewers are a combination of cord cutters and people that have traditional pay TV subscriptions, as well as streaming, obviously. So, I would say, just in summary, we performed well in the quarter relative to the market and our peers. And there's a lot of room to grow still. In terms of ARPU, I don't know, Scott or Steve, if you want to touch on that. This is Scott, I'll let Steve talk about ARPU. But I just wanted to tag on to your comment about streaming hours. You know, I think the right way to think about this as we took share. At the end, says that the slowdown was more of a secular trend in TV, and we grew in while traditional TV [0:36:05]. So we grew, we took share. The other thing to think about is the average US household was about seven hours of TV viewing today. So we're only around half and the other 50% is going to go completely to streaming. So I wouldn't interpret this secular transition as anything other than people getting out after a year and a half in the pandemic. And on the whole is that good for Roku, because we share. Steve, you want to address the ARPU question? Yes, sure. Just on the ARPU. You quoted 66% year-over-year growth in ARPU on a quarterly basis, trailing 12 month basis that 46% year-over-year, either way, it's accelerating, which is a great indicator that the world is moving to streaming and that the monetization is still early days. You know, Anthony talks about the viewership levels to streaming, you know, are being strong. And that sad about 39% of key demographic viewing is, the truth is the advertising budgets are well behind that, right. And so, with the pandemic, you know, they've found sort of a new focus on mixing into streaming. Because not only that's where the viewers are increasingly watching, but also the fact that they're now you know, kind of held to a higher standard in terms of demonstrating ROI for their TV fan, which you can do on Roku and other streaming platforms.
So that's an important distinction on that front. And, you know, when you look at what's driving that, you know, advertising dollars moving over, that's a positive indicator, the advertising business has grown, has been growing tremendously, we had another quarter where we more than doubled year-over-year on a Roku monetize video ad impression. Also competition on the service side, right, the Legacy media companies pretty much all of them have a focus in DTC services. And so there's increasing use of Roku tools, our media and entertainment tools to help drive viewership and engagement on their services. And so that's another thing that's increasing the monetization. So we're very happy with those trends that favors Roku kind of in that middle of that shift. And you know, given our scale in our industry leading tools, will be a beneficiary of those trends. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shyam Patil of SIG [Ph]. Your line is open. Hey, guys, I had a couple of questions. Steve, I had one for you. You talked a lot about active accounts and streaming hours, you know, kind of on a year-over-year basis. I was just wondering if you could talk to talk to them on a sequential basis. Just you know, should we see growth in active accounts sequentially in 3Q and 4Q? And if so how much? Maybe that might be easier for modeling externally? And then just a broader question, there continue to be a lot of privacy changes for digital advertising overall, but it seems like CTV is, one of the areas that that's not impacted by that, just wondering if that's becoming a tailwind or consideration in conversations with advertisers. You know, right now, and if you expect that to become more pronounced going forward? Thank you. Steve's do you want to take that and maybe turn it over to Scott for the privacy question. Sure. Yes. Good question on the streaming hours and active account, as we mentioned in the letter in my prepared remarks that certainly, given the pandemic surge in demand and engagement last year, we've got some kind of challenging European comps, not only on those key operating metrics you asked about, but also on certain parts of the P&L, depending on the quarter. So I do think, looking at it sequentially, looking at those metrics relative to pre COVID levels is probably more informative in the short term. And so you know, starting with active accounts, we grew the active account base by 1.5 million active accounts in Q2 up over 55 million. That's as expected below the comparison and what we grew last Q2 given the surge in demand, but it's favorable to the increase in Q2 2029. So I think that's a good comp there.
In terms of the streaming hours similar, formerly as mentioned earlier in the call, we're at kind of 3.5, 3.6 hours per streaming account per day, which again is kind of in line or slightly favorable to the pre COVID level. So, that's kind of where we more we would expect to be as things get back to normal. Again, apologies, I think I might have said 2029, I meant Q2 2019. So I'm not a soothsayer, clairvoyant [0:41:25]. But anyway, back to that. So I think looking back to those pre COVID levels is probably very instructive as we look ahead here in the interim, certainly there's a lot of uncertainty still around in the macro environment around recovery in the economy open up or the Delta variant taking hold, and kind of putting us back a step. But I think I think looking at the pre COVID levels, and understanding that the year-over-year comparisons are a bit challenged here for another few quarters, at least is an important perspective. And I'll turn it over Scott now for the other piece. Yes, Shyam, let me take the privacy question. What I'd say is that it is definitely a more challenging environment for marketers for independent ad tech. For small publishers who don't have a first party direct consumer relationship, as cookies get more scarce as regulators make use of consumer data harder as companies like Apple make moves to make device IDs harder to access. I would not characterize that as a tailwind for CTV generally, but rather a benefit or an advantage for platforms and services like Roku who've got a first party relationship, it's our strongest advantage when working with a marketer that we know our consumers, we can onboard their data, we can target more precisely measure drive more impact. That's not the case for independent ad tech for entities who don't have that direct consumer relationship. So I would definitely say that we're less effective relative to those entities because of this privilege, direct consumer relationship that we've got. Great, thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from [0:43:25] of Loop Capital. Your line is open. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit as to how much of the platform revenues coming from the streaming companies, or how quickly the streaming companies in aggregate are growing just any more data on how much of the 100 plus percent growth we're getting from the streamers? Thank you. Yes, we had a very, very robust quarter for the platform business. And it owes to strong performance on both the content and advertising activities of the business. As it taking it in parts, most of our big streaming service providers are still relatively early in their growth. So they're still acquiring consumers, heavily. They're investing heavily with us and taking advantage of our scale, and our marketing tools to acquire users. So we definitely saw good strength in terms of not just the revenue shares that we derived from those relationships, but also their investments in marketing, purchases of buttons, media and entertainment vertical in particular, which is the advertising segment of our business. We're selling marketing products to our content providers, more than tripled year-over-year. So there's a very strong segment but also we had a very, very strong traditional advertising quarter as well with strength from large to what we call our large customer segment, Fortune 500 type advertisers. And there was a question earlier in the call, we're also seeing really great strength from performance or growth, advertising as well, that category for us, which is still smaller part of our overall ad business more than tripled, or nearly tripled year-over-year. So, I just say that broadly, the restraints across the board, but our content vertical was particularly robust and especially the M&A segment. This is Anthony, I would just add that I would characterize both areas, content distribution and advertising is still relatively early compared to the potential those businesses and so there's a lot of room to grow. But I would also say that like from the point of view of someone who's in a day to day, that is gratifying that both of those customers have kind of switched their attitudes recently from, you know, experimental thinking about it to all in like [0:46:10] this is great to see. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. So, I guess that there's obviously increased focus on any change in the active accounts and I'm going to slow down. But just maybe talk about your ability to kind of drive hours, I mean, clearly, it's the counterbalance between you purchase more content for the Roku channel, presumably you can drive more hours, and then you get dollars and kind of balancing that. So maybe talk about like, even if you as active accounts were too slow, how much you still have with kind of, again, driving hours and then monetizing? I just did anybody ask a 606 question? I don't see you want to comment on, relative to the first quarter, there was more or less 606 impact. And then maybe last, any thoughts about how the Olympics will impact you in the third quarter? Let me start with that. And then Steve can jump in for 606 discussion. I would say just first of all on active accounts. I mean, they're, we've hit 55 million active accounts, which is a proxy for a household. But if you look at the potential market is just huge. I mean, there's a billion households around the world that have broadband, and watch TV, all of those households are going to transition over time to streaming for all their TV. And the way they're going to get it I think prime ultimately will be embedded in their TVs. And so you know, the real question is market share for smart TVs, and we're the number one, in the US, we're number one, and then the markets were entering, we're doing extremely well. So I would say it's a lot of potential for active accounts in terms of our ability to drive hours. It’s the cost core competency that we continue to build out. So you know, it's really one of the primary goals of our home screen experiences to help consumers find content influence content they watch and be a trusted partner with our viewers and finding content. And so I think a good example, and so we have a lot of ability to do that. And we view it actually is important that we help our viewers find content.
And so for example, with the Olympics, we spent the six months prior to the Olympics, working with NBC to build out into our home screen, an Olympic serves as a way to help viewers find out when the Olympics start, how do I watch the Olympics? What's happening? How do I get highlights and so just to make it easy for our viewers to find content, and that is getting a lot of use is doing just doing extremely well. So you know, there's just lots of ways like that, where we can become more important and want to become more trusted with our viewers and helping them decide what to watch. Hopefully that helps you answer the question then 606, Steve? Yes, Jason, Steve. Thank you for keeping our tradition alive with the 606 related question. Nothing a particular note this quarter on 606 as a reminder for everyone, 606 we have a portfolio of material deal models, every quarter we look at that we update our assumptions. You know, if their new services or you know, specific terms have changed on a deal we produce, you know, that would be a case to update the model or create a new model. And in the quarters where we talk about the 606 impacts, it's usually a quarter where you've had some kind of change in assumption or some other factor that created a large increase in deal models across the portfolio. In a standard quarter, we have deal values that go up, we have deal models that go down, and then many stayed relatively the same. And so kind of this is one quarter where there's nothing particular to note. Steve, do you want to also address the question about Olympics affecting Q3? I can take it. Okay, Scott. Unless you really want it Steve? All right. Well, look, I do think Olympics is a key TV drivers generally, we will have to see how it affects overall viewing. It's certainly been on 24/7 in my household. But you know, as Anthony said, I think the thing we're proud of is our execution together within NBC. And it's really indicative of the kinds of things that Roku can uniquely provide to drive viewership and increase consumption in streaming. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open. Thank you guys called out how the chip shortages and supply chain issues impacting player gross margins and will continue in the future. I just wonder, is there any scope for that to ripple over and affect sort of active account growth? In other words, because the shortage gets so acute, it actually affects a metric that people care about, as opposed to because? Sure, thanks. Yes. You want to take that, Steve? Yes, sure. So in terms of the supply chain issues, I mean, certainly, since the pandemic started, the industry and Roku have been dealing with component shortages, especially recently, component price increases, have seen to accelerate our slides gain and operations team has done a really good job over time, you know, minimizing those impacts. Certainly, you know, last quarter on the call, we mentioned, as part of our outlook, that we thought that given the cost increases, that the our player gross margin would go negative, which it did was negative 6%. Gross margin per player in the quarter, we said, we think that will increase in the back half. In certainly, this is an industry issue. So this is not only impacting us, but competitors on the player side, but also on the TV side. So you know, there's a strong surge in TV sales last year, some of the industry research firms are assuming that those number, that Smart TV market is going to go down year-over-year, and certainly many TV OEMs whether they're Roku, TV, you know, because the low margin business are pushing forward those price increase, those cost increases into price increases that you know, are testing the elasticity. So, certainly these kinds of conditions do not help the industry in terms of driving player in TV sales forward and so that that is something that we're factoring in. Okay, thank you. And the last question comes from the line of [0:53:57]. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. You know, I guess two questions, one on sort of, as you become more of a, I'm going to use John Malone's word for Roku, sort of more and more of a gatekeeper, to store to the streaming world. Curious how you think about ultimately being able to get subscription revenue, sort of a fee for usage or a fee for being on the platform. It seems like nobody can sort of be in the streaming world without being on Roku, as evidenced by all the deals we were able to get done over the last couple of years. And then sort of on a different topic. It sort of relate to this whole streaming world topic that I'm pushing on. When you think about sort of the media and entertainment spelt spending that was called out in your investor letter. How do you think about the sustainability of that? I mean, we're seeing a lot of platforms spending a lot. I mean, you're not the only one to call it out. Twitter did on their conference call, we were seeing a tremendous amount of spending and wondering like, I think investors are sort of curious, like whether this can be sustained in terms of how much they're spending to acquire subs? And are you thinking that's repeatable over the next couple of years? Or do you think that gets more challenging? Thanks. Hey, Rick [ph], great to hear from you. Last but not least. I wouldn't characterize us as a gatekeeper. I'm hesitant to even say that word out loud. I mean, we exist in a very competitive industry, we have lots of big, huge competitors. And consumers have lots of choice, you know, not just Roku, but they have choice of Samsung, Google, Amazon, and so forth. So we're very confident our ability to compete, but it's a competitive industry. In terms of, like charging for access to Roku, I mean, that's just not the way we think about it. We think about it as distributing people's content in a partnership and a win-win type situation, type deal.
How do we help them build customer base, customers build subscription basis, increase engagement? And how do we participate in that success when we achieve it? And so, we're focused on structuring deals that result in more viewers watching streaming from a variety of services and participating in the economics of that by being really good at it, and bringing a lot of value to the table. So that's kind of how we think about it. And then I guess that's on the M&A side. I mean obviously advertising is a huge part of our businesses, the viewers switch to streaming, all ads are moving to streaming. And it's a hugely large business that we're very focused on. So and that's going to keep growing. So I don't know if Steve or Scott, if you had any other specific answers. Yes, this just Scott. Great question Rich, I would just add to that. The suggestion of a gatekeeper term suggests a one and done kind of relationship. But as Anthony just highlighted, the success of these services and our ability to earn alongside them is an ongoing exercise. It's not just about acquiring a user. It's about retaining a user, especially as these services get big, shifting the frame to not just user acquisition, but also retention is critical. It's also a global market. And so yes, I do think that we're in a phase where there's very, very heavy investment, but I also am bullish on the long term potential, to partner with these services to continue to drive and retain viewership in their services. Scott, I think that's an incredible point that probably doesn't get enough focus. When you think about the user acquisition spend versus the reengagement spend. Is there any way that like, when you made that comment about sort of the robust growth is substantially outpacing the overall platform revenue growth? Is there any way to think about how much of that spend that was coming from reengagement versus sub acquisition? Well, look, I'll say, it's still relatively modest, most of these service providers are still very much in user acquisition mode. But it becomes critical as you need to run the math. If you lose 5% of your users monthly and you hit 10 million subs, that's what 500,000 users you got to acquire just to replace the users you've lost. So some of this is just the scale problem, I think you know, that our partners are bringing more focus to it. It's an area where we can certainly help. We've talked about the Olympics execution here a couple times, it's executions like that, that don't just get the user to sign up for the service, but get them to keep coming back and seeing the value in the service. So when that monthly bill hits, they don't cancel the service. That's critical and we are we are working, we've got a great tool set to help there, to predict, churn to predict what's going to engage user and we're bringing more attention to it with our content partners. Thank you very much. I guess my one last comment is I think I've been a little surprised about the willingness of consumers to sign up for multiple streaming services. There was a big question, you know about, will these streaming services all survive? How many will survive? And I don't think we know the answer to that. But I do think we're seeing consumers interested in more than just one or two streaming services willing to sign up for those multiple services and still save money versus what they're spending on pay TV. PayTV is expensive. Indeed. And not very good. Sorry, that was an editorial. That was a rich opinion. Thanks, Anthony. Thank you. And now I will turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for any closing remarks. I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners for an excellent quarter. We believe our competitive advantages and the broad secular trends have driven our growth continue to position us for success. Thanks for joining us today.","we'll make forward looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events . full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter . this call will also discuss certain non GAAP financial measures .",0.0

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today; Conrad Grodd, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Roku's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by; Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, the Senior Vice President, General Manager of our Platform business who will be available for Q&A.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks Conrad and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. In Q3 we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. The monetization side of our business continued to make tremendous progress with ARPU surpassing the milestone of $40. I'd now like to highlight three major themes. First, consumers advertisers and content publishers continue to shift to TV streaming. Roku's role at the center of the ecosystem to bring these stakeholders together on a common platform is more important than ever.
Second, Roku is the best platform for content publishers that want to grow a successful streaming business with a very effective and efficient set of tools for promoting content services whether that's signing up new customers, increasing customer engagement or reducing attrition. We've put a lot of effort into building these capabilities and our content partners are taking advantage of the tools and products we offer.
And third, there is still a significant gap as advertisers have been slow to follow viewers to TV streaming. With our scale, technology and first-party customer relationships we are uniquely positioned to benefit as this gap begins to close. The investments we have made and continue to make in our operating system that is purpose-built for TV, as well as our strong brand and large scale continue to position us well for the long term.
And with that let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks Anthony. Before we take your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our viewpoint looking forward. We grew active accounts by 1.3 million in Q3 ending the quarter with 56.4 million. While we continue to scale the platform, we believe that the slowdown in active account growth rate this quarter was in large part attributable to global supply chain disruptions that have impacted the overall US TV market.
Specifically overall US TV sales in Q3 fell below pre-COVID 2019 levels. We believe this was largely a function of lower inventory and higher component costs being passed along to consumers as overall US TV prices increased 42% year-over-year. We believe that some of our TV OEM partners were hit particularly hard with these inventory challenges.
Meanwhile Roku player unit sales remained above pre-COVID levels and the average selling price decreased 7% year-over-year as we chose to insulate consumers from higher costs. Roku users streamed 18 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year as we continue to outperform viewing hour growth rates of both traditional TV and other TV streaming platforms.
Total Q3 revenue increased 51% year-over-year to $680 million.
Platform segment revenue was up 82% year-over-year to $582.5 million, representing 86% of total revenue. Platform monetization accelerated with ARPU of $40.10 on a trailing 12-month basis up nearly 50% year-over-year.
Player revenue and player unit sales were both down 26% year-over-year following the pandemic-related demand spike in Q3 2020, but remained above pre-COVID levels in Q3 2019. Gross profit, our key financial metric grew 69% year-over-year in Q3 to $363.9 million resulting in gross margin of 54%.
Platform gross margin of 65% was consistent with Q2 levels and was more than expected due to a favorable mix toward higher-margin media and entertainment spend by content publishers. As mentioned earlier, we chose to insulate our consumers from increased component and logistics costs, resulting in player gross margin decreasing to negative 15% in Q3.
Our strong revenue and gross profit performance allowed us to deliver a record adjusted EBITDA of $130.1 million in Q3, while still investing in the business with OpEx spend of $295.1 million up 45% year-over-year. We ended Q3 with approximately $2.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.
As we look ahead, our business fundamentals remained strong overall. The global supply chain disruptions will likely impact the overall holiday season in terms of shipping delays, product availability issues and product price increases. We expect the U.S. TV market to continue to be significantly impacted by these issues.
Additionally, certain advertising verticals could reduce spend in Q4, due to limited product availability. Year-to-date, we are pleased with the performance of the business, despite continued pandemic-related obstacles and we achieved continued progress as the secular shift to TV streaming proceeds.
Our Q4 outlook is for a robust growth with total net revenue of $893 million at the midpoint up 37% year-over-year, despite macro headwinds and comping strong performance last Q4 from a rebounding ad business as well as the introduction of new SVOD services that drove content distribution value and M&A spend.
Q4 estimated gross profit of $385 million at the mid-point, up 26% year-over-year is being impacted by our decision to absorb increasing supply chain-related costs in our player business, as we optimize for account growth versus player gross profit.
We anticipate that the ongoing investments we are making as we grow and expand our business will increase operating expenses on a sequential basis and as a result we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be $70 million at the mid-point. Please note, that adjusted EBITDA includes stock-based comp of $57 million and $13 million of depreciation and amortization and net other income in the quarter.
We are pleased with the resilience of our business in the face of macro headwinds and continue to have confidence in the long-term vision of all TV moving to streaming that has driven Roku's extraordinary growth, since inception. We therefore continue to invest in our technology, tools and platform to maintain and grow our leading position in the TV ecosystem.
With that, let's turn the call over for questions, Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open. Thanks so much. Steve, I was hoping maybe you could flesh out the revenue guide a bit both revenue and gross margin that is in terms of player versus platform. And then, as you called out product pricing in ad spend on the product pricing front are you anticipating raising prices?
And then, on the ad spend call out, is there a specific direction you're getting from ad buyers right now that points to that call as well? Just if you could flesh a few of those details out that would be great. Thanks. Yes. Hey, Mark. Yes, in terms of the Q4 revenue, the outlook calls for a robust growth of 37% year-over-year at the midpoint for $893 million on the revenue side. There are a couple of factors impacting the year-over-year growth rate that I'll walk you through.
So first one is tough comps from last year. So especially on the platform side, we delivered exceptional performance in Q4 of 2020, largely driven by very strong media and entertainment spending by content publishers strong results on the content distribution side. That was the time when you had a couple marquee services that we were launching or building up in terms of HBO Max and discovery+ launching. And so those are a couple of factors that make the year-over-year comp pretty tough.
Then you kind of mentioned that the supply chain disruptions that we talked about for Q3 in terms of -- and this is really a macro industry or macro trend that's impacting a lot of industries where you've got component cost increases, you have inventory availability challenges you have shipping delays and shipping cost increases.
Those are really -- we believe those will continue into Q4 and into sometime in 2021 -- or sorry 2022. And so, those are factored into the outlook color Q4. And then we are -- there's a lot of uncertainties around the holiday season and we are also tracking some of the knock-on effects that we've seen that where, certain verticals, especially on the advertising side, they're seeing their own supply chain challenges impacting their availability and thus some of them are slowing down their advertising spend. So we saw a bit of that in Q3 and we anticipate like a lot of other folks that that will be persistent in Q4 as well. Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up Steve, just as I look at 3Q print, player revenue was obviously weak and platform actually performed quite well. So if I think about 4Q player versus platform, is it fair to say that more of that guide pertains to the player side of the business and acknowledging that there are tough comps in player? But maybe if you could just flesh that out just a bit more, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Yes, sure Mark. So on the one -- just as context on that and really just -- and this speaks to the impact on the TV market with U.S. TV sales. So the supply chain disruptions that I mentioned are impacting a lot of industries they're impacting U.S. TV sales. That is down. The market is down 31% year-over-year in part because pricing on U.S. TVs on average is up 42%. And the U.S. TV market is actually down below pre-COVID levels in the corresponding period in 2019.
When you look at the Roku Player results, as you mentioned Roku revenue -- Roku Player revenues and Roku units are down year-over-year based on an extraordinary demand spike in the pandemic in Q3, 2020. But player unit and player revenue are actually in Q3 above 2019 levels.
So the TV side of the industry, we definitely get hit harder than the Roku players. Part of that has to do with we've chosen to insulate consumers in terms of the pricing, while not passing on the component cost increases. And we mentioned that we plan to do that in Q4 as well.
So I think there's some uncertainty that's impacting the macroeconomic environment even in consumer sentiment. But certainly from the industry perspective, we think these trends will happen, but we're going to continue with our successful strategy on the player side of focusing on driving account growth as opposed to trying to focus on the player gross margin. Hey, Mark, this is Scott -- oh go ahead Anthony. Go ahead. No, go ahead Scott. Mark, I was just going to say that, certainly there are some ad verticals like auto and CPG that are facing their own supply chain issues and that's causing some advertisers to slow their spending. We think it will bounce back as they work through these supply chain issues.
It's also important to note that there are a lot of ad categories that are not affected by supply chain issues, financial services, our M&E segment. These are services businesses that aren't affected in the same way. And so it's a modest effect on some parts of the business, but not across the whole ad business. Sorry Anthony, you wanted to chime in with something? Well, I was going to say that. But also I think if you just think about the drivers of our ad business because some of your questions were about our ad business, the biggest driver of the ad business is not these kinds of details. It's the fact that if you look at TV time in the US today adults 18 to 49 spend 42% of their TV time streaming. But if you look at the amount of ad spend on streaming versus traditional TV, it's only 22% has moved to streaming. So there's this big gap still and that gap is starting to close, but has a long way to go. That -- the rate of that closure because they will catch up eventually and the rate of all viewers moving to streaming those are the biggest drivers of our ad business which is a $60 billion opportunity. Our next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you. Let me try your partnership and negotiations with YouTube please. How should we think about the impact on streaming hours going forward? And is there any other negotiation -- there's media coverage on potential conversations with Prime Video. Could you please comment on both those? And then second, could you please help us understand the active account growth to the extent that you can contribution from perhaps international markets, not only in the fourth quarter, but how we should think about it going forward? Thank you. Hey, Shweta, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of your question. I think Steve will take the second part. So on YouTube, I don't have new info for you. I would point you at our recent blog post for our perspectives on the topic. One thing I will say is as we said before, it's not about the money, it's about our ability to create the best possible experience for our customers. We're working to resolve this matter. We don't have an update and our goal is to land it in a way that's positive for Roku and for our customers. As for the -- your Amazon question, we have renewal discussions with hundreds of partners each year. It's normal course of business. Our goal in these discussions is always to reach an agreement that's good for our partner, good for our customers, delivers a great user experience. Despite what you may have read, our Amazon agreement is not up for renewal or in negotiations at this time. Steve, do you want to take the second part of Shweta's question? Okay. Thanks. Yeah sure. Hi, Shweta. Yeah, in terms of active account growth, we haven't broken out the specific of international, but the vast majority of the active account base is in the US historically. International has been growing faster than the US. And so over time that will continue to grow in mix. And we're really excited that not only are we making good progress in existing international markets in terms of having scale and market share in existing countries, but we're continuing to increase the footprint. So we just announced entering Germany with player -- starting with players here that just happened. We launched with SEMP TVs in Brazil and we're expanding the Roku TV footprint in Latin America also adding Peru and Chile later in the year. So over time, international will become a greater share of the active accounts. Okay. Thank you, Steve. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking the question. A couple for me. First, you guys did cite pricing of TVs as part of the challenge on the account growth side. A couple of your competitors seem to be taking more control of their TV manufacturing distribution process as opposed to just licensing operating systems. So I'm curious as to whether you would consider expanding your positioning there to having your own TVs in addition to licensing the OS? What are kind of the pros and cons there how much you get into that? And second, Steve, I'd like to try to understand a little better sort of the tough comp year-over-year, especially when it comes to the new streaming services. I feel like you've been pretty clear that you feel like there will be ongoing spend by those publishing partners to continue to drive engagement with their services. So, can you help us at all anymore with kind of how unique last fourth quarter was and what maybe a more normalized behavior might look like? Hey, Mike this is Anthony. I'll take the first part on TV sales and our brand and so forth and Steve, obviously, will take the second part. Just in terms of the way the TV business works is there's different roles, different companies take in the supply chain. And the results of all of that if you were to dig into it is the brand you sell your TV under does not affect the price. It's not a factor in the price.
The main factor in prices is things like component costs and shipping costs. If you look at what happened in the quarter TV prices were up 42% on average which is a pretty big increase. And also inventory was down like TVs were just not available. And that was driven in particular especially Chinese manufacturers, the supply chain issues around shipping and getting products out of China and into the US were particularly bad. And it just was either impossible or very expensive to ship products.
And that -- so that's just a factor that affects anyone shipping products to the US from overseas. And then panel shortages and chip shortages and all that stuff also. So, whether -- the brand you sell it under doesn't come into play there.
You have companies like VIZIO that have a model where they source products from factories overseas and then they get and then they transfer the product to a retailer and they almost don't take possession of the inventory. So, I would just say in summary we're happy with the way we run our Roku TV program. We work with a lot of top brands and they're very successful selling Roku TVs. We work with the entire ecosystem. We work with retailers directly we work with TV brands, we work with the factory directly.
We do the engineering. I mean a lot of companies don't realize -- a lot of people don't realize it but Roku is actually one of the few TV companies in the world in the sense that we have all the technology to build a TV. We know how to bring that manufacturing, we have the retailer. I mean we do everything except, we don't put our brand on it we work with partners that are in -- specifically in the TV business. And that works well for us. Then Steve or Scott? This is Scott. I'll take the M&E question the media and entertainment question from you Mike. Thanks for that. Yes, last Q4 was a very robust quarter. It had a couple of big new service launches. It was in the middle of the pandemic. But the M&E category continues to perform very well and I think there are a lot of reasons to remain bullish on it.
We are a first stop for anyone in the streaming services business because we have an effective promotions platform our scale our data our tools make it cheaper ultimately for the streaming services to acquire and retain users than all their other options where they might spend.
So, the M&E category in Q3 grew faster, substantially faster than the overall platform and the ads business. The growth is still strong although it is moderating. It's more normalizing as we come off of the pandemic. We mentioned in the shareholder letter this PAW Patrol execution by Paramount Plus, it's just a fun example of the one of many different ways that brands can invest with us to drive awareness and ultimately, trials and subscriptions to their services.
There's also a pretty long runway in our view around the M&E business. It's not ultimately just about user acquisition but as these services get bigger they also need to drive engagement and retention of those users that they've acquired. We've been building out the tool set, so that our partners can promote not just on that big home screen unit that you see when you start your Roku up, but in the channel store through video ads on and off the platform.
We've also made a lot of progress on our optimization technology so that we can deliver to the partner new users at their target customer acquisition costs. So, overall, although the business is normalizing as it comes off -- as we come off of the pandemic, the business continues to grow and I think is ultimately a tool a service that's going to be a great asset for our partners going forward. Great. Thank you, both. Our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about the deceleration in video advertising revenue. You said that the monetized impressions almost doubled. And I think outside of the pandemic quarters, that's the slowest kind of growth we have seen. So I was wondering, if you could give us some color on what's going on there? And can we expect reacceleration back to 100-plus percent there?
And a related question is, do you mind telling us, how the three different components of the platform revenue grew this quarter versus last quarter? And I mean video that we know, but then distribution and media promotional spending and what drives those variances quarter-to-quarter? Thanks. Scott will take the ad question and then Steve can take the second question. Looks like you're muted, Scott. I was muted. Thank you. Too many mute buttons on this end. Thanks, Vasily. I'll just say that the video ad business roughly doubled. It wasn't a substantial deceleration. We are coming off of a couple of quarters, where what we're comping over is a challenging comp relatively speaking. So, in general, we still view that category of advertising as robust, very robust.
The other categories that we're seeing robust growth out of -- we just discussed the M&E business. We're also seeing great strength in our performance or growth advertising set and these are advertisers that are driven primarily by optimizing to outcomes. That segment roughly tripled year-over-year and I think is indicative of our ability to attract a new class of digital or social first advertisers, who are less interested in reaching a demographic and more interested in optimizing for a site visit or a product purchase. Steve, do you want to take the second part of Vasily's question? Yes, sure. Hey Vasily. Yes, we don't break out the components within the platform segment. But we did talk about this quarter we had significant contributions from both, the content and distribution side and the advertising activities. So those are notable pieces of the puzzle in terms of growing relatively fast.
The other thing that's important to note that we talked about on prior earnings calls is in the back half of this year, we just have tougher comps, especially on the platform monetization side. So, if you remember in the pandemic last year, Q2 when a lot of advertisers hit the emergency break, we had a relatively easy comp for that quarter. And then, as we went into Q3 the -- our advertising business rapidly kind of reaccelerated and went back to a more normalized state in Q3 and Q4. And we talked a little bit about how the M&E business has been doing extremely well, but it's had a banner kind of last 12 months. So, as you've had a lot of the media companies either come on with new services or shift their focus towards that. So, we're very happy with the continued progress despite these tough year-over-year comps. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions probably for Scott. Scott, curious on -- there's been some obviously a lot of talk about IDFA and mobile headwinds this quarter and sort of heading into the holidays. Is that helping Roku at all? Are you finding advertisers maybe moving towards connected TV, just given some of the challenges particularly on the performance DR front?
And then, you guys announced a really interesting partnership with Shopify, I don't think that's been discussed on this call. There's a comment in the letter about SMBs and building out products for them. I'm just wondering, if there's an update you could provide for us on how sort of substantial that business is for you yet? And if you think this partnership translates into sort of real revenue kind of as we look out into 2022? Thanks. All right. Thanks, Ben for the questions -- or the two questions I should say. Yes, as you alluded to and the way you framed up the question, the disruption and the noise around the loss of cookies and device IDs like Apple's IDFA in general is a net benefit to Roku, really for two reasons. First, independent ad tech is very challenged in an environment, where these identifiers are getting more scarce because, they don't have these identifiers. They don't have a direct consumer relationship, whereas Roku does. And so we're always working on our platform with our own first-party data and it's a fundamental advantage for us and ultimately is bringing brands to us.
The second is a more general statement, which is that, these changes are forcing marketers to step back and reevaluate their full ad investment portfolio, how they're spending on social platforms for example. As these identifiers disappear, their costs of acquiring users or whatever action they're chasing are going up because their ability to measure, it is being through the loss of these identifiers.
And Roku is a beneficiary there in the sense that brands are generally underinvested still in streaming relative to our scale and our capabilities. And we've got user, identifiers and data just like some of these big platforms. So in general, we come out ahead as brands step back and reevaluate their digital and social investments and it accrues to our benefit.
You mentioned the Shopify partnership this is a relatively new partnership. We were excited. It was – we have a beta program running with them where basically a merchant on the Shopify platform can opt through their platform to purchase advertising on Roku. And we've got a whole host of brands Jambys, Moon Pod, Birthdate, OLIPOP in that beta working with us through that Shopify connection.
It's still early days but the program was oversubscribed on the first day. And I think it is indicative of a broader strategy on our part to really widen the funnel the set of advertisers that we work with on our platform. We are able because of our data our scale, our optimization capabilities to work with brands that have traditionally invested in social and digital. And the Shopify partnership is a dimension and angle by which to diversify into that client base. You'll see other things like that from us going forward. Hi, Ben, this is… Go ahead. Ben – sorry, this is Anthony. I just thought I'd add a couple of points. So in our letters and on these calls, we talk a lot about the TV ad business to $60 billion is moving from traditional TV to streaming and how customers or viewers are moving from traditional TV to streaming and the ad dollars are lagging but following. And it's a big market and our goal is to capture a big part of that market and we think there's multiple winners but be one of the winners in that transition.
But we've talked about TV advertising but if you look at our TV ad, the way we do TV advertising and our TV ad technology stack I mean it's nothing like a traditional TV advertiser. It's just built entirely on a digital big data targeted platform. It's got all the characteristics of a typical digital ad platform. And so we don't usually talk about that much but that market that uses those kinds of tools is just as big as the TV ad market. So it's a – obviously, our goal is to go after both of those markets and they're both big opportunities for us. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open. Hi, there. Scott, I'd like to follow up on Vasily's question about the bottom of funnel SMBs. I know you've been growing that and talking about that a lot. But what we're hearing from like Facebook and Snap and other places that the SMB is challenged. So I'm wondering, how is it that your small and medium-sized business category is growing and performance stat is growing so robustly in an environment where other people are saying those kinds of advertisers have really pulled back because of lack of feedback? Yes. Thanks, Laura. Look, I think partly it's the result of this being a new medium for most of these brands. Most of these brands did not grow up investing in television. They grew up investing in Facebook and then in Snap and more recently in other platforms. And in some cases they're being priced out of their activity on those platforms and especially as the identifier landscape is changing, it's making their spending look more expensive because they're less able to prove the effectiveness.
We are brand new to the category. We offer an opportunity for these not just as Anthony said, optimize the outcomes but also having – have a branding impact is running a 15 or 30-second spot on the biggest screen in the household. So we're something of a new kid on the block, but I think our appeal is quite broad.
We're still early in the business. It depends on how you want to talk about and think about the business. There's SMBs there's direct-to-consumer brands that have grown up nationally. All these brands tend to approach their ad spend with a performance goal in mind. And we've got the tools to compete for it. So from where we sit we see very, very significant upside going forward that we're in a different place than some of the other platforms you mentioned. Super helpful. And then Anthony I have a pricing question for you. I must be thinking about this wrong, but I think there's a consensus on Wall Street that TVs are going to sell out because of the supply chain issues. So it would seem to me that's really good for your dongles because you can fill up one aircraft carrier and basically supply America. But if you're going to sell out of those anyway because TVs are running out why would you cut price? Why wouldn't you double price and still sell out and just and still add as many subs, but at a higher price because you've got dongles in stock when all the TVs smart TVs are running out of inventory at the retail level? So let me just try to understand the question you're talking about why do we lower the price on the players? Yes. Aren't you going to sell out? So why lower the price? Well we try hard not to sell out, right? I mean obviously forecasting is a huge issue in our business. And getting the forecast right is important. And if you order too many devices then you end up with extra inventory if you don't order enough you sell out and you lose sales. So the supply chain -- in the case of players we're not -- our goal wasn't to not sell out.
We are paying more for expedited shipping for -- to get chips get in front of the line for chips. So the results of all that is our costs are going up. But we haven't sold out yet. We've just been paying for air shipping and we've been spending money to insulate the retailer and the end customer from pricing issues and supply issues. So far we've been doing that relatively effectively.
In the case of TVs, it's just a complete -- we don't obviously we don't set the price of TVs that's set by the TV OEMs and the retailers. And TVs cost so much more that -- and the lead times are longer. It's just it's not practical in many cases to absorb the cost increases for TV. So TVs are going to be in short supply as a result. And the players hopefully we won't run out of stock but we'll see how the quarter goes.
You also have more options on players. Like you can pull things in from Q1 with air shipping if you look like you're selling more than you expected things like that. You cannot airship TVs as a backup plan because they're just too heavy. So it seems like that would be a net beneficiary to you on the dongle side right? Yes, we have -- we are managing the supply issues better than the TV manufacturer to manage TV supply issue. So that is true. That is helping. That's the reason you didn't see player sales drop at the same amount that TV sales dropped relative to the last quarter. I mean player sales were up over 2019 pre-COVID levels. TV sales were not up because of the reasons we just discussed. Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about viewership trends of The Roku Channel off of Roku's hardware. So people watching Roku Channel that don't have a Roku Smart TV that don't have a dongle? And then the second question I had was how should we think about your proprietary content what you acquired from Quibi and This Old House how that's performing and your appetite to potentially acquire more? So this is Anthony. I'll take that and then I'm sure Scott might jump in with some extra detail or add some thoughts. So in terms of viewership trends of The Roku Channel off of the Roku platform I mean we don't break that out, but we said previously and it's still true that our primary focus is on Roku. That's where we have our full set of assets available to help promote the offerings.
And so that's where we spend most of our effort. We do make it available off Roku. And for example if you have a premium subscription you sign up for Showtime on -- in The Roku Channel. Sometimes you want to be able to watch that on your phone. So that's we make that available. And we do get incremental reach in viewing off Roku, but it's not our primary focus.
The primary focus is on the Roku platform where The Roku Channel has become a very important asset for us. It's very successful and continues to do well. And we've created this virtuous cycle where we can invest more in content that brings in more viewers that brings them more advertisers that provides more dollars to spend on content you just get this cycle that's really working well for us.
And then you inject into that cycle, the fact that it's our platform we own the home stream we can promote the content we can promote our originals very effectively. All that -- that's just the perfect storm of everything working well for us and so that's what we focus on.
In terms of content, your question is about content. We have a mix -- we have a portfolio approach of content for The Roku Channel. Obviously, as the portfolio is getting deeper and wider as we're able to spend more money as the scale grows, we spend more money on content. So it's just an overall strategy. We license a lot of content for The Roku Channel, I think we're at about 200 different companies that we license content from.
And, of course, we're producing originals. So we got into the original business when we bought the Quibi content as you mentioned. But since then we've greenlit renewals of some of those shows, we've greenlit new shows like Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas. And then that's because the originals are working for us as part of the portfolio. They're not a huge portion of the portfolio, because like I said we have over 200 content partners. We also have lots of linear channels. We just added 17 linear channels, so we now have over 200-plus linear channels. We keep growing our kids and family content.
So we're just growing content across the platform and originals are part of that portfolio and they work great for us in a few different ways. They, obviously, drive a lot of viewing because they're exclusive, but they also bring in new viewers, they help bring in new viewers to The Roku Channel experience. And so that's an important role for originals for us. And then also advertisers really like originals, because they're something unique and exclusive and so it helps drive our ad business. So for all those reasons, we're going to keep doing originals, but again in a disciplined way and as a part of the portfolio. Thanks for taking my question, Anthony. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. And sorry I was late joining this call from another call, so I hope I haven't missed this. But I'm curious about your international expansion. My question is I hope this isn't also clouded by the supply chain issues at the moment, but my question is you've laid out a strategy where your international expansion is basically predicated on your players if I understand right, leading the way into these markets. By understanding those international consumers and a lot of markets are often just buying a new smart TV rather than buying a player. So I'm curious if you could talk about the growth of your dongle sales, your player sales versus your growth in smart TV operating system sales, are you advantaged or disadvantaged in any way on either side? Thanks. Hi, Tim, this is Anthony. Well, I'll just start by saying that it's not true that we're player-first internationally. We view the international opportunity as a big opportunity. Streaming is a global phenomenon. The shift to streaming around the world continues. Our overall strategy is to basically copy what has worked for us in the US and use that internationally. So that's basically build scale through both TVs and players. That's how we've done it in the US and that's what we're doing internationally, increasing engagement and then as scale builds develop monetization techniques.
So that's the overall strategy. And as we enter new international markets we're seeing the consumers like our products. They use them a lot. And our market share grows in those countries as we enter the country. So our international strategy is working for us. We do enter markets sometimes with TVs first, sometimes with players first but our goal is to have both of them available in every market from multiple vendors and multiple SKUs.
So, for example, when we entered the Brazilian market, we entered with TVs. We just entered the German market we entered first with players. But in all markets, we eventually have players and TVs and usually it doesn't take that long. So a couple of other things that have happened recently in our international efforts, we launched players in Germany. And so now we have more than 2,000 channels on the German channel store platform.
In terms of Roku TVs, we just introduced a brand new lineup of SEMP model Roku TVs in Brazil. SEMP is a popular Brazilian brand for TVs. And we're working with TCL to expand -- to bring Roku TVs to Brazil later this year. We're expanding our presence in Latin America with Roku TV models later this year in Chile and Peru. And we're also shipping players in Latin America, UK and other countries. So, it's -- just to summarize, I mean we -- in terms of building active accounts, it's the same strategy we have in the US, which is focused on players and TVs. That’s great color. Thanks, Anthony. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Two questions. First, more short-term related Scott or Steve, in the letter you talked about headwinds that may impact Q4 guide several factors but one of which you talked about is advertising spend. Obviously, there's some concerns with product availability, et cetera. But, are you starting to see any advertisers sort of having the discussions about pulling back spend for Q4, or have they, or is that just more sort of what could potentially happen, is the first question.
And second question is just longer term, Anthony. You talked about the $60 billion opportunity in the spread or the gap that's close between time spent and ad spend. If you think about mobile or desktop advertising that was certainly true through time. But any factors you could sort of point to that could speed up that gap closing other than just time? Any sort of market movements or acceleration you could talk to or any perspective on perhaps when you think that gap may actually close would be great? Thank you. Sure. Steve, do you want to go first? Yeah, sure. Hey, Ralph. Just in terms of the Q4 outlook color on that, we did mention uncertainty in Q4 and into 2022 related to pandemic supply chain disruptions. And in the ad business, it's kind of a secondary effect as certain companies or verticals have their own challenges they might soften up their advertising spend. We've seen some evidence on that. It's been widely reported across the other advertising-focused companies and industries that there is some evidence of that. It's kind of unknown exactly how that will play out in the rest of Q4 here. So it's something that we're watching, but it is a factor that we accounted for as part of our Q4 outlook ranges. And then, in terms of the gap, time is probably the biggest factor. But the other thing that affects it, I think is anything that causes advertisers to reevaluate their spend. So, COVID I think for example has been a helpful factor in that, when everyone pulled back their advertising when COVID first hit. And then they started spending again, I think that they looked harder at how to spend that money more effectively. And I think they realized that they were underspending at streaming. Just -- so I think that's helped.
I think the -- I think Scott talked a little bit about the identity issues around cookies and such. I think that problem is also causing advertisers to reevaluate where and how they spend their dollars. So those kinds of things will I think, cause people to reevaluate and those are good for us. I mean if you just look at the numbers it is -- the gap is starting to close. It was a pretty -- I mean the gap has closed some since we last discussed the stats, but it still has a ways to go. Okay, great. Thanks, Anthony. Stay safe. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe two if I could. First, just coming back to TVs for a second. Obviously, there's some new kind of incremental competition in market between Google TCL, Amazon Fire TV branded TVs and kind of what Comcast is doing. It remains to be seen how successful that will be. But I guess the question is that that narrative is there and I'm curious what you guys think about to kind of offset that narrative?
And I guess one lever to pull when we think about international supply chain aside I guess, if we think about the next couple of years, I know you guys have been investing pretty aggressively. Can we see faster launches and penetration and ramp internationally than maybe we've seen kind of looking backwards over the last couple of years? I guess the other lever I'm curious is OEM opportunities. Are there other OEMs perhaps that you're not working with that -- without getting into any names where you feel like there's real opportunity for Roku? So that's the first question on TV.
The second question is around the different levers within the TV advertising business as we start to look forward here. I think you guys have held ad load pretty constant, if I'm not mistaken. CPMs, I would assume have probably been under some pretty nice upward pressure. And so I'm just curious, where you think you are in terms of inventory and sell-through? Is there any kind of ceiling we're hitting there? CPMs, is there any ceiling that we're hitting there? And I guess, is there any change to ad load versus kind of what you've been targeting in the past? Thanks, guys. This is Anthony. I'll take the TV questions. And Scott will I assume take the ad questions, because that's what he does. Let's see. So competition, so just in general, if you think about competition, I mean, we're in a very competitive industry. But we've been competing very successfully with large companies, all the companies you mentioned since the beginning. And if you look at where we are in terms of that competition, we've gone from no market share in TVs to the number one licensed TV OS brand in the US with about a-third of all TVs sold now running the Roku operating system. We've built an incredibly strong brands around streaming. We've achieved large scale with lots I believe lots of scale growth to continue in front of us. Most of our growth is in front of us.
So we've been competing very effectively. We take competition very seriously. I don't see any particular dramatic change in the competitive landscape, with all the stuff that's going on. It's just more of the same, and we will continue to compete in market share. I think we'll continue to grow although there'll be puts and takes as we move along that path. We continue to innovate. We've built the world's only purpose-built operating system for TV, it's one of the primary reasons we're so successful. Our competitors all take – generally take mobile operating systems and port them to TV, and that is versus Roku's approach is from the ground up build the best possible operating system just for TV and keep innovating and being maniacally focused on that.
So that's how we compete. We hire great talent. We stay focused. We've built a purposeful operating system for TV. We focus on innovation that matters being super easy to use, lots of content, being a partner for the center of the ecosystem. So I mean, that strategy works well for us. If you look at – and then you had asked for about US versus international, I mean, obviously US is a bit more mature market, but there's still lots of room to grow, where like I said about a-third of TVs sold in the US roughly half of TVs sold in the US are still running proprietary homegrown, operating systems not a licensed operating system.
And I personally, as we said before, we don't think that's sustainable. And you see that in the market share generally declining for these legacy TV companies as companies like Roku license ROS and gain share. And so in the US, I think you're going to see a lot of our share growth come from decline in share from the usual big Tier 1 TV companies which has been happening and will continue to happen. There was a bit of a – if you look into the details, it was a little bit of a reversal of that trend slightly recently due to supply chain issues, because it was easier to get TVs out of non-Korean – sorry out of non-Chinese companies – countries. It's particularly hard to get TVs shipped and built out of China, and our partners are primarily Chinese. So that impacted us more, but that's temporary. And I think that general trend that, the world will move entirely to a licensed OS is – will continue to happen and that will be a source of growth in the US.
Internationally, there's – we're just newer to the market there. And so every time we enter a country, we're displacing existing TV companies. And like I said before, consumers like our products and our market share continues to grow it starts growing immediately once we enter a country and we're seeing good results. So we're going to continue to push on international and domestic expansion of accounts. There's lots of ways to keep growing it, and that's what we're going to keep doing. I mean, if you think about the big picture, we believe all TV is going to be streamed. That means, there's one billion broadband households around the world. They're going to get all their TV through streaming. So a pretty small percent of those are actually doing that today. I'll take the second part of your question, which I think amounts to do we see any near-term feelings, or limitations in our ability to keep scaling the ad business? And I'd say that's generally not a concern of ours. First of all, as Anthony has pointed out, a few times in this call, there's still a pretty significant gap between user engagement and the ad investments. So there's a lot of headroom there. We're also – as fast as we're growing we're still -- we still sell a minority of the ads on our own platforms. So there's a lot of inventory flowing through the Roku platform, for us to both sell as well as through our OneView Ad Platform to add value.
So even if the transaction isn't our own media sale even if it's a publisher on our platform, we can apply the same identity data optimization capabilities through our OneView Ad Platform that our advertisers have come to expect when they're buying media from us directly. You talked about ad load, which I heard is like would, we float the ad load up. We're pretty passionate about the user experience here and not floating the ad load up.
But there are lots of other opportunities in the Roku experience to create consumer-friendly touch points for brands. And this is part of, why we've invested in the Roku Brand Studio. It gives brands an opportunity to author content with us, put together experiences content, first content-led experiences that are brought to you by that brand. So that's a particularly interesting dimension for us to keep growing the ad business in beyond 15- and 30-second in-stream spots and we've got a lot of interesting executions, we're doing there.
We also keep getting better at optimizing for outcomes whether that's driving a consumer to visit an advertiser's website or buy a product. And that gives us pretty good leverage too, because the better we get at that optimization and especially as our clientele mixes over time to what, we think will be a more heavy focus on outcomes, our ability to keep optimizing means our inventory will work harder both for Roku and for our advertisers. So all to say that I think there are a lot of dimensions of continued growth for the ad business going forward. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Rand with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. When talking about TV sales being below pre-COVID levels how do you think about the impact of higher pricing and the lack of inventory versus people who might have pulled in a TV purchase, when they were stuck at home during the earlier days of the pandemic? Hi, Jeff. This is Anthony. Well I think TV sales are actually below the pre-pandemic levels and I think it's primarily price. TVs are -- I mean also inventory because if there's no TVs in stock then you can't buy one. And that was definitely a factor. But TV prices are up almost 42% on average. And that's a huge -- I mean TVs are an incredibly price-sensitive business. And so higher prices cause people, to defer their purchases, so they can get a better deal, they wait for Black Friday or whatever they're going to do. So I mean -- if you look at the overall – Jeff, the TV industry generally is very cyclical. It goes through these cycles of pricing changes and sales go up sales come down. It's the history of TVs. I don't think there's anything to be -- there's nothing systematic or fundamental. It's just this is where we are in terms of TV sales and they're going to come back up. Great. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Anthony Wood, for closing remarks. Thanks. I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for a strong quarter. We've built the best TV streaming platform for audiences, content publishers and advertisers alike and we remain well positioned for the long-term.

Please refer to our shareholder letter and our periodic SEC filings for information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We’ll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our shareholder letter. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Now, I’d like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Conrad. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Roku delivered another record year in 2021. We have an enormous opportunity in front of us that we expect to capture. We have built and continue to expand a set of unique assets for this purpose. These include the Roku operating system, The Roku Channel and our sophisticated streaming ad platform. Our scale has passed 60 million active accounts, and we remain focused on being the best and largest streaming platform. The Roku operating system is poised to gain further market share as TVs shift away from costly proprietary operating systems. We expect manufacturers who want a best-in-class operating system to choose the Roku OS which is purpose-built for TV. The Roku Channel continues to gain momentum. Free, ad-supported services are the fastest-growing segment in TV streaming. In just four years, we built a flywheel that propelled The Roku Channel to a top 5 position on our platform in the U.S. This success is a result of combining a robust content portfolio with our ability to send consumers to The Roku Channel with superior content marketing and advertising features. Our ad platform is built for TV streaming. We believe large, traditional TV advertisers will continue to shift to Roku for the targeting, measurement, optimization and superior ROI that we provide. And for digital-first advertisers and small and medium businesses, Roku makes advertising on TV more accessible. We remain focused on maximizing our competitive differentiators, extending our industry leadership and driving growth, both in the U.S. and internationally. With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. Before taking your questions, I’ll walk through operational and financial highlights and address the outlook. In Q4, we grew our active account base by over 3.7 million, resulting in 8.9 million incremental active accounts for the year, thus ending 2021 with 60.1 million active accounts. While we continue to scale, we believe that the slowdown in the active account growth rate in the second half of the year was, in large part, attributable to global supply chain disruptions that have impacted the overall U.S. TV market and our TV OEM partners in particular. This was partially offset by Roku player unit sales in 2021 that remained above pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition to increasing our scale, we are also growing engagement on our platform, with 2021 streaming hours up 14.4 billion year-over-year to a record 73.2 billion hours. In Q4, we grew streaming hours 15% year-over-year, while full year grew 25% year-over-year as we continue to outperform viewing hour growth of both traditional TV and other TV streaming platforms. Average streaming hours per active account per day was relatively flat year-over-year as we lap the pandemic-related demand spike. As a reminder, please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter and the fiscal year, and I’ll highlight a few items. In Q4, total net revenue increased 33% year-over-year to $865 million. Platform revenue was up 49% year-over-year to a record $704 million, driven by strong content distribution and M&E growth. This was partially offset by temporary softness in advertising spend within the auto and CPG verticals, which have been most impacted by product availability issues related to supply chain disruptions. Q4 player revenue declined 9% year-over-year but was up 7% versus Q4 2019. Player unit sales were relatively flat year-over-year for Q4 and down 4% year-over-year for 2021. Gross profit, one of our key financial performance metrics, grew 24% year-over-year in Q4 to a record $380 million. Q4 platform gross margin was 60%, which was down 4.5 points sequentially as the platform business shifted toward a greater mix of video advertising. Player margin was pressured by supply chain challenges as we chose to prioritize account acquisitions and insulate consumers from higher costs. We estimate that excluding the year-over-year impact of component and logistic cost increases on the player business, total gross margin would have been roughly 4 points higher for Q4 2021. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $87 million, and we ended the quarter with over $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. Looking to the first quarter, we anticipate total net revenue of $720 million, up 25% year-over-year; gross profit of $360 million with a gross margin of 50%; and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million. Now, I’ll provide additional color on each of these estimates. Q1 total net revenue of $720 million reflects our expectations for standard Q1 seasonality, combined with the ongoing impact of supply chain disruptions on advertising spend within certain verticals. Next, conditions that positively affected gross profit and gross margin in Q1 2021 have shifted. The platform business, which had a larger portion of high-margin content distribution in Q1 2021, is expected to have a greater portion of video advertising in Q1 2022. Additionally, the player business, which had a strong positive gross margin in Q1 2021 is expected to have a negative gross margin in Q1 2022 as we continue to absorb elevated supply chain-related costs. Finally, our outlook for Q1 adjusted EBITDA is $55 million due to higher OpEx, which we expect to increase approximately 55% year-over-year as we plan to invest aggressively this year. As a comparison, adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2021 was $126 million, driven by a combination of very strong platform growth and lower OpEx growth as we slowed down investments due to COVID uncertainty. This demonstrates a strong return from prior monetization investments and the inherent leverage in our business model. Looking to the full year, I want to share my thoughts on supply chain, our investment strategy and our confidence in the business. First, supply chain. While we have seen some component costs decrease relative to peak prices in 2021, overall component and logistics costs remain significantly elevated and available issues persist. Thus, we believe these disruptions will continue to negatively affect the size of the TV market and our player margins in the short term. And we assume that ad spend in certain verticals will continue to be impacted by ongoing inventory availability issues until conditions normalize. Second, we intend to continue to invest in our growth. To date, our investments in people, technology and content have been successful, as demonstrated by our strong ARPU growth. Roku’s U.S. active account base has surpassed the U.S. video subscribers of all of the cable companies combined. Growing our share and extending our lead, both in the U.S. and international markets is the core part of our plan. For full year 2022, we plan to maintain adjusted EBITDA roughly in line with 2020 levels on an absolute basis as we continue to invest against a significant opportunity and drive continued innovation on the platform. Third, even with the volatility that is expected to result from ongoing supply chain disruptions, we believe Roku will continue to grow. And our estimate for full year 2022 year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-30s. Our core belief is that all of our secular growth drivers that favor streaming remain in place, and we have an exceptional platform as our foundation to build upon. There is a long runway of growth in front of us, and we are investing to capture this opportunity. We remain confident in our business and our ability to execute. With that, let’s turn it over to questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. Great. Thank you very much. Steve, just going back to the annual revenue guidance of 35%. That reflects a very healthy acceleration from Q1 levels. Could you talk about what gives you the confidence in that and perhaps tease out some of the contribution from player and platform to get there? And then related, you’ve called out aggressive investment. Could you talk about some of the top priorities and whether things like controlling more of TV manufacturing play into that? Thank you. Hey Justin, this is Anthony. I’ll kick off the answer and then turn it over to Steve. At a high level, the streaming platform business that we’re a leader in is a very large global opportunity. And we’re super well positioned to keep expanding our leadership in it. And so, we’re going to keep investing appropriately to the opportunity in our business. If you think about what we’ve accomplished so far with the money we’ve invested in our business, we’ve built some extremely valuable assets, the Roku operating system, which is the industry’s only purpose-built operating system for television and is the number one TV OS in the country and is making great progress internationally. The Roku TV program itself, where we build complete reference designs, license those to manufacturers and then help merchandise them at retail, and it’s been a super successful program for us. The Roku Channel, which is a top 5 channel on our platform, reached households with 80 million people in the quarter and it’s just been a big driver of our ad business, and then our very sophisticated ad platform. But those four assets we’ve built over the last few years, and we’re going to keep investing in them and keep growing them. And together, they were instrumental in driving our gross profit for the year of $1.4 billion, which was up 74%. So, -- over a tough comp. So, we just feel like there’s so much opportunity still in front of us. It’s still early days in the streaming platform business, which is a big global business or will be a huge global business, we’re going to keep investing for those reasons. And then, of course, there’s international, which we’re starting to see some good progress on, but it’s still very early as well. But, Steve, do you want to add any specifics? Sure. Hey Justin, thanks for the question. So adding to what Anthony said, in general, we’re providing formal outlook for the near-term quarter. So, in this case, Q1 and some color on the full year. You mentioned the revenue growth we’ve said that we thought for the year, that revenue would be in the mid-30s on a year-over-year basis. There’s some things that factor into that. Obviously, like Anthony said, we’ve had successful investments in these key strategic investment areas. Historically, we think there’s a lot more opportunity out there both to drive scale and monetization. In terms of the Q1 versus full year view, on the revenue side on Q1, a couple of things to note, and a lot of this has to do with the comp and then the current conditions that we saw coming into the year. And there’s a couple of things. One is, I’d just point back to Q1, and this is similar to Q2 as well last year. That’s a good example of where we saw significant strong performance in the platform monetization side with revenue growth rates over 100% year-over-year in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. At the same time, we were curtailing our investment growth in terms of incremental headcount and other spend because of the COVID uncertainty. So, that aspect early in 2021 really shows the inherent leverage in the business. So, when you fast forward to 2022, in Q1 in particular, what we see is we see more of a mix shifting into the ad business because of such a strong comp on the content distribution side and M&E side. At the same time, kind of mid last year, we -- as we got through some of the worst uncertainty around the pandemic, we decided that we would continue -- or we kind of go back to our historical aggressive investment levels. And so, you’re seeing strong investment in the back half of 2021 and into 2022. As a result, we think that we comp in Q1, and those will be maybe slightly less tough as the year goes through it. And the other part we’re tracking is in the back half of 2021, we had strong supply chain disruptions that we’re still working through, but we’re hopeful those will mitigate over time. Our next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham. Do we have Scott on the line today or no? Yes, I’m here. Scott’s here. Oh! Fabulous. Okay. Anthony, one for you, one for Scott. Fantastic. So, data, Anthony, yours is data. So, VIZIO makes $40 million a year selling some of their data. Your data is better because you have 3 times as many subs. My question is, would you ever consider, as a new revenue stream, selling part of your data, while keeping bunch for your proprietary use, to others as a new revenue stream? Scott, for you, I’m very interested in hearing from you what you think you’re most excited about as the ad revenue driver in 2022? Is it international ad growth? Is it like new markets like Mexico? Is it the upfront that’s coming up in May? Is it the integration of bottom of funnel e-commerce with advertising? I’m really interested in where you see the most growth upside and what you’re most excited about for 2022. Thanks, guys. Hey Laura, it’s great to hear from you again. Sure, I’ll take the first question on data. I think, generally, we view our data that we generate in lots of different ways, including ACR, Automatic Content Recognition, which I think is the data you’re probably referring to. I mean, that’s an existing VIZIO business. But we view that data as basically a key part of our ad platform and a key competitive advantage. And so, we don’t have any plans to sell it. I mean, we sell ads. We sell lots of ad, and that business is growing incredibly fast, and our data is one of the key drivers. I don’t know, when Scott takes the question, maybe he might have an opinion on data as well. Yes, I’ll just add to that. Data is our most valuable asset. And so, it’s not something we sell. It’s also obviously the wrong move from a consumer perspective. And frankly, we think the revenue optimal use of data is to keep it and use it for optimizing consumer experience and optimizing advertising. So, there are lots of reasons we’ve opened the hold back close consumer-oriented and commercial. And I think actually, if you look at some of those other platforms, they’re actually regretting their decision and in some cases pulling that data back. With regards to my excitement about 2022 ad opportunities, there are a few things. One is, as you’ll recall, we bought a division out of Nielsen last year that includes ACR and linear ad replacement technology. We will be rolling that out to beta in partnership with programmers. I’m very excited about that because it’s a whole other ad units to be sold into the marketplace to extend our reach. I’m also excited about our continued progress in the growth or performance advertising category. We really shine and we can leverage our data and our ad stack to help advertisers drive to real outcome, product purchases-type business, et cetera. 2022 is a big year for OneView as well. We’ve made good progress with selling OneView into agency holding companies and lots of other advertisers. And I think it will be a breakout year for us. We just last week announced Nielsen DAR guarantees in OneView. This will enable an advertiser to use our data and our ad stack to optimize the age, gender goals when buying from programmers in the Roku ecosystem. We have sold that product with our own media for years. We’re extending it now in what’s an industry first to all impressions on the Roku platform. So, those are just a few highlights of categories I’m excited about. I mean -- I guess, the punch line is there’s just tons of growth opportunity for the ad business. We might have driven 43% lift in ARPU year-over-year, but we’re nowhere near the ceiling of the ad potential in this contribution to the Roku Platform business. Yes. This is Anthony. I mean you didn’t ask me, Laura, but I’ll answer anyway. What am I most excited about with our ad business? And I think there’s -- I would highlight two things. One is just the overall industry state, which is that consumers spend 45% of their time, their TV time watching streaming TV, but advertisers have only moved about 18% of their budgets over to streaming. And all TV advertising is going to move to streaming. So, there’s just still so much opportunity for us there, both to capture those existing budgets and to continue to innovate. And then the second thing I would highlight is just how powerful The Roku Channel has become as a source of ad inventory for us and how that’s driving just this incredible virtuous cycle around content, advertisers and viewers, and how that’s allowing our scale to invest in originals and just becoming -- just really upping the scale needed to be successful in that business is creating a big opportunity for us as well. Our next question comes from Cory Carpenter of JP Morgan. I’m hoping you could expand a bit on the drivers that led to revenue coming in below your expectations in 4Q, but simply the auto and CPG verticals being weaker than expected, or anything else to call out there? And then, on the supply chain, are you starting to see any signs of improvement at all, or maybe if you could just talk about how you expect that to impact active accounts in 2022. Thank you. Hey, Cory. This is Anthony. I’ll start with some commentary on our platform business. Nonetheless, Scott wants to jump in or Steve to talk about supply chain. But just in general, our Platform business is doing extremely well. If you just look at the big picture, that revenue in 2021 grew 55% to $2.8 billion. That was driven by an 80% year-over-year increase in platform revenue. And there were some extraordinary circumstances. You should take a look at our shareholder letter for the details. But the fundamentals are strong. I mean, ARPU in the quarter was up 43% year-over-year. And there’s lots of room to keep growing that. I mean I mentioned the stat about how such a small part of the ad business has moved to streaming before with Laura’s question. I mean, it’s just so true, and there’s so much room to keep growing ARPU. Monetized video ad impressions nearly doubled in 2021. If you look at The Roku Channel, which is a key driver of inventory and ad revenue for us, it reached an estimate -- households with an estimated 80 million people. So, the business is very strong and still has a lot of room for growth. And it’s a diversified business. There’s a lot of different sources of revenue in that business, advertising, different kinds of advertising, M&E, content distribution, billing. There’s just a lot of sources of revenue into our platform business, and they’re all doing great. But, I don’t know, Scott, if you have -- or Steve, if you guys want to add. Yes, I’ll just add a little more color on that, and I think there’s a -- supply chain question’s better for Steve to answer. Yes, Cory, just breaking down the platform business a little bit more. The M&E, so this is our endemic advertising business of promoting partner apps and content on the platform, certainly moderating after some major app launches in 2020 and early 2021, but it still is growing very significantly faster than the platform overall. Our growth or performance advertiser segment, these are advertisers who are optimizing the bottom funnel outcomes, roughly doubled our brand studio, which is our sales of sponsorships and unique brand integrations and executions on the platform had its largest quarter yet. And with regards to brand ad sales, advertising, excluding our M&E category, we’re still going strong there. I don’t want to overemphasize the temporary softness in auto and CPG. It was a relatively minor factor in the quarter. It was also not unique to Roku. Other segments for our brand ad business were up strongly. Restaurants -- travel was up 5x, a real bounce back from COVID, financial services. So bottom line is we remain bullish on the continued growth of the platform business. Steve, do you want to... Yes. And just on the supply chain side. As I mentioned earlier, the world continues to seek supply chain disruptions. We think those are coming into 2022, both in terms of elevated component and logistics costs as well as some continued inventory or component availability issues, I guess the good news is, in some cases, component costs have come back a bit from their peaks that we saw in 2021, but they’re still overall very elevated. So, there’s a way to go between here and normal, but we do expect those to normalize over time. The team has done a good job on the player side of keeping the streaming players in stock. And so, the main impact there has been on the gross margin where we had the flexibility, thanks to our increasing ARPU to insulate consumers for the prices and thus, the main impact is on negative gross margin. But we said in our outlook that we do expect that the overall U.S. TV sales market will be down below pre-COVID levels, at least in the short term. And so. that’s something that’s a bit of a headwind for our business in the industry. Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria of Evercore ISI. Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try two please. One on supply chain. Could you please remind us what role, Roku, you play within the supply chain? And the follow-up to that is why not make your own TVs? And then, the quick question for Steve is on EBITDA. Steve, did you say 2022 EBITDA to be same level of 2020? I just want to make I heard it right. Hey Shweta, this is Anthony. I’ll start and then turn it over to Steve. We interact with the TV supply chain in a bunch of different ways. So, when we talk about device or streaming players, supply chain issues, those are products that we build -- we design and build and manufacture ourselves. I mean, we use contract manufacturers like the entire industry, but we manage that process. We source the key components or help source the key components. And so, supply chain issues around players impact us when the main chips or what are called SoCs become -- when they become in short supply because of just general semiconductor shortages. That causes the price to go up. That impacts us in a bunch of ways, including it costs more to build the products, but also it causes our engineering team to have to spend time redesigning products to use alternate SoCs so that we can get access to more supply. So, it impacts us in a couple of ways. But in general, we’re managing through that and those issues are mitigating over time. In terms of TV, TVs, we don’t -- our role with the Roku TV program, which has been -- just I’ll take a quick second and talk about the Roku TV program. I mean, it’s been hugely successful for us. This is the program where we designed the reference designs for a television, and then we work with manufacturing and brand partners to build and sell those TVs and then we work with retailers to help merchandise them as well. And that program has been super successful for us, continues to be successful. We’re the number one TV platform in the country by unit sales as well as hours streamed. And we’ve become the number one TV platform in Mexico by hours streamed, number one in Canada by hours streamed. We’re making great progress in other international markets, a lot of that through our Roku TV program. But, in that program, those TVs are built by TV manufacturers around the world and sold through retailers around the world. And so, that’s the supply chain. And what’s been happening in TVs is that there’s been a shortage of panels and then it has also been -- it’s been much more expensive to ship televisions. It’s been more expensive to ship players as well, but TVs are bigger, and so it impacts them more. So, the result of all that is TV prices have gone up a lot for consumers, and that’s reduced demand for TVs. And so, that’s the big picture of what’s happening. In terms of us making our own TV, there’s rumors around that. We don’t speculate on rumors. I’ll just point out that the Roku TV program is a big area of investment for us. It’s been super successful. And we’re successful, not just because we have a great purpose-built operating system for TV, but we also are a great partner for manufacturers of TVs. We offer a full stack solution and are really very helpful for them growing their smart TV market share. So, that’s some thoughts on Roku TV and supply chain. I don’t know, Steve, if you want to -- if there’s anything you’d like to add. Yes, I think you got it on the supply chain. Shweta, your second question was just around the 2022 EBITDA levels compared to 2020. So yes, in the prepared remarks, what we talked about is the OpEx investment levels, and we’re investing aggressively against a significant opportunity and a lot of great growth vectors, and we have a great platform to build upon. We talked about some of those things around investing in the Roku operating system, investing in The Roku Channel itself and then the ad platform, of course. So, one of the key things to mention in terms of the comparison to 2021 or 2020 is the fact that 2020 was a pre-COVID era, a more normalized basis when we were growing OpEx aggressively against these opportunities. In 2021, late -- or kind of mid-2020 and into 2021, we curtailed our investment growth because of the COVID uncertainty and then we’ve kind of stepped back on the gas so that the OpEx investment is a bit more aggressive like it was pre-COVID level. So that, combined with where we’re at in terms of a more normalized growth in the platform business compared to 2021, where especially in the front half, you had a platform growing 100-plus percent based on strong content distribution and media and entertainment as well as the fact that the OpEx investment levels were growing much slower. That’s leading us I think to a better comp in the pre-COVID level. So, we did say that we thought 2022 EBITDA levels would be around the same range as 2020 EBITDA on an absolute basis. So, I think that is a better -- a fair comparison versus the surge we saw on the top line in 2021 and some curtailed investment growth at the same time. Steve, it might be worth just mentioning a little bit about the -- how we’re -- how our TV OEM partners were disproportionately affected by some of the supply chain issues. Yes, sure. So, when you think about the supply chain impacts on the industry, we talked about sort of weaker demand because TV component prices and thus, TV consumer prices went up, it’s a low-margin business. So, those largely got past along. So, the overall TV market size did go down in 2021. And we think that’s below pre-COVID levels, and we think that will continue in the short term. The other piece, which impacts TV OEMs in terms of their unit sales and market share and thus the Roku TV market share was some of our OEM partners had specific component in inventory outages. And so that impacted some of their sales in Q3 and Q4. And so, that’s a big piece that’s a headwind for us on the TV side. Yes, we were fortunate on the player side to largely have inventory available, thanks to our team internally leveraging our scale and our relationships. So, we didn’t have the inventory availability on the player side, but that is a material factor in the last couple of quarters on the TV side. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov of Cannonball Research. Scott, I think it’s for you. I just wanted to ask you to speak in more detail about media and entertainment promotional revenue. Can you tell us about the options that you are offering currently through M&E advertisers, how their price may be CPM versus performance-based, et cetera? And then, if you could also tell us how did effective CPM evolve over time in this type of advertising? And what do you see driving growth going forward? Is it sell-through growth and impression? Do you think you have pricing power or to drive effective pricing up? So, get a lot of questions about this revenue stream, so I would appreciate your speaking in more detail about it. Yes. Great question. Thanks, Vasily. Our North Star in the -- on the call -- yes, maybe you can mute. Sorry. Our North Star on the M&E business is driving outcomes for our clients, and we are uniquely positioned to do this as Roku. First, we’ve got the promotional units all throughout the Roku experience from the time you’re setting your device up, the ad on the home screen, teams, video ads, e-mail. In many ways, we are the checkout counter at the moment that the consumer is trying to make a choice of what to watch, we’re there to influence it. The second reason we’re uniquely positioned to do this is we’ve got the data to target and optimize these promotions. And then, the third reason is, especially for our M&E clients, the conversion events, the download of the app, the subscription to their service happens on our platform. And so, we have got a beautiful closed loop, data-driven way of optimizing for the outcome that our M&E clients care about, which is new users, engaged users, retained users. And that all basically enables us to drive outcomes more efficiently for our M&E clients than the other media they might buy on social media or in linear television. Now, as for your question about how we price it and how that might evolve. Today, we price on both a CPM or impression basis as well as on a performance basis. You can buy in either way for us. Most of our clients, whether they buy on a CPM or a CPA basis are ultimately measuring on the outcome that they care about. They’ll net it out to that. Our pricing is a function of a lot of factors. In Q4, there’s just such competition as new programming is coming out that we often have scarcity. So, that’s sensibility pricing. But, we’re also creating more supply throughout the user experience as we build more user engagement in the Roku home screen. So that’s an offsetting factor. And then, of course, at the end of the day, this is basically an auction among various bidders trying to get attention from more consumers to subscribe to their service, and so that tends to drive pricing. Ultimately, though, our pricing will be driven by our ability to drive the outcomes that these M&E clients seek. And as long as we keep getting better at driving outcomes, which we’re doing, because of our innovation around how we grow these services and our use of data, we’re confident in our ability to keep growing the M&E business and drive deal sizes and pricing. I hope that answers your question, Vasily. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. I have a question about revenue and a question about costs. First, on the revenue side, on video advertising revenue, you guys noted monetized ad impressions on Roku Channel up 67% this quarter, I believe, which is pretty -- it’s a big number, but still a meaningful slowdown from the doubling you guys have been seeing before. I’m hoping you could break down a little bit for us how much of that was driven by these supply chain challenged industries that you spoke about versus how you sort of feel about what that growth trajectory looks like going forward? And my second question, I really want to come back to this spending growth next year. By my math, it looks like your spending is going to almost double to well over $1 billion, just using your revenue and EBITDA guide. I mean, it’s a pretty huge number. And Steve, I think you just said kind of goes back to pre-COVID levels or behaviors, but it’s multiples of what you were spending at that time. Now you’re obviously a much bigger company now, but I think this is a really big deal coming out of the call. So, I want to take one more opportunity to ask sort of in more detail what you’re spending on? Like which areas do you think this is going to power? And when we should expect to see the return -- the top line on this incremental spend? Thanks. Scott, do you want to take the 67% question, which I’m not sure if that was correct. Yes, sure. I think, the stat you’re citing, Michael, is our total monetized video ad impressions, not specific to The Roku Channel. We don’t break that out for The Roku Channel specifically. Roku Channel is growing much more -- much faster generally in terms of usage streaming hours, ad impressions than the platform as a whole. Still a very significant growth rate for us and represents a huge opportunity for us to keep growing into all the video ad volume that’s on our platform. I think -- sorry, your other question is on OpEx. Steve, do you want to take that? Yes. I can take that. Hi, Michael. Yes, in terms of the investment areas, I mean, Anthony talked about our three core investment areas around the Roku operating system, The Roku Channel and the ad business. And will also throw in that these investments are not only in the U.S., but they’re also in support of international markets as well. In terms of how we usually invest, the main source of investment is people-based. And so, that headcount expense is the largest single line item on our OpEx. And so we’re continuing to invest in employee expense existing where we’ve been ramping up our hiring rates. So, that’s very important to the investment. In terms of some of the specific items that we’ll talk about around The Roku Channel, in particular, one of the things that we’ve talked about recently is this flywheel effect. So the -- Scott mentioned, The Roku Channel is growing much faster than the platform overall. That flywheel is driven by content, which is driving increased reach and viewership, which then allows us -- since it’s primarily AVOD supported, to sell more ads based on the supply from The Roku Channel. Really the scale of The Roku Channel and that growth trajectory is allowing us to invest more in the content. And it’s a combination of licensing. We’ve got 200-plus licensing partners there. But also in 2021, we basically came out with the Roku original side of the house, which we kickstarted with the acquisition of Quibi’s content distribution rights, but we’ve done a lot on that front as well. And so, that is a big piece of that, but with same within our AVOD model. And then the ad business, there’s continued opportunity there. So, we’re continuing to invest in parts of the technology features. There’s a lot of innovation on various road maps. Yes. Sorry, I just want to jump in and just from my point of view, at a high level, the way I think about this is that the streaming platform business is a very large business, and it’s going to become an even larger, huger bigger business. And it’s got a huge amount of potential. And it’s the kind of business where there’s only going to be a small number of winners. In some ways, it’s very similar to what happened with like desktops, for example, where there used to be a lot of different companies to make PC operating systems and PC software. Now there’s -- every PC in the world comes to either Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OS. Same thing happened with phones. There used to be lots of different companies making phones and phone software stacks, and now every phone that you can buy comes with either Android or iOS. And the same thing is happening in TVs. TVs historically have been very fragmented, lots of different software providers, lots of different places you can get a smart TV operating system, and it’s consolidating, and it’s going to consolidate down to a handful of winners. And Roku is the leading operating system in the United States right now. We’re making great progress in other countries as well. And we’re just extremely well positioned to keep investing in that leadership position and grow that leadership position as consolidation continues to happen in the TV -- in the platform space. It also applies to other areas like the ad stack. Scale is super important in the ad platform business. It applies to content. The Roku Channel has been hugely successful for us. We’ve been a leader in ad-supported free content. We’ve gone from licensing a few low-cost, old movies to producing our own multimillion dollar originals. And that’s happened on the back of hugely increasing scale, and that scale supports that kind of investment. And so, it’s just -- there’s just a huge opportunity. The stakes are getting bigger. And we’re in a unique position that we lead in all these areas, and we can grow our leadership position. And so, that’s why, for us, continue to invest really just makes a lot of sense financially for the -- in our quest to build a huge, large business. And I think we ran this sort of accidental experiment during COVID where we pulled back on the gas on investment in the future, and we saw how EBITDA started flowing to the bottom line. And so, that’s what will happen eventually. We will start to normalize. But -- and these days where we’re still pretty early in the building of these streaming platforms, we want to maintain and keep winning with our leadership position. So, can I just ask, is wage inflation a meaningful part of this increase, or how much is just sort of like existing wage inflation versus how much is expanding the areas you’re spending on given your comment that people is such a big part of where the spending is going. Yes, this is Steve. Yes. I mean, certainly, there -- it’s a very competitive market out there. So certainly, wages are going up. And like I said, that’s our number one component in our OpEx. So, that is certainly part of what’s factored into the outlook. But the main driver is we just keep hiring a lot more people as we expand each of these key areas. Just one small example, we didn’t use to make originals. Now we have a whole team working on Roku Originals. We didn’t use to sell TVs in Brazil. Now, we’re building more and more models for Brazil. So those are places -- those are examples of places where we increase our headcount. The headcount investment usually comes ahead of the results, right? We have to work on it for a year or two before you start seeing the results. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. So, I’m going to applaud the investment. For years, we heard from investors that you weren’t spending enough. So, I’m going to echo that albeit a tough data report earning. So kind of sorry about that. So, I just want to ask -- I don’t think anybody asked, but did you kind of say why you missed the revenue guide in the quarter? Steve, just maybe kind of give us just some color there. And then my second question, I don’t know if anyone asked this. I saw the announcement with the resale agreement with Entravision, Mexico. Maybe just talk a bit about what you expect out of that? Could that start to be like the first material bucket of international revenue. Thank you. International ad revenue. Thank you. Scott can take the international revenue question. And then, Steve, do you want to answer the other question? Yes. Jason, thanks for the kind words, and I appreciate you mentioning the investors that wanted incremental investments. So yes, I mean, I think, frankly, the incremental investment just shows the -- we’re bullish on the opportunity and the growth trajectories have great road maps ahead of us. So, we think that’s the right strategic decision. As Anthony talked about, the industry is going to consolidate around and we’re in a leading position. In terms of Q4, the biggest theme in terms of the results versus the original outlook expectations were around the level of supply chain disruptions that impacted the industry, our partners and us in particular, both on the account acquisition side, like we said, it was a smaller TV sales size in the market because of the higher TV prices. I had mentioned that TV prices were up 33% year-over-year in Q4, which was a tamp down on demand, and then we had specific TV OEM partners that had inventory availability challenges. And so, the main impact of that was certainly on the account acquisition side, but what we also talked about was we saw some temporary softness in some verticals around auto and CPG, where they had their own inventory availability challenges and so deferred some of the revenue spend. And so, that was more pronounced than what we originally thought it would be going into the quarter, and that was the biggest driver of the disconnect. This is Scott. I’ll just tag on to sort of that question, and I’ll answer your question, Jason, about Entravision in Mexico. One other thing I’d say about Q4 was we were comping over a really robust Q4 2020. If you roll back to 2020, advertisers really suppressed spending in Q2 2020. And then, they made up for it in Q4. Drove a really strong Q4 for us in our ad business and, frankly, across the business. And so, we had a strong quarter in Q4 for the ad business, Q4 ‘21. But the comp, in addition to a couple of the -- softness in a couple of the verticals, as Steve mentioned, were the real drivers of the guide. With regards to Mexico, this is a great story, great part of our narrative of going abroad. Of course, we seek scale by getting televisions and players in the consumers’ hands, then we try to drive engagement and then we monetize. And in Mexico, we are through the first and second phases there with significant winning posture in terms of household penetration, user engagement. And so, it was very timely for us to launch Mexican ad business. We’re doing it in partnership with Entravision. Internationally, I’d also call out our success in Canada, where we’ve been scaling our ad business and our M&E business for several years now. So, we’re excited about the progress in Mexico. And of course, it’s also a great entry into activity elsewhere in LatAm. Yes. This is Anthony. I mean, if you think about just international and the countries in the Americas, south of the United States, the two biggest markets by far are Brazil and Mexico. So, that’s why we focused on those primarily, and we’re doing great in both of those markets. In Mexico, we’re the number one streaming platform by hours streamed. And we just announced that we passed 20% market share for TVs with the Roku TV program. And so our scale has been growing there for a few years now. That’s why we’re starting to add on monetization in that region. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. There was a little bit of a question in the buy side about whether or not you guys would provide sort of a full year outlook, which I think is unusual for you. You can correct me if I’m wrong. But I’d be curious about two things. Why you decided to do that? And then, two, sort of what your sort of level of conservatism is or isn’t when you sort of lay out a full year guide versus a quarterly guide, which presumably is much easier? Thanks. Scott -- I’m sorry. Steve? That’s a Steve question. Yes. In terms of our approach to outlook, since the start of the pandemic, so coming on two years, we have focused on providing a formal outlook for the near -- quarter, in this case, Q1 and providing some color on the longer term or the annual view to the extent we have visibility. And so, what we talked about in the shareholder letter is continuing on with that strategy permanently and tweaking the outlook, moving from a range to our best estimate. And so, that’s really no different than what we’ve been doing for the last couple of years. I think it reflects the fact that, obviously, we have better visibility into the short term. In this case, we didn’t provide formal outlook for the full year, but we did provide some color on what we thought the trends were for the full year, and we provided a rough outlook for the revenue year-over-year growth range as well as the EBITDA level. So, we’re kind of somewhere in between, but we think that’s prudent just given the level of uncertainty in that factor. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, one on platform revenues and one on your comments on the Roku OS. With respect to platform revenues, 4Q and the full year, the M&E spend, media and entertainment spend, was very strong. It grew faster than the platform revenues. Can you give us your thoughts on M&E spend for the full year 2022? And just maybe talk about, in the shareholder letter, it says delayed ad spend in vertical’s most impacted by imbalances may continue into 2022. If we go back to the pandemic in 2Q of ‘20, advertisers had pulled back, but they came back pretty quick after that and 3Q, 4Q were pretty strong quarters for your platform revenues. Just reading the shareholder letter, it seems that this come back this year might be delayed. So, just your thoughts on when you think the CPG and the auto advertisers might come back and spend more on the platform? Scott? Hey Ruplu. Yes, let me take this in parts here. First of all, again, I just would not overstate the impact of those verticals. We saw some softness. I think it’s anybody’s guess how the CPG and auto businesses deal with their supply chain issues, but we see robustness broadly across the rest of the ad business. And so, we’re -- it’s a relatively minor factor in the grand scheme of Q4 and our outlook going forward. With regards to the M&E business, we don’t guide to that business specifically. I’ll just say that it continues to grow strongly. The biggest services have launched on Roku, but they continue to spend very significantly with us because they’re not done acquiring users. And as they hit scale, retaining users becomes critical. It’s also a very competitive environment. We’ve seen quite a bit of share shifting within the top 10 apps as they compete for user attention. Consumers aren’t going to have subscriptions to all of these services. They’re going to pick and choose. And in a streaming world, it’s easy for them to subscribe and unsubscribe. And so, there’s a lot of competitive pressure on our partners to stay front and center when they invest in big new programming, they want to get behind it and promote it aggressively to users. And as I answered in the question earlier, we’re just one of the best possible choices for a programmer to utilize, drive awareness and tune it to their programming. So overall, we remain really bullish on the future of the M&E business. I don’t know, Steve or Anthony, if you want to add anything? Well, this is Steve. I’ll just add because you mentioned kind of Q2 2020 and it popped back pretty quick with advertisers. I think that part is -- certainly, there was a pullback in advertising there, but I think it was a very different situation, right? That was early days of the pandemic. There was a lot of uncertainty across the board for advertisers that their business was going to drop off a cliff. And so, that was much more of a stabilize the ship, lower the operating expense burn and see where the world is going. In this case, where you have certain weakness in the advertising or a temporary slowdown in the advertising, in large part, these companies are selling everything they can produce. And I can tell you being in the market for an auto have a lot of pricing power on what they are producing, right? And so, they’re actually in a position of strength as opposed to a position of concern and weakness. But because of the supply chain constraints, there’s kind of an artificial disconnect where they’re not having to market. But there is a strong case for marketing and advertising once things normalize on that front. So, to Scott’s point, I think it’s -- certainly, supply chain disruptions are the main determinant on -- in certain verticals about kind of what their -- whether their spend levels will be normalized or not. But, I actually think a lot of these companies are in a very strong position, and it’s just this temporary disconnect of supply and demand that’s created a temporary stop in spend. But otherwise, they’re in great shape versus at the start of the pandemic, they were quite fearful for their well-being. So Ruplu, I don’t know if that answered your question or not. And also, did you have something about you want to ask about Roku OS? I wasn’t sure if that was a question there. Thank you. Our final question is Rich Greenfield of LightShed. I guess, two big picture questions. One, Anthony, when you think about sort of the change in consumer behavior, moving from dongles to TVs, just wondering, do you have any way of telling how many people -- because I think one of the things people or investors fear is that as people move from sort of Roku dongles and then they buy a new television, that some of those are sort of inactive or those sort of active accounts become inactive accounts. I’m just wondering as sort of like as the shift from dongles to TVs play out, how do you -- like what are you seeing? What have you seen over the last year? And what do you think happens over the next couple of years? And then obviously, I mean, it’s sort of the obvious that everyone is sort of panicked about the state of streaming after seeing the results from some of the players, most notably Netflix earlier in the quarter, sort of revising long-term TAM? And I just -- when you think about the TAM of streaming, 300 million, 500 million, 1 billion, Jason Kilar said someone’s going to get to 1 billion. Curious what you think of the streaming market globally and where you think the TAM really lies, on the time to get to that TAM? Sure. Great questions. We have 0 minutes left, so I’ll do my best. Let’s see, on TV versus streaming players, they’re both important to us, to our business. And we sell millions and millions of both. I think -- and I think -- so some of the dynamics there are that we sell a lot of streaming players to people that have an older TV or a competitor smart TV that doesn’t quite have the features that they would like to get or the content that they want. And then, when someone buys a new TV, they’ll take the older TV and move it into a bedroom, and they’ll also want to upgrade that with a streaming player. And so, there’s just a lot of different dynamics. They’re both important. They’re both big sources of active accounts. They’re both not going away anytime soon. But I would say, I guess, strategically, TVs are probably more important just because when you buy a smart TV -- if you buy a smart Roku TV, then whatever you have before you don’t need because it’s a great solution. And people keep them for about 7 years roughly. There’s questions about how long will software updates happen on the smart TV, we try very hard to keep updating our smart TVs for a long time, and we’re better at that than -- I think everyone else in the industry who will sometimes abandon or stop doing software updates to their TV after a two years. That also becomes a great place for us to sell a streaming player, too. So, they’re both really important. And if you look -- when you go overseas, there’s a lot of older TVs. And so, they’re both just very important for us. They have suddenly different dynamics, but I think the main message is just we need to do both, and we do do both very well. In terms of the TAM, I think if it is -- every broadband household that watches TV is going to switch to streaming. So, it’s 1 billion households. Do you have any feel of why it slowed down so much? Sorry, what? Do you have any sense of like why do you think there’s been this slowdown that sort of panic investors. I’m not even talking about your stock. I’m talking about the entire streaming sector that people are starting to really just get concerned. No, I think -- go ahead, Scott. I would say, look, the market’s reception to this or that streaming company’s results and notwithstanding, as Anthony said, the number of households consuming television, what they spend on television, what their eyeballs are worth in terms of advertising hasn’t changed through all of it. So, the TAM really has not changed. And while I think individual streamers will -- their fate and their perception of the market will rise and fall according to their performance, at the end of the day, they’re all going to be on Roku and competing for share. And we see that playing out like never before on our platform, and it’s great ultimately for the consumer and great for Roku. Yes. I mean, I would just say that there’s important differences -- strategic differences between a streaming service and a streaming platform like Roku. I mean they’re both great businesses to be in right now in terms of the fact that they’re all growing. But our goal, as a platform, is to offer as many different services as possible and give our consumers options. And I think if you’re a streaming service, your dynamics are different. If you’re one of the early streaming services, you didn’t really have much composition for a long time, and now consumers have other options. So, that’s one dynamic. And also, there’s just a lot of change happening right now. And then, the rise of free streaming services like The Roku Channel, which is doing gangbusters, I mean, there’s just a lot of different dynamics affecting the industry. But, at a high level for us, we built a business model where we can monetize -- we do monetize most streaming services on our platform and provide tools to allow them to be successful and provide them -- trying to be a great partner, trying to provide a good marketplace, try and help the consumer find content and just provide a solution that works for the entire industry. And just -- and of course, streaming is going to keep growing, and there’ll be 1 billion households that use a smart TV to watch TV. And there’s not going to be -- there’s only going to be a small number of those different platforms that win. Thank you. I’d like to turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for any closing remarks. All right. Well, I just want to say thanks to everyone. Thanks to our employees, and our investors for joining the call today. And we’re looking forward to continuing our growth and the robust streaming business that we’re in continuing. So thanks, everyone. Thank you.

And welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Roku Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Conrad Grodd, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. And welcome to Roku's first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm joined today by Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, General Manager of our Platform business, who will be available for Q&A.
Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at roku.com/investor.
Our comments and responses to your questions on this call reflect management's views as of today only, and we disclaim any obligation to update this information. On this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events, such as statements regarding our financial outlook, our investments future market conditions and macro environment headwinds, such as global supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and geopolitical conflict.
These statements are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our shareholder letter and our periodic SEC filings for information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our shareholder letter. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Roku had a solid first quarter with platform revenue up 39% year-over-year, driven by higher content distribution and advertising revenue. This financial performance and our continued growth, even in a challenging operating environment, validates the strength of our business model.
From day one, the Roku platform has been built to operate at the center of TV streaming, meeting the needs of each participant in the ecosystem. For consumers, we provide an excellent experience with trusted discovery tools that allow them to find and watch content the way they prefer, whether that's via ad-supported or subscription services.
For content owners, we offer multiple ways to build and retain audiences and monetize content. And for advertisers, we have data, tools and technology that improves the return on every ad dollar spent. Ad supported streaming services are a huge and growing part of the streaming ecosystem, demonstrated by the continued success of the Roku Channel. It was a top five app on our platform in the U.S. by active account reach for the third quarter in a row. And for the first time, it was a top five app on our platform in the U.S. by streaming our engagement.
The Roku Channel's expanding reach and engagement is being driven by the increased quality and diversity of our content portfolio and our unique ability to promote it as the platform owner.
As a leading platform in TV streaming, we expect to continue to grow, both active accounts and platform monetization for years to come. This quarter, we launched new ad products and we will present more ad product offerings and content to advertisers at Roku's first in-person upfront event next week.
Today in the U.S., Nielsen reports that audiences spend 46% of their TV time streaming, while eMarketer reports that advertisers spent just 18% of their TV ad budgets on streaming. Both of these will become 100% as eventually all TV and all TV advertising will be streamed.
Roku is a leader in TV streaming with an established track record of platform growth and technology innovation. And we will continue to invest to capture the significant opportunities ahead of us.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. Before taking your questions, I'll walk through highlights and discuss our outlook given the current macro environment. We continue to grow, adding 1.1 million active accounts in Q1 and ending the quarter with 61.3 million. As expected, year-over-year active account net adds moderated, given the end of government stimulus payments that temporarily drove discretionary consumer spend in Q1, 2021. Additionally, ongoing supply chain disruptions increased U.S. TV prices in Q1, 2022, resulting in industry-wide TV unit sales that were below 2019 pre-COVID levels for the third quarter in a row.
Roku Player unit sales decreased 12% year-over-year, but remained above pre-COVID levels and the average selling price decreased 9% year-over-year. Engagement was high. Roku users streamed 20.9 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 1.4 billion from last quarter.
In Q1, total net revenue increased 28% year-over-year to $734 million. Platform revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $647 million, benefiting from higher content distribution and robust growth in advertising revenue, despite some continued softness in certain verticals. Q1 Player revenue declined 19% year-over-year, but was up 20% versus Q1, 2019 pre-COVID.
In Q1, gross profit grew 12% year-over-year to $365 million. Platform gross margin was 59%, which was down roughly 8 points year-over-year, reflecting a shift towards a greater mix of video advertising compared to a year ago period, which had significant growth of higher margin M&E and content distribution due to the launch of new services. Player margins continue to be pressured by supply chain challenges, as we chose to prioritize account acquisition and insulate consumers from higher costs.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $58 million, and we ended the quarter with over $2.2 billion of cash and investments.
Looking to the second quarter, we anticipate total net revenue of $805 million, up 25% year-over-year. Gross profit of $395 million with a gross margin of 49% and breakeven adjusted EBITDA.
At a high level, we continue to navigate through a difficult near term macro environment, which includes impacts from and further uncertainties related to ongoing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical conflicts. That said, we believe Roku is well positioned to continue to grow. And we intend to invest in the huge opportunity in TV streaming and to maintain our leadership position.
I'd like to provide additional color on each of our estimates. Total net revenue of $805 million reflects our expectations that the ongoing macro headwinds, I just mentioned, have the potential to reduce or delay ad spend in certain verticals. However, we continue to improve our ability to monetize across our business, and we believe that this will be reflected in growing net revenue despite a very difficult comp. Recall that Platform revenue in Q2 of 2021 more than doubled year-over-year.
Gross profit of $395 million reflects our expectation that in our Platform business, we will continue to grow the portion of video advertising, which has slightly lower margins than other revenue streams. And we expect that supply chain disruptions will continue to pressure the Player business, resulting in a negative gross margin, as we prioritize the account acquisition and absorb elevated costs. Together, we expect this will result in total gross margin of approximately 49%.
Finally, our outlook for Q2 adjusted EBITDA is breakeven, primarily due to our strategic commitment to invest in our business and the significant opportunity ahead of us. Recall that we curtailed spending during the early phases of COVID and then began ramping spending mid last year. And we, therefore, expect OpEx to increase approximately 90% year-over-year. We also continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA of roughly $150 million.
As expected, we delivered solid performance in a challenging operating environment to begin the year. We believe that the near-term headwinds are drove by the long-term opportunities in the secular shift to TV streaming and TV OS consolidation. The enormous value we deliver to consumers, content owners and advertisers will drive our growth. And for the full year, we continue to expect total net revenue growth of approximately 35% year-over-year.
We believe that all audiences, all content and thus all advertising will shift to TV streaming. We will continue to enhance our OS, our ad platform, and drive the Roku Channel flywheel with great new content. And we will continue to provide content publishers with the audience and tools to grow successful streaming businesses.
Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Shyam Patil with SIG. Hey, guys. Nice job on the results. I had a couple of questions. First one, Anthony, can you talk a little bit about just your thoughts on Netflix introducing advertising and the potential opportunities for Roku? And then second, can you guys talk about what gives you confidence in the second half growth acceleration? Thank you. Hey, Shyam. This is Anthony. Sure. I'll take the first question and then Steve can take the second one. So if I think about -- well, first of all, I'll just say that I can't comment specifically on what Netflix may or may not do. But except to say that they're a great partner. We've been working with them since we launched the first streaming player in 2008. And then my thoughts generally on advertising, is that advertising is a way to lower the cost of a subscription streaming service, which makes services -- streaming services more appealing to consumers. I mean, as you lower the price of streaming, people stream more. And so generally, advertising is good, because it lowers the cost of streaming and increases consumer interest in streaming.
And I guess the other -- another comment I would make is that Roku is a streaming platform, which is a different business model than an individual streaming service. And sometimes people confuse the two. But our business model and the way we make money is to connect consumers with content and with advertisers. And so anything that causes more streaming to flow through the Roku platform is good for us and good for our business.
More generally, I think we believe that more AVOD offerings will accelerate the movement of traditional TV budgets into streaming. Just to recap where we are there. The traditional TV advertising in the U.S. is a $60 billion opportunity. It's larger globally. And for the first time, the reach of TV streaming has surpassed legacy Pay TV in the U.S. for adults 18 to 49. And yet most ad dollars for TV have not moved to streaming yet. Only 18% of ad dollars -- ad spend -- traditional TV ad spend has moved to streaming. Yet almost half of all TV time is streaming. And so it's going to be 100% of ad budgets moving to streaming.
So anything that accelerates that trend is also very good for our business model. So just in generally, I think ads as part of streaming services is good for consumers and is good for Roku as well.
And then Steve, if you want to take the second question? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So in terms of how do we bridge from solid Q2 performance with revenue up 28%, our Q2 outlook, which is in the same ballpark and then reaffirmation of our view that the full year will be kind of mid-30s revenue-wise.
Like we said last quarter, one of the factors that's involved here is that the year-over-year comps are easier in the back half of this year. So just as context from 2021, if you remember, revenue in the front half grew roughly 80% in 2021 -- front half of 2021 versus in the back half of 2020, it grew 40%. So that plus the robust growth we're seeing in the ad business and the relative growth Society for Cardiovascular monetization relative to peers, gives us confidence that that we're reaffirming that full year guidance.
The other thing that we look at is just on a sequential increase basis, those are also in line with historical averages. So we're obviously transitioning through near-term macro headwinds that dwarfed by the overall opportunity. And so we're -- we feel good about the continued growth of Roku and the thesis around the shift to streaming remaining intact. Great. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from Victoria James with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So we're getting a lot of questions from our -- from investors on the following, and we would appreciate your thoughts. What's the difference today between the state of SVOD and AVOD markets in the U.S. when it comes to the level of consumer engagement for SVOD specifically? Like have we hit a saturation point when it comes to the number of subscribers for SVOD collectively? And then I've got a follow-up question after that. Thank you. Hey, Victoria. Thanks for the question. This is Anthony. I'll start and then see if Scott has anything to add. First of all, I guess I would just say that, I think it's too early to say anything about saturation of SVOD. I mean, streaming is more popular than ever. It's still growing. It's a large global phenomenon that is still spreading around the world. Roku has 60 million active accounts, but that's still tiny compared to the billion broadband households around the world that are all going to get their TV through streaming.
So there's still a lot of room to grow and a lot of room for services to continue to expand as the world transitions to streaming. I mean the dynamics are a little bit different in the U.S. versus globally. In the U.S., you've got this dynamic of Pay TV core cutting, consumers moving the streaming and saving money there, as well as having a better TV experience. And I think it's hard to say. I don't think we know yet what's the level of spend that consumers will settle out with on the SVOD services in the U.S.
We do know that AVOD services are increasingly becoming popular in terms of like integrating ads into SVOD services and giving consumers a choice of lower prices with ads versus higher prices ad-free. And then all the way to services like the Roku Channel, which are 100% free and completely ad supported, which are very popular with the consumers as well. The Roku Channel is doing extremely well. It's a top five channel on our platform by reach, and now it's -- sorry, it's a top five app on the Platform by reach and now it's a top five app on the Platform by engagement as well. It's doing incredibly well for us.
But if you look globally about the role of SVOD services, I mean, the way I think about it is streaming SVOD services are kind of the global version of Pay TV. Pay TV is mostly -- was sort of most of the U.S. phenomenon, although there's some pay TV internationally, but just not a lot, nothing close to in the U.S. But SVOD streaming services are a way for the global market to quickly and easily access a great content selection akin to that of Pay TV, but at a much lower price and a better experience. And so I think actually, there's a huge opportunity around the world, as I think most regions will transition from 100% free TV, which is the way it is in a lot of countries, to a lot of consumers around the world having at least one SVOD subscription and maybe more.
So just in general, I think the streaming is more popular than ever. There's a large number of TVs around the world that are going to become smart TVs. And we're not anywhere near saturation.
But I don't know, Scott, did you want to add something? Yeah. I just -- I'd like to double down on that, Victoria. We're nowhere near saturation. We mentioned the shareholder letter that we just crossed the point where streaming can deliver more reach than linear television, 46% of TV time's now on streaming. On our platform, we see 3.8 hours out of a daily diet of almost eight hours per U.S. household. I mean just everywhere you look, we're nowhere near saturation in terms of consumers moving their television time to streaming.
And I think if you -- then if you look at the business models of SVOD versus AVOD, we're also not near saturating there. Certainly, there are more mature services, whose growth has slowed down. There are much younger services who are still very much in acquisition mode, and competing, not just with each other, but for the time that's still spent in traditional linear television.
We do see that AVOD has and for many years now and by AVOD, I mean fully ad-supported free like the Roku Channel or ad subsidized with a subscription, that category of apps has consistently been growing faster than SVOD, the pure subscription services, in part for the -- because of the reasons Anthony mentioned earlier, which is that free is a great price or subsidizes a great price. And so consumers are drawn to having more choice ultimately when they can be offered ad supported sport services.
So just definitively say we're nowhere near saturation in terms of consumer appetite for streaming. Yeah, this is Anthony again. I think it's also important just as you start -- if you're thinking about Roku's business to remember that Roku's business is -- we are a platform that connects content consumers and advertisers. We're not an individual streaming service, but we are seeing across our entire platform, engagement continuing to grow. And as well as, of course, the reason the platform continuing to grow.
And the opportunity is huge, because just like we saw with phones where they consolidated around a couple of platforms, the way we saw before that with PC is consolidating around a couple of platforms. The same thing is happening with smart TVs. Smart TV platforms like Roku are consolidating to a small number of TV platforms, I think it will end up being two or three. And Roku is the number one TV streaming platform in the U.S. We are now the number one TV platform in Canada. We're now the number one TV streaming platform in Mexico.
And if you think about that in the future, a world where everyone is -- everyone is using a smart TV, the smart TV is consolidated to two or three platforms and at hundreds of millions of dollars of subscription and advertising revenue flow through those platforms, mean that's it's a great business. And it's a different business than in a single streaming service. Thank you for the color on that. And then if I can just sneak in one more quick question. Do you have any color on your current thoughts on the importance of both live sports and live news as it relates to Roku? I'll let -- Scott, do you want to take that? Yeah, I'll take it. I mean, sports is certainly a key driver for a number of the services on our platform in a key way that some of these services, whether it's Paramount, Peacock, Football or with the Olympics. It's an essential instrument content type that these services are using to draw viewers into streaming. And in some ways, sports is the, the last pillar holding the traditional Pay TV bundle together.
So as we see that on that, we feel more sports become available through streaming services, we'll see continued acceleration of consumers out of traditional Pay TV and linear viewership into streaming.
News has moved more readily. We've got some great news offerings in the Roku Channel. For example, ABC News, NBC, Reuters, we have a ton of offerings there. They do very well. And then there are standalone services as well. I think news has already moved and started to innovate and streaming. Sports is more of a mixed bag with obviously some content still locked up behind more traditional linear services. This is Anthony. I think sports actually is a great example of how Roku as a platform can be valuable to our customers, in the sense that sports rights are incredibly spread out across many different services. And one of the important roles we play for our customers is to help them find and discover content across the platform as opposed to like going into every app and looking at what's in that app.
So we have tools today like Universal Search. We have things called zones. We have a sports zone. And those kinds of tools we're expanding to make it even easier for consumers to find out where the game they want to watch is playing right now across the thousands of services that are available on Roku as streaming platform. Thank you. And your next question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Your question please? Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. And thanks for having me on the call here with you. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the discussion about the environment and then a related question. In terms of -- just to dive into this, Netflix obviously is the dominant streamer in the area where you're dominant. They've hit a wall. They're losing some subscribers. You guys are still growing accounts, growing hours. Where is the incremental usage coming from and it's not going into Netflix? I was wondering if you could talk about, is that going into AVOD or the new subscription services. Or just some color about what you're seeing there would be helpful. Sure. This is Anthony, I'll start. And then Scott probably could add. Generally, what we're seeing -- if you look at you look at Roku as a platform, there's lots of different services that consumers can select to stream from. Streaming has never been more popular. The viewers have just a tremendous number of options. And so -- and that's causing overall engagement across our platform to grow. Any particular service might be going up or down or whatever has some specific dynamics, but in aggregate, we're seeing streaming grow.
We've talked about the stat that if you look at the number of hours viewed by a typical household in the U.S., which is about eight, and you compare that to Roku's hours, we're about half of that. So there's -- and that's because consumers are using other ways of watching TV besides just streaming. But they're switching more and more and more of their time to stream, so that's causing streaming hours overall to grow.
As far as different kinds of categories, I mean, AVOD, ad-supported content, is a fast-growing category on our platform. The Roku Channel is doing extremely well, because it's free. And the quality of the content is getting better and better. Everything from that catalog content all the way up to Roku originals and everything in between, we did an output deal with Lionsgate recently for movies. We signed a deal recently with A&E to access some of their content.
So ad supported content is growing, but to content is strong as well. There's just -- there's a lot of services.
So I don't know, Scott, do you have anything you want to add? No. I mean just yeah, just simply the offer keeps getting better for consumers. We just see such a substantial investment in the services and the content that's going into them, that the appeal of what you can get on streaming just continues to get better and better. And with advertising, it opens up more price points and more accessibility to more consumers, that's ultimately, Barton, the thing that's driving incremental streaming consumption. Yeah. I mean, just for our viewers the golden age of TV. I mean there's just so many different options, so much competition, that just didn't happen before, between content providers for viewers. And so you just have lots of options is getting better all the time for them.
And then for services and for Roku as a platform, that competition is good for our business, because we provide a lot of tools that allow viewers to find content. I was talking about like searching across the platform, but -- and those kinds of user interfaces provide opportunities for us to put promotional impressions or ads, which we make money on.
And then we have lots of tools to allow content providers to build audience to -- everything from billing to promotion, and just other ways for them to build audience. So just for our business, the competition that's happening in streaming is good and for viewers is good as well. Okay. And then just one other kind of topic that I wanted to address quickly, if I could. The consolidation of services. So obviously, top of mind with Warner Brothers Discovery. And I'm just curious about what happens -- what -- you can talk about the contractual circumstances of consolidation to the extent that if one big service is buying a smaller service is it like we see in TV where the smaller service gets on the bigger services, more favorable economics. If two networks are combined, is that just the loss of revenue from one of the networks or is there something different in your model that protects you somewhat? I was wondering if you could discuss. Scott can take that question. Yeah. Barton, what I'd say is that, back to Anthony's earlier point, our role as a platform is to help these services get in front of consumers to drive consumption. And so in general, we're in favor of any development, whether it's the launch of new ad supported business models or the merger of companies that ensures that these companies can continue to bring bigger and better services to our consumers.
I won't comment specifically on our deals or relationships with Warner before the merger or Discovery, except to say we have deep enduring relationship with both parties. We expect it to continue afterwards. We've just launched discovery+ inside the Roku Channel. I'm very excited about the potential there to deliver for our consumers, a great experience and extend the audience that Warner Brothers Discovery can reach with discovery+ through the Roku channel. We've got a robust relationship with both sides of the house in terms of marketing their content and services to our users.
So in general, a robust competitive ecosystem is good for us as a platform. Yeah. And I would say -- I’d just add that actually -- I mean, the number of content services and the amount of content available through streaming is growing. What I think the consolidation that’s happening is around existing media companies consolidating to build better streaming services. But those are generally new streaming services that didn’t exist before. Thank you. And your next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try a few, please. One, can you please comment on the supply chain headwinds currently and when you think you'll start to see the headwinds sort of dissipate? Perhaps are you seeing that already? Where are you right now versus what you saw earlier in the year? That's question one.
Second is, possible to comment on the overall ad environment. The demand trends that you're seeing right now, there have been conflicting -- there has been conflicting commentary from some of the other companies that have already reported on brand spend and perhaps potential weakness in brand spend, but you are reiterating your full year guidance for top-line growth. So just talk to the demand trends that you're seeing for brand spend, especially.
And then finally, just if you could talk about gross margins for platform revenue -- for your Platform segment as we think about the rest of the year, that would be great. Thanks a lot. So Steve can take the first question on supply chain. Scott will take the second question on the overall ad environment. And then I guess Steve can also take the gross margin question. Yeah. Hey, Shweta. Yeah, in terms of -- I'll talk about the supply chain impact mainly on the account acquisition side, and we can talk about -- Scott can chime in with some commentary on the monetization side.
Yeah, the situation is similar to last couple of quarters. So if you remember, starting in Q3, Q4 and now into Q1, we've had dealing with similar situations where we've got continued elevated pricing in terms of components as well as some availability challenges and then the kind of shipping and logistics costs and delays there. Some of those portions have come off their all-time highs that we've seen, but in general, costs remain elevated. The Roku team is doing a great job of being nimble in terms of alternate sourcing and doing some reworking to make sure that we have availability on the Player side.
But in general, the situation is fairly similar in terms of the impacts of the TV industry and then how that impacts kind of our unit sales. So on the TV side, similar to the last couple of quarters, we can see that these elevated pricing of new TVs is causing the overall size of the market in terms of the units sold to be down. And they're still down below 2019 pre-COVID level. So that's definitely a headwind for the industry as well as our TV partners.
The good news is that our market share has actually gone up sequentially. So as we have inventory availability that's good with our partners. That has gone well. We're still the number one TV OS out there in North America. And we continue to compete well on that despite the headwinds on the TV side.
On the Player side, similar to the last couple of quarters as well. What we've been doing is using our scale, our relationships and the flexibility to go ahead and absorb the price increases. Our increase in ARPU gives us more flexibility. And like I said, the supply chain and operations team has done a good job of keeping that.
So the Player unit sales, while they're down year-over-year, in part due to a tough comp based on the stimulus payments last year. What you're seeing is that they remain above 2019 pre-COVID levels.
So that's kind of the impact. In terms of how long that will continue, we think that situation will be similar. That's what we talked about in our outlook for Q2, that at least in the short term, those conditions will persist. And certainly, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, not only around the supply chain, but continued pandemic impacts, especially in China as well as knock-on effects from the war in Ukraine.
So Scott, maybe turn it over to you on the ad side? Yeah, Shweta. On the ad side -- yes, absolutely. There's still some uncertainty out there. There are certain verticals that are more affected by supply chain than others. But we're still putting up very robust growth for the ad business. And that's largely because we're still early in the movement of budgets into streaming. In the shareholder letter, we cited 46% of time spent in stream, but only 18% of ad budgets being spent.
For us, that translates into hey, are we going to be able to grow this account 100% year-over-year or 40% or 50% year-over-year. Our per account spending is up 50% year-over-year, and we see significant increased commitments across every one of our segments, our large customer segment, our growth performance segment, our M&E segment.
So the uncertainty does affect us. But the magnitude of the shift is still very substantial. We're still putting up very substantial growth figures. And we're going into the upfront next week. It's our first live upfront. We're excited about it, rolling out a bunch of great new content offerings, great new ad product, innovations. And we're bullish about our ability to drive yet further substantial commitments for the ad business. Yeah. And then on the gross margin per platform. So in the quarter, platform gross margin was about 59%. That was down roughly 8 points year-over-year relative to Q1, 2021. The primary difference there is, it reflects the shift towards the advertising -- video advertising. If you remember, in Q1 of 2021, we had extremely strong performance from M&E and content distribution side of the business related to new or recently new streaming services. So that was a higher mix, and those are very high-margin parts of monetization. So that change reflects the overall move toward video advertising.
And then we mentioned as part of our outlook, kind of a similar overall company gross margin to what we had this quarter. And that reflects that kind of continued mix of video advertising. Okay. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your question please. Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Scott and Anthony, a couple of times you've referenced in this call and others about the 18% of ad budgets that have shipped to the streaming and on this call, we're talking about 46% of consumers streaming time occurring in the streaming environment. I know the macro is tough. But what are the conditions do you think that you would need let's say, we finally get through this macro tunnel to sort of accelerate that shift?
And maybe another question to ask is, if you're not allocating larger budgets of streaming today, what is the holdup? Is it just that TV is sort of established and has more predictable measurement capabilities? But just sort of provide some color along that question would be helpful. Thank you. Hey, Ralph. This is Anthony. I'll take it from my point of view, and then I'm sure Steve probably has a better answer. But I just think the big issue is just people take a while to change behaviors. TV buyer, ad buyers have been buying ads a certain way for a long time. They understand it. And the percent of the TV ad budgets that were spent on streaming, I mean not long ago, it was a lot smaller. The gap was even bigger.
So the gap is starting to close. I think really what it is, is just time. I mean, the other thing to kind of accelerate -- will accelerate things has in the past, is any time there's macroeconomic stresses on businesses, then they start to get more serious about how they should be efficiently spending their money.
But I think this is just something we've seen before in other industries. The transition of ad dollars to mobile, for example took a lot longer than it took for viewers to shift to mobile. But eventually, it catches up. I don't know, Scott, did you have anything else to add? I mean, it's happening, it's just inertia. As Anthony said, it's a big industry with a lot of players, a lot of strategies. But it's happening and the CTV ad segment is the fastest-growing segment among all media, all advertising segments. So I think we'll continue to see acceleration just because of this year amount of money is still locked up in linear television. And if you think about ad growth generally from Roku's business point of view, there's a shift of traditional TV ad dollars to streaming in the United States. In the rest of the markets around the world, Roku is much more focused at this point in the life cycle on building active accounts. And we barely started monetization. We just recently, in Mexico, launched ad sales, but almost no ad monetization in the rest of the world. That's also going to be -- I mean the whole world is going to switch to streaming and all TV advertising switch to streaming.
And the other big pool of ad dollars that I think is not fully tapped into yet is performance-based advertising or the kinds of ad dollars that are spent on digital advertising. I mean, if you look at traditional TV advertising, it was Nielsen demographics. It was -- there was no way to directly measure how effective your ad is.
In the case of connected TV, in the case of Roku specifically, we've invested a lot in our ad stack over the years. And we have a very high quality, high tech, big data, targeted measurement performance based advertising stack. And so we are starting to see performance-based advertisers and digital advertisers starting to move to our platform, and there's a lot of room to grow that as well. Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your question please. Thanks. Maybe first, I think that platform ARPU in the quarter was up around 20%. The hours per account were down a little bit. I know it's a really tough comp as there was still some lockdowns going on last year. But nonetheless, I was wondering if you could just maybe help us deconstruct that ARPU a little bit. So it seems like either you got really good pricing or maybe you had some content sales or other bounties that you might have had in the quarter. So I'd love to get a little more color on just ARPU. And then, Anthony, I got a quick follow-up for you. Okay. Well, actually, ARPU was $43 in the quarter, up 34% year-over-year. But Steve, I don't know if you want to add any more color to that? Yeah, you're right. Yeah. So for trailing 12 months, roughly $43, up 34% year-over-year. Yes, we continue to see great progress on monetization. That's obviously the three big parts of that are the advertising business, the content distribution, revenue shares as well as the media and entertainment spend.
And so from a year ago, we've seen a shift more to the video ad business, but all three aspects of that have been making good progress. And we continue to innovate on the ad side and obviously have our Upfront coming up next week, while we'll announce even more. And then we continue to see good progress partnering with the content publishers on content distribution revenues and media and entertainment.
So those -- that ARPU is not necessarily directly correlated with the streaming hours. As you mentioned, streaming hours on an active account per day -- streaming hours per day is a little bit down year-over-year, but that's still is a bit of a difficult comp just given where we were in the COVID and lockdown cycle a year ago.
We feel pretty good about how that's been growing over time, minus some of the demand blips in the lockdown phases. But just a reminder, that's still roughly half of the average U.S. TV household in terms of their total time viewing. So there's a lot more opportunity on both the engagement side with streaming hours as well as on the ARPU potential. Thanks for that color. And then, Anthony, I mean, you seem really convicted on this notion of operating systems, consolidating down to just a couple of players. Yesterday, there was the announcement by Comcast and Charter that they're going into this market in a little more aggressive way than they had been in the past.
So I guess, how do you kind of think about the risk that, that market rationalization takes quite a long time. It's obviously baked into a lot of your investment guidance for the year. So when do you kind of think we might be coming through to that rationalization where you might enjoy stronger economics? Thanks. Well, I think -- so if you just think about competition for a second, we've got over 60 million active accounts and growing fast. We're the number one TV selling operating system in the United States. I mean, a few years ago, Roku TVs didn't even exist. Now we're the number one selling TV OS in the country. And we gained -- our growth in TV program gained market share sequentially quarter-over-quarter in the latest quarter.
So every region we compete in, active accounts are growing, and we've been competing effectively against big, strong companies for years. We compete with Google, compete with Amazon, and we compete effectively. And the reason we win in these markets is because where -- we built the only purpose-built operating system for TV. We're incredibly focused on streaming, it's all we do. And we've got a great team. And our A team comes to work every day to build the best streaming products in the business.
The way we grow active accounts, we sell streaming players, and we sell -- when we sell licensed Roku TVs or we don't sell them, but Roku TVs are in the market, which we license. And both of those are -- both TVs and streaming players are critical strategic assets for us in terms of growing our active accounts.
If you look at our competitors, there's competitors that only do TVs and then there's competitors that do both players and TVs, but they're really strong and only one or the other, whereas one of the key things about Roku's success is we're very strong in both streaming players and smart TVs. Both of those assets are doing well for us.
So I think if you just -- in terms of why is it going to continue to consolidate, it's because the amount of money that goes into building a competitive TV streaming platform is very large and growing. I mean we're funneling all a big chunk of our gross profit back into building the strength of our platform. It's very hard for -- certainly for a new player. Like it's hard for you to imagine how they're going to be successful given the long number of years that we've invested in our platform and our competitors have as well. But also just you have to amortize that cost across a larger and larger installed base to be competitive. Scale is super important.
So it's the exact same phenomenon. I mean in PCs, there used to be lots of different PC operating systems. In phones or usual lots of different phones software stacks. Now there's only a couple. The same thing is happening in TVs. Thank you. Thank you. Our last question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball. Please go ahead. Well, thank you. I have a quick one and then a more substantial one. The quick one. Can you please tell us how fast they monetized with ad impressions during the quarter? I'm sorry if I missed it in the letter.
And then my second question is about your relationships with major apps that were launched in recent years and how they evolve overtime? So if I look at the disclosures, they show that spending by your biggest platform customer grew 39% last year after a significant growth in 2020. So obviously, relationships grow in years after an app launches.
So can you give us some color on how the revenue mix changes over time between distribution revenue and M&E? And then speaking of M&E, how do you see the M&E revenue dynamic change as an app goes from the initial subscriber acquisition phase to control and subscriber retention? Thank you very much. Steve? You are muted. Hey, Vasily. Yeah, just in terms of Roku monetized video impression, we didn't denote a specific number on that. Obviously, the ad business continues to grow. And as we said, we're mixing more into the video ad business.
In terms of kind of the rev mix between content distribution, M&E, I'll give some thoughts and then Scott can give more color on the dynamics there. But what we see overtime and certainly, we talked about the shift from last year into video advertising. So that's becoming a bigger mix of the platform overall.
But when you think about the kind of revenue specific to the content publishers. We obviously had a situation late 2020, early 2021, where you had a lot of new services, a lot of especially legacy media companies who were pivoting their focus towards streaming. That was very helpful in terms of short term revenues related to the launch of those services.
But what you really see is that we have the most engaged audience. We have significant reach with our 60 million plus active accounts. And we have industry-leading tools to help them grow their business. And then increasingly, what's important is that they will need to drive engagement and retention of those account bases. And so that's the shift that you're seeing in terms of spending specifically on the M&E side.
So we've been sort of moving that business for a long time even before some of the players that have reoriented that way, where that's all going. They're going to have large bases, they -- my analogy is the need -- many of them need to start thinking like scale wireless carriers in terms of focusing just as much on the engagement and retention as they've historically focused on building new subscriber basis. So would it be fair to say that an app can spend more in the second year after launch with you than in the year when they launch? Hey, Vasily. This is Scott here. I mean what I'd say is that our -- generally, our relationship with these app partners deepens overtime. And it's not just a function of their marketing, their M&E spend with us, it's multifaceted. It's buttons. It's revenue shares from their subscription services. It's collaboration on advertising. It's marketing trades between the companies.
When we keep getting bigger as a platform, we keep improving our toolset and the partners look to us, especially after they get live and they see the performance of our platform in terms of the ratio of new subscribers and engagement that we can drive relative to other platforms, they tend to lean in and engage more deeply with us, not just monetarily, but strategically.
We just announced the dynamic linear ad beta work that we're doing with Discovery Paramount, AMC Crown. There'll be more to come is just an example of where there's yet another lane to collaborate with these big partners on.
I think you're also probing the M&E category itself. And yes, generally, partners do increase their spend overtime. And it's not just for user acquisition. Even as partners hit saturation and very few of our partners actually have, they need to keep driving engagement and driving retention. There's clear precedent from the traditional TV world where up to about a quarter of all air time, all advertising time, is used to cross-promote shows. And obviously, linear TV is not growing.
And so the importance of the services investing in marketing, collaborating with us to feature their content organically in the paid form in our experience doesn't diminish overtime. They've got to keep competing for consumer retention, driving tune in, which drives loyalty and engagement. And this is even more important in a streaming world, where the traditional tactics of cross-promoting across different properties and content is harder than it was traditionally. They look to us as a platform to help continue driving tune in.
So Vasily, I hope that answers your question. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you. And that ends our Q&A session for today. I will turn it back to Anthony Wood for his closing remarks. Thanks. I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for a solid quarter. We have built the best TV streaming platform for audiences, content publishers and advertisers alike. And we're focused on continuing to be the innovation leader among streaming platforms. Thank you. This concludes today's program, and you may now disconnect.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks Conrad, and thanks you all for joining us today. In Q2, we saw a significant slowdown in TV advertising spend due to the macroeconomic environment, which is pressuring Roku's platform business growth in the short term. However Roku's business and strategic fundamentals are stronger than ever and growing stronger. Our TV advertising market share continues to grow and our active accounts continue to increase.
In light of the current macroeconomic environment, we started taking actions in Q2 to significantly slow OpEx growth. That said, we expect to keep investing into our streaming leadership. While downturns are difficult, it's important to keep in mind that temporary economic cycles do not change the significant long term opportunity in TV streaming. Roku was founded on the belief that all TV on all TV ads will be streamed and we continue to see this unfold.
In the first half of this year, TV streaming passed a tipping point where recent engagement for adults' age 18 to 49, exceeded that of legacy pay TV. However, marketers are expected to spend just 22% of their TV ad budgets on streaming in 2022. The ultimate driver of our success is to continue shift of viewers to streaming around the world and the closing gap between viewership and ad budgets.
The current economic state is causing TV advertisers to pause and reconsider spend, which is painful in the short term, but it also causes them to seek greater efficiency and ROI, which will benefit Roku in the mid and long term. This reminds us of when advertisers pause spend during the 2008 recession, but it became a catalyst that accelerated the shift of ad spend from print publishing to digital.
We believe a similar opportunity exists now for advertisers to accelerate their shift from legacy pay TV to TV streaming. We're already seeing this in the upfronts where we continue to take share from broadcast networks and where we surpassed the milestone of $1 billion in commitments recently.
Active accounts for bright spot in Q2, we added 1.8 million incremental active accounts to reach 63.1 million and we maintained our market leadership. We remain the number one selling TV OS in the US and we are the number one TV streaming platform in the US, Canada and Mexico by hours streamed.
Roku remains differentiated by our unique assets, our proprietary Roku TV OS, the Roku channel and our innovative ad platform for connected TV. We are more confident than ever in our strategy market position and growth potential, and we remain focused on the significant opportunity ahead.
With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks Anthony. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Roku continues to grow adding 1.8 million active accounts in Q2 and ending the quarter with 63.1 million. In the quarter, retailers temporarily lowered US TV prices managed through elevated inventory levels, which resulted in a short-term increase in overall TV unit sales, including Roku TV models. Going forward, we expect less promotional activity and lower inventory levels and retail channels, which we believe will continue to keep overall US TV sales below 2019 levels.
Roku player unit sales remained above pre-COVID levels in the US and the average selling price decreased 5% year over year. We have continued to insulate consumers from our cost increases in our player business based on our growing ARPU, which enables us to prioritize account acquisition.
Stream hours were 20.7 billion. This was up 3.4 billion hours year over year, but down 0.2 billion hours from Q1, which was as expected due to normal seasonality. In Q2, total net revenue increased 18% year over year to $764 million coming in below our expectations. Recessionary fears and elevated inflation caused advertisers to significantly curtail or pause spend in the scanner market and consumers to moderate discretionary spend. This adversely affected our Q2 platform revenue growth, which was still up 26% year over year to $673 million.
Going forward, we expect reduced consumer discretionary spend to pressure Roku TV and player unit sets. We therefore reduced our unit forecast and revised our 606 model, which had a disproportionately negative impact on Q2 platform revenue, Q2 player revenue was down 19% while player unit sales were down 16% year-over-year on a selling basis.
Total gross margin was 46% in the quarter. Q2 platform gross margin was 56%, which was down nine points year-over-year. This reflected a shift toward a greater mix of video advertising compared to a year ago, period, which benefited from the significant growth of higher margin M&E, and content distribution due to the launch of new services as well as weakness in the ad market in the quarter.
Q2 player margin was negative 24%, which was down roughly 18 points year-over-year, as we chose to prioritize account acquisition in insulate consumers from higher costs caused by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The year-over-year compression in platform and player margins in addition to a negative 606 adjustments based on our expectations for lower Roku TV and player unit sales resulted in gross profit growth of 5% year-over-year versus the 18% year-over-year growth for total net revenue. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was negative $12 million and we ended the quarter with nearly $2.1 billion of cash and short term investments.
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we are facing an increasingly difficult and uncertain environment. Recessionary fear, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and ongoing supply chain issues will continue to impact both consumers and advertisers. We believe consumers are going to continue to moderate discretionary spend and the ad scanner market will remain pressure.
As a result, our third quarter outlook is for the following; total that revenue of $700 million up 3% year-over-year, gross profit of $325 million with a gross margin of 46% and the adjusted EBITDA of negative $75 million. These estimates reflect our viewpoint that the second half operating environment will be increasingly challenging. We expect roughly stable platform margin on a sequential basis.
Our player margins will continue to be pressured as we insulate consumers from cost increases caused by ongoing headwinds from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. In anticipation of ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we took steps in Q2 to significantly flow, both operating expense and head count growth. We have reduced our OpEx growth rates down from the rates that underpin the full year color that we provided on our Q1 call.
We reduced our Q2 OpEx year-over-year growth rate by 10 percentage points and we plan to reduce Q3 by 10 percentage points and Q4 OpEx by 25 percentage points, bringing Q4 OpEx year-over-year growth rate, roughly in line with that of Q1 2022. We will continue to prudently invest in our business, given the long-term potential we see. We plan to manage our content spend on the Roku channel based on both the scale of the channel and the macroeconomic factors. We are closely monitoring macro conditions and will continue to be flexible with our OpEx and content spend.
Given the volatility and uncertainty of the current macroeconomic environment, we are withdrawing our previous full year revenue growth outlook for 2022. Our outlook has always been based on our assessments of both our business and the broader macroeconomic environment and at this point we feel that there is too much macro uncertainty for us to provide a full year outlook.
Before we get to questions, I want to say one last thing. The significant and long term opportunity in streaming is not changed by the current economic cycle. We remain confident in our business model, in the secular trends that support it. We're in a strong position as a market leader and have a strong balance sheet and we have the right strategy.
And with that, let's take some questions. Operator? [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Your line is snow open. Hey, thanks for the question. Hoping you could expand a bit on what you're seeing in the ad market. It sounds like you saw a pretty dramatic, broad based pullback, but any color on when you started to see the market turn or what verticals perhaps were most impacted would be helpful. Thank you. Hey Cory. This is Anthony, I'll take that and then turn it over to Steve to add some more color. So, at a high level, of course we are seeing advertisers worried about a possible recession, and so we're seeing them reduce their spend in places that are easy for them to turn off and turn back on. So for example, the scanner market which is, an important source of ad revenue for Roku is an easy market for advertisers to turn off and turn back on, and so that's one of the big factors we're seeing from the macroeconomic environment and that's impacting the growth rate in the short term.
In terms of, but I guess another important point there even though advertisers are pulling back on the growth of their spending or pulling back on their ad spend in places like the scanner market, they are continuing to invest more into streaming than traditional TV.
So for example, a couple of the verticals that we saw that were particularly impacted recently our, CPG and auto and if you look at CPG and auto, they were down in traditional TV, they were down 9% in the quarter. But we saw double digit growth as advertisers continue to prioritize streaming for their ad dollars.
So that's the macro environment, but in terms -- if you just kind of peel back the onion, I think super important is that if you just look at the business fundamentals for us, they're very strong. We're in an economic cycle where advertising is trending down, it'll turn around and things like ad market share will become very important when that happens into the size of the rebound. So for example, we are growing our share of the advertising market as advertisers continue to move dollars to streaming and platforms like Roku.
So for example, we, even though the scanner market we're seeing softness, we had a robust upfront recently where we closed over a $1 billion in commitments for the first time. And the upfront, is sort of the opposite of the scanner market. And a scanner market is sort of quarter by quarter short term, upfronts are where advertisers commit dollars for the next year and so, the billion dollar plus in commitments in the upfront shows, continued faith in advertisers for streaming is the place for them to place their advertising vets.
So good, robust upfront. Recently, we also in the quarter added 1.8 million active accounts. So active accounts continue to grow. Our share of ad dollars continues to grow as pay TV dollars shipped over as advertisers continue to move their dollars to higher ROI environments like streaming. So that's a few thoughts on the impact of the macro environment. I don’t know Steve, would you like to add some thoughts? Yeah. Just adding some color on the advertiser pullback in the scanner market overall. Certainly that was a significant factor in the quarter in progress as the quarter went on, but an advertiser perception survey noted that almost half of advertisers in Q2 made pauses on their ad TV spend on TV streaming, which was similar to the amount that passed on digital video and traditional TV.
So this is definitely a broad scale, significant pullback that that happened within the quarter itself and one that's pretty similar to other historical times of a degree of uncertainty or advertisers worried about impending economic downturns. For example, at the start of the pandemic, this is very similar to when a lot of advertisers paused or greatly detailed their spend and then once they got a better handle on which way the world was going, they added those budgets back.
Like Anthony mentioned, the scanner market is a very flexible market of close end timing. And so it's usually one of the first things to be dialed back on when there's uncertainty or a negative outlook, but it's also something that comes back. And when that money comes back, it generally comes back disproportionally into more demonstrateable higher ROI markets like TV streaming. Yeah. And I think, just to add, I think that is a silver lining here. That's important to note, which is that, stress on TV budgets causes people to evaluate how they're spending their dollars, looking at more effective ways to spend those dollars. 22% of TV budgets spent on streaming in 2022 versus about half of all streaming hours sorry, half of all TV hours on streaming. So there's a big opportunity to accelerate the transition from traditional -- advertising dollars from traditional TV to streaming, and this event will have a positive impact on that acceleration. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jason, your line is open please. Checking mute button. Oh, thank you. Sorry. Two questions. Steve, can you just go back and unpack the 606 impact on the quarter? Just specifically, how are you thinking about the drag versus a year ago? And then I maybe give us an update on one view. It doesn't really seem to be generating any material revenue tailwinds, at least from our perspective. So just how are you thinking about the programmatic impact on your business going forward? And are you considering, especially maybe during harder times allowing other DSBA to bid on Roku inventory? Thanks, Steve. Do you want to take the first question? I'll take the 1B question. Okay, sure. Yeah. Hey Jason, thanks for the question. So yeah, in terms of the 606 models, just a reminder, everybody that every quarter we are going through a process where we're looking at the assumptions that underpin our material deal contracts, and we're updating those as necessary. This is a quarter where certainly with the macroeconomic headwinds, not only we saw the advertiser pullback, but also we saw in the economy that many verticals of consumer discretionary spending were getting hit.
We mentioned in the letter and some of the remarks that the TV size of the overall US TV market and sort of overall player sales in the US are being impacted by that pull back and spend and our expectation is that continues in the foreseeable future. As a result in the shortened kind of midterm, we updated our unit forecast to reflect the lower our kind of smaller market size and that had impact, a broad impact on most of our 606 models, most acutely around expected button revenue value in some of the deals.
So anyway, that had an overall view of on the portfolio. As a reminder in the past, we've had most quarters we have some deal values, go up, some, go down many, don't say the same when you have a, a change to input that's common across all the deal models for good or bad, you tend to get a significant impact on the portfolio.
In this case, we did with the lowering of the unit sales that has a disproportionate impact in the 40 you do that. So we did see a hit to expected platform, segment revenue in Q2 and that will have an ongoing impact in subsequent quarters as well, based on the lifetime of the deal, the various deal models that are impacted. And then on one view I guess a couple thoughts. One is that in the quarter in Q2, we saw spending on TV streaming inventory from agency holding companies in one view quadruple year, over year. So it is growing but it is also still a fairly small part of our business compared to compared to just TV media streaming, streaming TV media, generally. We just closed a billion dollars plus and upfronts.
We're seeing TV dollars continue to shift in greater share and greater proportions from traditional pay TV to streaming. That's the biggest driver of our TV ad business, but one is a contributor is growing and it's also, I think, strategically important, over time we expect more and more of TV advertising to move to programmatic. And so having a robust one view solution is DSP is something that we think strategically important. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist. Matthew, your line is now open. Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Sorry, sorry about that. Hey guys, as we go into the back, I'm kind of curious how you were thinking about a few things contributing, I guess one would be, are you thinking about international launches having any impact as we kind roll through the year? Similarly, political I know is new for you guys probably starting small, but I'm kind of curious how you're thinking about that contribution as we move through the year.
And then finally late this year into next year, obviously we have a couple of very high profile AVOD service launches, and I'm, I'm curious if you expect those to be net accretive to Roku and any thought there would be, would be helpful. Thank you. This is Anthony. I'll take that. There was a lot of questions there. So the first question on international, international is going well for us, just as a reminder obviously streaming is a large global opportunity, over a billion broadband TV hustles around the world. They're all going to switch the streaming. Roku is the number one streaming platform in the United States, but also in Canada and Mexico. We're growing fast in Brazil and Latin America generally doing well starting to make good progress in the UK. And we just recently launched in Germany.
So, we are focused on global expansion. I am happy with the results there. We're going well generally. We do -- our business model is to focus first on scale, and then second on monetization, most international companies, we haven't started monetization yet, so that, it is something that will come in the future primarily focus on scale, at least for now on international.
Let's see. And then you had asked about political. Political is a good vertical for us. It's a scenario that's growing. Obviously the political season is coming up. Streaming is mainstream Roku, is America's number one TV streaming platform by ours. So political is an important part of that, of our ad business.
So I'd say it's an important, it's a good business it's growing, but it's not a huge business for us. It's not yet become, a primary growth driver. And I think that's a lot that's for various reasons, but one of the reasons is, the political advertising tends to be in certain, very high demand, localized markets. And so even though we have a lot of scale in a particular market, we'll recaps fairly quickly.
And so that's one of the limiters on growth, but we expect political to continue to grow and continue to be an important vertical for us. And then AVOD so, yeah, this is an important trend in the industry, which is that we're seeing SVOD services continue to add ad supported tiers. The most recent obviously is Netflix Disney, Disney plus also announced they're going to launch an ad supported tier all the other SVOD services already have ad supported, tier Hulu, HBO Max, for example.
And I think, if you just think about the high level, what's the impact to this well as supported tier and SVOD services have the primary impact of lowering the cost of streaming for viewers, which increases the amount of streaming that consumers do. So it's good for engagement and as, the US leading streaming platform, more engagement and streaming is good for our business overall. We like it when people watch more TV. So that's one big factor.
Another big factor is with companies like Netflix and Disney moving into ads. It makes streaming ads even more mainstream. they're already mainstream, but it makes them even more appealing to advertiser advertisers. And, I think we'll continue to accelerate or drive the trend from advertisers, buying ads and traditional TV to moving those ads over to streaming. So it'll grow the industry. We have a lot of tools, for partners as well as for ourselves and for advertisers to help make ads more effective on our platform. So it's, obviously an area we're leaning into and have a lot of ways we can partner and help our service partners.
Another, I think interesting trend driven by advertis in the rise of advertising is that if you're a net five service, historically you're just focused on active accounts or the number of subscribers you have. But if you have ads in your service, then you're also focused on engagement more so because the more people watch TV, the more ads they see, and we built obviously a lot of tools in our platform to help drive engagement, ways to promote services and content on our home screen throughout our platform. And that that's one of the keys that drives our M&E business.
So I think the rise of ads is going to continue to be a positive influence for us. It'll, it'll make ads more mainstream it'll move dollars over faster. It'll drive our M&E business and it creates partnership opportunities for us and our key partners. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you very much. Let me let me try one on expenses and one on gross profit, please. So could you please talk a little bit about how much flexibility do you have in terms of pulling back on your expenses? Not only this year, but how you're thinking about it just overall at a high level, as we even think about next year without, you don't have to officially guide, but just help us think through the potential here in terms of expense control and where would you be slowing down most of your expenses. So would it be original content, international expansion product? Could you please provide color on that?
And then the second question is on gross margins is to help us with where, how we should think about is the stability of gross margins for the platform segment, please, you you've guided to Q3, but how should we think about the long term potential of gross margins for platform? Thank you, Steve. Do you want to take that? Yeah. Hey Twitter yeah, I'll hit the OpEx and then gross margin. And in terms of OpEx, a reminder when we look at our OpEx, the single biggest bucket is headcount growth or headcount related expenses. And so, one of the significant actions we took is to slow that headcount growth in Q2, along with slowing down variable, OpEx, or non-headcount growth as well.
In addition, what we wanted to do is make sure that the Roku channel content spend is commensurate it with the, the scale and the growth trajectory of the Roku channel. We've, we've lived within this ad exported TV model since the inception of the Roku. And so certainly making sure the, it reflects the economic realities of the short term disruptions around the macroeconomic factors is important. So, when we think about that and I mentioned this, there are remarks the OpEx growth rate is going to be lower than what we had originally talked about on the Q1 call.
Just the actions in Q1 or Q2 apologies lower that growth rate that otherwise would've been higher by 10 percentage points. We think it'll be a similar level of about 10 percentage points in Q3 and 25% of his points by Q4. That will take the year of your rate back down to, closer to the Q1 range. And so we'll continue to manage that as things handle, but the biggest thing we can do while still maintaining, the right amount of balance between investing in the long term opportunity that we're still convinced is there.
And we're in a leadership position to, to go deliver against as well as the short term realities is to bend that cost curve down, on the OpEx side, again, CRCs a bit, bit of a different angle as a reminder there, when we talk about content spend the majority of the content spend and the foundation of the spend from the RO channel from day one has been third party licensing.
There's two models there. The predominant one is rep share. So that is kind of variables things on its own and third party licensing. And then you have the Roku originals, which is obviously the newer piece and one that gets a lot of attention, but that's the minority of spending. And so the Roku original program is important for consumers to help drive incremental reach and engagement.
And then also it helps keep in the relationships with the advertisers, as part of the value proposition and our successful upfront that we just completed where we surpass over a billion dollars. But we're going to make sure that we're, we're keeping that content in line with the, the revenue outlook. So that's how we think about that. Obviously there's a lot of uncertainty out in the world, so we'll remain flexible as we get a better handle on which way the, the world's going in terms of the growth margin.
Again, we mentioned that the world's very uncertain and we are providing specific guidance past Q3 at this point. Certainly the margins, especially on the platform side, you've seen some year over year degradation that's largely has to do with the mix shift toward more video, as we had some, kind of one offs around media and entertainment spend and content distribution revenue being a higher percentage mix as some of the new tier one services came online at the end of 2020 and early 2021.
And then also obviously some weakness in the ad market. So we anticipate that some of the pressures on the macro environment will continue in the short term and that that will have, knocked on impacts around not only the revenue growth rate but also the margin structure. Our next question comes from Nicholas Zangler with Stephens. Your line is now open. Yeah. Hey guys. I'm curious if there's any specific forces that you could point out that are serving as a potential offset to the industry headwinds in the near term, you kind of talked about political. I know you just turned on the advertising engine in Mexico. And then you launched the, the what to watch home screen in April. I I'd love to know if that is a monetizable product. It seems like it, but would love to get clarification there, but just any, any near term catalyst to, to kind of go through, Hey, this is Anthony. I would say, maybe one important factor there is, if you just look at the general advertising industry versus TV advertising in industry, especially in the scanner market versus Roku ad business, which is obviously streaming, we are still seeing as advertisers decide how to invest more limited amounts of dollars.
They do, they do look favorably on platforms that are growing as opposed to platforms that are shrinking. And so, it is causing it is causing dollars to shift to streaming at a faster rate. And I think a good example of that was that stat. I said before, where we saw CPG and auto, down in the mark, down in the overall TV ad industry 9% in the quarter, but grew double digits on our platform.
So we are, we are, still the beneficiary of advertisers, starting to follow viewers and starting to follow higher, higher ROI to streaming. And there's a big opportunity for that to continue to, to happen. Like I said before, about half of street about TV hours are now streaming, but only 22% of the TV budgets.
So I think so 1 think one bright spot is that, pressures on budgets cause people to get more serious about how they spend their budgets, causes them to change their behavior and that behavior changes permanent. So I think when we come out of this, we'll be in a better position. And then, like I said, oh, that's oh, sorry, go ahead. Oh, I was just going to I was just going to add, if you don't mind. I was curious also I, if I, if we could get a status on, on enabling like small and mid-size brands and, and performance advertisers to promote via targeted ads on Roku, I know you, you guys had within the last year and a half announced a partnership with Shopify there, but just curious, because it seems like there's, it's a growing priority now. We've heard recent announcements from the trade desk, Amazon peacock, all catering to this, this type of demand. And I know you guys were, were pretty early on starting to set this up. So any, any, there would also be appreciated. Thanks. Sure.
One other, you also had asked about more ways more ways to watch, other factors than our UI that's causing more engagement. And I think it is worth noting that we have been putting a lot more emphasis recently on, on driving engagement on our platform. We have created a whole new team. We hired a new executive that's focused on improving, improving, engagement, and there's a lot of low hanging food there. So that is an area that we are also continuing to focus on in terms of performance advertising.
Yeah. That's still a focus for us. We think that a lot of advertising is going to, is in the process of moving to performance space. We have a lot of tools to do that. We're good at it. We're getting, we're getting even better. So it is an area. It is an area that we're continuing to see growth. Then, if you look at digital budgets, that is -- they are a factor in our for us.
And it is a budget that we're starting to tap into that we didn't historically tap into, but it's still a fairly small part of our sales it's growing. But, still by far, the biggest source of revenue ad revenue for us is traditional TV budgets moving to streaming. And that's a 70 billion opportunity in the us alone. So that's our primary focus and some of those budgets are becoming more performance based as well. Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good afternoon. One for Anthony, and then a, a question for clarification for Steve. I think back in April, you guys launched the dynamic linear or ad product, at least in beta, which I think was something came outta your Nielsen acquisition and something we've heard ad buyers and national networks are excited about. Do you have any update on how that's trending?
And whether that, can turn into a revenue driver in sort of the next, six to 12 months. And then Steve just wanted to better understand the 606 adjustment. I apologize for going back to that, but I think you said it was tied to your outlook for player sales. I just want to confirm that was true. And also just make sure, I don't think you said that impacted the third quarter guide. I just wanted to just confirm that. Thank you guys. Thanks, Ben. Yeah. So just a quick update on dynamic when your ads it's going well still, still early days for those that aren't familiar dynamic, linear answer, or DLA is a technology that allows publishers with Roku's help to replace linear TV ads in real time, so that they're targeted.
So it allows for higher CPMs and better targeting of ads. It's we're in beta with partners like discovery and the AMC it's going well, but still fairly early, we did in Q2 release it broadly to buyers in one view. So that one view buyers can now target ads to DLA partners as well as traditional streaming ads. So it's, rolling out more broadly, still early. It looks promising, but still early than Steve. Yeah. In terms of the six oh side 606 side of things, then. Yeah, just to clarify, I mentioned that the changes in 606 model were primarily related to change in assumption that the size of the us TV market and player markets would be lower than prior expectations that would translate into lower estimates of active accounts, which then funnel through various models, the most explicit connection to that would be, a lower expectation of button revenues in certain deals where we we've sold those link buttons on the remotes. So that's the primary thing.
So it's not necessarily just the player, it's a macroeconomic wind largely tied to lower consumer discretionary spend expectations in a recessionary environment. And then you mentioned the question on Q3. Whenever we change the 606 models and you have a broad scale assumption like this, that hits the majority of the of the portfolio of 606 models, you have a disproportionate impact from that change in the quarter. So in this case, Q2, but you do have an ongoing impact in subsequent quarters, including Q3. And so there is a negative impact of that six oh six call down. That's contemplated in the Q3 outlook. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is no open. Thanks. So could you help us understand how you're adding 1.8 million active accounts which is more than you did in Q2 last year and it followed at 1.2 in Q1. If your player sales are down as much as they are it implies smart TV operating system sales. Good. But now I have the 606 mark down. So I'm just wondering if you could help illuminate where the account growth is coming from. And if I'm right, that it's more the smart TV side operating system side. How much that if you could help us break up between us and international, if that's possible. Thanks.
This is Anthony I'll, I'll start and then turn that over to Steve for some more detail. So I would just say at a high level, people are still buying lots of Roku streaming players. We have great products. People love them. Streaming players are low, have available at very low prices. Our TVs are great value. We have lots of content, lots of super easy to use the Roku OS the only purpose still OS for TV.
So all these have resulted in people liking Roku products and buying, continuing to buy Roku's products and our strength of our brand continues to grow. So, I think that's a big factor and both, both streaming players and TVs are, are doing well for us. But maybe Steve, do you want to talk about some of the details? Yeah, sure. So in terms of the kind of net ads in Q1 versus Q2, the biggest factor there that we talked about in the shareholder or letter was on the TV side. So, a lot of retailers are feeling like they have over inventoried right now and they're trying to lower their overall inventory levels in part due to the recessionary fears and also some of the consumer discretionary spend across a number of verticals that they're starting to see weakened as a result, especially on the TV side, which tends to be of costly inventory, they temporarily reduce the price of that basically put more aggressive promos on the TVs in order to get, get rid of excess inventory that had a short term boost on the number of TV sold in the market, including Roku TV models which is the kind of thing, the biggest part of the fact that net ads increased on a quarter over a quarter basis.
We think that's a temporary blip. A lot of retailers have said that they're looking to kind of lower their inventory levels in general and become more cautious. As the recessionary fears continue and inflationary pressures continue and so that we look at that as more of a temporary phenomenon. Like I said, in general with the six to six answer, the expectations out there in the market is that the, many of the consumer discretionary markets, including consumer electronics in general will be a smaller during, the near term because of these pressures. Okay. And any help on maybe qualitatively breaking out us versus international. We haven't, we haven't provided that before, so yeah, nothing to add there. Okay. Thanks Steve. Thanks Anthony. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Gould with Loop Capital. Your line of snow open. Thanks for taking the question. Anthony, can you tell us, was there any big difference in the various verticals in terms of advertising or did it all slow down at the same time and specifically had the median entertainment vertical do? Well, definitely different verticals were some verticals were more impacted than others. I mentioned that CPG and auto were particularly impacted, declining 9% for traditional TV generally, but growing double digits for us which, which is good growth, but we would've expected stronger growth in the absence of the macroeconomic problems we're seeing.
But and then in terms of media, M&E, I think, it's a good business for us. And like I said before, I think that the fundamentals are in favor that business continuing to do well, particularly, for example, just one example subscription publishers, publishers of SVOD services tend to just focus on subscriber acquisition type promotions, but we are seeing them now start to do promotions designed to retain customers, not just to acquire new customers.
And so as the industry matures, it'll start spending more promotional dollars on retaining customers, reducing churn as well as acquiring customers. And then, like I said before, I think the, the trend to offer more advertising, supported tiers is going to result in services, wanting to drive engagement because the more engagement, the more ants people see. And so and we have a lot of tools in our M&E business for helping to drive engagement. And I think we'll start to see them used increasingly. So I think, M&E is going to be a big and growing business for us.
If we could just ask one, one follow up, you say, you're, you're targeting most of your ad gains from traditional TV, not digital, but these trends sounds a lot more like the digital players. And when Comcast reported this morning, they talked about the scatter market being choppy, but having the whole business pause sounds a lot more like the digital guys wondering where the discrepancy is coming from.
Well, I didn't pause. our platform business grew nicely in the quarter. I was saying that we had like I was talking about that one vertical CPG and auto, down in the industry overall, but up double digits for us. So we are, we are seeing we did see in Q2 growth in our ad business, just not as strong as we had initially expected. Okay. And so I think yeah.
So, we are starting to access digital budgets as well. But there's still, relatively small compared to the, the overall TV ad business, which is a 70 plus billion dollar business and has got a lot of reasons to transition to streaming at the moment. So yeah, think that the overall our business is growing is growing. Just not as strongly as it would have if advertisers weren't pulling back.
Another factor, I guess in our business is we do, we do traditionally over index on scatter versus upfronts. that's starting to change. Our upfronts are getting bigger and bigger every year. Mm-Hmm , this year we passed a billion dollars, but, but we do traditionally have a lot of scatter business more than more than a traditional TV network that tends to be more their business in the upfront. Okay. And the scatter market's easy for advertisers to pause on and then restart. Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Michael your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Can I just ask too one Steve, I wanted to get, come back to six, six, and what I wanted to know is, are you seeing the material change in either top of funnel gross additions to streaming services or churn dynamics? Right. So is there anything on the economics of streaming that makes you come back and look at your assumptions? And then, and then the bigger question is it was a group M study back in June that talked about a lot of a impressions on sticks and dons were running when the TV set was off.
And I wonder if you guys have a point of view on the group M study and what you're doing to maybe address that. And do you think, is, is that a legitimate concern about maybe the, the quality of impressions that come through SNS and dons? So thanks. Yes. Steve, do you want to take that? I can take the impression question if you want, but go ahead. Sure. Yeah, I'll take in terms of six to six piece, the, the material change is like said around the sort of marketizing of overall TV players and the player sorry, TV sales, as well as player sales, kind of on the market level, which then filters down into unit sales estimates, and then active account numbers. Certainly we update the assumptions for the specific deal models, what I would say on that, in terms of in some, in terms of kind of the funnels within the SPO services there, there's certainly more competition in the SPO space. And so there may be, changes that we make in different models over time.
But it's certainly not a macro factor, like what we've seen with the, the material impacts to the 606 models. So I would say that's more of a competition related set of changes potentially that we look at every single quarter, as opposed to a broad scale change in the market size of TVs and players. That's really, what's driving the change in the six or six models this time. Okay. And then Anthony Yeah. And then on the ad impressions I would say rookie is a leader in advertising quality. so on the point you raised specifically, I'll just talk about a few other things we do then maybe talk about the big picture. So, in terms of specific things, when a rookie player goes inactive sorry, a rookie player will go inactive when they get a signal from the TV that the TV inputs no longer being watched.
A lot of TVs, most TVs send out that signal, but not all obviously if it's a Roku TV, then we know when you turn off the TV and we stop, we don't continue to play. And then to catch the edge cases in 2019, we rolled out a feature called, are you still watching?
Where we, if there's a period of inactivity, we ask the user, if they're still there. So we take a lot of steps to make sure our inventory is high quality. And I think we're, confident that it is generally and I think the proof is in the numbers. If you just look at, we do lots of, we do lots of analysis on ad campaigns that run on the linear and then also run on Roku. And we see consistently that the campaigns are higher performing on our platform platform versus traditional linear TV. Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will know. I turned the conference back over to Anthony Wood for closing remarks. Thanks. I want to thank our employees, customers, and partners for their focus and commitment in the very difficult operating environment, but we expect to emerge from the current advertising downturn stronger and better position than ever to capture value in the transition of, of TV to streaming. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Conrad Grodd, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. And welcome to Roku’s third quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm joined today by Anthony Wood, Roku’s, Founder and CEO, and Steve Louden, our CFO. Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter, which can be found on our investor relations website at roku.com/investor.

We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our shareholder letter.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results of the comparable period of 2021.
Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. And thank you all for joining us. I would like to provide some high level thoughts on the macro environment, Roku's business model, and our ongoing conviction in the streaming platform opportunity.
In Q3, advertisers pulled back on spending, consumers were further pressured by inflation and overall economic uncertainty remained high. We expect these conditions will continue and are likely to worsen in Q4. Although these factors are temporary and the ad market is expected to bounce back, we'll continue to take steps to reduce our OpEx growth. In addition, we are sharpening our spending focus on the projects that will drive the most growth and enhance our leadership position.
Our opportunity as a streaming TV platform is very large and remains intact despite current ad pull bag. We are not idly waiting for the ad market to improve. We added 2.3 million active accounts in Q3, which was above net adds in both 2019 and 2021. And we grew streaming hours on The Roku Channel by more than 90% year-over-year. We’re making good progress internationally, demonstrated by our results in Mexico. Last month we launched the Roku channel in Mexico, a milestone that is the result of meaningful scale and engagement that we have built in there in the past three years.
We continued to build our market leading competitive assets and to attract top industry talent. As demonstrated by the recent addition of Charlie Collier, as President of Media; and before that, Gidon Katz, our President of Consumer Experience. All of this positions us to return to stronger revenue growth when the ad market returns.
We continue to innovate and execute. Last month, we launched new smart home products to build new service revenue streams. We believe every device in the home will be connected by software and services, but it's still early days. For example, only about 20% of U.S. households have IT cameras. Additionally, the existing smart home experiences fragmented and difficult to use. As the number one selling smart TV OS in the U.S., we have the technology and expertise in hardware, software, and services to deliver a smart home ecosystem that is simple, powerful and delightful. We launched in this category with strong retail distribution at Walmart, America's number one retailer.
Roku is now the number one smart home brand by shelf space in nearly 3,500 Walmart locations. As with our TV streaming business model, we will build scale with our devices and monetize through smart home services, which we expect to become a very large market. We have spent years building a business design to benefit everyone in the TV streaming ecosystem. We are extending our ecosystem and as we look ahead, we remain confident that our strategy and business model are the best way to maximize the opportunity to deliver both growth and profitability to our investors.
Finally, we announced earlier today that after nearly eight years with Roku, Steve Louden, will leave in 2023 after helping us recruit and transition his role to a successor. You may recall that Steve previously decided to leave Roku three years ago when he relocated to Seattle. With the onset of the pandemic, he decided to stay. I'm grateful for his leadership and for building a world-class team, which he will continue to lead until his departure. And we all wish him well. Thank you, Steve. Thanks Anthony. I appreciate the kind works. Roku continues to grow, adding 2.3 million active accounts in Q3, which was above both 2019 and 2021 level, ending the quarter with 65.4 million. This growth was driven primarily by TV sales in both the U.S. and international markets, along with improved active account retention.
Meanwhile, Roku player unit sales remained above pre-COVID levels and the average selling price decreased 6% year-over-year, as we continue to insulate consumers from higher cost to prioritize account acquisition. Roku users streamed 21.9 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year as we continue to outperform viewing our growth of traditional TV.
In Q3, total net revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $761 million. Platform revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $670 million, representing 88% of total revenue. While platform revenue came in above our expectations and was a positive given the difficult macro environment, the advertising business continues to grow more slowly than our beginning of year forecast due to the current weakness in the overall TV ad market and the ad scatter market in particular.
Player unit sales were down 2% year-over-year on a sell-in basis, while Player revenue was down 7% due to a mix shift toward lower price units.
Total gross margin was 47% in the quarter. Q3 Platform growth margin of 56% was stable sequentially, but down nine points year-over-year. This reflects weakness in the ad scatter market and a greater mix of video advertising in Q3 2022 compared to a year ago period.
Q3 2021 was also a tough comp due to the launch of new streaming services, which drove significant growth of higher-margin M&E and content distribution.
In Q3 2022, we recognized a negative 606 adjustments due to lower SVOD industry expectations. As a reminder, the 606 adjustment in Q2 was driven by our expectations for lower Roku TV and player unit sales due to the macro environment. And both had a similar impact on our Platform gross profit in their respective quarters.
Q3 Player margin was negative 19%, which was down roughly four points year-over-year. As we continue to prioritize account acquisitions and insulate consumers from higher costs caused by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The year-over-year compression in Platform and Player margins resulted in profit growth of negative 2% year-over-year versus the 12% year-over-year growth in total net revenue.
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was negative $34 million and we ended the quarter with more than $2 billion of cash.
Let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Total net revenue of $800 million, gross profit of $325 million with gross margin of 41% and adjusted EBITDA of negative $135 million. The holiday season is typically the strongest period for most companies, including Roku, but we expect this season to be different. We believe that macro uncertainties and inflationary pressures will continue to negatively impact consumer discretionary spend and these pressures will further weigh on advertising budgets, particularly the ad scatter market. We expect these conditions to be temporary, but it is difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound.
For our Player business, we anticipate lower sales year-over-year and margins that will be significantly lower sequentially, primarily due to traditional holiday promotional pricing. For our Platform business we anticipate that these macro pressures will offset with ordinarily the seasonal tailwinds, and as a result our platform revenue will be slightly down on sequential basis. In addition, our Player and Platform revenue in Q4 is typically back-end loaded, which further reduces our visibility.
As we indicated last quarter, we will continue to slow headcount and operating expense growth in response to the macro environment, while continuing to make disciplined investments in our most strategic project that will increase both the market penetration of our platform and long-term customer value.
Despite near-term headwinds, we continue to make progress towards capitalizing on the opportunity created by consumers and advertisers moving to streaming. Roku will continue to invest in innovation in driving our leadership position forward, which we believe is the best way to deliver both growth and profitability to our investors over the long-term.
On a personal note, as it’s been an incredible journey and a privilege to be part of Roku’s success from pre-IPO, to becoming a public company and a leading TV streaming platform.
As Anthony noted, I will be here still my successor is in place sometime next year. In the meantime, I look forward to continuing to execute on our mission in working with our terrific team.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc Capital Markets, you may proceed. Great. Thank you very much. Two if I can. Anthony, I appreciate the comments you gave on smart home, however, it's a crowded space with some large competitors. Why focus on this category versus investing deeper into Roku's international expansion and strengthening the ad tech? What type of return do you see from this investment?
And then for Steve, it's been a pleasure working with you. Wanted to double-click on some of your OpEx comments. I realize it's going to take time for that to flow through. But how are you thinking about the right level of OpEx growth against say, revenue growth and margin preservation as we head into out of Q4 and into 2023? Thank you. Hey, Justin. Thanks for the question. I will answer the question on smart home and then turn it over to Steve for OpEx. So the way I think about the smart home business is that it's a natural extension of Roku's ecosystem and a natural business for us to be in. And for a few different reasons let me just highlight some of them.
So first of all, Roku has 65 million active accounts consisting of smart TVs which is a great smart device to build on in terms of expanding around the home with other smart devices. So we have an early start. We are probably one of, if not the most popular smart home device in homes today.
And then also it's a big opportunity. I mean it's still early days, for example, about 20% of U.S. homes have a smart camera. But the whole smart home experience today is early and complicated. It's way too complicated and it's got a lot more potential than the way the existing competitors are thinking about it. And so I just think it's an area. Making complicated things simple is something that Roku really excels at. And that's another big opportunity for us to be successful here. Another way for us to be successful.
It also, if you think about all the assets we have, we're great at software services, we're good at building very simple and usable devices and services, and all of those things directly apply to the smart home business. So we have our brand – I mean, it's a very natural extension and we've already built a lot of the pieces we need.
And then, finally in terms of the opportunity, there is going to be – it's going to be a big market for our Smart Home services. So it's a kind of over the long term, it's a way for us to build out new high margin service revenues. And then if you think at it practically, at our business model level, our business model is to sell devices, smart devices that are low cost and great value for customers and then monetize those through service revenue streams. So this is just, again, a natural extension.
Also, extending our ecosystem by allowing our customers to add other devices to their account should – will also have the benefit of increasing the retention of our existing customers as well as obviously building service revenue streams.
So – and it's not a particularly big investment for us because we're leveraging a lot of what we've already done. And so – but yes, it's an option on something that could be very big and a very high return. And so that's why we're doing smart home. It's a great opportunity.
And then Steve, did you want to talk about the OpEx question? Sure. Yes, hey Justin, I know you've been tracking this for a while, but just – I think taking a step back here on just the kind of trend over time. Before the recent ad market downturn, we've been performing well, consistent high revenue and gross profit growth and reinvesting that gross profit back into the business. As Anthony talked about, there's a significant opportunity out there ahead of us.
And when the pandemic hit, what we did is we've greatly curtailed that OpEx growth given the uncertainty at that time and effectively deferred some investments we would have otherwise made. When we thought that the business in the world was kind of moving out of the pandemic-related disruptions, we started to go ahead and invest again in a more substantial way, try to get through some of those deferred investments that we've pushed off during the pandemic. And so we ramped up headcount hiring, which is the primary way we invest in, in additional new innovation and work on our project road map.
When we saw the ad market downturn in Q2 that was really kind of the confluence of high inflation, economic uncertainty, geopolitical issues around energy and the war in Ukraine. So we pulled back significantly immediately on the OpEx growth. That manifested itself in relative, basically flat headcount levels in Q3. And we're continuing to look at ways to take steps to lower that OpEx growth.
But notably, the OpEx year-over-year growth rate is still high but that's largely the result of that hiring increases late last year and early this year. So we're focused on driving the sequential OpEx growth rate down. And then we're making sure that we're focusing our remaining investment on the high potential projects that are going to lead to further growth and further bolster our leadership position. Got it. Thank you both. And Justin, I'll just add that – I mean these are tough times, especially in the ad market, certainly impacting us as well as others. But the transition to streaming and the creation of a small number of successful large-scale streaming platform is a huge opportunity for us. And it's not changed by the current economic cycle.
So that's why we're being very disciplined about where we spend our money but continuing to focus on strong account growth, strong engagement growth, positioning us well for when the market turns around. I think it would be a mistake – although we're being very disciplined and we're definitely looking at OpEx very carefully. We don't want to pull back so much that we start impacting the key pillars that we're building out with our goal of becoming a very large and profitable company. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. You may proceed. Thank you. In terms of the Q3 kind of upside to ad revenues, can you just discuss kind of where the upside came from, maybe the linearity throughout the quarter as well? I mean just any thoughts on revenue by ad verticals that you are seeing as well. Thank you. Steve, do you want to take the question on Q3 performance? I can talk about the ad market. Yes, sure. Just in terms of Q3 ad performance, I mean, certainly, starting in Q2, kind of mid-Q2, we saw businesses react to the greater level of uncertainty by pulling back on OpEx in general and including the TV ad scatter market was impacted. That's something that, by its nature, is easy to turn off and then easy to turn back on. When things get better, our businesses get more comfortable.
So we are happy with Q3 performance given the headwinds. But that outlook was placed at a time where that trend was just materializing. So we feel like we've been performing well in terms of – so we looked at some external data from SMI. It showed us outperforming the traditional TV ad market as well as being at or slightly above the connected TV ad market.
So I think we continue to perform well despite all these headwinds. And that's really where we've seen the results come in relative to pretty uncertain outlook at the time we did last earnings call. Got it. August, September were kind of better than when you initially gave guidance – things end of July? Yes. We haven't really commented on the specific trends within the quarter. Certainly, there's a lot of uncertainty. And so there's been a lot of changes, I think, especially you mentioned some of the questions around the verticals. We've seen kind of the strength or weakness of certain verticals. There's been a wide distribution of the impact. I mean pretty much every vertical is down when you look at the ad spend but they're down very different levels. And so I think that it's been an ever-shifting landscape by verticals. And so it's really kind of hard to make a global statement about the overall trends. Got it, great, thank you. This is Anthony. So we are seeing – like Steve said, there's a lot of uncertainty. It's hard to say exactly what's going to happen in Q4, but we are seeing signs that Q4 is going to be worse in terms of the ad market than Q3 was, I mean we're seeing lots of big categories, pull back telecom, insurance. We're even seeing telemarketers planning on reducing their spend in Q4.
I think traditionally, Q4 is a very – the holiday season is typically the strongest period for a lot of companies, including Roku. But companies are pulling back their ad budgets because they're uncertain if there will be a recession or not. And so a lot of Q4 ad campaigns are being canceled. And so that's why – so I think this holiday season, given the unique set of environments and characteristics, is probably going to be different than the typical holiday season. Yes, thank so much. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore. You may proceed. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Okay, thanks a lot. I'm sorry if my questions have been asked but let me try two, please. One is, Steve, could you talk about how much visibility you have and how that has changed over the course of the year? So as you sit today, how much visibility across your revenue segments do you have from Player to video ads to M&E to content distribution?
And then, Anthony, how are you thinking about prioritizing the different initiatives, whether it is the Roku Channel to the ad platform to the operating system and enhancing user experience and also international? Has your thought process changed with the change in the macro environment in terms of how you're prioritizing? Thanks a lot. Sure. Steve, do you want to start? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Shweta. Certainly, with the increased amount of uncertainty out there, both on the consumer side as well as on the business and the advertising side, visibility has clearly diminished out there in the economy. Most pronounced is – we talked about that briefly. The ad scatter market is – by its nature is uncommitted, tends to be in quarter spend.
And so a good example on that is kind of before disruptions happened, before the ad pullback, we had a pretty good handle based on our experience over the years about what's the pipeline, what's the curve in terms of what percentage of bookings that we had at certain points before the quarter started and during the quarter. Those kind of historical pipeline curves are sort of largely thrown out the window these days where there's tremendous uncertainty. And as I mentioned on that prior question, there's a big shift in verticals, especially depending on the level of uncertainty, whether there's continued supply chain disruptions, all that.
And so the ad scatter business, certainly, the visibility has been most impacted by that, although obviously, we've made changes to longer term things like in our 606 modeling around the market size expectations out there in the industry have shifted and we had that change in Q2. And in Q3, we made some updates based on SVOD industry expectations as well.
So you've got – most pronounced, you've got short-term visibility issues and then some other kind of, let's call it, near-term to moderate term changes in expectations just given the way that the world is moving at this point. And then Shweta, your question on how we think about priorities given the current macro environment. I mean our priorities have not really – have not changed. And so just to recap those, a big – the kind of the first pillar of our business is built on scale of active accounts. And there's still lots of room to grow active accounts internationally, of course, but also domestically. And so that's the first area of continued investment for us. So that would be things like our Roku TV program, which has been super expensive. We're – sorry, super effective, not expensive, super effective. We're the number one selling TV operating system in the United States built on the strength of our purpose-built TV operating system, purpose-built for TV computing platform.
And again, just to recap for those who don't know our strategy here. If you think about when new computing platforms emerge, like happened with PCs, you get a lot of initial contenders or legacy businesses. And then they consolidate down to a handful of – small handful of winners. And we saw that with Windows and Mac on PCs. And then on phones, it was iOS and Android. And on TVs, Roku is the number one streaming TV OS platform.
So continuing to drive that both domestically and internationally by signing up more partners, entering new markets, creating more innovative products. So the Roku TV program is a big thing for us. And we made good progress in the quarter. Active accounts grew 2.3 million, both from TVs and players and internationally and domestically. So growing active accounts for Roku TV program.
And then another big area of investment for us is increasing the value of a customer. So we have lots of customers and we keep adding more customers. But we can also increase the value of those customers. And that's the mission of our consumer experience team, which we've been putting a finer focus on over the last year, led by Gidon Katz.
And there – what they're investing in is things that increases engagement in our UI, so engagement in the platform overall and engagement in the UI as well. And so making our – making the user interface – our platform user interface more effective in helping consumers find content to watch and more effective in terms of building out monetization options for us and just building the value of the customer by using all the levers available because we control the platform UI and there's a lot of ways to do that. And that's been going well, a lot of progress there.
And then another area of – sorry. And then on active accounts, international, of course, is a big – continues to be a big area of focus for us and we're making good progress. I mean we highlighted successes in Mexico in our shareholder letter. We're the number two platform in Mexico – I'm sorry, we're the number two selling TV OS in Mexico now. We continue to add more TV partners. We have a goal of passing Samsung. They're currently number one but I think we can pass them just like we did in the U.S. and other markets.
And because we've been making the progress in building scale in Mexico, we launched the Roku Channel, which is kind of one of the steps in monetizing our platform in the market. So continuing to focus on global expansion – so active accounts grow the value of a customer, increase engagement.
And then finally, of course, there’s monetization across the platform. And one of the key ways we do that is through the Roku Channel. So the Roku Channel continues to be a big success for us and an area that we continue to invest in.
And then content is an area of focus for us. And we’re getting – we’re obviously becoming a bigger player in the content industry in terms of licensing rev share, originals. But that spend has all done commensurate with the scale and size of the Roku Channel and appropriate to that business model. So I think – so that’s some of the areas that we’re focused on. So it’s basically growing scale of the platform, increasing the value of a customer and just innovation and competitiveness overall. Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks, Steve. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. You may proceed. Thank you. Steve, can I ask you to unpack the platform revenue growth by component, please? Maybe tell us how much monetized with your ad impressions grew in the quarter. You used to give out that metric. And then did M&E grow and the distribution revenue grow and maybe rank order by growth rates, if possible? Vasily, happy to give you some more color. We obviously don’t disaggregate that platform segment due to 606 disaggregation issue. But what we saw this quarter, obviously, we talked about the ad scatter market is challenged. And so that’s been a significant driver of the slowing growth in platform overall.
M&E, we had a tough comp compared to last year, where we had some services that had launched mid to late last year. But M&E continues to grow and it’s high margin. And from a content distribution standpoint, that is driven by the active account growth and streaming hour growth. So notwithstanding some of our expectations in the future based on SVOD industry changing expectations and some consumer behaviour that has held up as well.
So the main story here on the Platform segment and its growth trend is largely driven by the ad scatter market. Again, a reminder that upfront commitments have been strong this year, over $1 billion with that. In general, each year, our exposure to the – or our mix of the upfront to ad scatter has been moving towards upfront. And so there’s kind of a short-term, long-term disconnect here. The short term, certainly, very challenged with the ad scatter market pullback – pulling back significantly for the industry. But at the same time, good trend on the upfront committed as well as things like M&E performing well. Okay. Thank you very much. Sure. Vasily, let me just add, M&E was brought up. M&E is – which is media and entertainment and that – for those who don’t know, that’s our business, helping drive subscriptions and engagement and viewership with content across our platform.
And we’re very good at it. It’s an area that we’ve built a lot of expertise around. And as we built out our purpose-built platform for TV, it’s an area that we’ve invested a lot in, in terms of building the right capabilities and tools into the platform. And of course, we understand very well the business of TV advertising and the tools needed to drive that.
And so we built all that into our M&E business. And it’s an area that I think has a lot of opportunity. I mean, obviously, there’s a lot of streaming services that are still trying to build accounts, trying to reduce churn and grow engagement. But we’re also seeing big new services like Netflix and Disney get into the ad business or starting to add advertising to their – some tiers of their services. And for those companies, as soon as they have ads, engagement becomes even more important for them because, obviously, the more people watch content, the more ads they can watch and the more money that can be made.
And so using our M&E tools to drive engagement on our services as well as third-party services is something that we’re very good at. And I think those companies know that we can help them a lot in that area. So – and also, I talked about Gidon working on our consumer experience. A big part of that is also related to driving our M&E business, which is around how can we become more relevant to our consumers, to our viewers and helping them decide what to watch. I mean we’re a trusted partner for our viewers when they use things like universal search or more ways to watch or feature free in our user interface.
But as the owner of the platform UI, that’s our core advantage is using that platform UI in ways to help our consumers find content is something that we can do exclusively. And then integrating that into our M&E business to drive engagement and viewership and subscriptions is a big way that we can help our partners and generate profit for both our – revenue for both us and our partners. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Thanks. Anthony, kind of big picture question with a few parts. So from what I can tell, the majority of your shareholders think you’re making a strategic mistake by refusing to let third-party DSPs bid on TRC and other inventories. So one, do you still think this is the right decision? Two, why do you think this is the right decision? And three, what’s Charlie’s view on this given his position in the business? And is it possible you change the position now that he is running Advertising? Thanks. Jason thanks for that question on DSPs. So well, I’ll come to Charlie in a second, but let me just kind of touch on DSP. So first of all, we have our own DSP OneView, which is highly optimized for TV streaming and our Roku Platform. It’s the best way to buy inventory across our platform, taking advantage of our data and technology we built into the platform. So that’s obviously a big focus for us.
In terms of diversifying our revenue streams, one of the ways we’ve been doing that is focusing on the upfront. So we started out with no revenue coming from the upfront. This last year, we passed the $1 billion in our upfront commitments, which – and so every year, the mix of dollars that comes on the platform that comes through the upfront has been growing. And that’s becoming increasingly important for us.
But in terms of actual DSPs, I mean first of all, we do work with third-party DSPs. We work with dozens of buy and sell-side platforms. We’ve long worked with marketing and ad tech partners, including – for example, the shopper program we do with Kroger or the Roku Measurement Partner program with 20-plus measurement companies. And are there other ways we could work with DSPs to generate incremental revenue? There might be. And that’s – we’re definitely looking at ways to work with partners to increase our revenue stream. So that’s something that we’re looking at.
In terms of Charlie, I don’t know what Charlie thinks about DSPs. But he’s got a lot of experience working with advertisers, both traditionally through IOs and also through DSP platforms, which is something that he does at FOX, where he was before Roku. So we’ll see. But I think the big picture around Charlie is just that he’s a very senior media executive with a lot of experience in advertising and in content, in programming and the strategy of running a media company.
And we built our media business to a big business, a very large business. But it’s got so much more potential and it can be a lot bigger. And that’s why we recruited Charlie to help take us to the next level. So I’m sure he’ll bring some new insights and strategies and ways of thinking that we weren’t thinking before and love to see what happens. But I’m looking forward to working with him to grow the media business. Thanks. Appreciate the color. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. You may proceed. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe can you give us some perspective on what you’ve seen quarter-to-date on the ad pullback. Anthony, I think you talked about big categories pulled back like telecom. But any way to sort of quantify it or maybe talk to the – I’m guessing more acceleration in the pullback? Just some perspective given sort of what we’re seeing in the Q4 guide. And Steve, I just wanted to clarify something. I think you said that – I think you said platform revenue will be down sequentially in Q4. If you could confirm that’s indeed correct. Thank you. Yes. I mean I can say a few words about what we’re seeing in the ad business. But – and then maybe Steve has something – some comments on that as well on our guidance – I mean, our outlook. So I think – like I said before, this is not a normal holiday season. There’s a lot of uncertainty in the economy. And when there’s uncertainty around it, there’s going to be a recession or consumers are pulling back on spending. How much of that will continue, when will it turn around, when will the Fed stop raising interest rates, I mean all these things creating a tremendous amount of uncertainty in – so this is not a normal holiday season.
And we are seeing – and one of the first things companies do in the face of such uncertainty is they cancel their ad budgets. And so that’s kind of the core driver of why the ad market is down. It’s very hard to predict because a lot of our business comes in the second half of the quarter in Q4. But the trends we’re seeing are that big advertisers that we traditionally get spend from are not spending this quarter. They’re not spending with anyone. That’s not just they’re not spending with us. But the best information we have, we put in our outlook.
And like I said before, it’s definitely temporary. Assuming it doesn’t – the economy doesn’t have to turn around. What needs to happen is there has to be more certainty in people’s minds about where the economy is heading. And that will cause people to come back in the market and start spending again. Steve, did you want to add anything? Yes, sure. Ralph, so yes, just on your specific question, so we did mention in the remarks that contemplated in the Q4 outlook is that the revenue will be down sequentially as well as year-over-year and specifically because of the significant pullback in the ad scatter market driving that platform revenue down sequentially, kind of effectively basically counteracting the traditional sequential pop that we would get because of the holiday season. We think that the forces that are sort of against that, weighing on the economy and consumers and advertisers is enough to make that a sequential decline. Okay. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Anthony. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. You may proceed. I have a question about the next recession, actually. Do you think that the sort of dramatic sort of retrenchment that we’ve seen in your advertising revenue is simply a function of this upfront scatter mix? Or do you think it’s that plus some sort of, I don’t know, lack of sophistication or habit on the part of advertisers, where they still view connected TVs as experimental and therefore it’s sort of the first thing that they cut when they’re faced with a period of uncertainty? In other words, during the next recession, do you think you’ll see the same sort of dynamics in terms of the pullback or look more like traditional TV? That’s the basic question. Thanks. Hi, Jason. Thanks. That’s an interesting question. I think that – well, first of all, I think that there’s nothing unique about Roku’s situation. We believe that we’re – based on what we’ve seen that other connected TV companies are experiencing similar pullbacks to us. We think we’re over-indexing slightly a little bit versus the connected TV market in terms of getting our fair share. So we’re doing a little bit better but roughly in line, we think, with other connected TV platforms.
And it’s certainly true that most ad dollars are still flung to the traditional TV companies. And I believe that the environment we’re in now will – is causing people to look more seriously about how they spend their money. And traditionally, in similar situations in the past, you’ve seen situations like we’re seeing now accelerate the transition. So my expectation is this will accelerate the transition of dollars from traditional TV to connected TV. I think we're seeing that and I think the next recession hopefully is a long way away. And when that happens by that point, I think all advertising will be through connected TVs and streaming. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Thanks for taking the question. Anthony, I guess if we sort of think sort of about the overall business and the profitability of your business, I'd love to sort of get how you're thinking about the shift. The one other thing when I think about the meta-challenges it's because they're being forced to spend more on their business to sort of keep up with TikTok. And so the profitability from their AI investment is hurting the margin structure of the company. When you think about sort of Roku's current sort of Smart TV landscape, is the content spend simply to drive an incremental revenue stream? Or do you see content spend increasingly something you need to do to differentiate versus the other players out there? Meaning is it sort of an increasingly important part of the part of the business that you have to invest in, in order to drive player sales and sort of maintain player market share? That would be great just to, again get your kind of high level view on that.
And then separately, we listened to Lachlan Murdoch early in the week, talk about turvy and talk about sort of 30% growth accelerating to 40% growth in Q4. And I think the street's having a lot of part time kind of reconciling that – those comments relative to what you and Steve just said as well as what we've heard from most of the other companies who have been far more sort of pessimistic about Q4. And I'm just curious if there's any reason why not all players would sort of be seeing the same trends? Thanks. Hey, Rich, that was a complicated question. Let me see if I can parse it out. So the first part of it was around, I think was around our TV operating system strategy. And that we see is there parallel with meta in terms of increased competition? I think it's completely different. I mean, I think that the way the operating system for television strategy or market is playing out is that we're not seeing new competitors. If you think like I do that all TVs are going to be sold with a licensed operating system and we're seeing that trend playing out over time. There's three licensed operating systems in the market that have any momentum and that's Roku. We're Number 1 in U.S., Google TV or Android TV, whatever you want to call it, and Amazon Fire TV which is a variation of Android.
And all three of those operating systems are gaining accounts and they're gaining them at the expense of the incumbents – the incumbent TV providers, which have proprietary operating systems and those are all transitioning to licensed operating systems with various degrees of speed depending on the company, the OEM. So I think, so to summarize in the TV operating system business Roku has the only proprietary based TV operating system, sorry we're the only purpose built operating system for TV. It's not an operating system that was designed for mobile phones imported. It gives us fundamental advantages is the reason we're the Number 1 operating system in the U.S. and growing rapidly in the markets we enter.
And we expect active accounts and adoption of that operating system to continue to grow and we expect to maintain – leadership position. There's no new competitors coming into the market. It's the market's too far ahead and it's not, it's just different. It's just a different market than social media platforms. I mean, it's a TV business it's hardware, it's requires a lot of scale to be in the business at this point because there's so much R&D required and it requires that you be successful in monetization to participate in the business successfully. So and to fund the R&D that goes along with it. So I don't think there's really any analogy to meta. And I think there's lots of reasons to think that the hardest part of our business in terms of active account is behind us.
They're still very competitive obviously, but we're doing well in terms. It terms of content – our content strategy is not about differentiating our product – our platform, I mean, it might have some benefits there, but that's not the primary reason. So I mean, so if you look at versus say an SVOD service, a big SVOD service like Disney or Netflix or Hulu, they have to convince people to keep paying a subscription fee every month and they do that by producing a lot of originals and some of them become hits and some of them cause people to want to sign up or retain their subscription. Our business is different. Our business is, we build active accounts by licensing our TV OS, selling streaming players, and then we focus on engagement across the entire platform that a customer has those.
And because we control user interface for the platform, and we have our own free AVOD service called The Roku Channel, one of the things we do is we integrate The Roku Channel into the platform into the platform UI, which strives engagement of The Roku Channel. So it's not being driven – and of course, some of that engagement is really promo content, we promote originals, and originals role is actually is to drive engagement among other things. But it's all about – it's all in service of creating a good business around The Roku Channel and getting customers to come into The Roku Channel and watch content.
And so it's not – it's not about getting people to pick Roku at the retailer because we have WEIRD: The Al Yankovic. So anyway, so for us content from the originals is all part of a portfolio strategy designed to have a portfolio content for The Roku Channel that achieves our AVOD business model overall.
So then the third part of your question? And then lastly on sort of the TV? I don't know, they don't break out the specifics of TV. I feel confident that The Roka Channel is highly competitive. Pluto didn't have the numbers that TV had allegedly, I just can't really comment. I don't really know the specifics of the Fox TV situation. I do know that on our platform, The Roka Channel is doing extremely well. I mean, we grew engagement in The Roku Channel 90% year-over-year, which is a huge amount of growth. It's a very successful product for us. It's a top five app both in terms of reach and engagement. It's ranked Number 1 in AVOD Fast Services in the U.S. and Canada.
Got a broad portfolio of compelling content, everything from originals to direct license products, Spanish language products exclusive content like the WEIRD: The Al Yankovic, which premiered exclusively on The Roca Channel November 4th just had the premiere last night with Daniel Radcliffe and Weird Al. Lot of buzz around that show is going to be a great show, but it's not – it's – and it'll be very successful for us, but it's not like people are buying Roca players, they're buying Roca players because it's got a great user experience for streaming other content.
Other content business versus The Roca Channel includes the Rich Eisen Show. We're integrating more and more SVOD services into The Roku Channel, which has the benefit of driving a lot of incremental engagement for those SVOD services because The Roku Channel is integrated into our platform UI. So The Roku Channel is been great for us and it's a great asset for us. Hey, Rich, it’s Steve. Just to add to what Anthony was talking about, I don't have any insight onto TV but one thing just to remind folks is for a lot of media companies that have traditional sort of network cable and connected properties with the declining ratings in lot of the traditional business, a lot of times those ad sales are being fulfilled over on the Connected TV properties. And so they're actually shifting kind of a broad-based sale disproportionately over to their Connected TV property. So again, I don't know what's driving through these info but that's one thing that is a general phenomenon in the industry. Thank you. And our last question, one moment please. Our last question will be from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. You may proceed. Okay. Thanks for getting me in. And I guess two things I wanted to just get some color on. One is when you talked about the upfront, which was $1 billion was a big increment, presumably that was kind of start to flow in the fourth quarter. So I'm just wondering if that in fact is happening or had we've had people exercise cancellation options or push their committed spends back to later in the year?
And then the other question I was wondering about was in terms of the strong growth you've had in accounts – active account hours this quarter bit of a uptick in the pace there. Was there anything kind of unusual that drove that? Or does that feel like just a manifestation of the broad trend and for that reason, maybe every reason to think it could continue in the near-term? Let's see. This is Anthony. I'll start with the active account question and then in terms of the up-fronts and how much of that is related to the Q4 maybe Steve can take that one. So active accounts, so active accounts were up $2.3 million net new ads and it was driven by the normal things. So we sell streaming players. The TV sales, The Roku TV program was a particularly big contributor for active accounts and also international was a good contributor as well. So I would say if you look at the kind of four parts of that grid, you've got streaming players TVs, and you got domestic and international TVs did well and maybe a little bit over indexing there, and international also did well.
We also saw retention rates. Accounts come in and out depending on if a consumer is using them, it's not like the SVOD service where they cancel it or they don't cancel it. In the case of our accounts, if they use the accountant stream then that's an active account and so – and there's always accounts that haven't streamed in the last 30 days, and so they drop out and sometimes they come back, usually they come back.
So, but anyway all of that adds up to a retention rate that has been doing well for us for a little bit of two quarters now. So I don't think there's anything specific that was particularly unusual in the quarter that was just going to be a onetime thing. I think those are – that was sort of our normal – normal way where things are going for us in terms of accounts.
And then Steve, I don't know if you have anything to add about the up-fronts? Yes. In terms of the up-fronts you're right, the up-front to mid- start in Q4 and they go through the end of Q3 the following year. So the deals that we're talking about and the $1 billion plus commits that we discussed on last earnings called start as of October. We haven't seen significant cancel rates. Just a reminder that unless an advertiser wants to specify in say Q4 that the upfront commitment level expand that 12-month period, and so they have flexibility to kind of think of what their plan is and change it around in general. But the main focus for the advertising fullback for us has been the ad scatter market that's where most of the advertisers are being conservative in the short-term and the upfront commits are still a positive indicator for the, the long-term leaning into Roku and streaming. Okay. Yes. So maybe another way, just to add on that basically yes, upfront [indiscernible] are becoming a bigger and bigger percent of our ad plan and they're getting bigger, but when you see such a large dramatic reduction in the scatter market it just – it definitely impacts growth. And when you touched scatter market, you're not talking kind of the smaller digital players as much as you are the big traditional advertisers we see on TV, is that what you're saying in terms of who's cutting back? Yes. [Indiscernible]. Go ahead Anthony. Scatter, when we say scatter we mean anything that's not in the upfront. So it's big TV advertisers, some of the budget's in the upfront but not all of it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Anthony Wood for any further remarks. I just want to thank our employees, customers, and partners for their focus and commitment in a very difficult operating environment. We expect to emerge from the current advertising downturn stronger and in a better position than ever. So thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Conrad Grodd, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's Fourth Quarter and Year ended 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; and Steve Louden, our CFO. Also on today's call for Q&A are Charlie Collier, President Roku Media; Mustafa Ozgen, President Devices; and Gidon Katz, President, Consumer Experience.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period for 2021.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. 2022 was a difficult year for investors and a difficult year for the advertising market. But despite this, Roku made excellent progress building on our platform, brand and industry leadership. Our scale and engagement are unmatched. We reached 70 million active accounts globally. And in the U.S., we are approaching half of broadband households using the Roku OS. Additionally, we are the #1 selling smart TV OS in the U.S., Canada and now Mexico. This past fall, we hired a proven leader, Charlie Collier as President, Roku Media. We also named Mustafa Ozgen, President of Devices; and Gidon Katz, President, Consumer Experience.
The Roku OS is not just an industry leader. It is the only operating system purpose-built for TV. With this differentiated foundation, we continue to innovate, including with our home screen, the first thing that 70 million households see when they turn on their TV. Our home scheme presents a significant opportunity to grow not only the engagement of our viewers, but also the monetization of our platform. The Roku Channel also benefits from the unique advantages created by our home screen and integration throughout our platform.
In Q4, the Roku Channel reached U.S. households with an estimated 100 million people and a streaming hours grew more than 85% year-over-year. This scale and engagement make the Roku Channel a partner of choice for publishers and content owners that want to maximize the value of their content.
Turning to monetization. The macro environment pressured and continues to pressure the ad market. As a result, Roku Platform revenue growth was lower than in prior years, but still grew with advertisers move to streaming and our scale increased by 10 million accounts. We grew full year platform revenue 20% year-over-year in 2022. We intend to continue to innovate with our platform and to grow scale, reach and monetization. Our business has inherent leverage and through a combination of growth and belt tightening, we expect expenses will moderate relative to revenue going forward. We will continuously lower the year-over-year OpEx growth rate as we progress through the year. We are driving to positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024 with continued EBITDA improvements after that.
With that, let me hand the call over to Steve. Thanks, Anthony. In Q4, we grew active accounts by 4.6 million, ending 2022 with 70 million. Full year net adds of 9.9 million were above both 2019 and 2021 levels, driven primarily by the Roku TV program in the U.S. and international markets. We are also growing engagement on our platform with 2022 streaming hours up 14.3 billion year-over-year to a record 87.4 billion hours. We grew Q4 streaming hours 23% year-over-year, while full year grew 19% year-over-year. Average streaming hours per active account per day in Q4 increased 6% year-over-year to 3.8 hours, which is roughly half of the average U.S. household TV viewing, leaving significant opportunity for growth.
As of the fourth quarter, we reorganized our reportable segments to better align with our expanded range of hardware devices and our organizational structure. We renamed the Player segment to the Devices segment, which now includes licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands in addition to sales of streaming players, audio products, smart home products; and starting in 2023, sales of Roku-branded TVs. Financial information, current and historical is recast based on these reorganized segments.
In Q4, total net revenue was flat year-over-year at $867 million. Platform revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $731 million. While Q4 platform revenue came in above our expectations, inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to pressure consumers and advertisers. Q4 devices revenue and player unit sales declined 18% and 19% year-over-year, respectively, reflecting a difficult consumer environment.
Q4 total gross margin was 42%. Q4 Platform gross margin of 56% was stable sequentially, but down 5 points year-over-year driven by weakness in the ad scatter market. Q4 devices margin was negative 32% which was down roughly 6 points year-over-year as we prioritized account acquisition and insulated consumers from higher prices caused by inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions that continue to elevate certain component costs.
The year-over-year compression in both platform and device margins resulted in a 4 percentage point difference between the year-over-year growth rates of total revenue and total gross profit. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negative $95 million, which was $40 million above our outlook. The better-than-expected performance was driven by our platform segment, along with improvements to our operating expense profile.
Please note that a onetime charge of $38 million, primarily related to workforce reductions was added back to adjusted EBITDA, and we ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion of cash.
Let me turn to our outlook for the first quarter. We anticipate total net revenue of $700 million, gross profit of $310 million with gross margin of 44% and adjusted EBITDA of negative $110 million. We expect the macro trends that have pressured consumer and advertiser spend to continue in the near term. For total net revenue, we anticipate normal seasonal decline of roughly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Within the Platform segment, we expect continued weakness in M&E spend in near term. This will result in a mix shift toward video advertising, compressing platform margins.
On the devices side, we expect margins to improve from negative 32 in Q4 to negative high single digits in Q4. And -- our outlook for this sequential improvement reflects a lighter retail promotional period and supply chain continuing to normalize.
To better manage through the challenging macro environment, we continue to improve our operations and operating expense profile. As a result, we expect to significantly lower our OpEx year-over-year growth over the course of the year. We anticipate Q1 OpEx year-over-year growth of approximately 40%, which is a 30-point sequential improvement. And by Q4, we expect further deceleration to single-digit year-over-year growth.
Given our ongoing work to carefully manage expenditures, we are committed to a path that delivers positive adjusted EBITDA and full year 2024. Looking ahead, our unmatched scale and engagement, along with our competitive advantages, gives us conviction in our ability to navigate and execute in challenging times.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Cory Carpenter of JPMorgan. Charlie, with this being your first earnings call, it'd be great to hear your key priorities and where you're most focused? And then maybe also on the other side, where you see the most opportunity to potentially make some changes. And I have a quick follow-up after as well. Thanks, Cory, for your question. I appreciate it. It's a pleasure to join these calls. I've admired Roku for a long time, most recently as the CEO of FOX Entertainment. And from that linear perch, I envied Roku’s unmatched scale, which is approaching nearly half the broadband households in the country. I admired Roku's unencumbered first-party data relationships and its differentiating innovation and technology. And of course, I could see first-hand from there, that in short order, most television and advertising would be strained.
So I'm happy to share now a few months into my role at Roku that Roku's differentiators are actually even more compelling, particularly as we approach the day very soon where all video buying and planning will be done streaming the first.
So to speak to our priorities, Cory, Roku Media's focus is to build on top of one of the greatest platforms in the world, one of the greatest modern media and entertainment businesses in the world. And it's a lofty goal that Anthony and I set together, and this is the time in the industry's history to make it happen.
One of the most exciting things about Roku is that it's a platform and not a streaming app. And it's because Roku's platform that viewers begin far earlier with Roku than they do with most conventional streamers. Right when the viewer turns on a Roku TV, we're there, helping guide viewers through their streaming journey and helping build viewer engagement for our partners.
So you asked about Roku Media's focus, Cory. After dozens of meetings in New York and Chicago at CES and in L.A. and then listening to customer needs as well as in conversations with the remarkably talented Roku team we have three early areas of focus.
For one, we're focused on a media world where streaming first media buying and planning is coming, and that's coming faster than most realized. Two, we're adding breadth and depth to our partner relationships, including with third-party DSPs, where we're already more actively meeting marketers and partners where they transact programmatically and -- and it doesn't stop there. It's also with retail media networks like in our Walmart Connect shoppable partnership, which we announced last year. And then three, we're focused on adding a distinct entertainment overlay on top of the terrific Roku platform. So I'll close by saying there's an emerging appreciation that Roku is not just another player in the streaming wars but that the streaming wars are actually being fought on the Roku platform, and that is a tremendous advantage for all of us. And just as a follow-up, so you mentioned this in the letter and you mentioned it just now as well, just developing more relationships with third-party platforms on the programmatic side. Could you just expand a bit on your philosophy there and how you think about the pros and cons of potentially opening it up more? Sure. Thanks, Cory. Look, we have many broad and successful relationships that we're fortifying. So generally speaking, we're developing relationships with all sorts of third-party platforms from retail media to third-party DSTs. My overall goal is to make sure basically that every marketer feels the impact of Roku inventory and data, so we're making it easier for marketers to accelerate through this evolution. .
The philosophy is to meet marketers where they're currently transacting programmatically, to both increased demand and simply breadth in the relationships for Roku in the marketplace. We think there is a day coming soon when all media plans begin with streaming. And while Roku will remain the best place to buy and optimize Roku and its many special opportunities, again, we're going to meet our partners and marketers where they currently wish to transact. So our first party and ACR data along with our specialized ad products like the Roku Brand Studio, those will continue to be accessible only on their Roku advertising platform.
So broadly, it's not just ESPs, we have partnerships with Walmart Connect, DoorDash, Kroger and many more. So these are early days and we'll adapt to the market as we see fit. Our next question will be coming from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. Maybe first, I was just wondering if you could discuss the net adds and if there was a significant contribution from your international expansion. Just as we think about net adds going forward, trying to get a better sense of the domestic versus the international piece? And then related to that, 1 of the things we like to do is subtract streaming hours growth from platform revenue growth as kind of a proxy for how monetization is trending. Looks like it was down about 19% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. And I think your guidance implies that, that doesn't really improve or maybe even gets a bit worse in the first quarter. So I was just wondering if that's maybe more of the international mix shift and its impact on ARPU? Or if it just reflects that the macro is kind of still going to be challenged as we get into Q1. I'll take the first question and then Steve can take your second question. So yes, we had -- I mean, we had a great year last year in active accounts, adding almost 10 million new net adds, new active accounts to land the year at 70 million active accounts. And a big picture, why is that happening? Well, it's because streaming is really actually super popular right now. And Roku is the leading streaming platform.
So that's obviously helping. We have a great brand. We’re focused on building products that are super delightful, incredibly simple and unmatched value. And that generates a lot of word of mouth for our products. So there was a report recently by Morning Consult saying that Roku is the fastest-growing brand among Gen Zs, which is cool. So the brand is great. The product is great. People love streaming. So there's just a lot of things that I think that are helping us.
In terms of your question about where are those accounts coming from, in terms of devices, we sell streaming players and we have the Roku TV program, both are super successful. As time has progressed, the Roku TV program is becoming increasingly important active accounts and is now the majority of new active accounts. And then domestic versus international, both sources of accounts are important for us. We're doing well internationally. But of course, we're doing well in the U.S. as well. I mean we're the U.S. We're the #1 streaming platform in the U.S. We had I think it was 38% market share in Q4, which is the higher market share than Samsung and LG combined for TV operating systems. And you compare that to Amazon and Google, they were both single-digit market share.
So that's kind of the big picture. I don't know, Steve, if you want to take the second question? Yes. In terms of the second question on ARPU. Certainly, there is a difference in ARPU from the U.S. to international. The U.S. market is by far the part of this along in that shift to streaming, even though it's still early days even in the U.S. And so the global ARPU that you see on the statements is really driven by the U.S. because many of our markets Internationally, we're still focusing on driving scale and engagement, although we have notably in 2022, started to have additional markets that are monetizing. Mexico is a good case example where we've built up great scale, great engagement. And in 2022, we introduced the Roku Channel. And also, we started lighting up our ad business -- our ad sales efforts there. And so there is great progress on there on the ARPU side, but by its nature, it is at a much lower ARPU.
But when we look at the trend sequentially, really, the story is around the macroeconomic environment. And some of the pressures on consumer spending and also the advertising business hitting the ARPU side of things. So that's really the story here, although the U.S. international mix does come into play. But we've had that mix coming into play in subsequent, or in prior periods and the ARPU has still gone up until we had the scatter market pullback that we saw starting in mid-2022. And our next question will be coming from Laura Martin of Needham. Hey, Anthony, one for you because it's going to be mean. I don't want to throw your guys out of the bus. So you just went into competition with your hardware manufacturers. And so what I want to know is, a, revenue upside from that because you said in your statement that you can do things when you own your own television that you can't do when you're licensing the OS to others. I'd like to understand what those upsides are. And secondly, I'd like to better understand, Anthony, how hard is it for some of those people you are currently the OS for to exit you and substitute TiVo or another independent operating system, which is one of the field they thought they got with Roku. Is that hard? Is it costly? Does it take a long time? So I'm looking at the monetary impact of you now competing with your licensees. Thanks for the question. So let's see. So first party the Roku-branded TVs. I think -- if I think about kind of the big picture here. So first of all, I just mentioned the majority of our account growth is coming by -- is coming from our Roku TV program. So it's a super successful program it's the Roku TV program has made us the #1 TV OS in the U.S. In Q4, like I said, 38% share bigger than Samsung and LG combined. You compare that to Google and Amazon, which have single-digit shares. Where just Roku is now the #1 TV OS in Canada in Q4, recently became the #1 TV OS in Mexico with about 30% share in Q4.
So the program is doing great. In terms of our Roku-branded TVs. I'll turn it over to Mustafa who's on the call, Mustafa runs our device business and including the Roku program. But we feel pretty strongly that the Roku TV program is the first -- the Roku-branded portion of the program, which we just launched is additive to our overall business, and it will help us drive innovation as well as moving into higher end market segments. And so I don't -- so overall, it's good.
And then before I turn it over to Mustafa in terms of your question about how hard is it for OEM to switch to another TV OS. I mean, well, it's very difficult, I would say, impossible to build a new franchise in TV OS at this point. I mean the amount of scale that you need. So you mentioned TVOD, for example. I mean, that's -- that's not a significant player right now in TVOD and it's hard for me to imagine that a new entrant would be able to gain the necessary scale and technology and just size of the of everything that's needed to be in that business would be quite difficult. And then the big factor, of course, is the Roku brand.
I mean we've been working on building our streaming brand for years, and it's a great brand people love it. People go to a large number of our sales for devices don't actually create new accounts. They go into existing households that are rough households, and they want another Roku device. So there's a lot of barriers to entry at this point. So with that, let me turn it over to Mustafa to talk more about the Roku branded TV program. Yes, sure. Not to summarize Anthony. Overall, the world TVs will complement their successful Roku TV licensing program. and it will help us drive further innovation for both Roku and our also licensing partners and ultimately for the consumers. That's what we're really after. We want to build products that are great for the consumers. And historically, Roku has focused on TV software and some portion of the TV hardware.
In terms of TV software, we not only provide the purpose-built operating system, but we actually provide the complete software that runs inside the TV, along with some hardware design to help reduce the cost. With local brand TVs, we expand our scope to complete hardware -- and we have a chance now to innovate on the complete hardware side, including display and other areas of the TV, along with our software innovations, and we'll have a chance to really tightly combine these innovations together to offer even better TVs to the consumers. So we believe Roku Brand TVs will be edited to our overall product offering for consumers. They will enable us to further grow our leadership position in the market. They will allow us to expand into the higher-end spectrum of the performance TVs which are occupied by a few brands today. So this will allow us and go licensing partners to really capture some market share in the higher-end segment. So overall, we are excited to bring the first generation TVs to the consumers in the spring. This is Anthony again. I guess I would just add that if you look at this -- if you look at licensing programs in other -- the other companies have in adjacent industries and compare that to Roku TV, I mean it's very common for a program to have both first-party and third-party devices in the program. If you look at, like, say, Android phones, for example, Google makes the Pixel Phone or if you look at Windows operating system, Microsoft makes the surface line of laptops and tablets. And brands and companies do this because it gives our consumers more choice. And it really helps drive innovation as you understand better the integration of the hardware and the software, and that results in more innovations and those innovations roll out to licensing partners as well. The next question I have is from Thomas Forte of D.A. Davison. So first, at a high level from a P&L standpoint, can you explain the differences in sales and margins for Smart TVs sold with Roku's operating system and a Roku branded Smart TV. And then second, as you lower your OpEx growth rate, can you talk about your investment sending priorities, including in content, hardware and international expansion. Steve can take the first question about the P&L and then I can talk about investment priorities after that. Yes. Tom, in terms of the how the P&L treatment works for the Roku TV program. Currently, we -- with our licensed TV program, obviously, our partners are selling the TVs themselves. And so no revenue or COGS from that sale is on the P&L. There is a small amount of TV licensing OS licensing revenue on the P&L that's now in the Devices segment, but that's really inconsequential. And so really what -- when you think of the broken branded TVs, what you'll think of is they'll get treated similarly to the players. So you'll have revenue you potentially have some contra-revenue there. You'll have the COGS and the gross profit and then associated expenses with that program in OpEx as well. And so it will be very much like the players. That's part of the reason that we changed the Player segment named to Devices, and then we align some other small things to be consistent with the organization change we made when we added the three presidents and Mustafa runs the broader devices universe. Thomas, so in terms of areas of investment, I'll provide some color on that. And then when one of the ones you asked about was content spending, and I'll turn that one over to Charlie. So the here is -- some of the key areas we're investing in, obviously, the Roku TV program super successful for us, and we continue to push that forward, including with Roku-branded TVs, which we just talked about. The ad platform is an important asset of ours, our streaming ad platform. And there's different areas we're investing there. One, I guess, just one I might call out and highlight is improving integration of ads and promotions throughout our home screen and our home screen experience. which is a big area of differentiation for us, which is 70 million households starting there TV journey every day when they watch TV by turning on their Roku TV and starting at our home screen, there's lots of opportunity for things that we can do there and maybe at some point, Gidon will get a chance to talk about that. So that's the best area for us. Related to that is the customer experience team. So just improving our customer experience -- I mean, we have a world-class, obviously, customer experience has been -- it's one of the reasons we've been so successful. It's incredibly simple. It's easy as compelling entertaining -- but there's still ways we can make it better and in ways that increase engagement, reduce churn, increase monetization.
So that's a big area of focus for us. Internationally, you mentioned international is still an area that we're focused on. If I think about international, there's expanding into new regions, but there's also going deeper into the regions that we're in, which is a big focus for us this year, especially. We're doing -- we've made a lot of progress. We're now the #1 CBS in Canada and Mexico. But we're in other markets, and we're continuing to grow in those markets. In fact, we're growing share in every market that we currently participate in internationally. So that's an area for us. And then content -- and I guess I'll let Charlie talked about content. Well, thank you. To be clear, the foundation of our content spend will continue to be rev share and fixed licensing. But I'd love to talk about Roku originals for a second because they create content exclusivity that viewers seek and advertisers value. Actually, just this weekend, we launched a show called Meet Me in Paris, which was produced by Reese Witherspoon and Zoë Saldaña and it premiered so strongly this weekend. It's really charming first of its kind reality, rom-com, and we're proud of it. because not only is it a good creative swing, but it's already the #1 reality Premier on the Roku Channel, and that's original or library. And you've probably heard us mention before our recent feature film were the weird Allegiance its story. It had the most reach of any on-demand program in the history of the Roku Channel. So just as Roku products are heralded for offering award-winning quality. Roku Originals are following cut -- we won the Critic's Choice Award a few weeks back for the best movie made for television, and we're pleased to have nominations from industry yields like the writers Gilt, producers killed and the director skills. And again, while I say the foundation of our content spend going to be rev share and fixed license, we'll grow our investments in Roku Originals to create exclusivity for users and advertisers. Actually, Anthony mentioned Gidon, one of the major factors in the Roku Channel success to date has been our ability to use our UI to drive engagement. Gidon, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Yes. Thanks, Charlie. As you mentioned already, our users are -- they need more and more help finding content, whether they're looking for that Roku original, the football game is about the start or the news. And the growth of streaming has driven a proliferation of entertainment choices on the platform. And as the largest platform with almost half the broadband homes in the United States, we have a duty to try and make it as easy as possible for them to find the content they really want to watch. But research has shown that streaming viewers in today are taking 52% longer to decide what to watch than they did a couple of years ago. So to really help our customers and drive engagement, we've been investing in ways to help consumers navigate across our platform. And the Roku Channel and that team has really benefited from many of these unique integrations by being the anchor tenant by being the first partner to really engage with them, and our ability to surface content viewers throughout our UI in a way that's authentic organic and delightful has really contributed to the Roku Channel growing 85% year-on-year, growing fastly, faster than the rest of the platform. This was driven in 2002 by 3 new rows that we added to the home screen menu. The first was Live TV that helped people jump space quickly into live content. The second was What to Watch, a discovery zone that help people find new content to watch. And the third was a Sport Zone. We complemented these as well with content-first experiences like you saw with the House of Dragon or for WEIRD.
And we saw that by bringing that content closer to the consumer and by making it easier for them to find new great content, the usage of these menus has accelerated -- and in fact, if you look at today, the home screen menu is, again, growing twice as fast as the rest of the platform. And it's helping the of channel driving the Roku Channel to be the largest fast service by reach and engagement on our service. So excited that we've started this journey and looking forward to accelerating it this year. And our next question is coming from Tim Nollen of Macquarie. I wanted to go back to the comments you've made about using more third-party platforms. You acquired -- what was it 3 years ago, maybe 4 years ago, you acquired one of the largest at the time independent DSPs dataxu, which we thought at the time is going to be about automating a lot of the ad deliveries. That hasn't quite happened for reasons that I think I understand the way the market works. But I wonder now if you're doing something differently with OneView, formerly dataxu or -- and/or if you're going to be opening up more to other DSPs to be buying onto your platform? I'll take that. And Charlie, I'm not sure if Charlie you have anything to add, but if he does, he can jump in. So Roku has been building our ad platform out through a combination of internal organic efforts and acquisitions for several years now. We did acquire data, but we also built a lot of our own technology the ad platform that we built is world class. It's a great asset for us. It's used every day to deliver lots and lots of ads. It helps with measurement, it helps with targeting. It takes advantage of all the first-party data we have, our ACR data, our viewing data, integrates with other data sources like our cover shopping program. So it's a big asset and this -- and it helps marketers deliver very effective and targeted ads on our platform. We think it's probably the best streaming ad platform in existence. So it still continues to be a focus for us. We have, for a long time, worked with third-party DSPs in various capacities, but there's opportunity to expand our relationships, and that's what we're looking at in terms of -- there's opportunities to expand relationships in ways that will increase demand. And so that's what we're looking at. So I don't know, Charlie, do you want to Sure. Yes. Well, and it is about relationship expansion. It's not just DSPs. We have partnerships with Walmart Connect. Last week, we announced a terrific DoorDash and Wendy's partnership. And to Anthony's point, the tech stack, the world-class tech stack that makes this all possible is a result of some of the some of the parts of your question you put together there, Tim. So for example, with DoorDash, it's a great example of what TV streaming in the Roku platform can do. It's a first of its kind partnership that empowers DoorDash merchants to place unique click-to-order offers within their Roku ad. So picture of your home, watching a movie on Roku and you're hungry and you see an ad from DoorDash and Wendy's and you click on it and while you're watching your movie, we prove that we're full funnel and your food and you get your food as delivered and get your dinner and a movie. So for the first time, restaurant advertisers can partner with DoorDash and Roku to attribute target, measure TV streaming ads on Roku.
It's truly accountable media. It's differentiating media and it's lower funnel attribution, which Roku is first to market with, again, truly accountable. So I think here, Roku is taking a lead because of its tech stack and literally teaching new consumer behavior in this case, how to interact with the TV screen. And our next question is coming from Shweta Khajuria of Evercore. I guess I have a follow-up on the Roku-branded TVs. Congrats on launching those TVs in the line. the TV line. But I guess the question is, how should we think about the gross margin contribution from Roku-branded TVs versus, let's say, your player segment gross margins historically pre-COVID just for our modeling purposes? And then second is on Steve, have you -- has the guidance philosophy changed over the past couple of quarters, call it, in terms of how you've delivered through the quarters and how you've guided. In terms of Roku branded TVs, I mean we haven't disclosed anything about gross margins. But just in general, our device business is focused on customer acquisition. So it's not focused on gross profit from hardware. Our monetization obviously comes from our service and ad business, content distribution, which obviously is a great business for us. So that philosophy applies to TVs as well. And like I said, another big focus on the Roku -- I'm sorry, on the branded TV program is just driving innovation as well as moving a little bit more upmarket in the TV space. And then in terms of guidance, Steve, you want to talk about the outlook? Sure. Hey, Shweta, thanks for the question. Yes. I wouldn't say that our guidance philosophy has changed over the last couple of quarters. I think what's changed since Q2 of last year is just the level of uncertainty in the macro environment, and obviously, the impact that has on consumers as well as the advertising market, which, in particular, is obviously a large portion of our monetization. And so I think like a lot of companies, what you see over our approach to outlook and whether we provide full year outlook or just the near quarter and how we think about the color around that, it's really more of a factor around the macroeconomic environment and how we're trying to find their way through the amount of certainty and then looking at what levers that we have better control over and which levers we don't in terms of the advertising market spend which is largely macro-driven and vertical driven versus things that we can control better, which is what we've done with our operations and our operating expense base and corralling the year-over-year growth rate on stuff like that. So I think that's really how we look at it, and it's really driven by how we see the business and the industry timing given what's out in the broader world. Okay, Steve. If I could follow up, what kind of ad demand trends have you seen, whether it is sequentially from, call it, Q4 or December up until now mid-February and/or year-over-year, if you could please comment on that? And that's it for me. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks, Steve. Yes. This is Anthony. I'll kick that off and then turn it over to Charlie. I think, again, big picture, streaming is popular. Viewers are switching to streaming. Advertisers are moving to streaming. Huge opportunity in terms of our platform, scale and engagement with 70 million active accounts and growing. Like I said before, the #1 streaming platform by our streams in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. I mean, if you look at traditional TV in Q4, hours were down 5% year-over-year, but on our platform, hours grew 23%. And I think that reflects the power of our platform, but also the fact that the industry is moving to streaming and continue moving to streaming. Still got a long ways to go, but it's definitely in process. Roku Channel hours alone in Q4 grew 85% year-over-year, an incredible amount. So I think if we think about the big picture in advertising, there's macroeconomic -- there's macro issues. But we are continuing to build out a platform that’s world class platform for advertising and streaming and there’s a lot of opportunity ahead. But Charlie can probably give you a lot more color on the specifics of our ad business. Sure, thanks. The ad market, that was pretty well reported in fourth quarter. But even still Roku outperformed overall ad and certainly traditional TV ad spending. So Roku continues to take share. Ad spend among some verticals is improving in first quarter which we are so pleased with the momentum, including restaurants, travel, CPG, health and wellness and others, as you know, remain a little muted tech financial services and certainly, M&E, which is playing out pretty publicly. But we're creating new ad products and opportunities and building relationships, as I mentioned, to address all markets and diversify demand and as I mentioned a moment ago, with our shoppable ads both with Walmart last year and the one we announced last week, there are so many great examples of things Roku is doing that so many other platforms simply can't. So that's how I look at the markets right now. And our next question is coming from Matthew Thornton of Truist. Maybe one and then a follow-up, if I could. On video advertising, Anthony, you guys are talking about the north of $1 billion in upfront commitments. Is that still the right number to think about as we think about 4Q '22 through 3Q '23? Is that still the right number? Is there any cancellation activity that we need to think about, delays that we need to think about? I guess, just any updated color there would be helpful. And then just following up on a prior question around branded TV. It sounds like the strategy there will be very similar and that's to operate probably close to breakeven to drive customer acquisition. I guess the follow-on there is there any start-up costs that we need to think about in the margins as we start ramping them in '23. I'll turn over to Charlie. But before I do that, I would just say we had a great upfront last year, and our upfronts have been growing. If you look back historically, our fronts have gotten bigger every year. And I expect that to continue because the advertising -- TV advertising business is moving to streaming. There's, I don't know if it's a $60 billion a year spent on TV advertising. A lot of that, most of that is still hasn’t moved the streaming, but it is improving the streaming. And that's naturally going to transition the upfront to being a streaming-first event, and it's going to grow our business each upfront. So that's kind of the big picture. But Charlie, do you want to talk about our…? Sure. It's a good question, Matt. We're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. As you noted, it's fourth quarter through third. So we're only about a quarter into the upfront. But 1 way to think about Roku differently perhaps is that our upfront don't front-load in fourth quarter the way traditional networks do, just given the timing of new fall premieres and how heavily others rely on fourth quarter for sports. So the scatter market has been challenged, but we're also seeing some verticals, as I just mentioned, with some momentum and side of life. So that's the best way to think about it. One thing I'll say as it attributes to this team, Roku has only been in the upfront market for less than 5 years versus others who have been in it for 50-plus years. So we're excited about the runway ahead and the upfront market. And I do believe there's a world where all media plans are going to start with streaming, and that day is coming soon, and it will favor Roku and its unique scale and assets. In terms of your -- Matt, you asked about branded TVs and anything specific in terms of the startup costs, et cetera. I mean, I don't think we have anything really to add there. So I mean, all of our expenses are in our outlook. The next question is coming from Nicolas Zangler of Stephens. Focusing on the near-term weakness that we're hearing about in M&E, obviously, many streaming services have pivoted as of late to adopt an EVOD offering. So still very highly incentivized to win viewership hours now as opposed to just subscription count. So just given this dynamic, do you anticipate M&E spend to strengthen meaningfully at some point in the midterm? Just as viewership hours become more of a priority? Just how would you frame up maybe this I guess, this near-term weakness in M&E versus your longer-term outlook? Nick, this is Anthony. I'll kick us off and then turn that over to Charlie. But yes, you're right. We think that I mean to answer your question specifically over the not-too-distant future term. Streaming services are going to be focused increasingly on engagement, so they can drive advertising revenue. So if you -- just to take a step back, think about our business, I mean, advertising is important to Roku, but advertising is important to our streaming partners as well, streaming service partners. I mean they -- almost all of them have big and growing ad businesses. And the pressure we're seeing in the ad market is affecting them, just like it's affecting us, and that's causing them to pull back on M&E spend in the short term. But we know that M&E on Roku is super effective and a great way to spend marketing dollars. And the size of the -- of our platform is unmatched. The scale and engagement on our platform is huge. And so I do think there's -- I'm bullish long term and midterm on M&E. But Charlie, do you want to maybe take that? Yes. Thanks, Nick. I think you nailed it in your question. Longer term, as the ad industry recovers, we absolutely believe that M&E companies will shift their focus toward engagement because they'll need to deliver for their own advertisers. So I know first-hand from my lab job, the importance and magnitude of Roku's impact on every streamers engagement metrics. So Roku's M&E tools are terrific for that goal for growing engagement. I'll emphasize that our media literally think about it on the Roku media platform. It is the closest media to the viewing decision that the viewer makes, and we're doing this scale. Again, 70 million active accounts approaching nearly of all streaming households, we believe that every M&E dollar spent on Roku is a highly effective dollar and particularly in the context that you shared in your question, Nick.
So look, we collaborate closely with streaming services to create bespoke campaigns for them and prove that our media is accountable. And one thing that's great about the Roku media platform is that we can test the effectiveness of ads, and we did this in fact, with our own movie, WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story, I mentioned. And we did so using a holdout group. And on the on-platform media associated with weird, we drove more than 60% lift in unique viewers versus the old out group. So we even make our own media accountable. It's pretty great. And one of the reasons the industry respects Roku so much. And then there are things like Roku Pay, which enables easy one-click sign up. It's another valuable tool to offer our content partners. That's less on the engagement side, but obviously, in the subscription side. And then premium video streaming services experience higher retention using Roku Pay than they do on other third-party billing platforms. That was cited from a recent study by Antenna. So Again, you're right, the movement toward engagement, flatters Roku and moves Roku partner's priority list, particularly in this world where they have to be so focused on effectiveness and efficiency. Great. No, that's great color. Just one quick follow-up on that. There is one very, very large streaming service that seemingly doesn't really partake in some of these engagement strategies. And it's not just on Roku, it's under the other streaming service as well. Just I don't know if you have any thoughts there on whether you would expect like the full market to engage in including just the absolute largest streaming services as well. Well, look, you nailed it in your question, there's going to be a shift toward not just acquisition, but engagement. And when you build engagement, you need to build impressions and you need people to watch the programming. And again, Roku is uniquely positioned to be right there for the viewer at the moment of decision and will help will help drive partners' businesses. That's how we think of every large streaming service as our partner, and we help them build engagement. This is an -- this is Anthony. I mean I would just I agree with all that. We have -- we believe we can help all our streaming partners on a very positive ROI basis, build engagement, but we don't have any insight or can't comment on what any particular company might or might not do in the future. And our next question will be coming from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. First, Anthony and/or Charlie, you guys have made content acquisitions in the past, I mean most notably, Quibi. I'm curious how you would think about putting capital to work in acquiring a library of content or more content is something bigger going forward as opposed to what we've seen with some of your originals and licensing. So how are you thinking about potentially acquiring something bigger?
And then second for Steve, in the fourth quarter, you materially outperformed your guidance. I'm hoping maybe you could help us understand what changed that led you to kind of come in so far ahead on the top line. And as we look at your guidance for the first quarter, it can't help us think that we should probably be thinking it could come in a lot higher just like it did last quarter. Why wouldn't we think you could beat that number by 8% since you just did that in this past quarter? Mike, I'll let Charlie take the content acquisition question. But I mean just at a high level, I would say that we have done acquisitions in the past. We're very cautious about doing acquisitions. We have a high bar -- we do spend a lot of money on content, primarily to licensing and rev share, but also originals. And so we're always looking at ways to spend that money most effectively. But I don't think we have a particular strategy around acquisitions. I don't know, Charlie, do you want to add anything? Well, I think you're right. The foundation -- the base of our content spend will continue to be rev share and licensing. But you're right, those City acquisition -- those Quibi shows continue to perform well, and we renewed Kevin Hart series and he's coming back soon. And then we acquired a content library in This Old House. And I look at our commitment for the advertising community to genres like food and home and having This Old House library for us globally has been a really has been accretive and really creatively has led to some really interesting relationships. So I think we'll do so opportunistically and with discipline. But I like very much the fact, for instance, on weird that we own all the rights globally, and it's been a calling card, both for the creative community and for the advertising community because they realize we're going to build high-class distinct product for them at the right cost. Yes. And on your second question in Q4, I mean, we're -- we're pleased with the performance in the quarter against a pretty difficult consumer and ad market backdrop. Just to give you an idea, in our shareholder letter, we talked about just the trends in the U.S. ad market and how they weakened through the quarter. So the U.S. ad market was down 12% year-over-year in December. That's after a decreased 2% and decrease 6% in October and November. So it just shows you the challenge of the trends. And when we're giving the outlook, our expectation is to try to give our best estimate at that time. But certainly, with the high level of uncertainty and all the macroeconomic pressures that are both hitting consumers directly and then into the ad market itself based on those stats, it's really challenging to get a handle on that. So again, we're pleased with the results relative to our initial expectations captured in outlook. But I wouldn't say back to that other question around has our guidance philosophy changed, it hasn't. And we're kind of making a point in time call based on the imperfect information we have. And so that's how we approached it in Q4, and that's how we're approaching to our Q1 outlook as well. So Steve in that, are you saying that when you gave the guide in November, you thought that ads were going to decelerate like 25% in December? Or I'm just trying to understand because it's a big difference, right? I mean you talked about in letter to your point, that the trends did decelerate in December and yet you still came in meaningfully ahead. And now we're looking at the first quarter and you're guiding revenue to go backward by $34 million. I'm just trying to get a handle on it because the guide relative to we're forecasting has proven to be a bit tricky. Yes. I think -- I mean, there's a couple of different things and kind of Charlie mentioned this in some of the -- included in the letter in the prepared remarks as well as we were concerned, and you saw this in our language for the Q4 guide, we were concerned with how the holiday season will both on the consumer side of things as well in the ad market. And so we were we were hearing some concerns out there from a lot of different parts of the ecosystem. And so that was reflected in our view that it was going to be a difficult holiday season, which overall for a lot of companies, it was. For us, we had some bright spots around how TV is performed and then the ad business was better than we hoped it would be. So that's good, even though the market was down overall year-over-year. When you look into Q1, you see some bright spots in terms of certain verticals that seem to be stabilizing or potentially on a bit of a green shoot type uptick, but then you also have other verticals that remain pressured. So that's kind of the challenge we have. And part of our outlook reflects the fact that -- we do have a strong M&E business in general, and that's also a high-margin business. And so that's reflected both in the top line viewpoint as well as how that translates down into gross profit in and the EBITDA look as well. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'm going to turn the call back over to Anthony for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I also want to thank our employees, customers and partners for their focus and commitment. Thank you all for joining today's conference call. You may disconnect, and everyone, have a great evening.","today's Q4 Roku Earnings call is being recorded . we'll make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events, such as our financial outlook, future market conditions and our expectations . unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our shareholder letter .",1.0

Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. Roku delivered solid first quarter results in a challenging economic environment. We grew both our active accounts and streaming hours. Roku’s TV operating system was once again the number one selling TV OS in the U.S., achieving a record high TV unit share of 43%, which is more than the next three operating systems combined. We achieved share gains across the full range of TV screen sizes, particularly in the larger screen segment.
In March, we launched the first ever Roku branded TVs exclusively at Best Buy and they are receiving great reviews. Consumers now spend more TV time streaming than watching cable, and all major media companies have shifted focus to streaming. With the amount of entertainment available on TV streaming continuing to grow, consumers are spending more and more time looking for something to watch across our platform. Streaming services and brand advertisers want to reach these viewers increasingly before the viewer decides what to watch.
We're leaning into our unique role as the number one TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada and Mexico to simultaneously benefit consumers, content partners, and advertisers, while growing monetization opportunities. You can see this with features like our sports experience, live TV guide, and continue watching.
We will continue to expand existing content discovery experiences and build new ones that entertain and informs viewers and help them discover what to watch next. These experiences are increasingly creating opportunities for brand advertising, M&E promotion, and integration with Roku's owned and operated content and services.
As we noted in our letter, streaming hours that originated from our home screen menu doubled year-over-year. I am more excited than ever about the future of Roku's business. We are working to create new areas of customer engagement and monetization, as well as improve operational efficiencies. We are committed to delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 with continued improvements after that.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve to discuss our results. Thanks, Anthony. We ended the quarter with 71.6 million active accounts globally. Sequential net adds of 1.6 million were above net adds in Q1 2022. Overall, smart TV unit sales in the U.S. were up in Q1, driven in part by lower TV panel prices and freight costs. Roku player unit sales remained above pre-COVID levels, and the average selling price was relatively flat year-over-year.
Roku users streamed 25.1 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Average streaming hours per active account per day reached a record high of 3.9 hours, which is roughly half of the average U.S. household TV viewing, leaving significant opportunity for future growth.
In Q1, total net revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $741 million. Platform revenue was down 1% year-over-year to $635 million. While ad spend on the Roku platform in verticals, including financial services and media and entertainment remained pressured, verticals such as travel and health and wellness improved. Q1 devices revenue increased 18% year-over-year driven by the launch of our Roku branded TVs, smart home products and the recognition of a one-time catch up of $10 million related to a licensing arrangement with the service operator.
In Q1, gross profit declined 7% year-over-year to $338 million. Platform gross margin was 53%, which was down 3 points sequentially. This reflects weakness in the ad scatter market along with a greater mix away from M&E in Q1 2023 compared to a year ago period. Device margin was 3%, which benefited from a one-time $10 million service operator licensing catch-up previously mentioned.
Excluding this one-time item, devices margin would have been negative 6%, a 9 point improvement from a year ago period, driven by normalizing supply chains. The 8 percentage point difference between the year-over-year growth rates of total net revenue and total gross profit was caused by year-over-year compression of platform margins along with a lower portion of platform revenue within total net revenue.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was negative $69 million, which was $41 million above our outlook. The better than expected performance was driven by our platform segment, recognition of the one-time catch-up in devices revenue, and improvements in our operating expense profile. Please note that a one-time charge of $31 million primarily related to workforce reductions and real estate impairments have been excluded from adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Now looking to the second quarter, we anticipate that total net revenue of $770 million, up 1% year-over-year, gross profit of $335 million, with a gross margin of 44% and adjusted EBITDA of negative $75 million. We continue to expect the macro trends that have pressured consumer and advertiser spend to remain throughout 2023. Accordingly, we expect the advertising market in Q2 to look much the same as it did in Q1. With ad spend in certain verticals improving, such as travel and health and wellness, while other verticals remain pressured such as M&E and financial services.
For total net revenue, we anticipate a sequential increase of roughly 4%, in line with Q2 2022. Within the platform segment, we expect continued pressure on M&E spend in the near-term. This will result in platform margin remaining at Q1 2023 level. On the devices side, we expect margins to improve from negative 20% in Q2 last year to negative mid-teens.
Our outlook for this year-over-year improvement reflects supply chains continuing to normalize. We are executing against our plan to focus investments on high priority projects, while slowing year-over-year OpEx growth. We anticipate Q2 OpEx year-over-year growth in the mid-teens, a nearly 30-point sequential improvement, and we continue to expect further deceleration to single digits year-over-year growth by Q4.
Given our ongoing work to improve operational efficiencies and reaccelerate revenue growth, we remain committed to delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for the questions. I had one on profit and one on revenue. On profit, just given the uncertainty in the macro environment that you guys discussed, what gives you the confidence in your path to profitability in 2024? And what are some of the steps that you may still need to take to get there? And then on revenue, in the letter you mentioned “creating new monetization opportunities to reaccelerate revenue growth”. Hoping you could expand a bit on some of the initiatives that you think could be most impactful, especially on the programmatic side? Thank you. Hey, Corey. Thanks. This is Anthony. So I'd start by just saying we had a solid Q1 in both active accounts and streaming hours. We're executing on our plan to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA for 2024, both through growth of revenue and also operating system.
Steve can talk a little bit more about the details on that. Yeah. Hi, Cory. Yes. So we're – again, as we said, we're continuing to take adjustments to both the operation that we've got and the overall OpEx space, which is allowing us to manage through these challenging macro environment that we're facing. We expected OpEx tightening that we've been doing to continue to improve the year-over-year OpEx growth rates.
As part of the outlook, in Q2, we talked about year-over-year OpEx growth in the mid-teens, that's a 30-point sequential improvement. We saw similar improvement on the year-over-year growth rate from Q4 to Q1 as well, as you might have noticed before. And then, we were sort of reaffirming that single-digit OpEx year-over-year growth by Q4. So given all the work we're doing, we remain committed to that path to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024. All right. And this is Anthony again. We're in a great position with our unmatched scale and engagement. And we are working on new monetization opportunities as well that will be accelerating revenue growth as the ad market recovers. And maybe to just talk a little bit more about some of those monetization opportunities, let me turn it over to Charlie and then Gidon to add to that. Great. Well, thanks for the question, Cory. This is Charlie. I think to go right at your question about DSPs, I always start by noting that the best place to buy Roku is still Roku. From our first-party data to original content and UI integrations, we're so focused on helping clients maximize Roku and so many partners across the industry are enjoying those results. Now, inherent in your question, obviously, it remains true that incremental demand sources are a focus of ours. And of course, managing third-party relationships toward that incremental demand and incremental revenue has been a priority of mine from day one.
So to take best advantage, I have been moving us toward third parties and B2B partnerships of all kinds that help us meet partners where they transact and doing that, not just DSPs by the way, but retailers, distributors of all kinds. So we're focused on demand diversification. I see an opportunity to tap incremental demand at Roku, while preserving our overall Roku first strategies. And this should ensure two things. So one, the ongoing value of our data in specialized ad units and then, really a focus on Roku's overall market distinction.
We spend a lot of time talking about the leverage of our unmatched scale and innovation and creating new monetization opportunities. And so, as you asked, we are working with more third-party DSPs to tap into that incremental demand. Thanks Charlie. Cory, thanks for the question. At Roku, we've obviously had two key revenue streams: firstly, subscription; and then secondly, advertising. Well, our goal when we think about those revenue streams and about creating new monetization opportunities is to help consumers discover great content, help content partners engage with consumers, and help advertisers organically and authentically help that value exchange.
What we've been doing at Roku over the last couple of years is really investing in the tools to enable that symbiotic relationship. And that's what enables us to achieve the fantastic engagement results. I mean, 3.9 hours per consumer count per day is huge engagement and that's been driven by the investments we started making a few years ago. We started to invest in live, initially launched it within Roku channel in 2020, and then in 2022, we added it to left hand[indiscernible].
Similarly, last year, we launched What to Watch and we launched the Sport Zone. Within What to Watch, we enabled customers to discover great content. And to remember the content they already watched, a lot of our customers or 50% of our customers on the research have forgotten what they're watching to integrate and continue watching in their home screen helps them come back. And what to watch live Sport Zone massively contributed to the fact that our home screen menu hours have doubled year-on-year, supporting that overall engagement.
What we then do is, we enable advertisers to participate in that value exchange. Make sure there's relevant contextual advertising, both on the home screen, but also within all of these other discovery vehicles. And this drives our advertising revenue, but it also drives diversity of content peering, which drives our subscription revenue. You see that in our premium subscription services, which is growing at 3 times the speed of the app subscriptions on the platform. So we see ourselves continuously continuing to invest in these surface areas, continuing to drive more engagement, faster our engagement levels and continuing to create this authentic and organic symbiosis between content partners, advertisers and our consumers. This is Anthony, again. So I guess just in summary, we're looking at new ways to sell ads that are incremental, such as DSPs. We are seeing the amount of content on the platform rose significantly, both in terms of the number of streaming services and the depth of the offerings of those services, and that's causing consumers to spend more time looking for something to watch, which is something that we're leaning into, expanding our user experience to help users find something to watch in a way that's entertaining and informative and we're creating new ad opportunities in those experiences. So those are some examples. I mean, there's other examples too, like, creating unique advertising units like shoppable ads and that sort. Thank you all. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Vasily with Cannonball Research. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon. Steve, I wanted to ask you about licensed content amortization and produce content amortization costs. So, if I look at your disclosures in the 10-K, I can see a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about. First, the produced content amortization expense is small compared to the licensed content amortization. And then licensed cost -- cost of licensed content really spiked in 2022 compared to 2021 and then the expected amortization in 2022 to 2023 drops off significantly. Can you explain the reason for such volatility? Is the increase due to short contracts or what's driving that? And if you expect the produced content amortization costs to remain at relatively low level, the way it is now? Thank you. Hey, Vasily. This is Steve. Thanks for the question. I'll talk about that and then if Charlie has any color just from the kind of overall content strategy, he can chime in there if I missed anything. So, just a reminder for the Roku channel, our overall approach is to try to grow the content spend, kind of commensurate with the scale and the growth trajectory for the Roku channel and, obviously, to factor in the macro environment into those expectations. The predominant model that we have is still focused around license content, whether that's rev shares, whether that's fixed license fees. And then certainly, Charlie have shown a little bit the Roku original side of things is exciting new piece of content to get it exclusivity for viewers and that advertisers are interested in that exclusivity as well.
So the overall strategy hasn't changed on that. We are producing more Roku Originals, but, again, the overall majority of the content spend is licensed. When we look at the fixed license fee, because the rev shares basically don't show up on the balance sheet, they're kind of matched in the payouts kind of hit the P&L directly, if you will. So we have a wide range of fixed license. Some of them are short term, and that's really when we started our approach there. And then we have gotten into more longer term contracts, especially when you talk about TV series being licensed. So it tend to be essentially multi-year, especially for the bigger, more well-known TV series. And so there's likely a mix effect on that piece.
Certainly, we've been adjusting our content spend based on the macroeconomic conditions and so that can change the mix overall between both short term and long term fixed license contract as well as the mix for Roku Originals. So, it's Charlie. Look, Steve is right. The foundation of our content spend will continue to be rev share and fixed licensing, but I should step back and talk about Roku Originals for a sec. They create content exclusivity that is absolutely sought out by the viewers and the advertisers, adding value to both. So, we just premiered Die Hart starring Kevin Hart, and then last weekend, Slip with Zoe Lister-Jones. And each of these has been supported by some of our biggest clients, the progressive insurance, Verizon, T Mobile, and a lot more. And so, we'll continue to grow our investments in Roku Originals to create exclusivity for users and advertisers. So I had to get the letter we highlighted Emerald and broad support from Coca-Cola and Martha Gardens and her interwoven relationship with Scotts Lawn Care. So we'll do that. But we'll so it with focus and responsibility.
I get asked a lot about overall content spend on Roku and she's right. Of course, we'll do a commensurate with the scale of growth, the growth from channel and in the context of the broader macro environment. But I'd like to point out, you'll forgive a baseball analogy. The teams with the biggest payroll do not win every year, not by a long shot. I think certainly, my history – the great team I work with here, our history is programming [indiscernible] show that we can be targeted and successful. So with the data, platform that we have and then using all the benefits of Roku passes to third parties and advertisers. I believe, again, fueled by this great team that Roku continue to deliver differentiated product at a price that doesn't put us anywhere near the streaming wars, which probably is the heart of your question. I've said it before, and I'd say it with pride, Roku is not in the streaming wars. The streaming wars are being played out on our platform. Thank you both. It’s Anthony again. I'll just wrap up by saying this. The content that we just discussed, the license content, Roku Originals, that can be found on the Roku channel, which is just doing extremely well and continues to grow. Engagement was up, streaming hours were up 65% year-over-year on the Roku channel. And it's a top five channel by reach and engagement on the Roku platform. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shyam Patel with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Next job on the quarter. I had a couple of questions. Can you talk about just kind of how you're thinking about M&E and financial services, as well as kind of the scatter market overall over the near to intermediate term. I know you're not guiding beyond 2Q, but just curious if you could talk about how you expect to see the bottoming and then maybe the improvement in those areas? And then second question, the Roku channel is a big opportunity for you guys in terms of monetization, you guys have talked about engagement and viewership. And I was just wondering, how are you guys thinking about fill rates and the timeframe for improving the fill rates to where you might want them to be over time. Thank you. Let's see. So M&E, I'll start with that. I know we've talked about scatter markets. I think M&E kind of at the highest level, like I mentioned before, consumers are spending more time trying to figure out what they want to watch. And it's an area that we're really leaning into. Like, we really think we compete, especially on our platform, be their best guide to providing ways to help them find something to watch. And we think we can do that in ways that are branded, great advertising opportunities and are also entertaining and engaging. And increasingly, we're seeing that advertisers want both brand advertisers, but also M&E, media and entertainment services on our platform want to reach those consumers before the consumer decides what they want to watch.
So we're definitely -- we're seeing lots of opportunity to create more UI experiences that will create more opportunities for advertisements, for brand advertisers as well as M&E. It's the number one streaming platform with unmatched scale and engagement, we're in a great position to do that. Advertising is definitely in a bit of a low, but it's a cyclical business, it will bounce back. And as it bounced back, these experiences that we're building will create a lot more opportunity for us to monetize. So, we're leveraging that unmatched scale and innovation to create new monetization opportunities around our user experience.
In terms of the scatter market, Steve, did you want to... Yeah. Let me just talk about kind of our overall thoughts on the environment that impact scatter market and then probably can dive into some of the more [indiscernible]. So similar to last quarter, we expect the macro uncertainty to persist through 2023. That really results in an environment where consumers are remaining pressured and their discretionary spend is likely to remain muted as a result. And so, we talked about as part of our outlook that we expect the ad market in Q2 to look similar to Q1. Charlie? Look, I love the question. I mean, we believe the environment will drive a flight to effectiveness and a focus on engagement for advertisers and that shift flatters Roku. Roku is the best way to drive engagement for M&E clients, because Roku is where the streaming journey begins for nearly half of American broadband households. And so, if you were to see the ad on the Roku platform and literally watch the show that was advertised, and they're watching it here as well. So they couldn't be closer to the content. So, even as some partners manage their budgets down, Roku is poised to take a larger share of the marketing investment by proving as we do that Roku is a highly effective and efficient way to spend marketing dollars.
Actually, I'll give you a specific example, because it really highlights how sophisticated and impact driving a partner Roku is. Actually, HBO Max was looking to increase streaming engagement on Roku. And they decided to target Roku streamers that it stopped engaging after major ten-fold releases. And so it's a pretty sophisticated request that simply can't be addressed by most television partners and we proved results for them. So, streamers exposed to the campaign were 20% more likely to have a streaming session than the control group. And we help another partner. This is similar. We help another service find that 3 plus hours of streaming or 3 plus distinct streaming days in a month was their tipping point for retention. So at that point, the likelihood for return visits to their app increases double digits.
And so, I give you that example. So you see that Roku uses the power of our platform to drive engagement specifically and that's business building and insights that is the world turns to efficiencies, like your question about M&E will again complement Roku. I think you're also seeing across the industry that the ARPU for ad supported tiers of traditional SVOD businesses is surpassing their subscription tiers. And obviously, we're poised to help those companies grow. So, yes, add to all of this, Roku has a diversified ad business and this starts to get the fill rates and your question on fill rates. Beyond media and entertainment, this diverse ad business is -- it is so powerful because we're powering a full funnel marketing experience. Top of the funnel for broad reach, all the way down to performance at bottom of the funnel.
So, actually, just last week [indiscernible] fill rate. We got a call from a studio last week who is worried about top and bottom of the funnel for weekend streaming. And he called me about his premier. And I showed him our approach. We had to move quite a bit of inventory to accommodate him. And by the end of the weekend, he was using home screen ads on Roku to drive viewership for his movie. And then in his post analysis, he talked about how we didn't just help here, but across multiple platforms.
So look in the end, I believe that Roku is poised for greater demand and to take a bigger piece of this important market and the smart money will come to Roku. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Evercore. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. For being EBITDA positive next year, if we were to think about the OpEx line items. Where do you see most leverage? I understand you're focused on OpEx growth rate, but how should we think about the key leverage drivers within your OpEx buckets? That's question one.
And then the second question is on opening up to third party DSPs is one of your levers. I mean, you have other monetization opportunities too. But how should we think about the timeline for that in terms of the meaning and magnitude of contribution as you open up to third party platforms. Thank you. Hey, Shweta. It's Steve. I'll take the OpEx question. In terms of most leverage, as a rider, our kind of single biggest lack of OpEx is headcount and headcount related expenses, and then certainly we have a range of other categories of non-headcount expenses. And so, really, our focus has been on looking at the prioritization on the road maps and really focusing our efforts on high ROI strategic initiatives. And so we can, effectively slow down the year-over-year growth rate, both from a headcount perspective, then we're also been looking at the opportunities to get more efficient on the non-headcount side. So we have other work streams that are pushing efficiencies and cost saves on the non-headcount side.
So the combination of those, certainly, in the last round we talked about, we announced in late March was belated to that kind of project level work and some of the other ongoing initiatives on the non-headcount side. So for us, the leverage is really looking -- taking a harder look at the road maps and skinny in those down so that we're getting the highest ROI initiatives remaining on track and that we're becoming more efficient in a lot of different categories around that. So that will allow us to drive that year-over-year growth rate down to single digits by the end of the year.
And then, as Anthony mentioned at the start, we're also pairing that with work on monetization efforts, other growth initiatives to make sure that we're driving the top line, as well and positioning ourselves to really attract a good place when the rebound happens on the macro environment in the ad business, in particular. Charlie, you want to take the third party DSP? Sure. Thanks for the question. As I said before, and I always like to remind everyone, Roku is and will remain the best place to buy Roku. We've actually always shared inventory with third parties, including DSPs and retail media, full funnel partners, etcetera. And we'll continue to do so. But incremental demand sources, as I said, really -- obviously, are important to us, have been important since day one. And so, we've been deepening our data and tech integrations with select third party partners. But what's interesting in your question about timing is, we're evaluating many partners and we haven't made any preferential deals, but each markers had a different phase of their shift to streaming. And so, really our philosophy on the DSP side has been to meet them where they and be a better partner for them. We've made significant progress this quarter, and we'll continue to do so. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe Anthony or Charlie, I guess, I don't know who it's for specifically, but it's pretty clear when I look across the streaming landscape that all of these streaming platforms have sort of woken up to the importance of cheaper ad supported tiers. I mean, something I think you've probably known for quite a while. But, when I look at sort of the overwhelming majority of the -- not just of the user base, but even a lot of the net adds of things like Netflix, Disney, and HBO Max, which I guess in a few weeks will be called Max. They're all -- I mean, most of these subs are coming on ad free. And I guess, I'm thinking about, like, what changes these companies need to make and what role Roku can play in the evolution so that there are more ad supported subs come on to these platforms? I'm just trying to think, like, how that plays out? Whether that's advertising in your platform? Or just how do you think about sort of the -- how they shift their businesses to an ad -- more ad based subs. So it looks more like what I guess you see today and like Hulu, which I think is, like two thirds ad supported versus, 70%, 80%, 90% the other direction for a lot of these platforms. Thanks. Hey, Rich. I'll let Charlie just take that. But I guess my thoughts at a high level one is, way Roku’s business model is constructed. We monetize our platform whether -- regardless of whether consumer is [indiscernible] ad tier or a subscriptions tier, and we're seeing growth in both of those areas, subscriptions and ads -- ad supported tiers, ad supported products. And I think, the really most interesting thing for us about partners offering lower cost ads for tiers, which I'm sure will become more popular over time as you can get used to them is that, those tiers monetize more than more people watch, which is not the case for a subscription ad free tier. And so, we believe that that will cause increased interest in our M&E promotional products. The ability to promote shows on our platform to drive more engagement is what outcome we expect to happen as more consumers drive to ad supported tiers. But Charlie, I don't think you want to… Yeah. Sure. Well, you're right. Anthony was focused on ad support [indiscernible], and we're now watching our M&E tools, not just be great for driving subscription and retention, that's still true and they will, but the shift to engagement, Rich, that they actually have to watch the shows and the commercials during an advertiser's flight, that is a great trend for Roku, because that's what we do. As a business, we talk a lot about simultaneously helping the consumer, the content partner and the advertisers, all while growing monetization on our platform. So with us approaching nearly half the broadband households in the country is staggering. And with our platform advantages that Anthony just mentioned, we're great partners to help focus on engagement. And again, I think there is a huge flight to engagement happening.
So bottom line is, we're an impressions based business and we build impressions for a living and we can and will continue to help [indiscernible] partners grow as they see their ARPU benefit from it. Charlie, if I could just follow-up on that point. Obviously, as you move to an impression based business, you need time spent. Yet it seems like the knee jerk reaction from all of the companies that you know super well to mitigate their losses in streaming. All of them are just -- they're not really cutting their marketing -- their programming budgets. They're really cutting their marketing budgets, which is obviously doesn't help their ad budget or the ad dollars they can generate from platforms like yours. That just seems like a real disconnect. It is, Rich. It's a great question. First of all, only one question. I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. If you think about [Multiple Speakers] of marketing and programming that has to happen to drive engagement. And that's what we do. And it's not lost on anyone that while we can drive subscriptions so incredibly well and drive programming so incredibly well. These partners are huge advertisers as well, and they value the power of the Roku platform. And so, you're absolutely right. The shift from driving subscriptions to a flight toward engagement and effectiveness even in an environment where people have to show that they're being responsible, that will flatter us as we prove ROI. So, you're right. It's a cycle that has to be about both. And if it's just about one, they won't have the engagement. They'll quickly realize that. We see that, again, it's why I believe the smart money will be coming to Roku. Thank you for the question. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them. First, Charlie, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on your thoughts about making ad inventory more accessible. What guardrails are you putting on that? So on the positive side, I can see your fill rates going up. But do you see any possibility of CPMs coming down? Are you making any of the first party data that your platform has available to third party DSPs? So if you can talk about where you are in the process? What your thoughts are about how open you want to be? And do you think you have enough ad tech and enough relationships to support the third party DSPs and what you're trying to do? And I have a follow-up question. Thank you. Okay. Well, so look, we spend a lot of time leveraging our unmatched scale and innovation to create the new monetization opportunities that you're talking about. And so, doing that, we're doing so hand in hand with, again, our current partners and then more and more third party DSPs to tap incremental demand. And I think we're really focused on that demand diversification and see an opportunity to tap incremental demand. And it will ensure two things. Because one, [indiscernible] your question is pricing. We feel good that we can again continue to add ongoing value from our data and our specialized units and keep up the value of the general market distinction.
I've said it now a couple of times, but every time I am asked about incremental demand, I just want to remind you how successful we've been and how focused we are on Roku being the best place to buy Roku. And we have so many opportunities to work with partner to customize what that means. Okay. Thanks for the details there, Charlie. Maybe as a follow-up, I'd like to ask Anthony about the new Roku branded TVs that were launched. Since you came out with a very broad range, I mean 24 inches to 75 inches with a very broad price range. TV OEM partners are already in the value part of the TV spectrum. So why not just focus on the larger screen sizes and the high end TV space where maybe you would compete less against the existing TV OEMs. So just your thoughts on how you're approaching the TV market? Thank you. And just as a general statement, the Roku TV, like, program overall those licensing and our new Roku branded TVs is going to easily successful for us. It continues to grow. Now we mentioned in the letter that in last quarter 43% of all the TVs in the United States were Roku TVs. I mean, that's a large market share, and we're very proud of that. That's more than the next three OS’s combined. And a program that has a company like Roku that has a licensing program, but also sells first party products. It's very common in the industry. It's pretty standard. You see it with things like Google Android Pixel or Microsoft Windows Surface. These by having the first party devices as well as the third party devices, it gives consumers more choice and it really gives us a platform to drive innovation, to pass that innovation on to our partners.
So at a high level, we believe pretty strongly that the Roku branded TV program is incremental, It's going to drive increased market share over time, both for our licensing partners and through the first party products directly. But to add more, let me turn it over to Mustafa. He is team leads for the TV program.
A - Mustafa Ozgen
Yes. Hey, Ruplu. This is Mustafa speaking. Yes, Roku branded TVs are about expanding the choice for the consumers. And it's also a strong demonstration of our commitment to further strengthen the Roku TV ecosystem with innovation, with additional investment R&D on our side. So staying with a full range of products and then being able to innovate in that full range is important to add real value to basically the consumers, as well as to our ecosystem partners. Because, when we look at the innovation, we don't necessarily look at just keep adding new technology in the high end. We look at the innovation as bringing the best performance out of the mid-range hardware. And so, it's very important to focus on both the cost innovation and also the performance innovation.
Because, again, this helps our OEM partners at the end as we come up with innovations and as we come up with new ideas in that area. And we are definitely very excited about deposit reception our new TVs have received both from the consumers and the industry press. And again, they are great complement to growing array of [indiscernible] Roku TVs that’s made by our licensing partners. And I'd like to sort of quote a comment from Tom's guide, which I wanted to state, if there's choice for the Roku Plus series, and they said and we mentioned this in the shareholder letter. They said the fact that the Roku Plus series 4K TV comes even remotely close to the best TVs for the fraction of the price is remarkable. I think again, to summarize the focus that we have is bringing the best performance out of the TV hardware that exists in the market today and offering that to consumers, again, offering that our partners is our key goal in the Roku branded TV initiative.
And overall, as Anthony mentioned, the program is really -- Roku TV program is highly successful. It drives great results for Roku and our partners, not only in the U.S. which we again reached the 43% market share record high in Q1, but also globally with more than TV partners and growing -- actually that numbers continues to grow. We continue to drive great results and grow the scale of our business. For example, in Mexico, in Q1, one in three TVs sold in the market was Roku TVs and Roku TV had the leading market share. The successful program and the branded TVs really help us add incremental value to that program that benefits our partners and more importantly consumers. Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks, everybody. So we've previously been focused on you opening up demand to third party DSPs because that kind of seemed like the easiest way to solve the demand issue when the ad market slowed. You made a number of announcements. I’ll call out the one you did to partner with UM to kind of share data to help them better understand there buy. I think there was data that I saw this morning an industry presentation that's something like 50% of the top services have overlap from an ad standpoint. And effectively, you can see that and they can on their own. So I guess, I want to take it a bit deeper. Help us understand when you think about like the ability to monetize how much more valuable that is then just -- and those types of deals, then simply just opening up kind of simplistically third party demand? Thanks. Hey, Jason. This is Anthony. I'll turn it over to Charlie. I'll just say that, data partnerships are definitely an area we are focused on and this create value in a bunch of different ways. I couldn't agree more. The long term opportunity is terrific and you nailed a few reasons. So thanks for the question, Jason. As more and more clients drive dollars to accountable connected TV advertising and, obviously, that's happening to get scale. I mean, if you look in first quarter, traditional TV hours fell 10% year-on-year, while our streaming hours grew 20%. So the trends are terrific, and I'm bullish on Roku's position given our scale and the fact that Roku reaches, as I said before, half the broadband households in the country and this is important for your point about monetization. We reached the majority of board cutters. So we're poised to take a bigger share of the market as advertisers focus on value and effectiveness. And again, inherent in your question, because we prove ROI.
I talked a lot about M&E, but I should talk about the diversity of our video advertising. We're seeing health in video advertising. We're seeing it continue to stabilize against categories like health and wellness and travel, all of which grew faster than our overall business. And I should mention the new fronts, because the new fronts and the upfront, Roku has only been in this marketplace for a few years. In fact, our first live event was just last year and this will be my first new front on Tuesday in New York with Allison and the team. And I'm still looking forward to it because we'll be presenting new products, new ad sharing -- sharing new ad focused opportunities, including the data opportunities that you're talking about. We'll be talking about original content. And each of these make Roku more impact driving, distinct and effective for our partners.
I appreciate you mentioning our announcements. One you didn't mention was, we talked about Roku's prime time reach guarantee and this is directly speaking to monetization and moving money from cable to Roku. Advertisers can reach more TV households and prime time on Roku than the average top five cable network. And this is truly about that ongoing shift from traditional TV to more accountable TV streaming. And we're the only ones with enough scale to guarantee that type of broad result. And you might have noticed there was an announcement today about our Instacart partnership. So think about this in the context of your question. This is a full funnel marketing offer, which is so unusual for TV and makes Roku so distinct. With this, CPG advertisers measure whether streamers are purchasing products on Instacart after seeing the ad on the Roku platform. So we can see them buy their products after seeing our ads. And this type of results focus and accountability and as Anthony said, our use of data that distinguishes Roku that will really hold us in good stead.
So look, in summary, I think we are going to continue to maximize that shift that is happening from traditional TV to more accountable TV Streaming. And we're doing so as the biggest best solution. So, I said it before, but I think the smart money keeps coming to Roku. Thank you. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. I guess first for Steve. I think it's for Steve. Just I know you guys aren't guiding to revenue, but the comps get a lot easier for everybody in the ad market in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering, is there an expectation in the market that your business will -- the platform business will accelerate in growth. Does that make sense to you? And then the other piece is, you guys have talked about M&E headwinds for a while now. Is there any way to help us, I don't know, think about the -- when that becomes just too small than that or those headwinds fade enough or how fast the business might be growing if you excluded M&E, just because I think that's probably been masking stronger underlying trends?
And then I just was curious, Charlie, on the upfront, new front, whatever you want to call it. You've been through this a lot in your prior calls. How are you approaching this? Because on one hand connected TV and Roku have some secular tailwinds, which should help you and in the other hand the market -- the scatter markets weak. And so, how are you thinking about your strategy and positioning Roku the best you can to grow the 1 billion last year to a bigger number this year in terms of commitments? Thanks, everybody. Hey, Ben. It's Steve. I'll take that first couple, and then we'll [indiscernible] it over to Charlie for the new front, etcetera. Yes. In terms of the comps, you're certainly correct. The ad scattered market started to really materially slow-down in midway through Q2. So certainly as you comp that, you've got easier comps as you get into the back half of things. In terms of the macro environment, we said in our outlook color that we think that the uncertainty is likely to persist throughout 2023. Really the consumers kind of pinch between – inflation is coming down, but it's still elevated. There's also concerns of the potential recession later this year and next year. And so that spend is discretionary spend which drives a lot of the economy. We think we will remain muted.
So overall, the ad market -- the ad market, we think, in Q2 will look pretty similar to Q1. With that where -- folks talked about all the great incremental monetization opportunities we're working on. So we're not really sure of the timing, but we do think -- we do know that ads are cyclical, and they tend to track the economy. In general, you don't necessarily need the economy to be doing well for the ad market to stick back up. But what you need is stability and the uncertainty to kind of start to at least firm up and hopefully start to get incrementally better. I think that's why you see in certain verticals in the ad market, we talked about seeing signs of promise on things like travel and health and wellness, but we also do have some areas like financial services and M&E that are continuing to remain pressured. And certainly, we -- just given the streaming environment we operate in that we do have an exposure to M&E that’s bigger than average where rest of our assets is fairly similar to the market overall.
So I'm not sure what the timing is, but I think we're well positioned when it comes back. In the meantime, we are working on the OpEx side of the house as well to make sure that we're sort of balance so that we can kind of maintain our growth trajectory on the top line when things get better, but also make sure that we drive toward that positive EBITDA target we've talked about for 2024.
Charlie, I'll switch over to you. Well, Ben, first, thanks for noting how old I am and how many upfront I’ve been through. I appreciate that. [Multiple Speakers] Thank you. I appreciate that. Neither [indiscernible]. So look, our approach to new fronts is really exciting for two reasons. One is, the trend that you talk about. Again, when you know traditional TV fell 10% and our streaming hours are growing 20% year-on-year. That's obviously a really interesting time to come and reintroduce ourselves to the market. And you think about some of what I said before and what we'll be introducing in terms of the data partnerships and add focus offerings.
But, actually, I want to talk a little bit about why I am particularly bullish for Roku, which is that, we're still quite new to this. These are not 50 year relationships. You have a lot of new advertisers coming to streaming for the first time, and we still have opportunity to both grow businesses that have seen how effective Roku is and also add new accounts. So Roku is in an interesting position because, again, the secular trends are coming our way, and I also feel really excited to present Roku in the context of really being the base of the advertising market.
Here's what I mean by that. I think in the -- really in the near term, more and more television is going to be planned platform first because of our scale and are really unmatched reach on this platform. So we actually chose to come to the new front instead of the upfront because we wanted to reach people early, and we wanted to show them how much we help all the people they'll be hearing from. Again, those networks and apps and partners are M&E advertisers, and they value Roku and more and more you're going to see the general marketplace do the same. So I'm excited to present with the team. They're doing a great job and we're hearing really positive feedback. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Anthony for closing remarks. Thanks. So to wrap up, let me just thank everyone for joining and remind everyone that next week we will welcome Dan Jedda as our new Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of everyone at Roku, I want to thank Steve for his contributions and leadership over the last eight years. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. Roku delivered solid Q2 results in a challenging economic environment. We grew scale, engagement and platform revenue. The Roku OS was once again the number one selling smart TV OS in the United States and Mexico. For the first time, Nielsen reported The Roku Channel was 1.1% of total U.S. TV viewing in May, representing 3% of streaming. This is similar engagement to Peacock and HBO Max. We are leaning into our unique role as the platform owner to help viewers find entertainment across the enormous amount of content available throughout the Roku platform.
Our Home Screen Menu provides links to features such as our Live TV guide, Sports and What to Watch that aggregate relevant content into a single location. As we grow user engagement from the Home Screen Menu, we generate more monetization opportunities. At our recent NewFronts presentation, we showcased that new ad units that are unique to the Roku platform. We've opened Roku City to major brands with the recent promotions from McDonald's as well as the Barbie movie. We have partnered with a few key advertisers and verticals beyond M&E to place ads on the Roku home screen, and are ramping up our work with third-party DSPs to capture incremental demand while not reducing existing revenue streams.
We have built a best-in-class TV streaming platform for viewers, advertisers, streaming services and content owners. And we continue to lead the industry with innovation and scale. We remain committed to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2024 with continued improvements after that.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss our results. Thanks, Anthony. We ended the quarter with 73.5 million active accounts globally. Sequential net adds of $1.9 million were slightly above our net adds in Q2 2022. Overall, Smart TV unit sales in the U.S. were up in Q2, despite slight increases in TV panel and freight costs. Roku player unit sales remain above pre-COVID levels and the average selling price was down 9% year-over-year.
Roku users streamed 25.1 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year, while viewing hours on traditional pay TV fell 13%. In Q2, total net revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $847 million. Platform revenue was up 11% year-over-year to $744 million. Ad spend on the Roku platform and verticals, including CPG and health and wellness improved, while technology and media and entertainment remain pressured. Q2 devices revenue increased 9% year-over-year driven by the launch of our Roku branded TVs and smart home products.
In Q2, ARPU was 40.67 on a trailing 12-month basis, down 7% year-over-year. This decline was due to strong global active account growth outpacing platform revenue growth. We expect that over time, monetization per account will continue to grow as the advertising industry rebounds and as a larger percentage of our U.S. customers cut the cord.
In Q2, gross profit increased 7% year-over-year to $378 million. Platform gross margin was 53%, which was down 3 percentage points year-over-year. This reflects weakness in the ad scatter market, along with greater mix away from M&E in Q2 2023 compared to a year ago. Device margin was negative 17%, which was up almost 3 percentage points year-over-year. 4 percentage point difference between the year-over-year growth rates of total net revenue and total gross profit was caused by year-over-year compression of platform margins.
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was negative $18 million, which was $57 million above our outlook. The better-than-expected performance was driven by our Platform segment and improvements in our operating expense profile. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and restricted cash.
Looking to the third quarter, we anticipate total net revenue of $815 million, up 7% year-over-year. Gross profit will be $355 million with gross margin of 43% and adjusted EBITDA of negative $50 million. Overall, trends that we observed in Q1 played out in Q2 and we expect them to continue throughout the year. While consumer spend is showing some modest growth, macro concern and uncertainty remain.
As mentioned earlier, with the Platform segment, we do see some recovery signals in certain advertising verticals. However, M&E spend, which is already challenged industry-wide is expected to be further pressured by limited fall release schedules. As such, we expect Q3 platform margins to be below Q2 levels.
On the device side, we expect margins to improve from negative 16% in Q3 last year to negative low teens. We are executing on our plan to slow year-over-year OpEx growth. In Q2, OpEx grew 8% year-over-year, achieving single-digit growth ahead of our forecasted time line. We anticipate OpEx year-over-year growth rate to fall below 5% in Q3 and further improvement in Q4. Given our ongoing work to improve operational efficiencies and reaccelerate revenue growth, we remain committed to our plan to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2024.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. I had a couple of questions. First one for Dan. Can you talk about what attracted you to Roku and what you're most excited about? You've been here for a few months. And then second, can you guys talk a little bit more about your outlook for 3Q platform revenue. Specifically, what you're seeing in July and how you're thinking about the balance of 3Q? And then any additional color you maybe able to provide on the scatter market and M&E. Thank you. Hi, Shyam. Thanks for the question. As I spent 10 years at Amazon in the streaming and advertising businesses, I am well aware of the opportunity and the progress in streaming. And I followed Roku from before the company went public. And I've been a user of the Roku TVs during this entire time as well. In addition to loving the product, I've really admired Roku's innovation in Anthony's vision.
And what makes Roku particularly interesting to me is where we're at as a company. We're a market leader. We have significant scale and engagement and the leverage in the business is excellent as we've shown in our Q2 results. And still the long-term opportunity for both engagement and monetization in front of us is huge, and the people at Roku have been incredible. So I'm truly honored to have the opportunity to be here at Roku. I couldn't be more excited to be here with Anthony and the entire Roku team. And then, Dan, do you want to talk about the second part of the question, I think, was about the outlook. Yes. Let me – I'll take that. We delivered solid Q2 results, and we're well positioned and confident in our business. But overall, uncertainty remains with the advertise – with certain verticals in the advertising. And we expect those trends that we observed in Q1 and Q2 to continue for the rest of this year. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing recovery in verticals, including CPG and health and wellness. However, tech and M&E remain challenged.
And just as a reminder, M&E historically is our largest and highest-margin ad vertical. It's been challenged industry-wide, and we expect it to be further pressured in the second half of this year by the limited all release schedules arising from the current labor strikes. And so we factored that into our outlook. At the same time, we continue to gain share in video ad spend. And while mix is shifting, our margins are relatively consistent and healthy across our various platform categories, and we remain confident in our business going forward. This is Anthony. I'll just add, we're continuing to grow our scale, engagement and monetization opportunities. For example, in the quarter, we added nearly 2 million net new accounts also in Q2 streaming hours originating from the Home Screen Menu grew 90% year-over-year, which demonstrates the strength and the ability of our tools to help viewers find content across the UI and discover something to watch. Also, we continue to launch unique new ad units, for example, extensions in Roku City, shoppable ads. And of course, we continue to create new demand sources from third-party DSPs.
So I guess I'd just summarize by saying advertising is cyclical. The long-term opportunity in streaming remains unchanged, and we're at the center, serving viewers, content owners and advertisers. And then let's see. There's actually a third part. I think to the question which was around M&E. So let's see it. M&E, so I'll kick that off and then turn it over to Charlie.
So M&E, which stands for Media and Entertainment. Let me just explain a little bit about that. I mean we're the number one streaming platform. We distribute lots of services and content. One of the biggest roles we have is helping viewers find something to watch across all the different content and services on the platform. And there's a bunch of ways we do that. But one way we do that is through our M&E promotions, which are generally integrated into our UI and they're a very effective way and a very user-friendly way to expose content and help viewers find content that's available on different services.
And we're very good at these types of promotions. I would say we're best-in-class. And for a streaming service, just trying to increase engagement or add more subscribers, it's a very cost-effective way to do that, our M&E promotions. Due to the current state of the economy, and the ad cycle we're in, M&E is down industry-wide right now. But we think our share is growing, and scenario we continue to invest in. I mean, as a platform, we're just uniquely positioned to help with – M&E help drive engagement and help build subscribers. So it's something that we view as core to our business, and we're continuing to invest in it. But let me turn it over to Charlie, who can talk a little bit more about what we're doing to diversify away from M&E ads. Great. Thank you, Anthony and Shyam. Thanks for congratulating us on the quarter and for the sneakiest-ever three-part opening question. I think M&E is a great category. And I've enjoyed it more actually in my time at Roku because we have the best highly performing tools, and we deliver great ROI. So before I go at what Anthony spoke about on the M&E side, I want to point out the good news amidst the industry-wide M&E pressure, and it's that we're building share versus the competition in M&E. I mean, advertising is still down in some verticals. As we noted, M&E, tech and telco have been broadly actually reported on is down by the ad agency holding companies over the last few weeks.
But as Anthony said, it will come back. We do all know that advertising is cyclical. But as an illustration of the M&E marketplace change has taken place in really less than one year. I was thinking about this. It feels like a long time ago, but in just August and September of last year, that's when HBO Max, now Max launched its Game Of Thrones; Spinoff. It's when Amazon launched its Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV show. And you're not going to see anything like that this year for all sorts of obvious reasons. And so what a difference a year makes. But as Anthony noted, we've seen some of this coming, and we've been focused on ad diversification. We don't want to be over reliant on any single vertical.
So we continue to diversify and build new revenue sources and new ways to offer what were typically-only M&E placements to non-M&E advertisers. So Roku City is a great example. We've introduced a new way for advertisers to connect with consumers first with McDonald's, which we spoke about at the new fronts and more recently, actually last weekend with the Barbie's Roku City Dreamhouse. And these are just a few among several opportunities to integrate advertisers into Roku's unique and broad reach virtual world, and it has remarkable potential. I'm really excited about it.
And Roku City needs a double win. The advertisers love it. In fact, today, we have more demand than capacity in Roku City, and we're looking for ways to expand thoughtfully. And then the streamers love it, because it turns out they love seeing real brands in Roku's virtual neighborhood. Actually, just to share some unusually positive buzz for ad integrations, and there were many to choose from. Here are a couple of tweets I actually looked at earlier today.
Regarding the Barbie, Mattel, Walmart, Warner integration, here's a quote. ""My dream is to live in the Barbie House in Roku City."" And then there are even comments about other advertisers from McDonald's, here is the quote. ""Who can I talk to you about both keeping the Barbie Dreamhouse and also bringing back the McDonald's permanently to Roku City.""
So we had a world where M&E represented the majority of these opportunities. And we're now focused, as Anthony said, on the diversification of Roku's full funnel offerings. So you'll continue to see successes like Roku City, you'll hear more from us about shoppable ads. And we've been opening up the home screen even to advertising verticals. We mentioned this last earnings call, like restaurants. We talked about Wendy's and DoorDash. We opened it up a little bit to retail and auto, all with the consumer experience team, Gidon's team by our side. So these Roku only opportunities are just a few examples of how we're continuing to diversify ad categories in unique Roku products of scale.
And on the M&E side, I think it's important to note that will help our M&E partners transfer their focus from account acquisition and account growth to engagement and churn management and retention. It's something we do really well. We're the perfect partner for this, too, because we are closest to the viewing decision for more than 73 million homes. So as our M&E partners spend on advertising, Roku will continue to see disproportionate share of investment, I believe, because Roku frankly, remains the best place for M&E partners and others to invest in accountability, creativity, full funnel marketing opportunities and ROI. Great. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Wanted to ask you to talk about the potential impact of the strikes in Hollywood. We all pretty much know what happens to the linear TV when that happens. But I think it's the first time with the streaming being where it is right now. So in terms of the revenue streams within the Platform segment, can you please share, you're thinking about what will happen – likely happen to the M&E revenue stream, distribution revenue stream. And then also what you expect the Roku Channel to experience as a result will be viewership of the library product increase? Will it suffer? I would appreciate your thoughts of what you're bracing for what you're preparing for in this regard? Thank you. Thanks, Vasily. Charlie will take that question. Thanks, Vasily. As Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, I do think it puts added pressure on M&E in the back half. And of course, there's added pressure on our partners, including those with upcoming fall schedules I should pause for a second and say that of course, we hope that the AMPTP in both guilds reach fast and equitable resolution. To your question on our platform, there is a huge amount of content here. So viewers will have no trouble finding something great to watch, and we are seeing that reflected in our numbers. What about the distribution revenue? Do you think that could take a hit because companies will not have marquee shows to promote subscriptions, new subscriptions? So you will not get as many dollars in bounties and that could dampen growth in the second half of the year. Is that a possibility? This is Anthony. I'll take that. I don't think there's going to be much impact on distribution. Just as an aside, we don't really do bounties, we generally get rev shares for billing and signing up new subscribers in that category. So I think the main impacts we think will be on our M&E business. At least some additional pressure there. I don't know, Charlie, do you have anything to add or... Yes. I think that's right. I think it will perhaps vary by service. But for us, we have the tools to find viewers what they want to watch, and that's very much what we're focused on. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks for the question. Dan, I had two for you. First, you mentioned 1Q trends played out in 2Q. So just hoping you could expand on what drove the magnitude of the 2Q revenue upside relative to your guide. And then secondly, on the 3Q outlook, just trying to better understand why you expect revenue to be down sequentially. Is there anything else to point to beyond the impact of the strikes? Thank you. Yes. First of all, it's great to hear from you again, Cory. On the Q2 revenue, as we mentioned, it was the platform business that drove the revenue upside, and we did see some rebounding in verticals that we saw – that the verticals that we mentioned, CPG specifically was very strong for us as well as some other verticals. That ultimately drove the beat to the guidance. So we're quite happy with that. And with respect to the outlook, it's really what I addressed earlier is – it's the M&E continues to be challenging, and we do expect it to be challenged in the back half of H2 for us. It's been challenged in H1, but we think it's going to be further challenged due to the strikes and the fall outlook. So essentially, we are factoring that into our Q3 outlook, which is why you see the growth rate just down slightly on a sequential basis. Okay. Great. And maybe if I can sneak one more in since that was fast. Charlie, just could you – I know on the new front process, you don't have numbers to share, it's taking longer to play out. But any color you can give us in terms of the level of demand you're seeing relative to last year or your expectations? Thank you. Sure. Cory, you're our second, three question asker. Well done. So look, it is a very different year in the upfront for everyone. And you're right, it is proceeding at a slower pace than usual. Look, we're making great progress. You're absolutely right. We're not quite done yet, but we're pacing well. Overall, the good news is we're seeing more advertisers engage with Roku upfront due to our broad reach, our innovative ad products. And the powerful tools we offer to attract, engage and retain audiences. So all signs are good there, and we're methodically working through the market with our agency partners, but I feel good about where we are. Cory, this is Anthony. I just learned – you may know this, but Charlie has led on with 20 upfronts, which I thought was pretty cool. Thanks, Anthony. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open. Hey there. So this cost control is really excellent, 8% cost growth last quarter, it was 42% and the quarter before, it was 71% growth. But Anthony you did it at really the R&D line, the R&D line has taken the brunt of it, okay? All costs are down, but the R&D line fell to negative 2%. So is that actually sustainable now that you've been – you've actually launched your 11 Roku-branded TVs? And you've gotten out of international. Can we keep the R&D number at the slow number going forward? Or is it just a onetime only that really aided cost growth this quarter? Anthony. Thanks. Yes, I think – well, I think two things. One is that we are still investing significantly in our key growth initiatives, things like expanding active accounts, Roku TV monetization billing premium subscriptions, expanding the ways we can help you find content. And a lot of the – I would say one of the initiatives we're taking, which we don't talk about much is we have R&D offices around the world. We have – obviously, we have offices in Silicon Valley, but we have great teams in Manchester, England, Cambridge, U.K. Taipei and in other places. And so one of the things that we've been doing is doing a lot more of our hiring in regions outside the United States to have great engineering talent, but are just less expensive than Silicon Valley engineers. So that's one of the ways we're controlling our R&D costs and still getting lots of great engineers. Okay. And then my second question, and I will not have to three, is, I want to push a little bit on this issue of CTV versus full funnel. So before this year, you went into the upfront in the linear TV, which was a benchmark against a $20 CPM as a substitute for linear TV, which had data so you were getting $30 CPMs from 2017 to round numbers 2023. This year, you went into the new front and the go-to-market strategy pivoted to full funnel come to us because we can dose both the awareness drive, we can drive awareness, we can drive Shoppable with Walmart and with Shopify.
My question is, when you start moving down the funnel, you start competing with a $2 CPM, and I noticed your ARPU is here are down 7%. Okay. My question is, are you adding risk? Does it really do more good than harm to repivot the offering, your go-to-market offering to a full funnel and lose that benchmark of the $20 CPM that comes with broadcast TV substitute? So let me – I'll answer that and I don't know if Charlie or Dan might have more to add. We'll see. First of all, you mentioned ARPU down. I mean that's been driven by the fact that just we've been – monetization has slowed down due to the slowdown in the ad business, yet active accounts are still growing strong. And so just when you do the math, you get a lower ARPU number. I don't think it indicates anything more than that, and I expect it to start picking back up again when the ad business rebounds.
In terms of full funnel, I mean, we've launched things like Shoppable Ads, which allow purchasing right inside the ad. But those Shoppable Ads, of course, are still – have the site and sound of high-definition video. They're very engaging. And we still sell lots of ads to brand advertisers. So I think we're just trying to expand the different target markets we can sell ads to and there might be different pricing depending on the channel or the ad or the customer or the content or lots of factors. So I think it's all about for us, diversifying our ad revenue and tapping into all the different sources that are out there. And we've made progress on that, but there's still I think, a long way to go there. Charlie, do you want to add? No, I think that's absolutely right. And I also think you shouldn't read into the pivots as one or the other. One thing that is just so powerful about Roku is that we really can do what television does best, which is broad reach. And site sound in motion, and we can be accountable. And so when we talk about full funnel, it's a differentiator because, look, you look back in my career and what I'm there to do on the advertising side of the business is help them be effective.
And so by noting that we can be great at the top of the funnel and accountable at the bottom of the funnel, we're helping build businesses in a way that most people can't. So that is a really important message. And then I want you to look also during the upfront. We made a prime time reach guarantee. And that's obviously the opposite of lower funnel. What we're saying is that Roku can reach, and you look at the top five cable networks on average, we can outreach them. And so Anthony is absolutely right. We're looking at not just serving the advertisers, but actually taking advantage of all the ways we can monetize Roku. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Vikram Kesavabhotla with Baird. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the progress that you're making with third-party DSPs. And I'm curious if you can talk about the early impacts you're seeing on pricing and fill rates and how you expect that to evolve from here. And then separately, just based on the current state of macro trends and industry trends, I'm curious if you can offer any early perspective on what fourth quarter revenues might look like this year and some of the puts and takes we should be taking into consideration? Thanks. Hey, Vikram. So Charlie can take the DSP question and then Dan can talk about fourth quarter revenue. Great. Thanks for the question. Look, we sell ads through multiple channels. There's direct IO through our sales team programmatically through a DSP. And by the way, often that is also enabled through our sales teams. And recently, as you know, we've more actively engaged with third-party DSPs. And to your question, we're seeing incremental budgets. No doubt about it. We believe these relationships have long-term potential. So it is working. And I should note, it's off a small base. So it's early days, but it's going well. So headline is no doubt, we're getting budgets now that we weren't getting before. And I think these relationships have really strong long-term potential. Yes, Vikram, on the fourth quarter guide, we'll obviously update you when we report our third quarter results. We're not guiding the fourth quarter. I will just say that we do expect the second half to be similar to what we see – what we've guided to in the first half – the second half to be similar to what we've seen in Q2. We factored that into our guide for Q3. And again, we'll update the group in our Q3 results for further guidance for Q4. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Two, if I can. First, I just want to touch on platform gross margin. That was up a little bit sequentially. Curious if there were just anything beyond mix, perhaps some one-timers or promotions, just driving that uptick? And then secondly, you called out again just the softer scatter market this quarter. I would love to hear you just to mention out how Roku scatter is performing relative to the overall industry. Thank you. Hey, Justin. Dan can take the first part, and Charlie can talk about scatter. Yes. On the platform gross margin for Q2, it was mix, which caused a slight uptick. With M&E, we did see – it improved from Q1 to Q2. It was – we had a very tough quarter for M&E in Q1, and we had – we did see some uptick. So we did see some positive sequential change from Q1 to Q2 due to M&E. That said, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect M&E to be pressured in H2, which is why we expect just a slight tick down in platform gross profit for Q3. And Charlie? Yes, thanks. And on the scatter side, I think it is a story of categories. Dan mentioned CPG and health and wellness and a few others are really showing green shoots and we've repeated it a few times, M&E, tech and telco, you won't be surprised to hear, it's challenging us. So we're seeing that in the marketplace. And again, I think the overall trends that are benefiting us just – are the viewership trends. We used to have to tell people, even in my early tenure here, the linear decline was continuing and connected TV was growing, and now they say it to us and look to us as a solution. So I think we'll see that more and more as the scatter markets roll out. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question will come from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for – I'm not sure if it's for Charlie or Anthony and then one for Dan. Maybe for Charlie, I guess, a follow-up to the prior question around leaning into some of that third-party demand. I'm wondering if you can either quantify are we at a point yet where maybe we're getting a point type of lift on revenue growth. And again, to use the old baseball analogy, are we kind of in the first inning there. Just any further color there would be would be helpful.
And then one for Dan. Dan, as we think about the devices business as the branded TVs ramp, they carry a higher ASP. So that will start to become revenue intensive. And so my question is around how you're thinking about gross margin strategy in devices? Can we get back to breakeven next year? Do you think that business will run at breakeven or low single digits over time? Just kind of curious how you think about that because the revenue line theoretically could get bigger with branded TVs? Thanks guys. This is Anthony. I'll answer the question on third-party DSPs. And then if Charlie has anything else to add, he can jump in and then we could talk about device margins. I think that – I mean, we're obviously not breaking out numbers for third-party DSPs. The numbers, I think, are relatively – the base is relatively modest, but we're seeing strong growth. So we think it's got a lot of potential, but it's going to take a little while to build. I don't know if there's anything we can say beyond that. Charlie? I think we're very conscious of making sure that it's not cannibalistic. And so some of what I think you'd want to see us do and we're doing it actively is just make sure that it's additive and make sure that we're growing within our long-term business plan. So, so far, so good. Dan, do you want to – have any thoughts on devices. On the device question, Matt, for our first-party TVs will have a different margin outlook that's right. Obviously, a different revenue outlook relative to the licensed side of the business. And right now, the bulk of the device revenue is, in fact, players, along with a smaller amount of first-party TVs and our smart home product. On the longer-term strategy on margins, again, we'll update you more as we go. It's very early days for us in first-party TVs. We like what we see so far.
I think we mentioned we're getting extraordinarily good ratings at 4.5 out of 5 stars on all our models at Best Buy. So we love that. But the margin structure, it's just really small right now. So it's not showing up in the financials. And we'll update you more as we sell more, but a lot of that will be, of course, market-based pricing. And Mustafa and team are excellent at driving the BOM cost for these products. So we'll update you more as it becomes a bigger portion of our device revenue. And this is Anthony. I mean, I'll just remind everyone that we – our business model is – does not include making money on devices. I mean, devices are a customer acquisition channel for us. And how much we spend there varies based on a lot of factors, including looking at the value of the customers we receive and the return from different segments of distribution. So we don't – we're not talking about next year, but we don't – as a general rule, it's not profit maximizing or value maximizing for us to try and make the device business profitable because the service businesses so much more profitable. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Nicholas Zangler with Stephens. Your line is open. Yes. Hey guys. What's the takeaway on upfront negotiations proceeding at a slower pace. Just wondering if you could peel back the dynamic there. And you've heard of advertisers looking for more flexibility in these upfront commitments than in prior years, which I think would naturally push ad spend into the scatter market. But if that is true, just wondering if you could frame up the implications there for Roku? Sure, Charlie can take that. Sure. Thanks for the question, Nick. You look at the upfronts. And really what people are doing is placing money down early to lock in products of value, products they value in the 12 months of the upfront cycle. And it varies every year how they do so, right, depending on what they think they can get in scatter. And frankly, based on uncertainty of their businesses and how much they can commit in advance. So the pace reflects that, and I think what it says and it's not an issue for the business so long as the business is running by fourth quarter, that it comes in, in July or June or May as it has in some really healthy years.
So long as it's running by fourth quarter, the upfront cycle starts. And I just think you'll see a different mix this year of upfront scatter because there's not the need, for instance, to lay down that money or people are seeing the uncertainty and decide to hold it to closer to order because they don't think they can't get the inventory that they want. The flexibility issue is certainly one as well as they lay down money earlier in a market where perhaps there's not as much early demand, the return – what they're asking for in return is flexibility. So it's not unusual at all that these would be the issues on the table during an upfront. The result is a slower pace.
But again, the dollars that you're committing don't start running until October. So what I like about our trends is that we have more advertisers participating and more people coming to us for solutions, and I think that holds us in good stead whether the money comes upfront or in scatter. This is Anthony, I mean I guess – I would just add that we – I would just say that we've traditionally done very well in the scatter market is how we build our ad business initially. So we'll see what happens in this coming season, but traditionally, it's been – we've been strong in the scatter. Right. And to that point then, are you kind of agnostic to whether it comes via direct or scatter if we were to see an upfront number come in similar to last year. I mean, I don't necessarily think that has to be perceived as a negative if ultimately more dollars come in through the scatter market. But is that the right way to view the dynamic whether the dollars come in direct for scatter. Charlie? Yes, sure. I think that's right. Obviously, pace impact pricing, but we're very well positioned to even take late money. So sure, as long as the money comes, I think the mix of upfront and scatter does change in every marketplace, and it's getting a little more discussion now simply because of the pace. But I think that's a good way to look at it. That's right. Got it. And then finally, just on the Roku TV strategy, just curious what does success look like for you guys on the Roku-branded TV program? Is this merely a complementary gateway to the consumer? Or for you, is this a strategy that over time you might look to aggressively take market share and maybe do so through price and potentially become effectively a leading TV OEM. Just thoughts on this overall strategy? Thank you. This is Anthony. I'll give the initial answer and then Mustafa can add more detail. So you just think about the Roku TV program and the Roku-branded TVs are all part of our device team or device efforts and our device efforts are all around building active accounts. And that's going extremely well a scenario that we've always been good at, led by the purpose-built operating system that we built just for TV. I mean compared to all of our competitors that have basically taken mobile operating systems imported them to TVs. We've – we built from the beginning of an operating system from the ground that designed specifically for TVs, and we distribute it in various ways. We distribute it built into our streaming players built into our – the TVs that we work with our licensed OEM partners and then our own branded TVs. And that – in aggregate, that's resulted in the United States as becoming the number one streaming platform. We're also, like we said, number one in Mexico and doing well in a lot of other regions. In the U.S., specifically, we're approaching half of all broadband households now using a Roku device to watch television.
So the overall mix of different kinds of ways to reach the consumer has been very successful for us. And players, for example, we – some people talk about the demise of players. I mean, we don't see that. We sell tens of millions of players a year that add new accounts or increase engagement with existing accounts. When it comes to TV, TVs are now the most important way that we add active accounts. And by far, still the license program, the program where we license our platform to OEMs is the largest part of that. And then the Roku branded program is something that's new, it's going well, and it's got a few different purposes, and I'll let Mustafa talk about that. Yes. Hi, Nicholas. Mustafa here. Thank you for the question. Again, for us, the local brand TVs are about really expanding the choice for the consumers. And they’re also a strong demonstration of our commitment to further strengthen the Roku TV ecosystem itself, we had additional innovations and investments that we are making. And we also announced that before that we are sharing our innovations and the learnings with our partners. So it's about the strength of the ecosystem and growing the overall Roku TV licensing program.
And as Dan mentioned, actually, although we launched these products really recently in mid-March, early days are showing that we can actually build good TVs that can get great press reviews. For instance, the Roku Plus series won the Tom's Guide award for Best Value TV. Again, it shows that we can contribute to the Roku TV ecosystem, although to some extent, we are offering a competitive product, but in reality, whatever we build to build this Best Value TV is actually going to our third-party licensing program as well. It's a completely shared program. Not only the press review, but customer reviews were also great.
Again, as Dan mentioned, that all 11 models that we are selling at Best Buy, who is our exclusive retailer for the Roku branded TVs. They received at least on 4.5 star out of 5 star rating, which is, again, a great indication that we can build good products and contribute the Roku TV program. And as Anthony said, just to emphasize, Roku brand TVs are really a great way to complement to the primary way we distribute our platform, which is through our TV licensing partners and the Roku streaming players. So that's how we see the mix going forward. Yes. This is Anthony. I think that covers it, but I'll just add, the primary way we're going to – the primary way to distribute our platform through TV through our licensing program. The Roku-branded program, I think, is incremental to that, if we see it driving innovation, which we'll pass on to our partners in licensing program, and it also helps us fill gaps that maybe our partners are not filling or demand – incremental demand that they're not addressing allows us to go after that. Great. Thanks guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Walthall with Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open. Thanks guys for the question. I just had a question on the new Shopify partnership. What's the initial feedback that you're getting on that? And curious, if you could share any of the early success stories or learnings from Shoppable Ads generally? Sure, Charlie. Sure. Thanks, Ross. We're really excited about the Shopify partnership I should note upfront that our goal is to make the TV screen accessible by businesses of all sizes, not just the largest businesses. And so this first of its kind partnership with Shopify provides viewers the ability to seamlessly purchase products from Shopify merchants directly from their TV using Roku shoppable ads. So literally, you just click okay on your remote, you check out automatically with Roku Pay.
And an order confirmation from the Shopify merchant hits your inbox. It really is that easy. So you asked about a couple of partners, True Classic, which is a men's apparel brand, the game-based connected rower Ergatta and wellness brand Olly have all signed on as initial partners. Now it's still early days in terms of teaching the consumer, how to shop on the TV screen, just like they do on their phones. But to your point, this is something that Roku is excited about and is uniquely positioned to do. So we're seeing positive signs for this new ad format, and it's a new purchase point for the consumer. So I think there's a lot of good news ahead. Thanks, Charlie. And then one follow-up on margins. I know a little bit of discussion earlier about M&E being part of the pressure point in the Q3 margin guidance for the platform business. Just if you can step back and think longer term, what do you need to see in order to get back to that like the high 50s margins? Does that require meaningful recovery in the M&E business? Or are there other avenues to get back there? Thanks. This is Anthony. I'll kick that off and maybe turn it over to Dan to talk about. I think the margins are primarily related to the mix. And so with the M&E down, there's less M&E, which is higher margin. And I think there's two ways. From my point of view, there's two things that will address that. One is I think the reduction in demand right now is completely cyclical. It's related to the slowdown of the ad business impacting our M&E partners. That's also related to the strikes. And so I think those things will change and we'll see it pick back up again. We're also continuing to build out the features in our platform that are used by M&E promotions and sold as part of M&E promotions and making them even more effective. And so I think I saw already a very effective way to drive engagement and subscriptions from partner services, but it's just going to get better. I mean, we're making it a lot better – making it better.
And then the other part of it is, like Charlie said, where M&E is mostly inventory in the user experience, mostly ad units and the static ad units and the user experience. And there's a lot of opportunities to expand the type of advertisers that we sell those ads to. Like, for example, T-Mobile sponsor our sports zone, we had – we talked about the McDonald's and Roku City. And so there's other – we're expanding the client base that we sell those ads to brand relevant brand advertisers as well. So I think all that's going to increase sales over the long term of what we would today call M&E. And then I don't know, Dan, if you want to add. The only thing I'd add is, I think I stated earlier that we are seeing strong margins across all our platform ad categories. So there is a mix impact. And yes, M&E has a disproportionately higher margin. And we do expect at some point, M&E to start to recover again. And also, we are diversifying and things like Roku City also have higher margins. So there are opportunities to grow our margins outside of M&E as well. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. We have a question from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Hey. Two questions. First, there was an interesting choice of words using modest to describe 11% platform growth. So if that's modest, what's normal? So that's one. And then second, Charlie, can you talk about how you're supporting third-party DSPs demand? Are you doing SSP integrations, direct integrations with DSPs or both? Let's see, dissecting our [adjectives]. I don't know. Dan, you're good with adjectives. What's... Yes. That is probably one of the most difficult questions I've had. I'd say it's modest. I don't know when we said it was modest. I will say we're very happy with our Q2 results. I think we talked a little bit about our guidance and what's driving it. And I go back to my original comments on why I came to Roku and how much runway there is ahead of us from an opportunity standpoint on the monetization front. So outside of that, I will say, again, we have a lot of runway ahead of us to grow. And maybe we'll just choose our adjectives better when we explain a double-digit growth rate for Q2. Yes. On DSPs, I mean, there's direct technical integration with the DSPs at multiple levels. And we've had that for a long time and as well as, obviously, we have our own ad tech stack that we continue to make better. We integrate DSPs, third-party DSPs into that ad tech stack. And then we have a lot of levers on how we choose to work with them. And I would say – I mean, without getting into details, I would characterize the way we're working with them now versus the for is just much more active in ways that I think you're going to drive more success. So I don't know, Charlie, if you want to add anything? Well, first of all, as the first person in media to be asked anything with the word modest in it. I appreciate that. But secondly, I think that's 100% right. And it's the levers that we lean on to meet advertisers where they wish to transact. So Anthony is right on the tech stack, we're remarkably proud of our tech stack and the team that builds it. And then we are coming to market in ways that is showing signs of new accounts and new account growth. So it is – a lot of it is still manual, to be honest, and work through our sales teams but we are working in different ways with third-party DSPs and the way Anthony described. Thank you. Thank you. And our last question will come from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question kind of going back to the macro a little bit. Maybe can you talk about the linearity of the ad platform revenue growth as it progressed the quarter. So how did you start out versus how did end up through the quarter? Just one for me. Thanks. Yes. Dan will take that. Yes. I guess I would say the pacing was consistent throughout the quarter. And really, I guess, we haven't – we did see that improvement in those verticals. I would say that those – that has transpired. There's nothing within the quarter that we saw that changed outside of any normal trends that we have in the quarter. So really not much to add beyond that from an intra-quarter standpoint. Okay. Thank you. But they were modest changes I would say. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Anthony Wood for any closing remarks. Thanks to everyone for joining the call, and thanks to our employees, customers, content partners and advertisers. This concludes today's conference call.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. We are executing well as the shift to TV streaming continues and delivered a strong quarter. We grew our scale with net adds of 2.3 million active accounts, an acceleration from the previous quarter. We drove strong engagement with streaming hours surpassing 100 billion for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, and the Roku Channel remains a top 10 streaming app with engagement comparable to Paramount+, Peacock and Max according to Nielsen. On the monetization side, platform revenue was up 18% year-over-year, reflecting strong contribution from content distribution and video advertising. We continue to tap into new ad demand sources and are now integrated with more than 30 programmatic partners.
Spend on the Roku platform through automated third-party demand sources in Q3 grew meaningfully year-over-year, and we expanded our partnerships with marquee brands this quarter. With Spotify, we introduced video ads in the Spotify app on Roku devices and with the NFL, we launched the first League-branded zone in the Roku Sports Experience. We continue to make progress in reducing our year-over-year OpEx growth rate. In September, we announced additional measures that included a reduction of our workforce and office facilities and the removal of select content. These measures and other cost reductions, along with our strong top line growth, enabled us to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $43 million in Q3. Going forward, we will balance investment for growth with our commitment to positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024, and we expect continued adjusted EBITDA improvements after that.
With our growing scale and engagement, relentless focus on providing the best TV streaming experience and ongoing innovation, we are well positioned as the ad market recoveries.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss our results. Thanks, Anthony. We ended the quarter with 75.8 million active accounts globally, up 16% year-over-year. Sequential net adds of 2.3 million accelerated quarter-over-quarter. Overall, smart TV unit sales in the U.S. were up year-over-year in Q3, driven by a consumer focus on value that benefited Roku, which grew significantly faster than the overall industry.
Roku Player unit sales remain above pre-COVID levels and the average Roku player selling price was up 2% year-over-year. Roku users streamed 26.7 billion hours in the quarter, an increase of 22% year-over-year, while viewing hours on traditional pay TV fell 15%. Trading hours per active account per day of 3.9 was up 5% year-over-year. .
In Q3, total net revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $912 million. Platform revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $787 million driven by both content distribution and video advertising, offset by lower media and entertainment promotional spend.
Content distribution activities grew faster than overall platform revenue benefited from increased subscription sign-ups along with recent price increases from SVOD partners. Similar to Q2 2023, platform revenue and gross profit also benefited from a positive [ 606 ] adjustment from changes in forecasts of our content distribution deals.
Q3 Devices revenue increased 33% year-over-year driven by the launch of our Roku-branded TVs and smart home products. In Q3, ARPU was approximately $41 on a trailing 12-month basis, down 7% year-over-year but up quarter-over-quarter for the first time since Q3 of last year. We expect ARPU to benefit in future periods from a recovery in the ad industry.
In Q3, gross profit was $369 million, up 3% year-over-year. Excluding the restructuring and impairment charges, gross profit was up 22% year-over-year. Platform gross margin was 48%, down 5 points sequentially, driven primarily by a $62 million impairment charge related to the removal of select licensed and produced content from the Roku Channel. Excluding the impairment charge, platform gross margin would have been 56%, a 3 point increase sequentially. Devices margin was negative 8%, which was up nearly 10 points sequentially.
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was positive $43 million. The better-than-expected performance was driven by strong top line growth, along with cost reductions and measures we announced in September to further reduce our year-over-year OpEx growth rate. Free cash flow for Q3 was positive $239 million, and we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in cash and restricted cash.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate total net revenue of $955 million, up 10% year-over-year, gross profit of $405 million with gross margin of 42%, and positive adjusted EBITDA of $10 million. Within the Platform segment, we had a solid rebound in video ads in Q3, and we expect year-over-year growth rate of video ads in Q4 to be similar. However, we remain cautious amid an uncertain macro environment and an uneven ad market recovery. Ad verticals like CPG and health and wellness continue to improve, while verticals like financial services and M&E remain challenged.
Additionally, we will face difficult year-over-year growth rate comparisons in content distribution and M&E, which will challenge the year-over-year growth rate of platform revenue in Q4. Within Devices segment, we expect device margins to be down sequentially, in line with historical seasonal trends but up year-over-year. We anticipate both the sequential point decrease and the year-over-year point increase to be in the low teens. As a reminder, Q4 is traditionally a heavier promotional period in the retail calendar resulting in lower device margins in the quarter relative to other quarters.
Turning to OpEx. We anticipate Q4 year-over-year growth in the negative mid-teens, a significant improvement from OpEx year-over-year growth of approximately 70% in Q4 of last year. We will continue to operate our business with discipline to defend margins with a focus on driving positive free cash flow over time. Additionally, we remain committed to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024 with continued improvements after that. We will balance this commitment with investments to further expand our scale, engagement and monetization.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Hoping you'd go a bit deeper just into the different trends you're seeing across M&E upfronts in the scatter markets. Charlie, maybe specifically for you, anything that you would call out on impact from geopolitical events in 4Q? And then, Dan, maybe if you could just tie it all together into how those kind of various cross currents got you to your 4Q guide. Cory, thanks. This is Anthony. So yes, Charlie will take that first part of that question, and Dan, the second part. Thanks, Anthony. I'll start in the second quarter. We saw a continued rebound in video advertising from second quarter into third quarter. And in third quarter, year-on-year growth of video advertising on Roku actually outperformed the overall ad market and the linear ad market in the U.S. So while we're optimistic about the ongoing rebound in video advertising on our platform, we remain cautious about the uncertain macro environment and the uneven ad market recovery by category.
Actually, Cory, for instance, CPG and health and wellness are growing and doing quite well, but there are still categories like financial services and insurance that are not recovering as quickly. And you mentioned M&E, I expect M&E to be further pressured in fourth quarter by, of course, the limited fall release schedules because of labor strikes. And there are some challenging comps last year, if you remember, included the World Cup and a healthy seasonal and full theatrical schedule and more. So I'd say sort of trend wise, we had a solid -- really solid rebound in video ads in third quarter. And though there are the ups and downs I mentioned, we're executing well, and I fully expect the year-on-year growth rate of video ads in fourth quarter to be similar to third. Dan, do you want to? Yes. Cory, thanks for the question. Let me just tie that to what Charlie just said into how it impacts the Q4 guide. Yes, we did have a very solid video ads rebound in Q3. We do expect, as Charlie said, the year-over-year growth rate in video ads to be similar in Q4. And you also said that we remain cautious and uncertain for the macro environment, the uneven ad market recovery. I do want to add that we also do face a difficult year-over-year growth rate comparison in content distribution and M&E. And that does challenge the sequential growth rate change from Q3 to Q4. We had a very strong Q3 in our content distribution activities. That comp gets harder in Q4, and that's factored into our guide. And so from a sequential basis, when you look at Q4 2023 growing slower than Q3 2023, some of that is this harder comp. And some of it is timing.
If you look at our H2 compared to H1 of this year relative to our H2 compared to H1 of last year, you'll see a 9-point sequential change in the second half of 2023 relative to 2022. So that's also playing into the guide. And I'll just end by saying we expect to demonstrate further leverage in our business while our outlook -- with an outlook that calls for double-digit increase year-on-year in gross profit and a double-digit decrease year-over-year in OpEx, and that's what's driving the positive adjusted EBITDA for Q4. Cory, this is Anthony. I'll just -- if I could just wrap it. I'll just add that I feel good about our commitment to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024. And obviously, with continued improvements after that, I also feel good about continuing to invest in our business while also meeting those targets. So things are looking good for us right now. . Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Charlie, I have 2 for you. One is, as you noted in the press release, Roku Channel is up 50% year-over-year. Can you talk a bit about what's changed on your watch in terms of how you program it versus previously? And then secondly, we'll focus on Amazon entering the market for Prime Video ads. What do you think it means for more broadly the ecosystem? And then any competition that you think you'll hit as they enter for Prime Video advertising? Michael, this is Anthony. Why don't we start with the question about video ads and competitors, and then Charlie can expand on the rest of your question. So I just -- I would say, first of all, we're the leading TV streaming platform. It's a great position to be in. We get asked about market dynamics a lot. We founded Roku on the belief that all TV including advertising is going to be streamed. And we're obviously seeing that happen well into that transition, but there's still a long way to go.
Traditional TV ads in the U.S., as everyone probably knows, is a $60 billion a year business. It's all going to move to streaming, and there's going to be multiple winners. Our platform obviously has significant scale, engagement, first-party data, unique ad products. And like we said before, in the U.S., our scale is approaching half of broadband households. That makes us a tremendously important platform to be involved in for everyone in the ecosystem. Our streaming hours passed 100 billion hours, a great milestone for us. The Roku Channel, which Charlie will talk more about, it's a top 10 streaming app on our platform and represents nearly 3% of all TV streaming in September, not just on Roku but across everywhere, which is comparable to the engagement of apps like Paramount+, Peacock and Max. So we're in a great position.
We're a strong part of the ecosystem. We're executing well. And if I think about a couple of factors that would be impacting our -- the growth of our video ad business, specifically, the most important one, which we've mentioned before and continues to be the most important is just the macro is -- well, one is the macro environment, which is impacting everyone right now. And then -- but the second one is just how fast advertisers move from traditional TV to streaming. There's still a lot of dollars that are in the traditional pay TV ecosystem that are all going to move to streaming. And that's a big factor in terms of our growth.
And I think as services like services that were traditionally ad-free start to add ads, it does have the benefit of creating more interest in -- of advertisers and moving their ads to streaming. So that's a positive benefit for us. And then I think another thought I have, that maybe most people don't think about is if you think about the Roku Channel as popular streaming services make the trade-off to add ads, it levels the playing field in viewers' minds to services like the Roku Channel, which are already ad supported. In other words, in streaming services that don't traditionally have ads as they enter the advertising business, I believe it's going to increase engagement on the Roku Channel. So those are a few high-level thoughts. And then, Charlie, do you want to add your thoughts? Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Thanks, Anthony. Look, we've done a lot of curation on the Roku Channel, and we feel really good about our opportunities there, Michael, to continue to grow. Really, our focus is on bringing the right mix of content to the Roku Channel, content that our customers love and watch across what is really that curated mix of licensed content, the fast channels and original content. And to sort of summarize or prioritize for you, originals are a key part of our strategy, and I'm proud of the team and are efficient and impact driving efforts. But the foundation of Roku's content spend is third-party license content that we service for viewers through Roku's unique UI advantages.
Our position as the platform is extremely powerful. Probably, I would say, more powerful than I anticipated even coming in when we first spoke. And we have great program overall, and the numbers and the engagement growth proved that our content mix is working well. The Roku Channel has grown streaming hours 50% year-on-year. And so just like I did at AMC and other places I've led, we're very serious  about managing the library, and we frequently tweak it. In fact, we review the Roku Channel's content and the content performance often simply to ensure that viewers have the best possible experiences. That's the job, to adjust the mix of offerings and do so to the benefit of audiences. And that process has helped us grow and the engagement is growing consistently, and we see continued growth ahead across all key content categories starting with that direct license, as I mentioned, including the fast channels and even sports and focused in budget originals.
We have 400-plus fast channels, linear fast channels, and they're gaining in traction. Fans noticed that our NFL partnership continued to grow, and the NFL Zone launched within our sports zone in September. And Roku Originals mirrored that and premiered the NFL Draft, the pick is in. I think you just saw a clip if you were waiting on the call. Applebee's sponsored that, and that provided insider access to the NFL Draft in partnership with the NFL sitting side by side with our expanded NFL partnership.
And then we did innovative stuff like we launched the Mr. Beast fast channel working with 1 of the most popular YouTube creators. I think he has something like 176 million YouTube subscribers. And that was both strategic and accretive, and it was an exclusive launch that our audience has loved, and it performed real well.
So we're on strategy, Michael, and see growth ahead. We will continue to release new content and new partnerships on the Roku Channel, and I'm pleased with the team and our process and our progress. And this is Anthony again. Maybe I'll just point out an important component of our Roku Channel business model, which I think a lot of people understand but maybe not everyone, which is that Roku's big strategic advantage is that with a platform that a large number of people use to watch television. So approaching half the broadband households in the United States, when they turn on their TV, the UI that they see is the Roku user interface. And so one way we use that is to help recommend content to our -- we use it to recommend content that's in the Roku Channel to viewers. Obviously, we use it to recommend all kinds of content, but we also insert and make sure that we promote content that is in the Roku Channel in our user interface when they're deciding what to watch.
And so that position in the viewer journey is a big competitive advantage, and it allows us to grow the scale and engagement in the Roku Channel with much smaller content budgets than other companies that have similar scale have to spend in order to reach that sort of -- in order to achieve that kind of reach. And so it's a big competitive advantage in our business model. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Two questions. Sorry, there was an echo. One, how much further does the company plan to go with DSP integrations? I think you called out 30 -- over 30 in the letter. Are you fully deployed with the major DSPs and agency trading desks? Just maybe help us understand what inning. And then second question, Dan, can you give us your philosophy for guidance? Like what's a reasonable kind of upside, downside range? Even if no numbers, just philosophically, I think just that would help investors kind of better set expectations. Jason, this is Anthony. We're making great progress with third-party DSPs, but it's still early in sort of our journey there and tapping into that demand source. But I'll let Charlie talk about it more. . Thanks, Jason. We are seeing meaningful success with our early efforts to scale third-party DSPs. We broadened our relationships with a full spectrum of not just third-party DSPs but also third-party supply and demand partners. We're -- as you noted, we're there with over 30 programmatic partners, both big and small, to answer your question, and we're spending -- we're seeing them spend on the Roku platform through automated third-party demand sources and also obviously directly with us, and that grew meaningfully year-over-year in the third quarter. A lot of it has to do with a concerted effort to meet marketers where they wish to transact. And that's been successful. It allows us to diversify demand and to demonstrate the full power and breadth of Roku's capabilities, really no matter how an investment in Roku is transacted. And it also has allowed us to be a really flexible partner in multiple ways across the markets we serve.
So the initial results prove the benefits of the strategy. And beyond just growing revenue, the feedback has been terrific, and we're often called our partner's most productive supplier of CTV impressions. And as Anthony said, the good news is these are still early days.
I should say there's no silver bullet. The programmatic market faces the same overall macro challenges as other marketplaces, including categories like insurance that are not back as robustly as several other categories. Overall, though, our embrace of third-party partners of all kinds continues and the results should continue to be positive.
We work sort of client by client to set up the best ways to build their businesses and to prove the unique value of Roku. I do want to note, I sort of say this every quarter, but it's important. Much of our unique first party and ACR data, along with our specialized ad products, our original programming and many of the unique elements of the Roku UI, which deliver at a scale that few others can offer, I mean, these features will continue to remain accessible only through Roku. And it's this diversity of market-facing options that allows us to manage both demand diversification on the one hand and then product and pricing distinction on the other. Jason, I'll take the second part of that question on guidance. obviously, we performed far better than what we said when we issued our 8-K in early September. And the reason for that was we did have a 606 adjustment that we talked about in the letter that I talked about earlier. We had a great September and Q3 on video ads revenue. We had a very strong content distribution quarter as well. And we saw the opportunity to go even a little deeper in our operating cost savings. And so a lot of that played in to what resulted in Q3.
And going forward, the ad market is variable. It's challenging. A lot of ads are running closer to air dates. That does create some variability within a quarter. It's a very uneven ad market recovery. We're doing our best to forecast that. We think we've got a good handle on that. Content distribution activities is less seasonal and slightly more predictable. But the guidance is to give the best view that we have at the start of the quarter when we give the guidance. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's like overly conservative. It's not overly aggressive. We don't give a range for a reason. We give what we believe is our best view at the time that we give this call. Our next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Could you please provide some color on what drove the net ads acceleration specifically? You pointed to a couple of things in your letter, but anything that you can point to, if it was specific to this quarter, something that was onetime or just the trends that you saw. And my next question is anything you want to call out on macro. There are a couple of other advertising platforms that did call out impact from the Israel war. Anything that you saw or just the overall brand sentiment right now and in Q3? This is Anthony. I'll ask Mustafa to see if he has any color on what drove our net adds in the quarter. And then I think your second part of your question was about political ads. The war. [indiscernible] Charlie can take. This is Mustafa. Thank you for the question. In terms of the drivers of the net add in the quarter. It's a combination of strong growth in the international markets as well as in the U.S. market. Yes. Although we're approaching half of the broadband households in the U.S., we still continue to grow, and we still see growth opportunities as the ship is streaming is happening in the U.S., followed by the international markets. .
Overall, both the TV devices and the player devices were contributing to the growth in general. TVs are slightly higher than the players because of the international markets that we have a strong share of TVs at the players because of the mix of the devices used by the consumers in those markets.
Overall, just looking at the international, we are doing really well in Latin America. In Mexico, we are the #1 selling TV OS, launched the Roku Channel, which continues to grow in reach and engagement, and we are beginning to monetize in Mexico. And again, the improvement that we're doing in engagement and improves we're doing with the distribution with our TV partners and with our player devices, we see continued growth in Mexico.
Again, we have more than 10 TV partners in Mexico, and they are all growing their market share, and that's helping us to get again the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico. Equally, we're growing in other markets like Brazil. We have a strong growth in Brazil. And just like Mexico, Brazil is a large country in terms of number of households, so that's helping us to drive our net adds. I'll just add really quick to that. On the international, it's definitely a big tailwind for us. But on the ARPU side, which, of course, takes the actives into account, while we were down 7% at [ 413 ] year-on-year, we did see sequential change. That's on a 12-month trail basis. We did see a sequential growth in ARPU, which is a big positive despite a very solid net active adds quarter. And then we also look at it on a quarterly. We don't share it out, but the quarterly ARPU, also had a year-on-year change, positive change. So really good ARPU in addition to a very strong net active adds for the quarter. This is Anthony again. I'll add just a couple of other observations about net adds. One is we are continuing to see a shift in consumers' minds to selecting value-oriented products, and we excel in the value segment of TV. That helped us. And then also, I think we're also continuing to see consumers selecting larger screen size Roku TVs, which is also beneficial because they tend be consumers that -- the larger screen sizes tend to be in the main room of the house. And so it's a great spot to be in. And then, Charlie, do you want to talk about further... Sure. Yes. Thanks for -- Shweta, thanks for the question about the conflict. Thus far, we are not seeing a direct impact to ad spend the conflict. I would, of course, like most companies experience impact from it to the extent that it affects the macro environment. But again, we're not seeing a direct impact has been from it yet. . Our next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. My first question is on the upfront. Can you give some more details, like how did upfront pricing compare to last year? I mean I think last year, you said you had 1 billion plus in commitments. I mean did you continue to gain share? So any details on specifically on the pricing? Because as in the scatter market, as you open up your DSP to working with third-party DSPs, are you open to price discovery below that level of the upfront? And so how do you trade off the fill rate versus CPMs and margins? Ruplu, this is Anthony. Charlie, obviously, you can take that question. . I was hoping you'd say it. Thanks, Ruplu. Look, I'm not going to break out the upfronts, except to say you'll be pleased with our numbers overall whether they come in the broadcast upfront calendar, upfront scatter as the blend you just described. I'll start by saying, look, I'm pleased to report that we did do well in terms of total upfront dollars to the platform.
It's interesting, as I said in last quarter's earnings call, this year was a very different one for everyone across the industry because it preceded at such a slower pace than usual. And despite the pace, it closed on time as we knew it would, and we're pleased with the outcome. It was interesting to me because the sales team pretty much pivoted from closing the upfront right into focusing on scatter. And one trend you see is advertisers are still spending closer to air dates. I think that will continue, and we certainly saw evidence of that in the third quarter.
So when I look at total dollars, we did well. We continue to take share from the overall TV market because of a combination of our unique scale, the data we offer and compelling Roku-only offerings. Again, business tends to keep coming in late as we keep highlighting, but the ad recovery itself is uneven, as Dan mentioned, across categories. So that's just making forecasting particularly challenging. But as broadcast and linear entertainment impressions continue to decline, Ruplu -- as a reminder, by the way, global hours on Roku grew 22% year-over-year, while linear hours in the U.S. declined 15%. So the gap is significant.
So as this continues, I believe CTV in general and Roku specifically, will continue to be planned and bought earlier in the process. So overall, advertisers engage with Roku on the upfront. I talked a little bit about our third-party DSPs. We're seeing great engagement there, too. And we're seeing, again, later than usual, but we're seeing that engagement in scatter as well.
We've talked a lot about having nearly half the broadband households in the U.S. and the unique advantages of that scale in our data and our ad products like Roku City or shoppable ads or some of the powerful tools we use to attract and engage and retain audiences, I think all of that is what's seeing us drive that success. Got it. And just for a quick follow-up. If M&A spend remains weak, are there things you can do to monetize the home screen and screen saver differently that is diversified to other end markets? So any thoughts there? Congrats on the quarter. Let me start on M&A. And I'm sure Charlie has things to say on that topic as well. So I think -- well, first of all, I'll just say that, as I said before, we're the #1 TV streaming platform. We distribute lots of streaming services and apps and content, where, often, if not usually their #1 distribution platform on television. And this relationship, the scale of our relationship with viewers and with content apps generates a lot of different revenue streams for us beyond just M&E. And you can see this in our Q3 results. In Q3, M&E was pressured but we still grew the platform revenue 18%. And so those are -- so that implies, obviously, these other revenue streams are doing well. .
And then when it comes to M&E promotions, specifically, just in case everyone doesn't know what that, that is, as we expose the TV viewing UI to our viewers and as they browse around, we integrate promotions for different types of content into the user experience. And we do it in ways that are effective in driving engagement, ways to build subscriptions but also ways that are super viewer friendly. So it's something we're good at. We put a lot of effort into it. It's a win-win for everyone. It's good for our business. It leverages the fact that one of our key assets is the user interface for selecting content. So it's an area that we continue to invest in, an area that I think we're best in class, an area that we're going to continue to invest in.
And M&E is down right now because of the current state of the economy and the ad cycle, but it's an area that I think has long-term potential. I don't know, Charlie, do you want to add? Sure. Thanks, Anthony. And Ruplu, thanks for the congratulations. We talked a lot about diversifying demand, and Anthony talked about integrating all sorts of different advertisers and promotion into the UI beyond M&E, and that's right. And maybe I'll just add that stepping back, I think it's good to think about how versatile a partner Roku is both to M&E and to other advertisers who need to prove that their marketing is working. We have top of the funnel and bottom of the funnel impact, and we're building upon it. So just on M&E, look, we're a business builder for our media and entertainment partners, not just a place for them to invest. And that's because we make their services and content, we use the word unmissable a lot, unmissable across the full funnel from broad reach acquisition right through to engagement.
And in the case of M&E partners on Roku, that literally means, right? You see their ads on our platform and the integration Anthony talked about. Viewer will click here and watch the video here, too. So that is the ultimate endemic advertiser for us. And we're starting to see that impact beyond M&E. So we're effective and accountable. And what's interesting is we're finding each of our partners has individual ways of seeing the power of the Roku platform to help them build their business. And so simultaneously, we can benefit the customers, really the consumers, the advertisers and our M&E channel partners, and we sort of relish all 3 opportunities.
Anthony talked about the short-term pain that the M&E category is facing because of the difficult ad sales market, limited fall release schedules and the general uncertainty. And I mentioned earlier that last fourth quarter, there were some pretty big promotional moments from the World Cup to midterm elections. But I got to tell you, the temporary economic cycles do not dampen the enormous opportunity that we see in working with our streaming partners. We just have the reach and the scale and the powerful tools, both to win ourselves but also to help them win.
Just a few examples. We produced some branded content that builds viewer loyalty. One of our partners actually leans on advanced Roku machine learning to optimize their creative executions for them so they can proactively reduce churn and improve win backs. And there's lots of examples like this, and it's not just the large partners this is really effective media. And if you're a Roku user, you probably noticed that a couple of weeks ago, we had a fan experience around the new season of Apple's The Morning Show. And this content was exclusively available on the Roku platform. It included unlocked new material, free episodes, exclusive interviews and a 3-month free extended trial for Apple TV Plus subscribers.
So the breadth and depth of this promotion is a perfect example of what I've been talking about in this question but answering a couple of others, we're the right place for M&E and other partners to invest to build engagement and we'll do more of it and we'll measure it uniquely for them and will improve the impact. And this is Anthony again. Just maybe touch back on your question, the other part of your question, which was what's beyond M&E in the user experience, I think, is sort of how I interpreted that question. And it's innovating ways to create ways for viewers to discover content and also to create experiences that they find compelling in our user interface and then integrate promotion, marketing sales into those experiences is a big part of our strategy of monetizing our installed base. And so this an area that we have invested in historically. I think we lead in it, and it's an area that we continue to invest in.
Just some examples. When we launched the Sports Zone, for example, which is a big pain point for viewers, how do they find which is the many streaming services their favorite game is being played on currently. It was -- that Sports Experience when we launched it was sponsored by T-Mobile, so which is not a traditional M&E advertiser for us.
And then another example, Roku City has become super popular with our viewers become a cultural phenomenon. It used to have only M&E-based ads. We started adding buildings like we added the McDonald's building, for example, which is a big hit. So these are the kinds of things we're doing. And these are things that -- these are promotions and advertising and viewer experiences that everyone loves, advertisers love them, our peers look them. So it's a big -- it's certainly a huge area of focus for us. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but as we just look at the gross margin performance of platform in the quarter, is it right to think about some of the year-on-year and sequential weakness as being driven by the M&E market, that that's some of the highest gross margin revenue. And so as that trends into Q4 and could even be a little bit weak in Q1, should we just be thinking about a little bit of pressure. So I'd love some color there. .
And then, Dan, when you think about the OpEx growth heading out -- sorry, heading down to mid-teens in Q4. You've done a lot on costs. There were some in the 8-K, and I think you've continued to work on it. Is that a good way [indiscernible] be down mid-teens. I know you've had investment projects in the past. So I just want to make sure if that's a decent run rate or if there's anything more ahead on the OpEx side. Yes, I'll take that. Thanks for the question, Steven. On the gross margin side, the platform gross margin of 56% backing out the impairment charges that we talked about for Q3, was a very strong. Gross margin quarter for us, it was up 3 points sequentially. As we look -- as you look forward, and yes, on a year-over-year basis, there is an impact on the mix of M&E. It is our -- one of our highest margin products within advertising. And there's also different margin structures within the different content distribution activities as well as within display versus video versus M&E advertising.
So when we look at margins, we look at them and we want all of them to go up and to the right as we improve margins, but we're very focused on absolute gross profit dollars, which leads to absolute free cash flow, which is obviously a North Star for us.
But to answer your question on guidance, we did have a 606 adjustment in Q3 that did add 200 basis points of margin to platform. We don't -- there's no guidance to give for that because, of course, that depends on the forecast that we have at the end of the quarter for 606 adjustments. But we do feel good about gross margins ex that 606 adjustment and where they are on a go-forward basis. But mix will play an impact on that based on the M&E market, which does continue to remain challenged. And we're expecting that business to be challenged going forward.
So that gives you a little bit of color on how to think about gross margins. To your question on OpEx, we guided to a gross profit of $405 million for Q4 and an EBITDA of $10 million. You all will do the math. That puts OpEx in that $500 million to $510 million range. From a go forward perspective, we'll give more guidance for 2024 next quarter when we do Q4 results. But I would anticipate low single-digit growth rates from a run rate basis off that. But because we are focused on driving towards the positive adjusted EBITDA, but we're also going to balance that with growth and look at positive ROI initiatives and invest in those as we look at -- to expand our scale and our monetization. Our next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. . Could you please discuss your thoughts about the carriage deals in the legacy world, such as Charter and Disney, where the streaming apps are becoming more prevalent on those cable systems? How might that impact your business model or plans? And if you could marry that thought with the increasing pricing on the streaming services, do you -- how do you think the consumer is reacting to all of the streaming choice out there and the pricing versus the legacy model in terms of how that could impact your streaming trajectory? David, this is Anthony. Well, I think at a high level, the agreements like you just highlighted, also highlight the importance of streaming in the current and future TV ecosystem. So the fact that pay TV operators are more actively trying to promote streaming offerings, I think just shows -- it just makes it very clear that streaming of the future. And we're the #1 streaming platform in the United States. We're in a great position to continue to benefit as the world and the country shifts to streaming. .
in the U.S., for example, our active account base is bigger than the largest 3 pay TV providers combined, which is also -- I think when we started Roku, people would have thought that would never happen. We're the #1 TV streaming platform in the country by our stream and these both -- and we've built both of these positions while competing with very large competitors.
So I think we're well positioned to continue to monetize viewer activity engagement on our platform no matter where the viewers attain their streaming convention -- streaming subscription credentials. So I just think we're in a great position. And these pay TV companies are trying to figure out how to make the transition to streaming but is going to be very tricky and very difficult for them to do that.
And I think if you look at the Roku platform, it serves not just viewers that are cord cutters and just sign it for Netflix and YouTube and the Roku Channel. But also we do serve pay TV operators, pay-TV customers. Virtual TV services are very popular, even non-virtual TV services like, for example, I personally live in a spectrum area, and I use Roku obviously to watch television that I also subscribe to the Spectrum app, which is a great app on Roku  well.
So I think that we're great at selling subscriptions. We monetize all viewer activity not just by selling subscriptions, and we monetize viewers no matter how they obtain their streaming credentials and we're extremely well positioned to continue to do well as the world shifts to streaming. I think our big headline is going to be that you watch TV through Roku. Surprising. And I have a Pay TV subscription, right, but it's through the Spectrum app on Roku.
And then you asked about the impact of increasing the price increases on streaming. I mean it's a natural evolution of the ecosystem. It will raise overall streaming revenue. And I think we've seen so far, it's been good for our business because we have a large business distributing content services. We do billing. We have revenue share arrangements. We have a lot of different arrangements that result in that being positive for our business overall. . Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Anthony, a lot of your streaming partners, your media and entertainment companies are losing billions of dollars, and Wall Street is putting a lot of pressure on them. I'm sure you've seen their stock prices. They have multiyear, even multi-decade lows. What can Roku do to help them accelerate revenue growth and reduce costs? Like what are the options or what types of creative things could you do to help these companies that are really struggling in their streaming businesses? Well, I mean, as they transform their businesses to streaming first companies, I mean, there's a lot of ways we can help them. We -- that's what we do, actually, is our core, is connect viewers with streaming services and advertisers. And we do it in a lot of different ways. We have a lot of products that can help them build their businesses whether they're trying to build an ad-supported business or whether they're trying to build a subscription business. We've spent a lot of time putting those features into our platform, thinking deeply about it. And so just in terms of effectiveness for them and spending dollars to make the transition to streaming and to sign up new subscribers, we're, by far, the most efficient and effective platform to do that marketing platform. So that's one.
Two is there's different ways for those companies to distribute their service. They can create apps and a lot of companies are trying to do that. But that's a heavy lift. I mean when you do your own direct-to-consumer service, create your own app, it requires a lot of technical expertise. It requires a lot of marketing expertise. It requires a lot of a lot of money to acquire customers and retain customers and build user experiences. And the other way is for those companies to work with Roku and integrate into our overall user experience with what we call premium subscriptions, which is a way for them to offer SVOD services but without doing the heavy lifting of building their own app and figuring how to become data science experts and how to build engagement when people might be using -- customers might be in a different user experience.
And so those are -- that's another way a content partner or -- or sorry, a studio that transport sorry, streaming company -- a media company that's transitioning to streaming can much more efficiently build their business without building a lot of new streaming and expertise and with focusing more on what they're good at, which is the content in their programming. So those are a few examples. I don't know if want to, Charlie... Rich, one thing we talk about a lot is Roku is a really powerful engagement engine. So as people are moving from certainly subscription services to now embracing ad sales, we can help them drive engagement, and we're seeing that a lot. It's a really big shift even cyclically moving from trying to get people to subscribe and not churn to getting them to watch the shows and the commercials. And so we're really good at driving engagement, and we're having a lot of positive response and seeing the impact of our media as we help our M&E partners drive engagement. And then another thing we're doing is windowing differently with the studios. So you're going to see a lot -- we're very efficient, as Anthony said, with respect to our programming costs, and we're a really good partner for the studios as well in that respect because we're window that hasn't existed before, and we can monetize it in different ways because of the power of the UI that Anthony mentioned. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Two questions Okay. I wanted to ask you guys about live programming. You guys mentioned in the letter quite a bit, growth in live and the investments in live and I think back to years ago, people probably thought live TV was going to die and streaming would be all on demand. What -- any sense for how much of your viewing is done through by viewing and whether that's an opportunity for you guys in terms of monetization? I would imagine it would have greater ad loads, maybe greater overall engagement levels, and I think a lot of the investments you guys have made in content and products are around driving fast channels and a lot of the Roku Channel is built, particularly sports, around live. So I'd love to hear some thoughts on whether that's something we should be thinking about as a tailwind to the business.
And then I just want to ask, Dan, on the North Star comment on free cash flow. You guys generated, I think, about $150 million year-to-date. Any expectations you can share this for the year or the fourth quarter just to get a sense for what you think free cash flow might shake out for 2023? I'll take the first part on live and then, Dan, obviously, will take the second part. So yes, I mean, well, first of all, let me just define live. So live in the streaming world, at least on our platform means content that is truly live, like a sports game or an awards show. But it also means content that is just programmed linearly because it's hard to call it a linear -- I'm just explaining this for other listeners. So when you call it a linear channel, that doesn't -- viewers don't respond to that. So we call the whole category of linear viewing live.
And then live is something we've been focused on for at least a couple of years now. And we've built out a lot of great experiences to promote live content. There's a live menu in our left-hand tab on our home screen. We built an EPG, the electronic program guy, which is sort of like a traditional cable box UI for live programming. That's also very popular. And we continue to put a lot of effort into things like our machine learning algorithms drive tuning of live. And it's very popular.
It surprised me actually how popular it is. I was wondering be thought maybe it would fade away, but it's not true. It turns out there's lots of people that don't want to have to -- don't want to pick a show. They just want to flip through a few channels and find something that catches their attention.
So it's a big growth area for us. It will probably continue to be a big growth area is especially important internationally, where linear is still super big. So there's a lot of different categories, different types of content, whether it's live or VOD, AVOD or SVOD or TVOD. And we put a lot of effort into all those types of content. But live is popular and growing fast. We're also actually airing some live events. We have Formula E coming up, and we've done some great work with the Miss Universe Pageant. And so there are opportunities there. But also live is confusing often to the viewer of the way so many of these sports packages are being split up. So Anthony mentioned it earlier, but our Sports Zone is an incredible tool for viewers to figure out how to navigate. And actually, the consumer experience team does an amazing job helping viewers navigate to the live events that they'd like to find. So it's another platform advantage as well.
They come through our front door. We make it delightful and simple for them to find what they want to watch and get where they want to go. And we're always looking for ways to help our viewers. So for example, we have something called tune-in reminders, which is a way for a viewer to like be reminded when a live event is about to air. And they can click on an ad for an event and it can schedule a tune in a reminder for them where they'll get a notice. So it's definitely an area we're also innovating in as well. On free cash flow, thanks for the question on that. And yes, you're right, 3, 3 quarters, we had about $161 million of positive free cash flow, $239 million in this most recent quarter. We're very focused on free cash flow. And with respect to Q4, we will have some restructuring charges that get paid out in Q4, so I need to wait and see like the timing of that relative to our working capital. Obviously, Q4 is a big advertising quarter for us. But a lot of that collection doesn't come until Q1. And then Q1 also is a big payment for us through some of our sales and marketing channels.
That said, I think that EBITDA is a very good proxy for free cash flow. We -- after several quarters of being capital intense, we are now capital light, and so EBITDA is going to be a pretty good proxy of free cash flow with some fluctuations in working capital from quarter-to-quarter. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Anthony Wood for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining.

I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Conrad Grodd. Thank you, operator.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. Looking back at 2023, I'm proud of our execution. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow a year ahead of schedule by focusing on operational improvements and platform revenue growth, which we grew double digits. We also drove record growth in our scale and engagement. A large share of my management team's attention in 2023 was spent on OpEx reduction and internal operational improvements. This year, we will be redirecting much of our attention to platform growth and innovation where I see lots of opportunity. A core strategy for us is to take better advantage of our position as the programmer of the home screen for our 80 million active accounts globally. We use this to grow ad reach, which correlates to ad revenue, as well as to grow our streaming service distribution activities. 
For example, Roku City is popular for the way it seamlessly integrates iconic brand imagery like McDonald's Golden Arches as well as movies and TV show promotions in ways that are delightful for viewers. Newer examples include our All Things Food and All Things Home viewer experiences, which aggregate the best culinary and home and garden content on the Roku platform; or the Roku sports experience, which aggregates sporting events in a single central location. These are some early examples, and we are focused on improving these early efforts as well as new experiences to engage viewers and help them find content across the streaming universe in ways that also drive monetization. 
Thinking about the state of the industry, I see 2 trends that are particularly important for us. One is the enormous volume of streaming content. As I just mentioned, helping our viewers easily navigate and find what they want to watch is a big opportunity for Roku. Second, the industry has increased its focus now more than ever on building thriving and sustainable businesses. This means more ad-supported streaming service tiers, which will further accelerate the overall shift of ad dollars from traditional TV to streaming. Roku has the tools and expertise to help streaming services grow engagement, which is critical in an ad-supported environment. We expect strong demand for ad-supported tiers on Roku as many users seek value price streaming options. 
With our platform advantages, loved brand, first-party relationships with 80 million active accounts and deep user engagement, we are well-positioned to accelerate revenue growth in future years. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss our results. Thanks, Anthony. In Q4, we grew active accounts by 4.2 million, ending 2023 with 80 million. Full year net adds of 10 million were above 2019 and similar to 2022 levels, driven primarily by the Roku TV program in the U.S. and international markets. We're also growing engagement on our platform with 2023 streaming hours up 18.6 billion year-over-year to a record 106 billion hours. We grew both Q4 and full year streaming hours 21% year-over-year. Average streaming hours per active account per day were 4.1 hours in Q4 2023, up from 3.8 hours in Q4 2022 and 3.6 hours in Q4 2021. Average viewing time on traditional TV is 7.5 hours per day in the U.S., providing significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our engagement.
In Q4, total net revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $984 million. Platform revenue was $829 million, up 13% year-over-year, driven by both streaming services distribution and video advertising activities, offset by M&E. Streaming services distribution activities grew faster than overall platform revenue, benefiting from increased subscription sign-ups along with recent price increases from SVOD partners. However, the year-over-year growth rate of streaming services distribution in Q4 was lower than the year-over-year growth rate in Q3 due to tougher comps in Q4.
Devices revenue increased 15% year-over-year in Q4, driven by Roku-branded TVs, which launched in March 2023. ARPU was $39.92 in Q4 on a trailing 12-month basis, down 4% year-over-year, reflecting an increasing share of active accounts in international markets where we are currently focused on growing scale and engagement. Q4 total gross margin was 44%. Q4 platform gross margin of 55% was stable year-over-year and sequentially when excluding the $62 million restructuring charge in Q3 related to the removal of select license and produced content from the Roku Channel. Q4 devices margin was negative 13%, which was up roughly 19 points year-over-year as a result of improved supply chain costs and limited promotional discounts.
Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $48 million, which was $38 million above our outlook. The better-than-expected performance was driven by our platform segment, along with improvements to our operating expense profile. Please note that a onetime charge of $42 million primarily related to lease impairments and workforce reductions was added back to adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow was $176 million on a trailing 12-month basis, and we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Let me turn to our outlook for the first quarter. We anticipate total net revenue of $850 million, gross profit of $370 million, with gross margin of 43.5%, and breakeven adjusted EBITDA. While we remain mindful of the challenging macro environment and uneven ad market recovery, we plan to increase revenue and free cash flow and a deep profitability over time. For total net revenue, we anticipate a seasonal percentage decline in line with Q1 2023. We will face difficult year-over-year growth rate comparison in streaming services distribution and a challenging M&E environment for the rest of this year. We expect to maintain our Q4 2023 year-over-year platform growth rate of 13% in Q1. 
We expect a continued mix shift away from M&E activities, which will compress platform margins in the near term. For Q1, we expect platform margin to be similar to Q1 of last year of roughly 52%. On the Devices side, we expect margins to improve from negative 13% in Q4 to negative mid-single digits in Q1. Our outlook for this sequential improvement reflects a lighter retail promotional period in Q1. 
Turning to OpEx. We anticipate Q1 year-over-year growth rate to negative low to mid-teens, a significant improvement from OpEx year-over-year growth of approximately 40% in Q1 '23. We'll continue to operate our business with discipline with a focus on driving increasingly positive free cash flow over time. After achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023, we expect to deliver further improvements for full year 2024. As we've stated previously, we'll balance this commitment with reinvestment to continue to expand our scale, engagement and monetization. 
With that, let's take questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shyam Patil with Susquehanna International Group. Nice job on the execution. I had a couple of questions. The first one, what are the biggest priorities for Roku this year, Anthony? And then just a follow-up on Amazon, how are you guys thinking about the Prime AVOD launch? Is this a threat? Is this an opportunity? Maybe if you could talk about that a little bit. Shyam, thanks for that. This is Anthony. Well, like I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, last year, 2023, as a management team, we were very focused on improving our operational effectiveness efficiencies, rightsizing OpEx, and we made a lot of progress in that area, achieving positive EBITDA for the full year, a year ahead of our target. So we're very happy with that. I mean, obviously, we're going to continue this year to push on operational efficiencies. But we'll have a lot more time this year as a management team to focus on innovation and growth, and that's where I'll be spending a lot of my time is just driving some of the -- or improving and adding things to our platform that will drive more growth over the long term. So that's a big focus for us in 2024 is innovation and growth.
And maybe I could just give a couple of examples of the kinds of things that we're doing there, just to give you a flavor for it. I mean there's a lot of things -- there's a lot of opportunity in this area. But -- so one example is I made some organizational changes recently. And one of the changes is that I tasked one of our most strategic executives who reports to me to focus on driving our subscription business. And we have a large subscription business, both Roku Channel premium subscriptions as well as building and driving subscriptions for our streaming service partners. So it's not something that's new to us, but it's something that could be a lot larger and is a big opportunity for us. And so we're consolidating all the activities under one leader who reports to me. We're going to increase resources there. And I just think it's something that we can make a lot of good progress on. So that's one example.
Another example is one of our core strategies in monetization is to take advantage of our -- the fact that 80 million households -- approximately 80 million households turn on their TV and start their streaming experience with Roku. The first thing they see when they turn on their TV is the Roku home screen, and it's the place where they start to decide what do they want to watch -- what are they going to watch. And so one of the things that we do is we build viewer experiences to engage viewers that are entertaining and to help them decide where -- which app they want to run, what TV shows they want to watch. And you can see that in things -- just, for example, there are features that we've already launched to do this. So for example, we have the sports zone. Sports is an area that's particularly challenging for viewers because it's so fragmented. It's hard for them to figure out where the game that they want to watch is playing, it changes by day of week; it changes based on the league, it's just very complex.
And so our Sports Zone helps viewers find games, figure out where they're playing, learn more about sports on the platform. That's one example. Things we've launched more recently, All Things Food, which helps -- which where we curate the best food content across our platform, what to watch. So these are the kinds of experiences we're working on. We call this programming our home screen, and it's a core strategy for us. It's a big area of focus. And it's basically a key strategy for us to engage with our viewers while they're trying to decide what to watch and use that to drive viewing in both our owned and operated apps, but also in third-party apps. So it drives monetization. At the same time, it helps solve big problem viewers have, which is trying to decide what to watch across all the content in the streaming universe. So those are just 2 examples, but a big focus on innovation and growth for our management team this year.
And then I think your second question was about AVOD launches. So maybe what I'll say there, just kind of taking it up a level. One of the trends that's happening right now in the streaming world is that the streaming industry is maturing. So if you take AVOD, for example, I mean a couple of years ago, all the streaming services were just very focused on driving subscribers at almost any cost. Now the industry is very focused on building sustainable thriving businesses. And one of the tools that's being used is ad support -- entry-level ad supported tiers to streaming services. The mainstream solution is something that the industry has done since the beginning for television. So it's not new. But for me, it's a sign that the industry is really starting to mature and, I think, the streaming industry.
And I think if you -- another example of, I think, evidence that the streaming industry is starting to mature is sports. I mean we're seeing new sport services launched. It used to be that you couldn't get access to sports content without having a subscription to traditional pay-TV. That's really changed. Almost all sports, if not all sports, are now available. Unless there's been channels on streaming that's very fragmented, it's hard for viewers to figure out where to watch it, but it's there and it's an opportunity for us.
So I think both of these examples, more sports coming to streaming, the rise of AVOD tiers and streaming are examples of the industry maturing. And I think what that means is that we're going to see even more viewers moving to streaming, and in particular, more ad dollars moving to streaming.
So for example -- I mean in the U.S. alone, the TV ad business is over $60 billion, but there's still this really large gap between viewership and ad spend. Approximately 60% of streaming -- sorry, approximately 60% of TV viewing hours are on streaming versus traditional pay-TV, but only about 30% of the ad dollars are on connected TV. So that's a huge gap that, as the industry matures, will start to close. So -- and I guess that's one. I think one aspect of AVOD is this maturing of the industry. And I don't think it will accelerate cord cutting, it will accelerate the shift of ad dollars moving to streaming.
The other thing, I guess, I would say is as the programmer of the home screen for 80 million active accounts, we're good at and well-positioned to help drive across our platform. And we do that to promote our owned and operated services like I mentioned, but we also -- we can use -- we also do it regularly to promote third-party services across our platform. And in particular, ad-supported services are very reliant on engagement. Engagement is highly correlated to revenue if you have ads. And we're in a great position to help drive ad support and engagement across our platform. So we expect it to continue to be a good business and growing for us to do that. So that's just a couple of examples. Our next question is from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Great. Two, if I can. First, Anthony, I was hoping you could elaborate just on some of the progress you've made with third-party partnerships on the ad tech side and retail media networks over the past year. What have you learned from those initial integrations? And how should we think about that? Is it just a bigger part of the business going forward?
And then perhaps for Dan, I appreciate your commentary on EBITDA being profitable over the course of the year. But how should we think about just the puts and takes of what that -- what really drives the overall margin expansion and potentially how you might be reinvesting some strength you might be back at driving innovation and future platform growth? Justin, thanks for that. I'll let Charlie take the third-party partnership question. Thanks, Anthony, and thanks, Justin, for the question. When I think about our focus on demand diversification, which continues to be a huge priority for us, and our embrace of third-party relationships, underlying both of them are focused on expanding upon the many ways we build our businesses. We're opening up new ways to prove the unique value of Roku, and we'll continue to do that in whichever ways are best for our clients to execute their marketing and advertising campaign. So in '23, we did make real progress expanding our relationships with third-party platforms, Justin, including retail media networks, DSPs and other strategic partners.
And as a result, we've increased our roster of advertisers. Programmatic ad spend continues to grow on the platform and ad investment grew. Third-party DSP is also growing well. Our strategies really have allowed us to tap into do budgets from existing advertisers while also growing and diversifying the number of new advertisers on Roku. We built tech and enhanced relationships that actually make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, easier than ever before, to access the Roku platform. And many of these are small, but they have the potential to grow into large advertisers for us.
So to name some names for you. Over the past year, we formed partnerships with a broad variety of third parties. Actually, you mentioned retail platforms. We had DoorDash, Instacart, Cox and Best Buy. We've expanded third-party DSP relationships now to really participate with all the major DSPs and SSPs, and we're partnering also with new measurement partners like iSpot and Comscore. So overall, Justin, we are serving more partners and advertisers. And we really continue to improve and expand on the performance and measurement capabilities that Roku is providing for them. So on a third-party -- overall, I'm very pleased with our third-party partnerships, both in terms of our progress and our growth. I'll take the next question. Justin, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. On the -- on your question on EBITDA and some of the puts and takes, let me just talk a little bit about Q1 and the full year. And as we mentioned earlier, streaming services distribution performed very well in FY '23, with very strong year-over-year growth rates. And video advertising really rebounded well in the second half of 2023, and we expect both those areas to continue to grow in 2024.
We did comment on the M&E challenges that we faced in FY '23 and that we expect the M&E markets to continue to be challenged this year. So this will ultimately result in a difficult year-over-year comp on the platform side because of the strong growth in SSD and the challenging M&E environment. And if we EM&E accelerate from its current levels, it will have a positive impact on margins and our EBITDA, both on -- if we see it on the SVOD and the AVOD side, we'll grow subscribers and engagement across the platform, and that will have a positive impact for us.
On the margin side, we guided platform margin in Q1 to 52%, which was similar to Q1 of last year. We're not providing guidance going forward, but I would anticipate that our gross margin to improve on the platform side, slightly from the Q1 levels as our volume of revenue growth, we do have some fixed costs up in platform margins. And I would expect us to see some sequential improvement in gross margin going forward.
And then on the -- lastly, on the OpEx side. We ended Q4 at just over $500 million in OpEx, if you adjust for our Q4 impairment and restructuring charge. We talked a little bit about this in last quarter, it's similar to this quarter. If you annualize that out, and apply a mid-single-digit growth rate, that's the way I'm thinking of OpEx for 2024. And as we've stated previously, we do expect to see further improvements in 2024 in adjusted EBITDA.
We had a very strong free cash flow year in 2023. We expect to be positive on free cash flow in 2024. And lastly to where you see the reinvestment, Anthony touched on this in the earlier question. We have multiple areas on the monetization side that we'll reinvest in, specifically on our subscriptions business as we look to expand that and accelerate that. And we have a lot of other initiatives on ad product and the monetization side that we'll continue to reinvest as we look forward to accelerating growth in the years to come. Our next question is from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Let me try 2, please. One is on just the overall ad demand trends that you saw in Q4 and into Q1 so far. And specifically, as it relates to certain key verticals that you could comment on or just the scatter market health and the caution or the lack of among -- or the improvement of sentiment among brand advertisers. That's question one. And just a quick follow-up on how are you -- how should we be thinking about political impact this year for you? Shweta, thanks. This is Anthony, but Charlie will take those questions. Thank you. Good to hear from you, Shweta. Thanks for the questions. We continue to see actually a really solid rebound in video advertising in the fourth quarter. I'm really pleased with the way video advertising has strengthened in general, offsetting what has been and remains a challenging M&E marketplace.
Now all that said about M&E, it remains a really important category for Roku, and we are a unique and effective platform for driving engagement for our partners. And building our partners' businesses and driving engagement will always be core to Roku's success. So when that grows, we'll grow well.
However, by all accounts, the M&E category went through a period of spending at unsustainably high levels. And we're working with our partners now even more to help them figure out their shift to a greater ad-supported focus and success. Again, engagement is something Roku is best suited to help them with. So that's a good transition.
Now overall, in the market, to your question about categories, we're executing well, and I do expect the year-on-year growth rate of video advertising in the first quarter to be similar to what we saw in fourth quarter. There are ups and downs by verticals since you asked. To name a few specific categories: CPG, health and wellness and telecom are growing nicely. Categories like financial services and insurance are not recovering as quickly. So Shweta, overall, I feel really good heading into the new fronts, the upfront in '25. We'll continue to build upon our market-leading scale and platform advantages and we'll continue to elevate Roku's powerful ad products and tech offerings, all with a focus on diversifying demand and continuing to scale our ad-supported businesses.
I think your second question was about political. Political is growing for us. It's our tools and our tech make Roku a strategic platform for political advertising, both for those, by the way, targeting scale and also those looking for specificity. I will point out that in '24, we expect political to grow, but it will likely remain a relatively small contributor as a percentage of our whole really diverse ad business. We know political obviously; it's a big opportunity and a big market. And as this category, like others, shifts from linear to CTV, we'll be well-positioned.
We have some product updates that will help us tap into these budgets more and more in the future. We're making those updates to our platform as well as other refinements that we'll make moving forward. So overall, Shweta, we expect political to grow over time. For now, it will grow, but it will remain a relatively modest part of the overall ad mix at Roku. This is Anthony. I'll just add a comment on M&E. Although we've talked a lot about M&E being pressured, I will say that one of the -- it's still a big opportunity for us. We're very good at it. It's something that I expect to bounce back over time in the growth area over time. This year, it'll probably will continue to be pressured, we project. But the other thing we're doing is we're taking a lot of inventory and creating new inventory that we used to sell exclusively for M&E, and we're using it now for brand advertisers. We're opening -- we're increasing the number of advertisers we will give access to that inventory.
A good example of that, I think, is Roku City, which used to be entirely promotions for content, but we started selling buildings to McDonald's and companies like that, and that's gone extremely well for us. Viewers love it. It taps into new revenue sources. So we're going to continue to diversify the advertising in our home screen that we used to use exclusively just for M&E. We're going to start using that for brand advertisers as well. Our next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Great numbers, you guys. Congratulations. My first question is on the Roku-branded TVs. I know that we've been really worried about channel complex. So you were in Best Buy exclusively; now you're announcing you're going into Costco and Amazon. Can you tell us what your 30 OEMs are saying about you expanding? And what's the ultimate strategy? Are you going to have these Roku-branded TVs in every channel outlet? Can you help us look forward on the future of this product? Laura, it's Anthony. I'll let Mustafa talk about -- Mustafa will talk about revenues. Laura, thank you for the question. Look, as we announced the product and explained then, Roku-branded TVs are basically a complementary program to our existing Roku TV program. And we use the Roku TV as a way to innovate in a hardware software combination. Historically, we focused on software only in the Roku TV context. Now we are able to do more innovation using the hardware as well as the software and build much better products that can then be given to consumers. And also, we are sharing that with our 30-plus licensing partners. And we are very open about that. And then we -- some of the improvements and innovations that we have already developed as part of the initial launch of the program is already being fed into our Roku TV ecosystem. Our partners are already benefiting from those improvements. Some of them are cost improvements, being able to further lower the cost of the hardware. Some of them are performance improvements.
So both of these type of improvements have been shared with our partners, and we'll continue to do so. And in terms of distribution, definitely to make this program successful and then for us to operate as a program, we need to scale it a little bit more. And therefore, we are expanding our distribution because customers love the product. We are receiving great reviews every day. And we want to be able to offer these products with customers and get their feedback and then that will be, again, used as a way for us to further improve and add new capabilities, then we'll share with our Roku TV ecosystem partners. Super helpful. And then the other -- my second and last question is when we think about the user interface, I think one of the things -- I know you really love this whole city thing. But I think it's really ironic as you have a CTV business, and there's no video on the home page. And it feels like if you had some kind of carousel, you could not only put in cross-promoting your stuff instead of a still image, but also you could sort of get more money from video postage stamps on Page 1. Could you talk -- I know Anthony said you're focusing on the homepage more. That's one of your like tactical focuses in '23. Can you talk about other than just adding more brands to city? Are we going to see anything more -- I'm going to use the word engaging, for consumers from the Roku homepage in '24? Laura, this is Anthony. Absolutely. I mean it's a big area of focus for us. We mentioned our food zone: All Things Food. I mean that has been -- has gotten a great reception from our viewers. Just as an example, building out an experience this access from our home screen that integrates promotion, both static display promotion as well as it promotes video as well. And it's just -- it's a small example of the kinds of things that we're going to be doing. So it's not -- Roku City is one example, but there's lots of ways across the platform that we can drive, we can create experiences that will engage viewers that will provide monetization opportunities and that will drive more engagement across our platform.
So in terms of putting video directly on the home screen, it's not -- of course, it's something that we thought about and it's something that we're thinking about testing, but it's not an area that we've made any decisions on. And -- but I'll just say, I guess, the big picture is, there's a long list of ideas of how we can create viewer experiences that engage and entertain on our platform around the home screen. A lot of those do include video, but they're -- the video is something on the home screen that you have to approach carefully. There's always this concern that it might delineate some viewers, but some viewers love it. So it's just something that we'll keep looking at and testing. But overall, there's a long list of great things we can do to add to our own stance drive engagement. Our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Charlie, I have a question for you. And wanted to ask you to talk about how you price your scatter inventory, maybe help us triangulate your logic here in terms of how you do it relative to the upfront pricing relative to your competition. I mean we understand how it's done in linear TV. Is it the same? Because with the new entrants into the AVOD space, there is a lot of discussion what will happen to your pricing. There are industry press reports about where your CPMs are relative to your competitors. So can you tell us how you price your scatter inventory? And what kind of thinking goes into that? And what factors will make you raise your prices, drop your prices and so on? Just help us understand directionally how to think about that. Vasily, thank you so much for the question. Actually, I was looking at something yesterday, and the first thing you look at, as you said, in linear television also holds true in CTV, which is you want to see your upfront advertisers who come in early and make large commitments early. You want to see that pricing actually be less than what is occurring in scatter, and sure enough that's happening. Our scatter rates have been very solid and continue to be so. And I know there's been a lot of talk today about my beloved Roku City and All Things Food and some of those integrations.
What's remarkable about these integrations besides the fact that they're so immersive and engaging in their broad reach is that they're also scarce. So we look at what scarcity does to drive pricing and Anthony's last answer about the opportunities that we see, not just on the home stream, but throughout the entire streamer's journey. So many of the sponsorships that, as we said, used to be M&E only are now both M&E and non-endemic advertisers.
And what's terrific about that, not only does it open up that scarcity to new bidding and new advertisers, but it's also driving pricing. So I would say the upfront we look at, and those who have committed to us early have been rewarded and those coming in scatter are -- seem to be responding to our changes toward opening up the sponsorships as Anthony mentioned, and the pricing is growing in tandem with that. So we feel like that's working and it seems to be so both in fourth and continuing now. Do you feel that for advertisers, pricing is an important factor when they decide between, let's say, the Roku channel and other streaming opportunities? Well, look, obviously, price is something that they need to look at when they purchase. Our value has been great. We're also a performance platform. One of the things that are unmatched scale, the direct relationships with 80 million active accounts. What's great about it is we get the opportunity to be both top of the funnel and [ bottom of the funnel ] so we see people obviously, they look at us and compare us on price, and we're very competitively priced, but we also have the opportunity of being performing. And so the fact that we can broad reach at the top of the funnel and also in certain categories truly lead in this way. We're priced well and we're effective, which is what I think has people coming back. And then when we build these sponsorships on top of it, we are a creative solution for them as well. So that's right. Pricing matters, of course. We're competitively priced, but we also have some unique opportunities that are actually growing in demand and, therefore, pricing as well. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Zangler with Stephens. Congrats on the quarter. Given the headlines and the new competition arising, I'm curious what you could tell us about your current relationship with Walmart, both in regard to overall retail distribution and then placement within the on-brand TV? And just if there's any risk of any material changes in this relationship in the foreseeable future? Nick, this is Anthony. I assume you're referring to the article in The Wall Street Journal. I mean we can -- obviously, can't comment on that. That's a rumor. But I will just say a few comments in general. First of all, we're the industry leader, with 80 million active accounts and growing. And one of the things -- one of the primary reasons that we're the leader in streaming platforms is the viewers love our products. They love our brand. They love the light and simplicity of our operating system. And one of the results of that is many of our viewers have multiple Roku devices in their home.
So we've been the #1 selling TV OS in the U.S. for the past 5 years, and we're installed in those half of all broadband households in the United States. And of course, we have a lot of international penetration as well. We have strong retail relationships. We have a great relationship with Walmart. We have a great relationship with -- relationships with lots of retailers. And we have strong distribution both inside and outside the United States.
We have a large engaged customer base. They love our brand. They ask for our brand. They have multiple products, multiple Roku products in their house. You can take that and you think about our leading technology, our innovation in the industry, our singular focus on streaming, our lower hardware costs. We have lower hardware costs than any other TV manufacturer I'm aware of. All of this gives me a lot of confidence that we're going to keep growing our distribution. We added 10 million net active accounts last year, and we're going to add a lot more active accounts this year as well. Got it. I appreciate your willingness to answer that. And then just for the second question, you talked about M&E spend continuing to be pressured. I'm just wondering if you'd expect that vertical to potentially improve meaningfully in at least the second half of '24. Obviously, in that period, you'd be lapping some easier comps. I would think new releases by that time maybe come to market. But maybe in your view, the release slate is just too light, and that's why you're calling for M&E to remain pressured for the duration of the year. But maybe just as you think about second half '24, do you see a potential for an inflection there? Or maybe you could just parse out the commentary on M&A being pressured throughout the duration of the full year? Charlie will take that. Thanks for the question, Nick. Look, M&E is a really important category for us. And I want to tell you that what we really focus on is helping them right now as they shift their focus toward engagement. It's really interesting to me to watch as they do so. And I think in the second half of the year as they not just have to get people to subscribe, but got -- even need to have people watch their shows and watch the commercials that we are probably their best partner in helping them do so on the platform. So when they're back, we're ready for them. I would say one of the things we're doing to make sure we're offering opportunities not just for M&E advertisers but for other categories, just to diversify in the way that Anthony said, we've been doing a lot of work to make sure our ad offerings are places where M&E can advertise but then have opened it up to the other categories. So that pivot to engagement will be successful for us, and we'll be ready for them when they return. Also, I think we'll be able to offer those opportunities to a lot of different categories. I'll just add a couple of comments, I guess, since there seems to be a lot of interest in M&E. I'll just say that -- like we said, it was pressured, it will continue to be pressured for a while. But despite that, our platform revenue grew 13%. And then in Q4, the year-over-year growth with the video ads on our platform outperformed both the streaming industry overall as well as, obviously, the traditional TV industry.
I mean what's going on with M&E is pretty straightforward. We're a great platform for M&E spend. We have the most advanced tools in the industry. We are very good at it. We're good at helping streaming services build subscribers and increase engagement. And they spend a lot of money on M&E in the go-go years of the COVID pandemic. Now that they're retrenching and focusing on a sustainable business, that spending has normalized. It's normalized down a little bit, but it's going to continue to pick back up. And over time, it will be a growth business for us. Our next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. I just had a quick question for Anthony. Given your focus on growth that you talked about and less on costs, what sort of your aspiration? In other words, what metric do you think is most important to focus on given all the metrics you disclosed? And what do you think is a reasonable aspiration where you would say we've been successful in our effort to reinvigorate the top line and get growth? So I think -- so first of all, just on cost. I mean cost is obviously a big issue. We're not -- I'm not saying that we're not focused on cost. I mean as a company, we take operational discipline very seriously. We just made a lot of progress last quarter -- I mean, sorry, last year. And so this year, we have more time to work on some other initiatives, and growth is one of those big initiatives. And for us, for me anyway, there's just so many opportunities across our platform to drive, in particular, monetization growth that we've worked on historically, but we've never put a huge amount of effort and made it a big focus in terms of monetization growth. And so it's a renewed area for us -- it's a renewed area of focus. And success to me means reaccelerating platform growth rates beyond what we're seeing this year. Just in dollars, dollars per hour. Is there any sort of metric that you think is more important? Let me just add on to that. So when we look at both the current year and out-years, we are very focused on absolute free cash flow, and we're going to get that through acceleration of growth rate on the platform business. So again, when we look at investments, we ask ourselves how does this, of course, impact in a positive way the streaming experience and how -- what's the ROI on this. That second component is really how we evaluate what we invest in. So again, we see tremendous opportunity to monetize our platform. We're really just getting started. We're doing a good job. 2023 was very strong, but there's a lot of opportunity as we've grown these 80 million actives. But when we think about it, again, it's not -- we don't focus so much on a margin percent or an EBITDA, we're focused on absolute free cash flow and free cash flow per share and driving that up over time. And my focus is also just the fundamental drivers, like what are the features and what are the areas of the product, what's the strategy that will fundamentally just drive increased platform revenue growth. Our next question is from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt. I was curious about international in terms of your active account growth. Can you give us any sense of the contribution of international to the over 4 million active account growth in the fourth quarter and the 10 million over the year? Is it a minority of the net increase or a majority? Or is there any kind of sense you can give us of that contribution to growth? That's the first question. And then the second question is just to drill into this idea of your market share, you as the leading platform, smart TV OS in the U.S. and some other markets. I understand you've kept a #1 ranking for a number of years in the U.S. But as your absolute market share, has that also been steady? Or has there been any change up or down in your market share of smart TV OS in the U.S.? Barton, I'll take the -- I'll start with the -- this is Anthony -- with the kind of some high-level thoughts on international and then Dan has some thoughts. Just in general, I think overall, we're pleased with our progress internationally. We're the #1 in Mexico as well as the U.S.; doing extremely well in Canada. We're doing well in all of Latin America. We're making great progress in Brazil. So we don't break out our active accounts by region, but a lot of them are international at this point. We're making good progress. We're also doing well in the U.K. So Dan, did you want to add something about international? Yes, I'll just comment. I just think it's important to note that we -- as we talk about the 80 million actives, we are growing in both the U.S. and international. And while international, of course, just given the maturity of the markets are growing faster. The U.S. continues to grow very well for us on net new accounts. And as part of that, a significant part of that, those 10 million adds that we have. And we expect both markets, both our international and our U.S. to continue to grow on actives.
One comment, just as it relates to the platform revenue and ARPU, we talked that -- we stated our ARPU was down 4% due to the fact that international is growing so fast. And that is true. But in the U.S., we are actually seeing ARPU flat to up. We don't break it out, but we are seeing year-over-year growth rates in ARPU, and it's really mixed. It's all mix that's causing that slight contraction in ARPU. So it just shows you -- and then we're at a different stage, obviously, in the monetization of our international accounts. But those will monetize over time. We're in that scale phase, that engagement phase and in that monetization phase depending on the international markets. But we feel very good about the growth rate of both the U.S. and international. And this is Anthony again. Just on your question about market share and it's been steady or up or down in U.S. Well, I'll just take that question. So globally, if you look at regions outside the U.S., let's say, outside the U.S. and Canada, which are more mature for us, you've seen strong and steady upward trends of market share growth rates. In the U.S., also, we launched Roku TV 10 years ago. And since that launch, we've seen steady increases in market share growth rate. We've seen it bounced around quarter-to-quarter. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. But in general, on average, it has been going up steadily since we launched Roku TV. And I actually think there's still quite a bit of room to grow our market share, even in the United States because there will continue to be consolidation.
There's a lot of TVs sold that run on proprietary TV OS. And I've always said and still believe strongly that we're going to see consolidation to a small number of licensed TV OS. They just have bigger economies of scale. They just have a big head start in terms of user experience with a leading licensed TV OS and we expect to be a beneficiary of that. So I think that sort of the trends in market share for TVs are in our favor. In the United States, I expect over time the growth rate to continue to climb, although like I said, they do bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Our last question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. So 2 questions. Do you expect media and entertainment revenue to start growing again in the second quarter? And then on the 3P ad platforms, you gave obviously some color on the note, and there's been questions or comments, questions about that. But what would it take to see a material increase in participation from major DSPs such as Trade Desk and DV360 in your ecosystem there? Jason, this is Anthony. So I think Dan will take that first question, and then Charlie can talk about DSPs. Do you want to go with the next question? Sure. We talked about M&E and that we do think it was a challenge in '23 and we'll be challenged going forward. And we're not -- I'm not going to break out what the growth rates that we're expecting of M&E. And we do think it could grow year-over-year, but it's going to be growing less than our overall platform business most likely, and that's what we're anticipating. And that's all the work that Charlie is doing on diversification. What he talked about is what we're focused on. But we'll update you more on M&E as we get into the second half of Q2 and in H2. But we're actually not -- we don't break that specific activity out in our advertising business. Jason, I like the way we say we have one more question. So you have 2 questions. That's good. And I'll take the second one on DSPs. We are now actually in relationships with all the major DSPs and SSPs. And the way I look at it is this, we went and prioritized demand diversification. And we've done a good job because we're balancing the direct relationships we have, some of whom wish to execute their transactions on the DSPs. And then there is the opening up of demand to smaller accounts that has really grown in the thousands for us, and a lot of those smaller accounts will become bigger and bigger over time. So we've built those relationships. I feel good about the growth, both in dollars and active accounts. And then I think you'll see the small- and medium-sized business, it's really a good result and become, I hope, medium- and large-sized businesses. But we think the strategy is solid and that we're executing well. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude the Q&A session. I will turn it back to Anthony Wood for final comments. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And thanks to our employees, customers, content partners and advertisers. I look forward to an exciting year of TV streaming. And thank you all for participating.","we'll make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events, such as our financial outlook, future market conditions and the macroeconomic environment . unless otherwise stated, all comparisons will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022 .",0.0

I would now like to hand the conference over to Conrad Grodd. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Roku's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On today's call are Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Dan Jedda, our CFO, Charlie Collier; President Roku Media; and Mustafa Ozgen, President, Devices.
Full details of our results and additional management are available on a shareholder letter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at roku.com/investor.
On this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our shareholder letter and periodic SEC filings for risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
On today's call, we'll present GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures of the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our shareholder letter. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call results of the comparable period of 2023.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony. Thank you, Conrad. We delivered solid results in Q1, growing streaming households 14% year-over-year, streaming hours 23% and platform revenue 19% year-over-year.
As I mentioned on the Q4 call, this year, we are directing more of our attention to platform growth and innovation. We will accelerate platform EBITDA and free cash flow growth in 2025 by focusing on 3 key opportunities: maximizing the Roku home screen as the lead-in for TV, growing Roku build subscriptions and growing demand for Roku.
Every day, the Roku home screen reaches U.S. households with nearly 120 million people. This significant reach creates a lot of opportunity. I see many ways to improve the user experience while also growing monetization for Roku. For example, the Roku Sports experience, which viewers can click and view right from home screen, addressed with the fragmentation of sport as a shift to streaming, making it easier for viewers to find games and other sports-related content.
The NFL Zone on was our first lead sponsor zone. And for this year's Super Bowl, it was sponsored by TurboTax delivering massive reach to the brand during the critical time of the year.
We recently launched the NBA Zone in partnership with the NBA in April.
We also see a big opportunity to grow Roku build subscriptions. Roku Pay, our payment and billing service simplifies the sign-up process for users so they can quickly transact and start streaming and as your content partners don't lose subscribers due to unnecessary friction at the point of purchase.
Additionally, we are making it easier for advertisers to execute campaigns programmatically on the Roku platform by expanding and deepening our relationships with third-party platforms.
In Q1, we continued to grow programmatic ad spend as a percentage of total video ad spend on the Roku platform.
With our platform advantages, first-party relationships are more than 80 million streaming household and deep user engagement, we are well positioned to accelerate platform revenue growth in 2025 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss our results. Thanks, Anthony. We ended Q1 with 81.6 million streaming households, sequential net adds of 1.6 million were in line with Q1 2023 and driven by both TVs and streaming players. We continue to drive strong growth and engagement with streaming hours up 23% year-over-year and surpassing 30 billion for the first time in a single quarter. We also grew engagement per account globally with streaming hours per streaming household per day of 4.2 hours in Q1 2024, up from 3.9 hours in Q1 2023.
In Q1, we grew total net revenue 19% year-over-year to $882 million. Platform revenue was $755 million, also driven by both streaming service distribution and advertising activities.
Streaming services distribution activities grew faster than our overall platform revenue, benefiting in part vision price increases. However, the year-over-year growth rate of streaming services distribution in Q1 2024 was lower than the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 2023 due to lapping past price increases and higher mix shift towards entry-priced ad-supported offerings.
Devices revenue increased 19% year-over-year in Q1, driven by the expansion of retail distribution of Roku-branded TVs.
ARPU was $40.65 in Q1 on a trailing 12-month basis, flat year-over-year. This reflects an increasing share of streaming households in international markets where we are currently focused on growing scale and engagement.
Q1 total gross margin was 44%, down slightly year-over-year. Platform gross margin of 52% was stable year-over-year, while devices gross margin was negative 5%, which was down 8 points year-over-year.
Excluding the onetime $10 million service operator licensing catch-up benefit in Q1 2023, device gross margin would have been roughly flat year-over-year.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $41 million, which was above our outlook of breakeven. The better-than-expected performance was driven by our Platform segment along with improvements to our operating expense profile.
Free cash flow was $427 million on a trailing 12-month basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
Let me turn to our outlook for the second quarter. We anticipate total net revenue of $935 million, gross profit of $410 million with gross margin of 44% and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.
Our outlook for total net revenue anticipates a 10% year-over-year increase. This takes into account challenging year-over-year growth rate comparisons of streaming services distribution, along with an elevated 606 adjustment in Q2 last year.
We expect Platform margin to be similar to Q2 of last year at roughly 53%.
On the devices side, we expect margin to decline from negative 5% in Q1 to negative low teens in Q2 and which reflects continued expansion and in our Roku-branded TV program. We expect to benefit from having implemented multiple operational improvements over the course of the past year, and as a result, forecast our year-over-year OpEx growth rate in Q2 to be down to negative low single digits.
Looking into the second half of the year, we expect normal seasonal spend in sales and marketing or devices which will cause second half adjusted EBITDA to slightly moderate relative to the first half of the year.
Looking at the full year, we expect 2024 year-over-year OpEx growth rate to be in the low single digits when excluding impairment and restructuring charges in 2023.
We continue to see leverage in our operating model with our third straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We will continue to drive operational efficiency. And as Anthony mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate the growth of platform revenue in 2025 and beyond.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. I'm hoping you could expand on the drivers of the platform we excel, you're expecting in 2025 and what you're seeing that gives you confidence in this happening? And then, Dan, a quick follow-up for you. Just could you elaborate on what's embedded in the 2Q revenue guide for the Platform segment? Cory, this is Anthony. I'll be happy to talk about that. So for some context before I start, I'll just start by noting that last year, we grew platform revenue to $3 billion. Last year, also, of course, we focused on operational efficiencies. And like I just said, this year, we're directing -- I'm directing more of my attention that my team is correcting more of their attention towards accelerating softer revenue growth in 2025. And there's a lot of opportunity to do that on our platform. But I'll just highlight 3 key areas where I see a lot of opportunity where we are increasing our focus. First is the Roku home screen. And by the home screen, I mean not just, of course, the actual home stream, but the UI, the user experience of URCs when they turn on their TV and they use to kind of find something to watch. So the home screen is a big area, programmatic ad capabilities and also Roku build subscriptions. So talk a little bit more about the Roku home screen. Every day, the Roku home screen reaches U.S. households of nearly 120 million people. That means every day, household of 120 million people turn on their TV and they start their viewing experience, their streaming journey on the Roku home screen. And so that home screen is what a viewer sees before they select an app. And they use that home screen to find something to watch. During that process, they're exposed to promotions, they're exposed to advertising. And they'll see advertising on our home screen before they select an app. They might be select an app that doesn't actually have adds in it. So we have the ability to reach everyone on the platform, not just the people, not just the viewers to select apps with advertising.
But to give you some examples of the kinds of things we're looking at on the home screen, on the home screen today, there's the premier video app we called the Marquee and that traditionally has been a static ad. We're going to add video to that ad. So that will be the first video ad in that we add to the home screen. That will be a big change for us.
We're also testing other types of video ad units, looking at other experiences we can add to the home screen that would be where we can innovate more video advertising. So that's something we're looking at.
Another example, this quarter, we launched the NBA Zone in the Roku sports experience, and the sports experience is a way for viewers to find sports across the platform. It's a way for us to grow our content, both AVOD and SVOD content. It's also a way for us to integrate advertising to that experience.
Another example, we just launched, we just rolled out a personalized content row on the home screen. So this is the first time that we add content recommendations directly on our home screen. It's a big change for us in terms of the home screen, and it will be obviously AI-driven recommendations but it will promote both subscriptions and AVOD content in that row. So there's lots of ways we're working on enhancing the home screen to make it more valuable to viewers but also increase the monetization on the home stream. So that's the home screen.
Another area we're looking at increasing our focus on, and I'm spending more time on is programmatic ad capabilities. So we recently switched our programmatic strategy to be more focused on third-party platforms and expanding our relationships with third-party platforms, including DSDs, expanding what we can offer advertisers. From building out the relationships. We're also increasing the expertise in-house and the talent we have in house splits programmatic advertising.
And I think one example of how this will be useful is if you look at the Roku Channel, took the channel in Q1 was the #3 app on the Roku platform. I mean that's pretty impressive. That's the #3 app after Netflix and after Q2, and engagement in the Roku Channel is up 66% year-over-year, but there's a lot of opportunities to close the gap between engagement in the Roku Channel and [indiscernible] Roku Channel, programmatic ad capabilities are on the way. We intend to do that.
And then the third area, another third example of an area that regard there's lots of opportunities to continue to build monetization and subscriptions. Now We've talked about in the past that we had various teams throughout Roku working on subscriptions. We've reorganized them into one team. We've reallocated more resources towards subscription. That team now reports directly to me. And they've already come up with a good list of priorities and ways we can increase our focus on monetization on subscriptions.
One area that we're looking at, of course, is Roku Pay, which is our payments and building service. Roku Pay is very popular, but it can be even more popular. It's great for viewers. It allows them to sign up first subscription in a frictionless way without having to enter the credit card number, and it's great for our business partners because it allows them to reduce friction when a customer is signing up for a subscription.
So those are 3 examples of how we're working on increasing monetization -- and monetizing our home screen programmatic and subscriptions.
And I just think overall, if you just look at the platform advantages we have, we have a brand that viewers love. We have first-party relationships with more than 80 million of screening households. We have deep user engagement, and we're well positioned to continue to reaccelerate platform revenue growth in 2025 and beyond. And then, Dan, do you want to take that? Yes. I'll take the second part of that question. Thanks, Cory, for the question. So let me talk briefly about the change in Q1 to Q2 before I answer the question on platform revenue in Q2. So last year, Q1 platform revenue growth rate was negative 1% due to a weak ad market, so Q1 of this year grew 19% as it had a relatively easy comp on a year-over-year basis. Platform growth in Q2 last year was plus 11%. So we went from negative 1% in Q1 to plus in Q2, and that was due to streaming services distribution growth rate increasing primarily from increases in both subscriptions and subscription prices. Advertising revenue growth also improved in Q2 relative to Q1 last year, but SSD was the primary growth driver. And so we faced that challenging comp in SSD in Q2 and really for the rest of the year. We also had a positive 606 adjustment in Q2 and Q3 for platform revenue last year, adding to the difficult comp. So if you exclude that 606 adjustment in Q2 of last year, our outlook for total revenue growth rate would increase by nearly 200 basis points for Q2 of this year. So again, we did see positive growth rate in advertising in Q1 versus the easier comp of Q1 last year, and our Q2 guide assumes a similar year-over-year growth rate in advertising versus what we exited the year at. So we're seeing momentum there. But the comp is the reason for the sequential decline in growth rate from Q1 to Q2.
And to answer your question specifically, of the 10% growth that we guided to for Q2, I would think of platform growth as very high single-digit growth rates, inclusive of 606. And if you were to exclude 606, the 606 adjustment in Q2 last year, we would be in low double-digit growth rate for platform revenue. Cory did I answer your question? Yes. And it comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Thank you, Dan. I would like to follow up on your comments on OpEx. And if you remember on the last quarter call, you made the comment about annualizing Q4, operating expenses and applying a growth rate. And then it looks like this quarter expenses came in lower than we expected. So can you help us understand exactly how we should think about this math for the remainder of the year in terms of quarterly progression. So from this 460 this quarter, how it's going to progress and what the full year estimate should be at this point should be what the reasonable estimate should be? And when you say mid-single-digit growth rates, would you please specify what net range is for you? Yes. Thanks, Vasily. I will take that. So we exited the year in a good place with our operating expense profile based on all the work we had done throughout the year and in 2023. And you see that in our Q1 OpEx. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect full year OpEx to be in the low single digits from FY '23, excluding the impairment and restructuring charges that we had in FY '23. So let me just be clear on that.
So our GAAP OpEx in 2023 was $2.3 billion. If you exclude impairment and restructuring, our OpEx would have been $2.0 billion, just a little bit above $2.0 billion in FY '23. So think about it as -- and I'll be very clear, not mid-single digits, but think about it as low single digits off of that $2 billion is what we'd expect for full year 2024. That just happens to be down double digits off a GAAP basis. But the way to look at it is off our $2 billion OpEx, excluding restructuring in 2023, we will likely grow low single digits off that number.
We do expect H2 OpEx to be higher than H1. I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. And that's due to normal seasonality that we see in sales and marketing for devices. And then Q3, Q4, if possible? Again, we'll update that. I've given you a very clear guidance for overall OpEx. We'll update Q3 and Q4 once we close on Q2. But again, think of it low single digits, off that $2 billion.
A lot of that -- I just want to add, like a lot of that timing depends on how sales and marketing ramps in Q3 and into holiday in Q4, which is why I'm not providing specific guidance, but we do have a very good view for full year. Okay, makes sense. One moment for our next question. Comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. So first on device margins. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the sequential change you're talking about from Q1 to Q2? Is that mix or channel partners or anything else that takes it from the pretty good down 5 in Q1 to that low teens a little weaker in Q2? And with the seasonally higher marketing spend in the second half of the year, is there anything that also is reflected in device margin being weaker in the back half relatedly?
And then secondly, Anthony, just on Roku Pay, it seems like it's a really big focus for monetization of growth. I think you said it's really popular, any sense of what percentage of your streaming households use Roku Pay? And how we think about what the ARPU uplift is when you've got that? Yes. I'll take the device gross margin. So again, Q1 device gross margin was negative 5%, which was flat if you exclude the $10 million positive service operator licensing catch-up in Q1 of last year, In terms of like the near term and they change from Q1 to Q2, it really is reflective of the ramp-up in our Roku-branded devices. And again, that's a positive. We are continuing to ramp that up. It is -- we're far more distributed now. We're in 2023. I'm sure Mustafa can talk on that. But we see that as a positive. And we would expect those margins to be in the Q2 ballpark going forward.
Again, as we grow and scale this program, we will improve our cost structure within devices, and those margins will get better. relative to where we are now. But again, we are in the ramp-up stage of Roku-branded TV. And so for the near term, as we ramp that program up, I would expect to see margins similar to Q2. Yes. In terms of Roku Pay, I don't think we've broken out the percentage of streaming households to use it. I'll just say that it's the primary that we drive subscriptions on our platform is through having dealers sign up to a subscription service with the ease of using Roku Pay. And a lot of the way we plan and we had improved Roku Pay adoption on the platform is things like integrating SVOD content more throughout the recommendation engine. So for example, like I just mentioned, we're adding a just rolled out the content wrote a recommendation of -- a row of recommended content at the top of our home screen that will include recommendations of SVOD content both entitled and unentitled SVOD content, meaning SVOD content that you have a subscription for, which will increase engagement, which will reduce churn as well as SVOD content. You don't have a subscription for which you then would sign up, get a free trial and a sign up using Roku Pay.
But we also -- so integrating SVOD throughout the platform more, but also the user experience of how easy it is to sign up with Roku Pay also the technicality running a large-scale platform, things like cancellations, there's just a lot of operational focus on improving the numbers in Roku Pay. And so it's a big business and it's -- and there's still lots of opportunities continuing to improve it. And we come from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Just a question on ARPU. It did increase sequentially. So I'm just kind of curious how we should think about that trend line going forward, particularly with some of the monetization efforts that Anthony highlighted? And then just maybe as a follow-up, maybe bigger picture, a couple of quarters now of higher levels of EBITDA and free cash flow, just kind of thinking -- or give some perspective if you could how you're thinking about just philosophically about these levels of sustained profitability. Yes. Okay. So I'll take the ARPU question first. We were flat year-on-year on ARPU, and that's, of course, mixing out is to more international than U.S. where we're in our scale and engaged phase. We are starting to monetize in areas like Mexico and key to monetize like Canada U.K. and Germany. But essentially, a lot of our international growth does have a lower ARPU. So we do mix out.
I will say what we do see, which is positive, is one, if I were to just look at U.S. in isolation, we, of course, look at it in multiple ways. And on a trailing 12-month basis, U.S. ARPU was up year-on-year. And when we mix in international, it becomes flat for total company. So that is a positive for us that we are improving ARPU on a trailing 12-month basis. So we also look at it on a quarterly basis, but also what's positive in the U.S. looking at the most recent quarter, which is a positive. So I like the trends I see in terms of on a mix adjusted basis in ARPU, but only mix things out. The ARPU does tend to be flat, just given the growth that we're seeing for Actives International, which again is a good thing as we continue to scale and grow engagement internationally.
Ultimately, we will monetize international. We are monetizing pieces of it, but we'll continue to monetize it, and that should improve international ARPU over time. This is Anthony. I'll just comment that we're seeing great progress with our international growth plans. For example, in Mexico, we've now achieved 40% market share for TVs. 40% of TVs sold in Mexico are now Roku TVs, which is a great achievement. And we're also starting to ramp up monetization. I mean it's still early days internationally, but we are starting to make progress is, for example, launching the Roku Channel in Mexico, things like that. And I'll just take the second part of that question, Ralph, on EBITDA and free cash flow. So we feel very good about EBITDA. We basically -- we have had our third straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA, and we've guided to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $30 million for Q1. So 4 quarters inclusive of the guide. I feel very good. About EBITDA going forward, we said in the letter and Anthony repeated that as we focus on growing the growth rate of Platform in FY '25, we will continue to grow EBITDA and free cash flow. I will say -- I've said it many times, free cash flow. EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA will give a good proxy for free cash flow as we are CapEx light, and we'll continue to be CapEx light for at least the next year. I'm really, really happy with the capital that we have and how we're focusing CapEx, being CapEx-light. So adjusted EBITDA will be a great proxy for free cash flow. So we see that growing along with adjusted EBITDA.
I will say one thing that we did do in Q1 was something called a net share settlement where when we issued our shares via our restricted stock units in we did offset some of that with net share settlement. So we offset 1/3 of our dilution by essentially issuing less shares and paying the taxes in cash that had the impact of reducing dilution impact of shares issued. That's just one way we utilize cash. And as we continue to focus on free cash flow and free cash flow per share, that will have a positive impact. I do expect us to continue to do that for the rest of this year, which should offset about 1/3 of the dilution of future issuances.. It comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Anthony, earlier in the call, you touched on this idea of this personalized fee that you've rolled out at the top of Roku. For a long time, Roku was always about apps or clicking on apps, and curious sort of fundamentally what made you take the shift because it seems like a pretty big fundamental shift in how content is sort of surfaced? And as you think about this personalized feed, obviously, as you think about directing the traffic to the Roku Channel, where you sell ads or apps that you could subscribe to. It seems to power to drive revenue. And I'm trying to think about how the interplay between purely what a user might want to watch next versus how it drives revenue at Roku and how you think about that balance going forward? And sort of just how this evolves for Roku would be really interesting to hear. Rich, yes. So I think there's a few different things that I think about when I think about doing a content row on the home streams. One is our view of success has been building a custom built operating system for television that has a simple and delightful viewer experience. And we have an iconic home screen that's differentiated and recognizably different than our competitors. And so we don't want to -- we obviously don't want to lose that, and we're not going to lose that.
But also, if you just look at the evolution of what people's view on a platform like growth there. It used to be that a lot of pains spread out a lot of different apps. Now I say, for example, the number -- we said the #3 app on the platform is the Roku Channel, but it's not really an app. I mean, of course, it is an app but it's also more than that. It's content that we have, is fast content, it's pre-used subscription content is AVOD content. It's content that we've licensed directly that we have direct distribution deals with and that we integrate throughout our user experience. One way to access that content just to the Roku Channel app, but you can also access it to more ways to watch in our UI, you can access it to one. You can, there's just lots of different ways. And it's one of the fundamental parts of our business model is to expose content to viewers and drive engagement with content while being disciplined about how much we spend for content, and we can do that by integrating our UI. So it's important for our viewers to expose that content. It's important for our business model to expose content.
So -- and then, of course, this year, last year for me was the year of focusing on operational efficiency. This year, I'm focused on driving platform revenue growth. There's tons of opportunity one of the big ones, it's just the home screen. It's iconic, but it hasn't changed. It's really in a long time. And there's a lot of ways to still keep what's made it great, but also make it useful for our viewers and drive revenue. So that's sort of the different kind of aspects. Maybe asked another way, do you think ultimately, it becomes a content feed and not an app feed like long term? Well, I don't want to design our home screen on the earnings call. But the home screen -- my goal with the home screen is that it will evolve while maintaining its iconic differentiation and while increasing monetization and increasing its usefulness for viewers. And a big part of that strategy for that is some of this content, but it's not -- it's also about what we call experiences, things like the sports experience, which is just to bring up a lot because it's just a good example, it's an experience for helping viewers find source content across the platform. And so I think one of the things we plan to do with the home screen is build more of these types of experiences to make them more useful for viewers and to use those ways to integrate advertising and promotion and sponsorship as well.
So that -- you might see more of that kind of thing integrated into our home screen long term. But no, I don't think it will ever become just content recommendations. And it comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. I have two, one on active account growth and one on program avenues. On active account growth, do you see more growth in the U.S.? Or do you think that more growth in the international markets? And with respect to the Walmart VIZIO deal, do you see any impact from that, and do you see yourself maybe potentially gaining share at other retailers?
And then the second question on programmatic, Charlie, I wanted to ask you what innings are we in with respect to opening up to other DSPs? And have you seen a meaningful uptick in the fill rates and any impact on CPMs. So this is Anthony. And I actually see, I think, three questions in that question. So I'll take the first part. I'll turn it over to Mustafa to talk about Walmart, VIZIO talk about DSPs. I mean in terms of active account growth, we're seeing growth -- I mean, obviously, more future growth out from the U.S. because there's just a lot more humans with broadband households to watch TV outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. And certainly, we're seeing stronger growth at this point outside the U.S. than inside the U.S., but there's still, I believe, plenty of room to continue to grow active accounts inside the U.S. for a while. And of course, there's tons and tons of room to continue to grow active count outside the U.S. which we're making good progress there.
I mean we -- outside the U.S. has been to focus on a small number of specific countries established scale in those countries and then add more countries. So the countries we've been focused on historically are primarily countries in the Americas, like U.S., Mexico, Canada, Brazil,, and then outside of the Americas, primarily the U.K. And we're seeing great progress in all those countries. And then at some point, we'll add other countries as well. So I don't know Mustafa -- I don't if you have anything to add on international or if [indiscernible] No, I think you [indiscernible] internationally. On VIZIO. We spent the last 15 years building America's #1 TV streaming platform and the brand. And our users love work and ask for Roku, and many have multiple devices in their homes. We are becoming the platform where they consume their content. So we know what our customers want, and we are always innovating. Our innovation is not just about launching new features, but also bringing down the cost of the existing features for us. So we have a very strong setup here. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow our streaming households. Obviously, we have a great relationship with all of our retail partners, including Walmart, where we are in shelf space in streaming players, TVs and smart home categories.
Additionally, we have a wide retail distribution in and outside of the U.S. because -- and also deepen it with select partners.
So overall, we have a robust strategy to continue to grow our streaming households with our devices that includes streaming players, our licensed Roku TV program and our Roku-branded TVs that we launched last year.
Over on Roku-branded TVs, we are expanding the product line up with recent introduction of higher-performance TVs with the Roku Pro Series, which complement the existing select [indiscernible]. And we're also expanding its distribution, they are now available at Best Buy, Costco, amazon.com and walmart.com. So these factors in our strong track record and capacity to innovate such as recently announced AI-based quality settings along with our singular focus on streaming and low-cost hardware, that's enabled purpose-built TV operating system gives us confidence that we will keep growing our distribution and streaming households. And this is Anthony again. So just back -- the third part of your question was on DSPs. I'll turn it over to Charlie, but just -- I'll just say that, like I said before, I highlighted 3 areas where I think there's a lot of potential for us to increase our focus, drive more growth, accelerate growth in '25 in terms of platform revenue growth. And DSPs are one of the pillars. And we've changed our strategy a bit there to be much more focused on working with third-party partners. And I would say it's pretty early in that sort of adoption of that new strategy, and there's a lot of room to grow. But we've had some early successes, and we're making good progress. That's at the high level to you. I don't know, Charlie, if you want to do that. I agree. Thanks, for the question. It's early innings for sure. I think we're getting to the heart of our lineup. There continues to be a ton of opportunity for us with third-party DSPs, and it's an important priority for all of us. As you know, over the last year or so, we made the strategic changes Anthony talked about, and we've been really focusing on incorporating more third-party DSPs.
Now it is going well, but the expanded access to our platform that I talked about on the last call. We now have over 30 partners, not just all the names you think of, by the way, our list includes all the notable partners, but also Instacart and Cox auto and others, you might not immediately have top of mind. So this expansion is part of our commitment to an open ecosystem, which is central to our growth strategy. And I think this will be a key differentiator for us versus large ecosystems.
As I've shared before, we're committed to flexibility and meeting advertisers where they prefer to transact. And this strategic pivot has been paying real dividends.
In the first quarter, we continued to see increase in programmatic ad spend as a percentage of total video investment on our platform, and that underscores for me the strength and appeal of our offering.
Our strategy isn't just about expanding the platform right on. It's also about deepening these relationships, so we're making it easier for advertisers to execute things programmatically with us and easier for them to use Roku inventory. So as we continue to deploy our programmatic strategies, at Roku, I really expect us to continue the action we're seeing and prove that this is really just, as you said, early innings. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. And it comes from the line of Bazinet with Citi. I just had a quick question on the home screen. I'm always surprised when I turned on my Roku how much sort of white space there is there. My question is, is your sense that this sort of new static to more video-centric is sort of a key unlock to monetize it? Or do you think there's just something about marketers that don't quite understand since it's a pretty unique sort of piece of inventory to buy? In other words, do you think that this shift to video is sort of a key enabler or could it take more time? Yes. This is Anthony. I think that to be frank, there's lots of areas we spend our time and our resources on. And our home screen has served us well. There is a lot of white space as part of what makes iconic in different recognizable as part of our brand. But I would say the big change is that you just identified it, it's like, okay, we're going to prioritize resources to work on. There's just a lot of untapped opportunity there, but you asked just one of the areas of opportunity. I mean integrating some for, some content like the recommendation road that we're adding. But there's just lots of areas on the home screen in terms of the potential to both increase engaging UI experiences with our viewers and more deeply integrating promotion and advertising in ways that work for marketers as well as our viewers.
And so no, I think the, adding a video adds at all going to be very popular, well, my prediction is it will be very popular with advertisers. Like I said, it's households with 140 million people in them daily before they enter app. Many of those apps don't have video advertising. So I think it will be popular. And like I said, we're also looking at other ways to integrate video into our home stream, but the video is not the only thing we're looking at. And Charlie, do you think market understand the value of your advertising on the home screen? I do. Thanks for the question, Jason. Look, it's really about distinction. We do so much well. But as Anthony said, when you got nearly 120 million people, that's huge distinction in and of itself. And there's a whole class of viewers today who purchase ad-free streaming subscriptions, for example, and they do so. So they see fewer ads, and so it's worth noting and the one thing all viewers see when they turn on their TV is our home screen, and Roku's ads, as you know, are elegantly placed in an uncluttered ad environment. So we literally have the privilege of engaging viewers where they choose what to watch before audiences splinter into apps. And if you think about the problem for marketers, a lot of it is a tension fragmentation. So our home screen is a huge opportunity because it really differentiates. And it comes from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt. I was curious about sports, which has been a theme you've been touching on a lot. And in particular, I mean, there's been some media reports perhaps at Roku could be looking at buying some sports rights directly. I think there was something recently about the Major League Baseball Sunday lead off that was on Peacock. And you guys have done something in small scale, I think it was formulary.
I'm just wondering kind of just structurally. Is buying sports rights directly at a meaningful level? Does that make sense for Roku? It would seem to be questionable, given that anyone streaming sports is kind of want to have a deal with you to go through you, I would imagine. So if you can talk to how you see sports rights deals in the role for Roku direct or through kind of third-party kind of intermediaries. Yes, this is Anthony. I would say the primary -- so first of all, we don't comment on rumors, speculation, that sort of thing, so I can't comment on that particular rumor. But just your bigger question, like how do we think about sports. I mean, I think the primary way I think about sports is that we're a platform -- there's many different streaming services that we distribute on our platform. Many of them have sports. So and sports, in particular, have been fragmented and viewers just have no idea how to find they want to watch their favorite team or -- so the primary opportunity for us is to help our viewers to be the place they go to help them find a sporting event to watch.
And now that doesn't mean -- we also have content that we license directly. We have rev share content. We have direct license content. We have Roku originals. So -- and we've done like you mentioned for, I mean, the way we think about Roku Originals is a budget of content -- budget for content that we either produce or have more exclusive relationships around.
So -- and there's things like The Rich Eisen Show, which is the Roku, we integrate into the sports zone. We also look at sponsorships for the sports zone. We also think about, well, is that a place where we get the video ads. I mean, so for us, it's really the experience of helping viewers find content. We also do license content and produce content so that also could in the sport zone, but the primary goal is to be just the go-to place for a viewer to find what to watch and to monetize that whole experience when they figure out what they want to watch. And then at the end of watching something that we have licensed directly that we monetize that as well. Okay. That's great. And then if I could squeeze in just one other. I was curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of the endemic kind of media marketing partners at this point. There's been a headwind  historically, but that businesses. Some ways kind of normally still going through some structural issues with some of the media companies and the cost cutting at the streaming services. So what are you seeing in that kind of market right now for you guys? Yes. Charlie will take that. Great. Thanks, Barton. Look, we have a large M&E business. And good news is we're really good at it. And Roku is really the best place for marketers to build audiences. So simply put, we build content companies, businesses. I think you used the right word. Obviously, the market has been normalizing versus what it used to be. And so our efforts have been to monetize our home screen in the way Anthony described, and we're now focused on all verticals as we continue to diversify and successfully sell inventory that was previously utilized nearly exclusively by M&E advertisers. So we're also growing engagement and monetization by creating new experiences on the home screen.
Actually, Anthony mentioned The Rich Eisen Show. So a notable example for sharing his BMW sponsorship of The Rich Eisen Show, which included marquee ad on our home screen as well as custom advertising within Roku City. Of course, they sponsored his live show. By the way, he's at the draft this week for us and do a live shows from there. And then our partnership with BMW is growing. So our home screen is being deployed beyond M&E and for the client enhancing brand visibility and engagement. And it comes from the line Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. This is Ian Peterson on for Mark. First question, the Roku Channel streaming hours accelerated second quarter in a row. Can you help us walk through some of the drivers of that? Where within the Roku Channel or what areas of content are you seeing the strong engagement trends from?
And maybe to follow up on the earlier programmatic question, how should we think about the trajectory and mix of video ad revenue coming from third-party programmatic demand going forward?
And last question on advertising. Anything you can call out on the macro front on quarter-to-date advertising trends you're seeing heading into the up-front season, maybe progress on some of the SMB advertiser initiatives you've laid out in attracting them to the Roku platform? Ian, this is Anthony. Thanks for all the questions. I see. I think we'll start with Charlie. You got it. Thanks, Ian. You asked about TRC. The Roku Channel offers 3 types of content, primarily, AVOD, live TV, and premium subscriptions. And we deliver them via viewing experiences that are integrated throughout. As I mentioned earlier, we've made some strategic programming choices for the Roku Channel. It's strong growth. In first quarter, we made it the #3 app in our platform by both reach and engagement. And as the program type this past weekend, for example, the chronicles open we made it the most watched on-demand title on the Roku Channel with the highest reach and most hours streamed of any title in the history of Roku Channel for its opening weekend. So it shows there's a tremendous opportunity to engage new audiences with power the Roku platform.
Other content, we've briefly also added short-form content, launching clips from popular NBC shows like Saturday Night Live and sports. And by servicing this content throughout the Roku platform, including our home screen, we're able to generate additional reach and engagement.
I mentioned live TV. We continue to expand our line up of fast channels. We recently partnered with the NBA to launch the first-ever MBA fast channel, and that's exclusively on the Roku Channel, and we now have more than 35 sports-focused live TV channels. So all these examples point to the opportunities for us to serve and delight our audiences with the content they love. And I'm going to head into the new front last week, and I look forward to sharing more of what's coming at the Roku Channel. ;
ESPs. Well, look, I talked a little bit about it before. There is a lot of opportunity for us in third party. I mentioned that we expanded our relationships to now over 30 partners. And while we don't break out the mix, I'm really focused on the re-acceleration of platform revenue and the DSP focus will play a huge part in that. I mean, DSP is one of the things that will happen with more focused on DSPs as increased diversity of advertisers. And I think I don't want to that will probably help attract more SMB advertisers for the platform as well. Yes, third question number 3. No, yes. So you asked about the small, medium-sized, the demand of diversification is something we been focused on for several quarters. I've talked about for a few quarters in a row. And I answered earlier that we're in the early innings. I really think you're going to see the reacceleration of the platform revenue growth into '25 and beyond, and it is both small- and medium-sized businesses, and it's also expanding the work we're doing with so many of our existing partners. Thank you. And with that, we conclude our Q&A session. I will turn it back to Anthony Wood for final comments. Well, thanks to everyone for joining, and thanks to our employees, customers and partners and advertisers. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.","we'll make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions . unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call results of the comparable period of 2023 are provided in our shareholder letter .",0.0

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Roku Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would like now to turn the conference over to Conrad Grodd, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Welcome to Roku's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On today's call are Anthony Wood, Roku's Founder and CEO; Dan Jedda, our CFO; and Charlie Collier, President, Roku Media.

Now I'll hand the call over to Anthony. Thanks, Conrad. This quarter, Roku continued to build on our foundation of unmatched scale and engagement while remaining focused on operational discipline. We continue to lean into our unique assets, the Roku home screen, which is the beginning of the various TV experience. Every day, U.S. household is representing more than 120 million people began their streaming journey on the Roku home screen. This fact, along with our development and operations pipeline makes me confident we will be able to accelerate our platform revenue in 2025.
In Q2, we grew streaming households 14% year-over-year, streaming hours 20% year-over-year and platform revenue 11% year-over-year. In the U.S., Roku is the #1 TV OS by both TV shared and our screen, and our share of each is more than double the next largest operating system. The Roku Channel was our #3 app by both reach and engagement. This is a great achievement and demonstrates that Roku is building the lead-in to TV.
Another result we are proud of is our fourth straight quarter of delivering positive adjusted EBITDA and generating positive free cash flow. More than a year ago, we set a target of positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024. As ambitious as this target was then, we did the work of rightsizing our cost structure and delivered on a full year early. Looking ahead, we will maintain this strong track record of execution as we focus on our monetization initiatives, including maximizing ad demand for Roku, leveraging the Roku home screen as the lead-in for TV and growing Roku build descriptions.
Now let me turn it over to Dan. Thanks, Anthony. We ended Q2 with 83.6 million streaming households, up 14% year-over-year with sequential net adds of $2 million driven by both TVs and streaming players. We continue to drive strong growth in engagement with streaming hours up 20% year-over-year. We also grew engagement per account globally with streaming hours per streaming household per day of 4.0 hours in Q2 of 2024, up from 3.8 hours in Q2 of last year.
In Q2, we grew total net revenue 40% year-over-year to $968 million. Platform revenue was $824 million, up 11% year-over-year driven by both streaming services distribution and advertising activities while offset by a challenged M&E vertical. Streaming services distribution activities grew faster than overall platform revenue, benefiting in part from subscription price increases. Devices revenue increased 39% year-over-year in Q2, driven by the expansion of the retail distribution of Roku-branded TVs.
ARPU was $4.68 in Q2 on a trailing 12-month basis, flat year-over-year. This reflects an increasing share of streaming households in international markets where we are currently focused on growing scale and engagement with monetization efforts in early stages. Q2 total gross margin was 44%, down slightly year-over-year. Platform gross margin of 53% was relatively in line year-over-year, while devices gross margin was negative 11%, which was up 6 points year-over-year.
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $44 million, which is above our outlook. The better-than-expected performance was driven by our Platform segment. Free cash flow was $318 million on a trailing 12-month basis and we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We continue to see leverage in our operating model with our fourth straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
Let me turn to our outlook for the third quarter. We anticipate total net revenue of $1.01 billion, gross profit of $440 million with gross margin of 44% and adjusted EBITDA of $45 million. Our outlook for total net revenue anticipates an 11% year-over-year increase. We expect Q3 platform revenue to grow 9% year-over-year. This takes into account a challenging year-over-year growth rate comparison within streaming services distribution, along with elevated positive 606 adjustments in Q3 of last year. While we expect M&E to remain challenged, we anticipate the year-over-year growth of advertising activities to accelerate in Q3. Platform margin will be in line with Q2 at roughly 53%.
On the device side, we expect Q3 revenue to grow 24% and margins to be in line with Q2 in the negative low double digits, reflecting continued expansion and investment in our Roku branded TV program. We're benefiting from operational improvements we made over the course of the past year, and as a result, we continue to expect 2024 OpEx growth rates to be in the low single digits when excluding impairment and restructuring charges. We are confident the year-over-year growth rate of platform revenue will begin to accelerate sequentially in Q4 of this year as a result of executing on our monetization initiatives to maximize ad demand and leverage our home screen as the lead-in for TV.
With that, let's take questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna International Group. Congrats on the nice results. I had a couple of questions. First, there's been a lot of commentary recently about excess supply of PC inventory in the market and downward pressure on CPMs. I was wondering if you could just talk about this and maybe what you're seeing? And then second question, can you talk about what you guys are currently seeing with M&E and just your expectations there? Hi, Shyam, this is Anthony. Yes, I'll be happy to take that question. So first, I'll just say that Roku is not impacted by market-driven pricing changes in the same way that other streaming services seem to be. And this is because we, Roku, are streaming platform. We're not solely a streaming service. And if you think about what that means, like as a platform, as a streaming platform, one of the benefits is that we have a diversified set of revenue streams. Our platform business consists of our streaming services distribution activities, which are diversified as well as advertising, which are also diversified. So if you look at streaming service distribution, we're investing in areas like Roku built subscriptions as well as premium subscriptions. And then you think about advertising activities, which are also diversified, obviously, we have traditional video as traditional streaming ads on our platform across our platform.
But unlike normal streaming service, we have a unique set of ad products and sponsorships that are only possible because we own the platform, and we integrate these throughout the viewer experience. So we have diversified revenue streams, a platform level revenue streams.
And then if I even take a step back and think about like what are the primary factors that drive our platform business? Our platform business growth is driven by the growth of the different components of that business. So for example, we continue to maintain strong growth of streaming households. We added 2 million net adds in the quarter recently. Now it's 83 million almost 84 million streaming households. So we continue to add global streaming households. They're very strong streaming hour engagement that also continues strong, and a lot of that is monetizable engagement for us. And then, of course, we continue to invest a lot of our R&D effort into building and creating new monetization products across the viewer experience. So these are the primary things that drive our growth.
And then another critical point, I guess, I'd just like to mention is, I don't know we said it before, but it's really important. The Roku home screen is one of our, probably our most important asset. It's the reason why they lead into TV. Every day, U.S. households with more than 120 million people start their streaming experience at the Roku home screen. And that's super valuable scale to advertisers as well as promoting our owned and operated properties. But for advertisers, our home screen and our viewer experience for our platform reaches years before they decide what to watch. And after they spent some time trying to decide what to watch, they pick a streaming app and they fragment into different streaming apps. And a lot of those team apps don't have ads. And so for many of our viewers, promotions and advertising in our home screen is the only ad they're going to see. So the home screen is a very important part of our strategy for growing our monetization, something that's working well for us.
And then if I just think about what are the actual primary challenges to our platform business right now is, like we mentioned a few times, is continued weakness within the M&E vertical. But we have a great ad business, and we're well positioned to accelerate our ad business.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie to share some more details. Great. Thanks, Anthony, and thanks for the question, Shyam. I appreciate it. there is a lot of supply in the market. You're right. And Anthony addressed our differentiating platform advantages. Why don't I speak about advertising directly. We're actively creating new revenue sources all the time at Roku. We're building new ad products across our UI. And these serve 2 purposes. They both drive demand, and they also fulfill demand. A few good examples are video ads on the home screen, our customizable Roku city buildings and cars, sponsorships across our UI in our content destinations like the NFL experience our Olympic zone, which is booming now, actually, I think you might be looking at it on your screen as we speak in the updated metal count.
And it includes our all-things food and all things home areas. And then if you think about it, Shyam, there'd be open and interoperable way we partner with clients and use our unique ad targeting and measurement capabilities to help them meet their goals. That's really important. And we talk a lot about how we come to market. Inherent in your question is that we've been competitively priced, and we remain competitively priced. And we've built multiple products and partner collaborations each at different points across the demand chain and that's important because I've mentioned over the last few quarters, we have strategically pivoted to all sorts of third-party relationships, third-party DSPs, channel partners and others. And we are very much focused on meeting our clients where and how they wish to transact.
And Anthony mentioned it, we have the flexibility to handle really well the market fluctuations you mentioned because of our increasing supply. And that's possible for a bunch of reasons. One is that the Roku Channel is up over 75% year-on-year, and it's also because of the growth across the entire Roku platform experience. So I'll reiterate what Anthony led with, which is as a streaming platform we do have distinct advantages over the streaming services that compete on our platform. So our unique assets allow to adapt and be less impacted than others seem to be by market supply dynamics. And for all those reasons, I'm really optimistic that we'll ramp revenue into the back half of 2024. Thank you. You also asked about M&A. So let me just talk about that for a second. In our prior calls, we mentioned that we expected the M&E vertical to be challenged in 2024, and that's what we're seeing. But despite these challenges, the challenges we're seeing in the M&E vertical. We expect advertising activities on our platform to accelerate in the second half, and we expect to continue to grow platform revenue. So but I'll let Charlie and Dan share more detail on that. Well, this is Charlie. He's right. We've diversified the overall ad business well. Before I get into that, I should note, I'm proud of this, we're really good at M&E and we're a must-have for our M&A partners. One way we've diversified is that we've increased the number of ad categories and/or ad units in the viewer experience. We've opened up inventory to new advertisers and it's inventory that used to be reserved almost exclusively for M&E brands and performance advertisers. And that diversification has worked well. Our new marquee video ad unit on the home screen is one example. We actually announced that at the upfront. And we opened a limited invite-only beta for this new video ad unit and it's sold out in the first month and the participation was exactly what we hope to see from premier brands like the Home Depot and Disney, automotive in Mini. So regardless of short-term broad market softness across M&E in the marketplace. Our platform is still the best place to attract and retain viewers, to build subscriptions and to help our partners manage churn. And let me just add one point to that. due to the efforts to diversify our ad demand and ad products and our many growth initiatives, all the examples that Charlie just stated, M&E is a significantly smaller percent of our overall platform business now versus the last several years. So while we're in a good position to benefit from any M&E rebound and any new M&E entrants into the market, we're not relying on the vertical for future growth. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. It's really exciting that you're now supporting UID. Charlie, can I ask you what kind of lift are you expecting in demand or pricing from this partnership? And how long will it take to ramp demand from cradle. And do you expect kind of a similar integration with DV360 at some point? Jason, this is Anthony. Let me just kick this off, and then I'll turn it over to Charlie. We are very focused on accelerating our platform revenue, and we have as last mentioned, as we have mentioned, a variety of initiatives to increase monetization and grow platform revenue that we're executing against. One of those initiatives is to grow our relationships with all third-party platforms, and we're making progress on that. And the announcement today around UID integration is one step in that strategy. I feel like we're making good progress against that strategy. But I think Charlie can talk more about it. Well, thanks for noting it, Jason. It's really all about making Roku more performant and efficient for our clients. On the Trade Desk specifically, we're only a couple of months in, but the partnership with them has been really well received and been great to work with and our relationship is growing.
So to answer your time and question, it's early days, but we're pleased with the progress, and we look forward to continued innovations ahead. We think this will continue to drive demand.
Unified ID 2.0 or UID2 is an identity solution developed by the Trade Desk. And really, for us, it will allow others to achieve more precise targeting and enhanced data collaboration. So you asked about others. It's not just Trade Desk. We've grown relationships across the entire programmatic demand and measurement ecosystem, including enhanced partnerships from folks like iSpot PubMatic, Magnite and more. The team and I talk a lot about the word interoperable and being open because we actually believe in addition to the benefits I just mentioned, our flexibility and open approach to partnerships are going to help differentiate Roku and benefit advertisers. So it drives performance for clients and demand, as you asked, for Roku Media.
I take really seriously, our leadership position as the leader TV streaming. We're triple the streaming hours of the next largest platform in the U.S. And so partnerships like these, the ones I've just described, put Roku and our partners right at the center of the open premium CTV ecosystem. And the next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. So the first one I definitely think is for Anthony. So I think last quarter, you said you have everybody in your distribution activities now reporting to you, which is the concept I love. And I like your 3 integrations, the execution you put in the note about the new content row, facilitating subscription-based steps with your Roku Pay and also the special thing you did with NBC around the Olympics.
My question is, when you think about a year from now, clean piece of paper, what's the north star here? Are you trying to get the revenue mix to 50-50 ads and let's call this a subscription revenue stream? Is there products that you want to introduce because clients are asking for them? We talk to me about the next year and what we should expect to see a year from now that's driving the subscription revenue streams at Roku. Laura, thanks for the question. Yes. Well, I mean, obviously, a big goal for us for this year and next year is to reaccelerate our platform monetization. I feel like we're making great progress on that. We've talked about expanding our third-party partnerships as a way to increase demand for our advertising. There's a lot of opportunity there. It's an area that, although we've invested a little bit in the past, we just mostly spend our time on other initiatives. And now we're turning our attention to that one. There's a lot of opportunity on that side. And the goal of that, of course, is just to drive more demand for our apps. You've got a lot of supply of that and we have the ability to grow our supply. So we're highly focused on growing demand and third-party partnerships are one way to do that.
The other way we do that is building unique ad products into our UI. Simple example is Roku City, which is very popular, we added sponsored links to Roku City and the people, companies love that as a unique product. And when they buy that product, we bundle other ad products with that. So increasing demand.
I mentioned subscriptions. So there's a lot we can do on subscriptions. We have a large subscription business, but given the scale of our engagement, I believe there's opportunity to grow subscriptions. So we have a variety of initiatives there. And that involves signing up new subscribers, but also reducing churn. There's things we can do on both of that, both of those fronts.
And then a big focus for me is how do we make best use of our home screen. It's a key asset. But again, we've done a lot over the years to build our business. There's areas we're focused on. There's areas we focus on less, not because they weren't important just we have to choose. And the home screen is something that is a huge asset for us. It's iconic and viewers love it, but we have not really spent much time evolving over the last many years, actually. And so there's just a huge amount of opportunity to keep it iconic but also make it more useful for viewers and also drive more monetization, so driving more subscriptions, driving more engagement, ad products and sponsorship built into the home screen. So I think if I think a year from now, I think we'll continue to see evolution of our home screen. I mean, so far, all we've really done is that 1 content wrote the top, which has been working well for us, but that's really just the tip of the iceberg of what we can do. So those are the kinds of things that we're working on. Fantastic. My other one is on M&E. I will take the point that M&E is a lot smaller than it used to be. But I'm really -- Wall Street loves lead indicators. It feels to me like this Deadpool movie and Barbie and Oppenheimer, when these big movies come into the box office, do they eventually show up in streaming and therefore, they show up as an ad on your front page? Are we able as Wall Street to look at what's happening at the box office and then extrapolate that into your M&E revenue 2 or 3 quarters later as those films come to the streaming platforms? Well, let me take a shot at that, and then I'll turn it over to Charlie, who really understands our M&E business very well. M&E is pretty broad-based. It's not just. I think, you can't really just look at new releases and extrapolate from that. I mean M&E is -- it's an internal term. It's a term we use that means media and entertainment. It's a term we use to refer to our basically our endemic partners like services on the platform that wants to sign on these subscribers or increase engagement or sell transactions. And all of those things happen through M&E and it's also distributed.
One way we're good at it is it distributed throughout platform. There's, of course, the Marquee ad. That's a primary way. But there's a lot of other ways that we drive those things for our partners, subscriptions, transactions, engagement. And so it's complicated. I mean we do -- it's deeply integrated into the platform. But Charlie, do you want to share? Sure. That's spot on. And Laura, the way I think about it is M&E is really a category for us because we are so good at driving people streaming business. Literally, you click on an ad here and also watch it here. So it's a unique category to us and as it does well and as there are new entrants, we're always positioned to do well in that. And that's why we break that out. But your point is right as well. When you think about the big movies, all of our strategy is to establish that we're broad reach in the lead-in television. And so with households with 120 million people, which is really Super Bowl sides reach every day, we really can drive an impact and put people in seats at movie theaters. So as they spend more and as we do the improvements to the home screen that Anthony talks about, those are strategies that overlap and we'll have more and more value to people who need broad reach because you can't fake scale, and we have scale. So our home screen and broad reach strategy, Anthony said, we're just at the beginning of, will drive broader reach advertising, which is stuff like what you've seen from Disney over the last few weeks, they've had a nice run.
I'll tell you also partnerships, a lot of what we're talking about in terms of making Roku more performant and more efficient for our advertisers, is also allowing us different types of partnerships. So we just did a deal with Fandango, and that's all about proving that we are not just effective for them, but that we can get people into seats. And so I'm very enamored, one of the reasons I came here is we're so good, not just at the top of the funnel with the broader reach, but with proving performance and you're seeing it in our partnerships that they're acknowledging it, and then we're driving outcomes and driving the KPIs of partners just like we will for the studios. Thanks, Laura. This is Anthony. I was just going to comment one last comment, which is just that, I mean, we are very good at M&E and we're getting better at it, and it's a good business for us. But the key factor that's driving -- the reason it's challenged is because it's pretty simple that a lot of streaming services are pulling back on their marketing budgets, and that's having some impact on the market and us as well. And the next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. I wanted to ask about distribution revenue. First of all, was there 606 adjustments in the quarter, if there was, would you mind telling us how big it was? And then looking at the next year revenue acceleration. Does that assume that the distribution revenue continues to grow at the rate that seems to be growing now or should it accelerate because we are comping against fairly big 606 adjustments last year. So I would appreciate any help on this. Yes. I'll take that one. We did have a 606 adjustment in Q2. It was similar to the adjustment that we had last quarter, and it was primarily due to the -- our subscriptions increasing prices when our partners increase prices, we benefit from that, not just in our revenue, but it can lead to 606 adjustment. We don't forecast 606 adjustments because the forecast takes that into account. But yes, we did have one for Q2.
In terms of your question on acceleration, as we talked about the acceleration that we expect to see in Q4, we talked also about the acceleration from Q2 into Q3 for advertising. That was specific to advertising. In my prepared remarks, I talked about SSD or the streaming distribution business having difficult comps because of all the price increases, the subscription businesses that we saw in H2 of last year and in H1 of this year, and it's very hard to predict those price increase. And so if we see similar price increases across the SVOD partners, we'll benefit from that. We'll also benefit from all the work that we're doing and driving more subscriptions. That is what Anthony talked about earlier on the call and how that compares from an acceleration standpoint, I would expect that just based on the difficult comp, the acceleration is going to be led more by the advertising business with SSD moderating going forward. But again, it really does depend on a lot of the price increases that we see from our SVOD parters. And the next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolf Research. Two questions, one on third-party ad sales and another on the cost and getting apps and getting screened real estate. On sells, I wanted to ask you why now on using third-party DSPs to sell Roku Channel ad inventory.
Particularly the [ third-party ] partnership. Should we think about that as over the long run, a disinflationary or decision for you relative to your prior strategy and why now? Obviously, everybody wants to sell more volume, but there's a pro and con to that decision. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And then on the costs, you've had a very advantageous commercial terms with TV manufacturers over time and also with streaming app owners over time. And I wonder how many changes in the market for those relationships. This is Anthony. third-party ad sales and why now. I'll let Charlie give his thoughts. But I'll just say from my point of view, over the years, we've created a streaming platform and it's not -- it's a lot of work. You've got to do a lot of different stuff. And there's a lot of places you can focus. There's a lot of different ways to make money and you sort of have to choose. And so in the past, we've chosen things that have worked really well for us to focus on. And obviously, we're not stopping doing those. We're going to continue to do those.
Integrating with third-party partners is something we've done in the past. It's not that it's new. It's just that we've never really focused on it as a key initiative that we're going to really push on. And it was just a choice you made. These other opportunities where we thought were better turns at that moment in time. At this moment in time, it's the one that we've chosen. And without going through that, the way we rank different options. I mean we've got a lot of options on where we can spend our time is the one that we believe is going to have a big impact over the next year.
And also a little bit related to the fact that the evolution of the industry, advertising even though it's often delivered programmatically these days, it's still often sold through people on the street, but it's increasingly going through programmatic demand platforms and demand is also increasingly being sourced from those platforms. And it's clear that's the future of the initiation of the question of how long is it going to take. And so it's our judgment now it's the right time. So that's basically the answer. I don't know, Charlie, do you have anything to add to that? Yes, I agree with all that. And look, media performance will differentiate us. There's something very empowering for us about being an interoperable platform in a world that is not often open or interoperable certainly across the ecosystem. So we announced something called Roku Exchange. It's a TV streaming first ad tech solution, and it's the way we bring Roku's differentiated tech stack to market. So to your point, we've benefited from our tech stack to date. And now we're bringing it to market in a way that allows us to take all of the advertising capabilities from our DSP and add an intelligence layer that allows for our data-driven media to be matched with best product across the pragmatic ecosystem.
So Peter, you think about the scale that we offer, we talk a lot, it's funny about having unmatched scale in the homes with 120 million people every day. That means we also have the largest CTV data set to match with someone like the Trade Desk, and that will separate us in this market. So Anthony is right, the timing is right, and it allows us to be confident that we're building with the right people in the right way to grow into the future. And then your second question, I wasn't quite sure I understood, but I think it basically was, is there any change in the dynamics around apps on our platform. And perhaps you mentioned -- yes. So I think the main change, I would say, is just the continued growth in Roku's scale. I mean, we're approaching half of all broadband households in the United States, [ 100 ] households with 120 million people every day turn on a Roku TV. We put a chart in the shareholder letter that showed just the massive scale of our engagement compared to other platforms. I mean we're a must-have platform if you're going to launch a streaming service or if you want to build a market a streaming service. And so certainly, that scale is impacting our relationships with streaming services. I mean, obviously, there's a mutually beneficial relationship for both of us. But our large scale is making us really important to streaming services platforms. That's probably the main change. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. I had 2. I wanted to just ask a little bit more about the revenue guide at platform. Dan, you helped a little bit with the 606, but I'm curious just to understand the at least reported deceleration going from 11% this quarter to 9% next quarter. Is the 606 impact that you're expecting in the Q or the comping that much bigger in 3Q versus 2Q? And then also several price increases have been announced, right? So I think Peacock, Max, Paramount Plus, if I remember correctly. So is that taken into account in your third quarter guide? Or is that something that would be incremental? And then I have a bigger picture one, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on that first. Yes, I'll take that question. So the 606 impact for Q3 of last year was similar to the 606 of Q2 of last year and Q2 of this year. So there is that impact on the sequential decline. And you could roughly call it around 200 basis points. But the other piece, which we tried to lay out in the prepared remarks is the SSD comp, the streaming services distribution comp just gets a lot more challenging in H2 of this year relative to H2 last year, simply because we are comping a lot of price increases that happened last year. And yes, there are some price increases that happened this year, but not to the level from what we see that happened last year. So the SSD business just doesn't have a much more difficult comp, which does play into that Q2 to Q3 decel from 11% to the 9% that we guided also the 606 I just mentioned. And then, of course, I said in my prepared remarks that we are expecting advertising to accelerate on a sequential basis during that quarter, during from Q2 to Q3. Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question is on the data that you put in and Anthony just referenced about your share of the U.S. CTV OS market, right, at almost 50%, a very impressive number. But your CTV revenue as part of share, I think, is much, much smaller than that. My math would say less than 10%. So my question is, do you see 50% as a number that investors should be thinking about as share of the market that you can be striving toward. How can we reconcile that share with how big you feel your company can be in the CTV marketplace? This is Anthony. I'll take that. But before I answer, I just want to make sure I understood the question. So what were you comparing it to? Our share of the... The CTV. So I understand there are different revenue sources. I understand that, but showing that chart, I think, leads investors to see you as roughly half of the, as you like to say, the starting point or the launch pad. So how much of that can translate to financial performance? Could you be 50% of the CTV marketplace over time? Yes. I mean I think that there's -- that scale and -- I mean, we expect to continue growing our scale, both in the U.S. and internationally. Both in terms of active accounts, but also streaming hours per account. So that's the basis, one of the basis on which our growth is based and we're going to continue to drive that. That scale does create the opportunity for us to continue to increase monetization per account in a variety of ways, including creating new products that we own and operate or that we integrate into our platform. And so yes, there's a lot of room to continue to grow. If you think about the streaming hours on our platform, they range from hours that we completely monetize 100% on like ours in the Roku Channel to ours that we make less monetization on. So where it's going to land, it's hard for me to say. And the next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Can we switch to the devices side, please? I'm just curious, you had really strong growth in the quarter. It looks like some okay growth forecast for Q3 as well. There was some question about your distribution via various retailers such as Walmart. I wonder if you could speak about how your retailing strategy is going. And when do we actually comp against your own teeth coming out Q3, but I can't remember. And just kind of how much impact might we expect for that in Q3 and Q4. All right. Thanks, Tim. This is Anthony. I'll take that and then maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about comping against our own TVs. In general, the device side of our business, which is focused on growing active accounts, signing up new streaming households is doing really well. I mean we have a product that we spent the last 16 years building. Consumers love it. It's a great product. It's a great brand. It's got strong momentum in the market. Like I said, we added 2 million net accounts in the quarter.
And that side of our business, growing active accounts from selling devices comes from selling -- there's sort of 3 pillars to that. The biggest pillar actually is the licensing program where we licensed Roku TVs to other OEMs. We license the platform to other OEMs. That's the biggest piece, but also quite big as streaming players. We sell a lot of streaming players. And then Roku-branded TVs or first-party Roku TVs, that's relatively new for us, is growing. It's ramping nicely, like we think it's a good program, but it's still got a ways to go.
And then in Q1, we mentioned that we added in terms of Roku TV first-party TVs, Roku -- sorry, Roku-branded Roku TVs. In Q1, we added -- we mentioned before that we added Amazon, Costco, Walmart.com. And then in this quarter, we expanded distribution to include Target and some other specialty retailers, so we're expanding distribution.
In April, the new Roku Pro Series hit the market. The Pro Series is our sort of higher-performing Roku-branded TVs, receiving really strong reviews, selling well. For example, Yahoo! Tech, named the Pro Series their favorite TV of 2024.
So I would say, in general, that part of our business is doing well. And we expect it to continue to grow for the foreseeable future, both actually in the U.S., where we have very strong market share, but we still think there's room to grow there. And then also globally, of course, is a big focus for us.
And then on the branded TV, like I said, it's still fairly early days for that. I mean it's starting to ramp up. The scale is good. But there's a lot of room -- I think a lot of room to continue to grow that, but I'll turn it over to Dan. Yes. I'll just add that we launched in Q1 of last year. But just as a reminder, for all of last year, we were exclusive with Best Buy and Anthony labeled off all the distribution partners we now have starting in Q1 of this year and adding in Q2 and this year as well with Target and some specialty Visa. So we're very well distributed in FY '24 versus FY '23. So we do expect to -- the Roku branded TV to continue to ramp, and you'll see that in our guide and in our reported results as we go forward. We're happy with it. We're happy with our distribution partners and we're seeing great results from it. So it's a big win for us. And a quick follow-up. When can we think -- when can we expect to get closer to breakeven on gross profit? If you're ramping up more on the owned branded TVs, maybe the higher price sets coming out now, I'm guessing that helps to get closer to breakeven on gross profit? Yes, I'll take that one as well. So we were at negative 11% in our device margin business. And we guided to a similar level in Q3, which is the low double digit, negative low double digits on Roku-branded TV.
So as Anthony mentioned, we're early on in our ramp to scale. And as we get scale, our component costs should come down. I can't speak to market pricing. We watch that very closely as well. But we do believe that the component costs will continue to go down to scale. So I expect over time that we will see improvements in device margin. Again, just as a scaling and getting very good at managing the BOM cost. We saw this with players and Roku does an exceptionally good job of managers. It is a core competency of the company. But for the next several quarters, I think we're going to be in this range just because it takes many quarters to get to the scale where you start to see the benefit from component costs come down. The next question comes from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. I had 2 advertising questions for Charlie or Anthony. First, could you provide an update on the news front, maybe the broader market, what you're seeing and anything Roku specific? And then secondly, how are you thinking about the impact to advertising in the second half of the year from the political and mix given your announced partnership. Hi, Cory, thanks for the questions. Charlie will take both of those actually. Cory, the answer is we're seeing good momentum on news front, it's been a positive market for us. And we've been growing our share generally across the board while continuing to embrace new ways of working and what is unquestionably modern more digital-first ecosystem. The digital transition absolutely benefits Roku and our clients. Good news is we're hearing a lot of excitement around our new products like the video ads and the marquee and sports participation. You mentioned in your next question in the Olympics and all we've done Major League Baseball.
And we've also invested, and this isn't quite as visible as those, we've invested a lot in partnerships to make Roku easier to buy and measure. So we've been getting the feedback we wanted, which is that we're making it easier to purchase Roku Media and onboard new clients and then measure their performance. And I think you're going to be hearing that more and more.
So it's a different marketplace than it used to be. And we're ready while the video revenue is still purchased during the upfront, and we're building that share, we also expect buying to be executed across a bunch of channels both direct and programmatic all year long with all sorts of flexibility built in because of the market dynamic you mentioned in your question.
So on the momentum, we're closing the upfront with Poise. We're building share and we're having great conversations both about the upfront and establishing client KPIs really well beyond the upfront. And it's a change we're ready for, and I feel confident with our position.
On political. Look, political holds us in a terrific position as we count down to November and the completion of the '24 election cycle. And while we're happy with our political ad sales, it really is just one part of our growing and diverse advertising business. What they're noticing like other categories is we have the tools and tech that make Roku a strategic platform for advertisers. So they're taking advantage of our scale and our ability to target desirable audiences and geographies and Anthony said something earlier that I think bears repeating. This is another category where Roku is getting better every cycle. We really are improving, which is terrific.
The Olympics, I'm really excited about. You just saw on the screen before we customize that experience. And if you understand Roku's strategy and market differentiation, the Olympics is a really great example of both. We talk a lot, we did at our upfront. We talked to advertisers all the time about our unique position to lead in to all of television. And we're working so closely with Peacock and NBC to be the lead into the Olympics. And it's clearly working. I keep getting text from folks in France that say we're on fire and we're helping drive their engagement.
So what our Olympics partnership with them was, and it was a series of custom integrations, ability to innovate and are also ability to build really bespoke ad-supported experience around tentpole events. And what I like about it, not just that it's working for our great partners at NBC and Peacock, but we can do this for all sorts of major events across television. It's totally something Roku has a right to win at. So we have the scale and focus to be the lead into television. That's a differentiator. I said before, you can't fake scale and you can't fake that we have home with nearly 120 million viewers every day coming through our front door. So the good news about this, and I'll end here is our Olympic experience is great for viewers. They're using it. It's making the Olympics easier. It's great for content owners who are our partners and obviously, it benefits advertisers. In fact, we co-hold the Olympics with NBC and that whole lead-in experience.
So we launched the Olympic zone. That's going well. We are doing similar things for Major League Baseball and through our NFL experience. And again, it's a total differentiator and improves our impact and our partnership capabilities and you're going to see a lot more of it ahead. And the last question will come from David Joyce with Seaport Research. Could you please add some more color on how fill rates are evolving and how the increasing programmatic buying activity and ad tech partnerships and increased industry supply are interplaying there? This is Charlie. David. It's all of a piece. So Anthony led with, and it's so impressive. The entire platform is growing. And in fact, the Roku Channel is growing over 75% year-over-year. So you can imagine that holds us in great stead to handle both. Pricing fluctuations in the market and demand fluctuations. And then we're layering these third-party partnerships, not just Trade Desk, but all sorts of third-party partnerships over our advanced data, our scale and our ability to handle supply. So fill rates are one metric of our success. But I think what you're going to see is a steady ramp of demand and a steady ramp of ad revenues into the back half of the year. So it all moves together and I think we're pretty uniquely positioned to drive the type of opportunities we've been talking about on this call. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Anthony for closing remarks. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and thanks to our employees, customers, partners and advertisers. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","our full results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter on our IR website at roku.com/investor . on this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, subject to risks and uncertainties .",0.0
