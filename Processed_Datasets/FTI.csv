All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
Thank you. At this time I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Matt Seinsheimer. Please go ahead, Mr. Seinsheimer. Good afternoon and welcome to TechnipFMC's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued yesterday can be found on our website.
I'd like to caution you with respect to any forward-looking statements made during this call. Although these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding future developments and business conditions, they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.
Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q, and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the French AMF and the UK Financial Conduct Authority. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. Our financial results in the quarter again demonstrated solid operational execution and the benefits of merger synergy.
Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the first quarter with the anticipated year-over-year declines in Subsea and Onshore/Offshore partially offset by growth in Surface Technologies. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $387 million, with margin unchanged at 12.4%.
We recorded our highest level of quarterly inbound orders since the formation of TechnipFMC. Total company orders were $3.5 billion, with particular strength in Onshore/Offshore. Total company backlog grew sequentially to $14 billion at quarter end.
Driving value through subsea integration was the fundamental reason behind the creation of TechnipFMC. Today, we remain the only company that can execute a truly integrated subsea project delivered on the seabed. In the first quarter we demonstrated further progress in validating this unique business model by securing three additional integrated EPCI, or iEPCI awards.
We have talked previously about a growing trend towards independents and new entrants undertaking subsea development. In March we announced our largest iEPCI award to-date for Energean's Karish and Tanin development in the Mediterranean Sea. The size and breath of scope make this a flagship project for TechnipFMC. It is also a direct award and another major contract win for us. We have worked exclusively and collaboratively with Energean from early concept and integrated FEED, through to the integrated EPCI direct award.
It is also the first iEPCI contract that fully integrates the entire subsea scope with that of the host production facility, leveraging the unique capabilities we have across our portfolio. And we will deliver a cost-effective solution faster than anyone could have done under a traditional contracting model.
Success also creates opportunities. In the first quarter we announced the award of an iEPCI from Shell for their Gumusut development in Malaysia. This award marks our second repeat customer and is the industry's first iEPCI award in the Asia-Pacific region. Our new business model is now being implemented in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific region.
We can also demonstrate our unique integrated model in the brownfield market through the integration of subsea processing and topside controls. We have been awarded an iEPCI project for the Who Dat field in the Gulf of Mexico, a contract that builds on an alliance relationship with LLOG that we have shared for more than a decade.
Who Dat originally achieved first production in 2011. As the field has matured reservoir pressures have declined, suppressing the recovery potential of the field. With the addition of our multiphase pump, the third such award for our own solution and the first for us in the Gulf of Mexico, we can boost production and increase recovery rate, providing an uplift to the overall project return. As an iEPCI offering, we will deliver and install the complete subsea package as well as the control equipment on the topside.
In total, we have now secured nine iEPCI awards. We see further validation of the new business model through our growing volume of integrated FEED activity, which serves as a leading indicator of future integrated project awards. Many of these projects are exclusive to TechnipFMC and are now progressing towards final investment decision. All this gives us confidence that as much as 25% of our Subsea inbound orders will come from iEPCI in 2018.
Subsea order inbound in the first quarter of $1.2 billion again exceeded revenues in the quarter and on a rolling 12-month basis, we have achieved a Subsea book-to-bill above 1. Importantly, the momentum in FEED and tendering activity for both traditional and iEPCI projects is supported by the considerable improvement in deepwater project economics and operator cash flows.
The Subsea opportunity list reflects our view of the full Subsea value stream and highlights a significant market opportunity set for us, given the breadth of our product, service and commercial offering. We expect several major projects to move forward in the coming quarters and remain confident that we will again achieve year-over-year growth in our Subsea inbound orders.
Now, turning to Onshore/Offshore. We reported solid inbound activity for the quarter. Onshore orders reflect work across multiple downstream markets including gas processing, petrochemicals and refining. Our process technologies business also benefited from multiple orders. Offshore work was driven primarily by the FPSO award for Karish and Tanin, a major component of this fully integrated EPCI contract.
FEED activity strengthened in the period. While these revenues are typically smaller in size, this work can lead to significant project activity in the future periods. This early engagement strategy also serves to reduce project execution risk. For the quarter, Onshore/Offshore achieved total inbound of $1.8 billion. These awards were broadly split between onshore and offshore markets and reflect diversity by both geography and end market.
In early April, we announced the award of a FEED contract for the FPSO unit on the BP Tortue field development, a major LNG project located offshore West Africa. TechnipFMC will initially work on defining the technology and equipment scope and the agreement with BP provides us the opportunity to transition the FEED to an EPCI contract at a later stage. This represents a major inbound opportunity for TechnipFMC in the coming quarters.
As we discussed on our Q4 earnings call, we continue to see opportunities developing in the LNG market. LNG is one of the fastest growing markets in the oil and gas sector. To satisfy increasing customer demand, a few LNG projects will likely be sanctioned over the next three years and many more beyond that. We have an extensive list of LNG references that date back to the world's first LNG project in the 1960s. We have executed many of the world's largest LNG developments as well as many midscale LNG plants.
We are the pioneer in floating LNG, having successfully delivered the first FLNG and we are now commissioning the largest ever FLNG. And we have developed significant expertise in applying modularization to large scale projects and developing project management solutions for mega projects in remote locations. In fact, we have developed over 20% of global installed capacity, some 90 million tons of annualized production. LNG is clearly a core competency of TechnipFMC. We are present and capable in all regions with large gas reserves, leaving us well-positioned to capitalize on the improved market dynamics for gas monetization.
Now let me update you on some of the technology investments we have made that will further differentiate our offering and provide future growth opportunities for our company. We announced in March, we have taken minority ownership in Magma Global, a leading provider of risers, jumpers and downlines for subsea exploration and production.
Through our collaboration with Magma, we will accelerate our delivery of the next-generation of Hybrid Flexible Pipe. This new product is part of our Subsea 2.0 offering and upon commercial introduction we'll complete the rollout of this unique suite of products. Much like the other 2.0 products we have in our portfolio today, we see the potential for significant reductions in both schedule and weight, driven by the use of innovative materials and increased manufacturing automation. Composites also provide superior corrosion tolerance in applications that involve high natural gas content such as the pre-salt discoveries in Brazil.
Customer acceptance of Subsea 2.0 has been very positive. Our 2.0 components have been incorporated in more than 50% of new FEED studies this year. And several of these studies have included the entire suite of products. We are very pleased with this level of interest as it speaks to the compelling benefits of our 2.0 offering.
But our technology investments extend beyond subsea. In late March, we also announced the acquisition of a unique chemicals technology used to produce Epicerol, a chemical intermediate used in the manufacturing of epoxy resins, founding coatings, composites and adhesive applications across various industries.
TechnipFMC will license this technology, provide services related to project design and engineering, and supply the associated proprietary equipment. More importantly, this investment, much like Magma and Subsea 2.0, is representative of a broader strategy focused on further expanding and differentiating our portfolio of value-added technologies.
In closing, the first quarter marked another period of solid operational performance but more importantly, we generated robust inbound orders that resulted in a sequential increase in project backlog. Market acceptance of our unique integrated model, iEPCI continues to demonstrate our clear leadership as evidenced by the three new integrated projects awarded in the quarter.
Momentum is also building in Onshore/Offshore activity, enabling us to selectively rebuild backlog as we continue to successfully execute and deliver on Yamal LNG, the largest project ever undertaken by our company. And we continue to pursue growth opportunities through new technologies that we are confident will strengthen our leadership position and create new market opportunities.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann. Thanks, Doug. Overall, we are pleased with the operational performance in the first quarter. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $387 million in the quarter and compares to $420 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was unchanged at 12.4% despite a year-over-year revenue decline of 8%. Good project execution and the benefits of merger and other cost saving initiatives offset the otherwise negative effects of reduced sales volume.
Subsea delivered solid first quarter results in the face of revenue declines and lower utilization of our fleets and manufacturing facilities. Onshore/Offshore delivered robust performance with strong project execution across much of the project portfolio, and in Surface Technologies, higher activity levels in North America were the primary driver of the year-over-year improvement, somewhat muted by transitory issues. However, the sequential performance versus the fourth quarter results was negatively impacted by project award deferrals and lower price backlog in our international market.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.28, when excluding after tax charges and credits of $0.08 per diluted share. This compares to the prior year quarter of $0.26 per share on an adjusted basis, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.30 per diluted share. Charges and credits in the period totaled $48 million. We have provided you with schedules that accompany our release that give you greater clarity on the details of these items. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9% when excluding the effects of discrete items. Strong results in jurisdictions with higher tax rates are expected to keep our full-year tax rate within the targeted range of 28% to 32%.
Turning now to more detail in the segment highlights. Subsea EBITDA margins of 14.6% were down 276 basis points against the prior-year quarter impacted by a 14% decline in the revenues, lower vessel utilization, somewhat offset by cost reduction initiatives. While vessel utilization is typically lower in the first quarter of the year due to seasonal factors, the 60% utilization rate for the first quarter was down from the 68% level achieved in the prior year.
Inbound orders were $1.2 billion in the quarter. Subsea backlog now stands at $6.1 billion. Importantly, the backlog schedule in on our presentation deck illustrates that we now have more than 90% coverage of revenue for the midpoint of our 2018 guidance when including first quarter results and the anticipated revenue from Subsea Services. This is further support to our full year revenue guidance.
Onshore/Offshore revenue declined 11% versus the prior-year quarter as we progressed towards completion on major projects including Yamal LNG. Notably, revenue from project activity beyond Yamal increased significantly year-over-year driven by higher activity levels related to several large projects, including Prelude FLNG, Martin Linge, and Jebel Ali, as well as work related to the activity ramp on Coral FLNG.
While year-over-year revenue comparisons for Yamal LNG will remain a headwind over the course of 2018, the project will still be the most significant contributor to Onshore/Offshore in the year. We expect revenue from Yamal to continue through 2020 as we progress towards final completion of the project.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13.7% were up more than 500 basis points versus the prior year quarter despite the revenue decline, driven in large part by continued solid execution on several key projects. We are pleased with the broad-based strength of the inbound for Onshore/Offshore, both by geography and end market. Orders grew to $1.8 billion in the quarter.
I will also highlight that our previously announced award for the Bapco Sitra refinery expansion in Bahrain was booked in the quarter. Inbound related to this project was just over $100 million, a small portion of our economic interest. We have a 36% ownership stake in the project joint venture, which is a minority position and therefore do not consolidate within our financial statements. However this project holds significant economic value for TechnipFMC. Onshore/Offshore backlog now stands at $7.5 billion. We now have sufficient backlog in hand to meet our full-year revenue guidance of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion.
Moving to Surface Technologies, revenue increased by 50% year-over-year largely driven by the significant increase in North American activity that drove strong demand for hydraulic fracturing, wellhead and flow metering equipment. International revenues also increased versus the prior year quarter, although at a more moderate pace. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13.5% declined 96 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Despite softer than anticipated margin performance in our North American business, we expect further activity improvement over the remainder of the year.
Additionally, we are experiencing increased demand for our integrated pad offering which services the shale market. Outside of North America, increased orders and targeted business investment should benefit near-term results. While we remain cautious on the potential impact of pricing in some international markets, we are confident that we can meet our full year objective for the segment as a whole. Backlog for Surface Technologies ended the quarter at $410 million.
Turning to cash flow, I wanted to highlight several items that frame our results in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a negative $202 million. The decline was primarily a function of working capital outflows, driven by our project related activity.
Let me point out another change associated with revenue recognition. A change now exists in the presentation of the trade receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities. Under the new revenue recognition standard, we now recognize receivables when we have unconditional right to payment. Previously, we reported certain billed amounts on a net basis within contract assets and contract liabilities. Going forward, we will provide you with the changes in the quarterly filings, so you can see what the balances would have been under prior recognition method.
In the first quarter, contract liabilities would have been $3.4 billion under the prior standard as compared with the $3.9 billion we reported. Contract assets would have been $1.8 billion versus the $1.5 billion reported. The change to note here is that trade receivables increased $960 million in the quarter, $846 million of which was due to the recognition standard. When looking at net contract liability position going forward, this change should be included.
Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $53 million in the quarter. There were also several discretionary items impacting the period. First, $120 million reduction in debt outstanding, much of which was related to the reduction in the use of our commercial paper for short-term financing. Second, $93 million related to share repurchase activity, bringing our total repurchases since inception of the plan in 2017 to $151 million. We remain committed to completing the $500 million authorization by the end of this year. Lastly, $62 million related to the completion of acquisitions, which included the transaction with Island Offshore that is intended to strengthen our services growth platform.
As a reminder, we're forming a new company called TechnipFMC Island Offshore Subsea, or TIOS. This will focus on vessel-based well intervention services. The combination expands our engineering, design and execution capabilities and accelerate our transition from a light well intervention stack supplier to an integrated services provider. We have worked with Island Offshore for more than 10 years and together we have successfully performed intervention services on more than 500 subsea wells. Over the next five years, we believe the market for these services will double in size. In total, these discretionary spending items were $275 million in the period. Importantly, they are supported by a very strong balance sheet and our net cash balance stood at $2.4 billion at quarter end.
Let me update to you on the financial implication of the new revenue recognition standard. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method. Under this method no restatements are made to prior period results. Revenue from the period totaling $115 million will largely be recognized in future periods. Since there is no change in the timing of project costs and expenses, most of the revenue will be realized as pre-tax income. The majority of this income statement effect will occur in our Onshore/Offshore segment over the course of 2018.
Additionally a net favorable adjustment of approximately $712 million was made to project backlog. Under the new guidelines, there are additional revenues related to future reimbursable work that are now included in backlog, reflecting a change in the timing of order recognition. This work was not recorded in our inbound activity during the period. The majority of this adjustment impacted our Onshore/Offshore segment. I'd like to also note that the adjustment was not related to the Yamal project.
Given the future impact from the new revenue recognition standard, as well as the operating strength reported in our first quarter results, we are increasing 2018 margin guidance for the Onshore/Offshore segment. We now anticipate full-year EBITDA margins to be at least 11.5%, up from prior guidance of at least 10.5%, while our revenue guidance is unchanged at between $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, we now expect full-year results to be near the high end of this range.
In summary, our first quarter earnings underpin our confidence in the full-year outlook for 2018. We have increased our guidance for Onshore/Offshore, driven in part by the strong results in the quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver EBITDA margins of at least 14% in Subsea. And we continue to expect Surface Technologies EBITDA margin of at least 17.5% despite the softer first quarter performance.
Total company inbound orders were strong at $3.5 billion with orders exceeding growth in all segments. We are encouraged by growing FEED activity and project tendering, which bodes well for future project awards across our major business segments. Three iEPCI awards during the quarter speak to our leadership and success in developing the integrated business model. Our extensive involvement on Energean's Karish and Tanin development clearly illustrate the sheer breadth of our integration capabilities.
We are optimistic about the improved outlook for LNG, particularly given our Tier 1 status for onshore projects and clear market leadership in floating LNG, and we continue to pursue value enhancing investment opportunities that strengthen our market positions, extend our technology leadership and bolster our growth potential.
Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. Again we do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you. I will pause for a brief moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Alsford with Citi. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I've got one on the cash flow if I could please. Just to come back to Maryann's comments on the working capital and the change in accounting rules you're adopting. Can you maybe give some guidance as to what you expect the working capital outflow will be for 2018? Obviously, there's been a big outflow in 1Q, and how that would relate to obviously the performance you've done in 2017 would be my first question. Thank you. Sure, Michael. Thank you. A couple of things, yes, working capital, about a $450 million change in the quarter. In part, there's about $50 million in that working capital swing that's associated with FX, largely from change in the euro. As we talked about in a prior quarter, we had estimated our working capital change to be about half of what we experienced in 2017. And obviously, there's a piece of that – pretty big piece of it happened in the first quarter. As you can imagine, working capital is clearly one of the most challenging things to forecast. But we do quite a bit of work in looking at project expectation, completion, as we look at that project by project.
On a full-year basis, I would still submit that our working capital range might creep up a bit from that, but we're still pretty confident depending on the timing of when projects come in and which projects they are, which is probably the biggest challenge to forecasting that working capital piece. But we remain pretty confident that within a reasonable range there our working capital flows will be lower than we've seen in 2017. Okay. Thanks, Maryann. And let me following up on the kind of momentum in the pipeline of awards. I know it's just a broader question, obviously the oil prices have rallied quite a lot since the beginning of the year. I'm just wondering whether you've got a sense as to whether your customers are changing behavior in terms of the way they think about executing and, I guess, targeting new project sanctions? Thanks. Michael, thank you. I'll take that one. We saw a change in behavior actually occur last year, and that change in behavior was driven by our customers' recognition and acceptance that we had created a new and unique commercial model in developing technologies, through (29:42) platform of technologies, that could sustainably and structurally lower the cost base for subsea projects. So, when you couple that with a recovery as you pointed out in the commodity price, increase cash flows for our clients, it just further improves and provides further confidence in their ability to move forward and sanction projects.
But I think it's important to mention both of those attributes. It's not just about the oil price, because as we know the oil price will fluctuate over time. TechnipFMC was created to drive real structural and sustainable change and improved project economics. Our introduction in late last year of our Subsea 2.0 platform and the broad market acceptance of this new product platform, where over 50% of our new FEED studies now include this product platform, gives us great confidence that our customers see that we're providing a real solution. Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, and good afternoon where you guys are. Question just maybe for you, Doug, kind of a big picture. There's been a lot of positive commentary in the press on a lot of projects moving forward this year FIDs, a lot of momentum towards additional bid activity and you guys alluded to that. We're halfway through May and candidly that some of the award flow has been a little slower than I would've expected, not necessary for FMC, but just kind of across the industry. I'd be curious to get your perspective on has it been a little slower in terms of actual awards from where you sit and are we looking at kind of a bigger increase in the second half of the year and do you think we'll have a pretty positive momentum going into 2019, as you think about kind of award cadence for the rest of the year and kind of what's going on? Thank you, Jud. Yes, thank you, Jud. I guess I would have to say if we just look at the sheer results, as pointed out, this has been a record quarter for TechnipFMC. We believe that we're capturing a significant portion of those opportunities. And we're also translating a lot of our integrated FEED work that we've now been doing for over two years, are now being translated into direct project iEPCI awards. The Energean Karish project being a very good – a way to recognize that, a very good example of that. So it's likely that we'll see a continued improvement in the cadence of project FIDs, but we're actually quite pleased with the three iEPCI awards that we received. The level of inbound both in our Subsea as well as our Onshore/Offshore business that we secured in the first quarter. Okay. And my follow up, maybe for Maryann. Could you maybe give us your thoughts on how to think about the margin kind of progression within Subsea for 2018? Typically you guys see a little bit of an improvement seasonally from 1Q to 2Q. And just trying to think about the annual guidance and just in the context of how you see maybe margin progression over the balance of 2018 within Subsea? Yeah, thanks, Jud. So, yeah, you're right. Normally Q1, at least it has been for some time, is normally a seasonally softer quarter for us for many reasons. As you know, we really don't give quarterly guidance, but certainly, as we continue to progress down with respect to our revenues, our ability to improve margins in the back half would certainly be a little more challenged. I would say in this way, we are not expecting very much variability in the next couple of quarters. We should be, I would say, fairly range bound as volumes level out, a lot of the good work that we've done with respect to our cost synergies are now flowing through our manufacturing operations. As you know, we've done quite a bit of work there as well. So, we're not expecting to see a tremendous amount of variability quarter-by-quarter as we have right-sized our organization. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning. Maryann, back to the free cash flow question, if you could perhaps – recognizing the difficulty with regard to nailing down working capital, what do you think is the expected cadence over the course of this year? And moreover with regard to – do you expect to be roughly free cash flow neutral or a modest consumer of cash or more than that on average for 2018? Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, we had a lot of project completion in Q1 and we would expect a bit more in Q2. The back half of the year as we replenish backlog is where we would see some of that offset happening, obviously depending on the timing of those project awards, et cetera, in the form of milestone payments and in the form of advanced payments as well. So, I would say back half should be more positive than the first half. The second part of your question I think... Okay. The second part of your question was operational cash flow, do we expect to be a significant consumer or more neutral? I would say – I would answer the question in this way, from an operating cash flow perspective, absent big swings in FX, which obviously are a challenge there. I would expect to be neutral to slightly negative, but certainly not a significant consumer on the operating line. And again just to reiterate, the timing and the type of projects as the way they come in obviously plays on our ability to forecast that. But big project completions in the beginning of the year as we then start new projects should be offsetting as we look at those milestone payments. Okay. And then secondly, with regard to I think, your prior guidance for Subsea services which appears to have been maintained, called for flat revenues year-over-year. We've got Brent approaching $80. I would assume that short cycle activity in general is picking up pretty strongly. So I'm just curious as to regard to (36:42) your updated guidance for Subsea services and the importance of that of course is that, it's your highest margin sub-segment within Subsea which would I'd hope drive overall Subsea margins higher as well. Can you comment on that? Yeah. Bill, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. As you know, we don't give specific guidance on sub-segments, but we had indicated that we would expect that activity to be relatively in line with 2017. You hit on a very interesting point. I just got back from visiting with a client, who clearly is indicating that there will be an increased level of subsea well intervention, which as you know, if done via riserless light well intervention, can – we certainly benefit from as the leading provider and the most experienced provider of riserless light well intervention. But also regardless of the mode of intervention, riserless or riser-based, it requires the removal of the tree, the reinstallation of the tree, and typically while the wellbore maintenance is being done, the tree is actually returned to shore for inspection, maintenance and repair.
So, I think you're right to expect that there is going to be some increased level of activity both in terms of riserless well intervention activity as well as in inspection, maintenance and repair activity, which is a very important component for our company. Let's wait to see how that plays out, if that plays out towards the latter half of 2018 or more pushed into the beginning of 2019. But I would agree with you there is a pent up demand that we are well-prepared and well-positioned to take to provide that support for our clients. Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Brown with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. It's encouraging to see another multiphase pump sale. Are you seeing any opportunities to deploy that kit within the greenfield market? That's the first question. And then the second question, following up from perhaps what's already been said, you've obviously invested in the Subsea services space over the past few months, is there anything that you feel you're missing from that toolkit and do you get the sense that your clients are perhaps increasingly interested and in an integrated services type approach and perhaps bundling more of those life-of-field services together? Thank you. Short answer to both questions is yes and yes. Thank you for the questions. In regards to greenfield... Thanks for the answer. In regards to greenfield opportunities for multiphase pumps, clearly there is quite a few studies that we're doing right now and not just for boosting by the way, also for subsea processing, something that hasn't been spoken about much in the recent years. And as you know, we are the leader and have done 100% of all subsea processing, including that are inclusive of separation activity that has been done in the industry. So, yes, quite a few activities.
Now, that being said, part of our vision for Subsea is to enable our customers to have a more dynamic subsea architecture. In other words, instead of necessarily putting all that capital in the front-end of the project, which has a significant impact on the overall project economics and FID and the sanctioning of the project, is to be able to spread that over the life of the project. The only way you can do that is by reducing the number of interfaces, making things interchangeable and quite frankly making things more simplified by significantly reducing the part count and the interoperability of those components.
This is a big engineering challenge. It's one that our company has been focused on for quite a few years. So, we would see potentially it designed into a greenfield, but maybe we deliver it at a later stage. Why is that important? That keeps us intimately involved with that asset for the 20 year, 25 year life of the asset, not only in terms of the aftermarket subsea services, which was your second question, but also in terms of if we want to add capability as the reservoir conditions change, as the geochemistry change, as the reservoir pressure changes, there's things we can do over time and it keeps us intimately engaged with that client.
In terms of Subsea services, things that are missing, well you certainly saw the move that we made that Maryann talked about in her prepared remarks in terms of really strengthening our position and changing if you will, our status within the RLWI activity, this was very important and absolutely it was based around becoming the integrator, from going from being the product supplier, a very important piece of the subsea well intervention kit, which is the stack or the pressure containing device, but to move from that to being the integrator is absolutely a key role. This is an area where we will continue to invest. We will continue to look at opportunities to bring in other competencies within our portfolio and expand our range of products and services. Your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Sean. So, Doug, just with the inbound in the quarter, obviously a solid result, what would be your updated thoughts on the cadence of awards for the balance of the year in Subsea. And I'm thinking about the potential impact to 2019 if we maintain pretty consistent assumptions for book and turn in services. In other words, I'm asking, as we're trying to get a better handle on the ability of Subsea inbound to impact the forward year depending on the mix of SPS versus SURF as we go through 2018. Thank you, Sean. So, if we just take the $1.2 billion in the first quarter, and we look at it on an annualized run rate and we have said and remain committed to the expectation that we're going to continue to see an increase. As you know, we saw a 27% increase in 2017 versus 2016, we indicated we would expect a further increase in 2018 over 2017. So kind of from a run rate, and it was – it really ties back to the earlier question from Jud, yes, you would expect that we would be looking for an uptick in the level and the cadence of the inbound orders and very much to Jud's question, some of that may come from some very large awards that are currently pending and could well be FID-ed and awarded later this year.
That being said, we're where we need to be in terms of the current activity and as you know, the earlier that we inbound that activity, the greater benefit that it will have on 2019 which is, we're certainly focused on that as well, Sean. So we're doing everything we can to put the very best solutions and unique solutions in front of our clients and give them opportunities to vastly improve their project economics by in many cases showing them where we can deliver projects that reduce the schedule significantly. A 36 year (sic) [month] (44:39) greenfield project in 24 months or a 15 to 18 month brownfield opportunity installed, delivered on the seabed and commissioned in just 10 months. So it's getting the project sanctioned, but it's also our ability to, if you will, accelerate and capture that revenue more quickly. Understood. Thank you for that. And so, as you're looking at these iEPCI projects compared to other inbound, how would you characterize the pricing for those types of projects? I guess I'm asking as, on the one hand you're trying to get this model established, and you certainly want to be able to show that you're making good traction. At the same time, in many cases, you're providing the best opportunity for that particular project to get sanctioned for that particular operator. So I'm just curious how you see the puts and takes at this point in the cycle for those types of projects dropping into your backlog? Thank you, Sean. Look, I can assure you there is no introductory pricing. There's no special pricing, there's no buy one get two. This is real structural savings that we're providing to our clients. This isn't about discounting. This isn't about a procurement exercise. This is sitting down with them, understanding the project economics, being engaged very early, setting an economical hurdle rate in which the project will be successful, and our ability to be able to do that through that early engagement and then demonstrate through a unique solution which greatly simplifies the subsea architecture by reducing unnecessary interfaces that are required when you split the SPS package from the SURF package, by showing how we can take those away as a single integrated entity. And in off – many times as indicated earlier, reducing and accelerating the delivery of the project installed and commissioned on the seabed by 6 to 12 months, that's what drives the project economics. So you're having a very mature conversation around the project economics, not a conversation around discounting. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rae with Redburn. Please go ahead. Yeah. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. First is just on raw material input costs. What's the impact of rising steel prices on your business? Is there an impact this year or can you pass that through to customers or have you kind of bought forward in some way that leaves you protected? Thanks. Thank you, Michael. Look, we've – when we're going through the process of tendering the projects, we're already going out there and looking at getting some indicative pricing from our supply chain. And as we either become shortlisted or if it's a direct award, as we become more confident that the project is going to move into being sanctioned, we're actually locking in and securing that pricing. We're in communication with the various different suppliers. I think we have quite a diversified group of suppliers and a very high class group of suppliers. But we would not be – other than our very short cycle businesses, we would not be seeing any impact to our projects this year. Okay, okay. That's great. And then just a brief follow up at the risk of being a bit pedantic on the Subsea backlog. So, I can see you've reported book-to-bill of above 1, but the backlog in Subsea looks like it's actually declined ever so slightly quarter-on-quarter. So, has there been any kind of re-phasing or a cancellation or anything in there. Why is that happening? Michael, hi, it's Maryann. There are some minor adjustments which don't flow directly through inbound across all of the segments and they're related to revenue recognition. In addition to that, what you would have is any FX impact. So, they're two things that you would – that we would want to look at. In that there is a small minor impact in the Subsea business as a result of those two. But other than that, nothing else of substance. But certainly no cancellations. Correct. No cancellations, sorry. Your next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead. Thank you. My first question relates to LNG. You had some optimistic commentary on the opportunity there for TechnipFMC, and if I recall the project opportunity or award opportunity for the On/Off biz was mentioned at about $5 billion and that did not include any LNG. If I have that right, could you help us think about the opportunity that could come from LNG and perhaps some of the timing? Great question, Marc, and you are correct. Just to be very clear that when we were talking about the $5 billion of opportunities that we were tracking, that was onshore, downstream opportunities mainly refining, petrochemicals and fertilizer. What we've seen, let's say beyond that, is a significant increase in our process technologies portfolio, much of which drove the unannounced orders in the quarter. And we're also seeing a much – a very strong uptake in our FEED activity and that really, quite frankly, spans petrochemicals and LNG.
So LNG specifically, as you know, it depends upon the project. I mean, there are several projects out there right now that are greenfield projects, but there's also several projects that would be the expansion, if you will, the addition of a train or the addition of maybe two trains.
So where could they range, they could range – they're certainly in the billions, but they could range from $3 billion to $10 billion, and as you know, we would likely partner with somebody on those type of a project. So we would not be necessarily realizing the economic benefit of the full value of the contract but we would be doing that along with a partner. But I think as you're attempting to point out, it would be a substantial upside and we've had quite a bit of activity, both in FEED and also tendering activity going on in LNG. Okay. Well, thanks for that, Doug, that's helpful color. Maryann, I didn't quite catch if you mentioned this, but the $115 million of change in revenue recognition here. Was any of that included in the first quarter and I guess whether it was or it wasn't, it seems like the increase to margin guidance here is a little bit lower than what I would have expected in the On/Off business given that $115 million of benefit, so can you kind of talk to that and also if there's any thought on kind of the long-term margin profile for On/Off given the change in revenue accounting? Sure, Marc. Thank you. So first of all, yes, you're absolutely right. Of the $115 million revenue recognition adjustment in the quarter, the impact was about $33 million of revenue, and – I'm sorry, total of $36 million, excuse me, $36 million, my fault, $36 million. And that is – we'll report that to you. You'll be able to see through the balance of the year quarter-by-quarter, how that $115 million flows through.
The second part of your question is, we expect most of that to flow through in 2018 and most of that flows through on the Onshore/Offshore segment. As you – the question that you asked with respect to the guidance there, we had a very strong quarter in Onshore/Offshore by good project execution. We've increased the guidance to account for the portion of that revenue recognition that'll come through because it comes through really all as pure profitability or EBITDA in the segment.
As you know, I – or at least I tried to comment on the fact that guidance is at least 11.5%. So I'm in no way trying to signal to you that the back half of the year is any different than we projected. Again, these are estimates and not all of it is Onshore/Offshore. So you should feel very confident about the project performance in Onshore/Offshore and our ability to deliver margins in a range of 11.5%. So again just to answer your first question, $36 million of that revenue is accompanying in the revenue that you see under the new revenue recognition guidance. Your next question comes from the line of Vlad Sergievskiy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. It's not Vlad, it's Mick here. Couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, Doug, just on the collaboration with Magma and the composite. So, obviously there's been a long debate and the message for a long-time has been that flexibles are just as good. So I'm just wondering why now, why you need to go into composites at this point. Is it because of the corrosion resistance and the flexible issues or is it they've come of age? Mick, thank you, an important question. The easy answer is because of flexibles (sic) [Subsea] 2.0. This is a new way of thinking. This is a completely changed engineering methodology across our company where we're looking at how do we drive simplification, reduce part count, weight. And when you look at all of that together, it has a profound impact on our operating model. And that's what I think maybe hasn't been fully appreciated.
So, when we talk about – people can talk about making things lighter, I guess it's easy to go on a crash diet, but it's just as easy to put the weight back on at the end of the day. Tell me (55:18). What we're talking about is a fundamental change in our engineering philosophy that has a profound impact on the roofline, on the manufacturing process, on the delivery systems, on the fleet, et cetera. So, no, this is a big, big strategic decision for our company. It has many benefits, one of which as you point out is clearly higher corrosion tolerance and that's important as we continue to develop assets around the world, but it's much bigger than that. And look, I couldn't be more excited. We got with the right partner. We now have an ownership structure and a seat at the table and we look forward to the future together. Yeah. To answer that question it's about weight reduction, given what the composite manufacturers have been saying for the last several years. Why does it actually need an armor on it, because I think they're pretty confident you don't need the armor in any shape or form. You can just go to fully composite? Sure. It depends upon the application, right. So, if you're going to just do a downline, I would agree. If you're going to do a riser, stiff riser, I would agree. But if you're really trying to look at doing things that are going to require – like we're using them for subsea systems and flow lines, they're going to require the armor. The armor provides a different stress profile across the system. It actually allows you to have a larger bending moment. And by the way, it adds weight. One of the challenges with a composite is they float. So, in some applications, you actually want to add weight to the system. So we think, together with Magma Global, we believe strongly that when you put these two technologies together, we're going to have something truly unique and differentiated. Your next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess kind of coming back to Subsea margins. When you were talking with Jud, you talked about Subsea margins being unchanged over the next few quarters. But if you look out past the next few quarters kind of could you talk to the puts and takes as you see Subsea margins kind of going out over the medium-term? Sure. Thanks, Chase. It's a bit early for us to be forecasting margin sort of beyond 2018. But let me try to address your question in terms of the things I think the way you asked it in terms of the puts and takes. Obviously volume will be an important piece for us. So the timing in which we receive all of the inbound that Doug talked about, you've seen the list of Subsea opportunities, quite robust, those that are iEPCI as well, so timing of the projects. And I'll say to the extent that it isn't an iEPCI project, whether it's equipment or whether it is SURF and how quickly we can turn that into revenue as one variable. So timing would be important.
The second one there obviously is our fleet utilization. And so, that obviously has a cost component element to it. So the sooner we can get our fleet back to work obviously with respect to installations in iEPCI that will be another positive variable. We've talked a lot about over our last couple of calls some other cost elements, that being our ability to reduce our overall manufacturing cost or the footprint without fundamentally reducing the throughput, that comes through product optimization, the lean, all of the work that Subsea 2.0 does, we can get it through our facility faster. And the benefit that obviously is, we can bring a project to first oil that much quicker. So, that will clearly have a leverage benefit as those volumes come through as well.
We've been talking about our strategic resources, those being people and I think what we've tried to communicate is, we've got a belief in the recovery of Subsea and I think as we've demonstrated in 2017 and hopeful we'll be able to continue to demonstrate to you in 2018. We've held on to some of those strategic resources and so as we fully utilize those resources, that could also be a lever.
The other piece here is, this is still a relatively competitive market as you know. We've talked quite a bit about some project wins and project losses and why we may have walked away from some of those. So, the inbound margins on these projects that are not iEPCI as Doug commented on, we clearly have a competitive advantage with iEPCI, but the competitive market could have a lever that would work downward to us.
So, they are all the things that we're watching very carefully. We're working very diligently. We're looking at cost very carefully, synergies have helped. As you know, we've got more synergies across the broader organization, but some of those obviously impact Subsea this year and they would all could be positive contributors going forward, just a little too early for us to give any more clarity, just given the moving pieces. Understand, Maryann. Thank you for that. One quick follow-up. Could you kind of talk about pricing in SURF and in SPS on the tree side and maybe talk about if you're seeing kind of a narrowing of the range between the winners and losers, are there still big outliers there and so just talk about the environment there on the pricing side? Thank you for asking. The brief answer is unfortunately there are still outliers. There is certain behaviors that are just unpredictable and a little unrecognizable, but there are certainly outliers. I assure you we will not be an outlier. And the reason why is 50% of our activity is not exposed to competitive tendering. That's because the direct awards from our alliance partners, the direct awards from our iEPCI projects as we discussed earlier, as well as the strength of our Subsea services business. That if you will, reduces our exposure to the competitive market by 50%. But in the remaining market, you do see a tightening and you see a band, but then you do on occasion see the outliers. I expect that to further tighten and the market is now tightening if you will, in terms of the pricing range, but there are certain behaviors that are still allowing some to be outliers. And your last question today will come from the line of Jean-Luc Romain of CM-CIC Market Solutions. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. When looking at Energean comments about their awards of projects, it appears that they would pay part of a project once it's producing. Could you tell us more about how much we need to kind of – your plans to finance the (1:02:45) project? Thank you for the question, Jean-Luc. Look, our position has not changed. We will not use our balance sheet to fund projects. What you see here is a very unique scope. As I pointed out, it's a full Subsea iEPCI plus the floating production storage and offloading facility. So with the structured terms that we use would be no different than you would see in a project of that scope and that composition. So again, I repeat we are not leveraging the balance sheet, what we are providing is a unique solution. We've been working closely with this customer from the very beginning, from the concept stage and worked in a direct intimate way and we are very proud to be part of this project and Energean's success as they continue to expand their portfolio. Thank you. And there are no further questions this time. I would now like turn the call back to the presenters. This concludes our first quarter conference call. A replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8 PM British Summer Time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining us. Operator, you may now end the call. Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today's call. And you may now disconnect.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session after the speakers' prepared remarks . at this time I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Matt Seinsheimer .",0.0

We undertake no obligations to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you all for participating in our second quarter earnings call. Q2 represents another strong quarter for our company. Total company revenues were $3 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $377 million. All three business units delivered solid results, including a strong sequential EBITDA margin improvement in Surface Technologies, which serves as a good example of our execution focus. Total company inbound orders improved to $4.2 billion, Onshore/Offshore inbound of $2.3 billion was particularly notable, driven by new project awards, as well as additional work on existing projects.
Taking a closer look at inbound orders, the second quarter represents our third consecutive quarter of order growth and our highest order intake to-date as TechnipFMC. Total company book-to-bill was above 1 for a second consecutive quarter, driving sequential growth in backlog to $14.9 billion. The improvement in Onshore/Offshore has been significant. Backlog now stands at $8.3 billion, an increase of 30% since year-end.
Operating results in Surface Technologies recovered as anticipated from the weaker first quarter performance, delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.1% in the period. The segment resolved the transitory issues faced in the prior quarter and continued to benefit from strength in the Americas which accounted for over half of segment revenues in the quarter.
Activity in the U.S. land market continued its steady upward trajectory during the quarter, with well completion activity notably robust and outpacing the increase in drilling activity. Also in the quarter, Shell announced the early start of production from the Kaikias development in the Gulf of Mexico, the industry's first full-cycle iEPCI project. Production was achieved one year ahead of schedule with a project breakeven below $30 per barrel.
Working with our long-term partner Shell, our goal was simple; to improve project economics and accelerate time to first oil. Our collaborative approach included early engagement to simplify the fuel architecture, the use of flexible jumpers for greater well dispersion, an equipment redesign using Subsea 2.0 technology to enable fast-track installation.
Kaikias serves as a great example of what can be done when utilizing a fully integrated approach for Subsea developments.
As we turn to the broader market opportunity set for Subsea, we are encouraged by project award momentum and the current level of client engagement and project tendering. We have updated our Subsea opportunities slide to reflect our latest view of the next 24 months. In this updated slide, five projects were awarded and have been removed. Six projects have been added. The new opportunities dispersed across South America, West Africa, and Asia Pacific.
In aggregate, the economic value of the market opportunity more than replenished with this update. But this is not the entire market opportunity set. There's a significant opportunity for smaller awards below $250 million, including brownfield and Subsea tie-back projects. And there are additional projects beyond this list that represent fully integrated opportunities that are unique to TechnipFMC, a subject that I will address more directly in comments to follow.
Year-to-date, over 25% of our Subsea order intake has come from iEPCI, in line with our guidance for the full-year. And we continue to expect that over half of our order inbound will be direct awards associated with Subsea Services, alliance partners and iEPCI projects.
In the face of successes like Kaikias, clients are acknowledging the benefits from our early engagement, technology enabled iEPCI model. Many in our industry are now talking about integration, but as slide 7 indicates, the benefits to the operator are highly dependent on the degree of project integration. Full integration requires early engagement at the FEED stage in order to optimize field design and remove interfaces and schedule waste. And it requires having all capabilities under one roof, to manage the tradeoffs inherent in optimizing solutions.
We know this because we experienced this friction as alliance and JV partners prior to our merger. The lack of a single fully integrated entity, plus the absence of early engagement, provides limited opportunity to achieve structural cost savings. In this bundled approach, the suppliers have no commercial incentive to eliminate scope, reduce vessel days or invest in the installation techniques that are required to drive sustainable improvement in project economics. But regardless of the level of integration for any one project, the trend is clear. The market is rapidly moving towards greater Subsea project integration, both in terms of the volume of projects and the average project size. And as operators move further up the integration curve, there is much greater potential.
We have already demonstrated this success with our first full-cycle iEPCI delivery on the Kaikias project. We have also taken integration to the next level with Energean's Karish/Tanin project by integrating Subsea with a host facility, allowing us to capture more project scope than ever before, and we remain on track to deliver many more successful references from our growing iEPCI project portfolio.
Our philosophy is simple, to create real and sustainable improvements in project economics for our clients to enable more investment decisions through the cycle. Driving returns is our ultimate goal. So, we will prioritize our assets and resources towards those opportunities that generate the most value for our clients and for TechnipFMC.
Turning to Onshore/Offshore, we continue to see good growth opportunities in both Process Technologies and LNG. Global demand for petrochemical products continues to grow and we are experiencing significant early activity for technology definition and selection across most major markets. Combined with favorable feedstock to product differentials, this is driving new opportunities, including the potential for a second wave of world-scale ethylene crackers.
Our Process Technologies portfolio has grown to over 50 technologies, with strong market positions in ethylene, hydrogen and others. We have several commercial models that allow us to license our technologies and provide proprietary equipment around them. Importantly, these technologies drive differentiated EPC opportunities for our company.
We have had solid backlog additions for our Process Technologies business year-to-date, accounting for approximately 10% of our Onshore/Offshore inbound. These include two gas cracking furnaces to support the third phase expansion at NOVA Chemicals' Corunna project in Canada where we provided the process technology and are also in the consortium for the EPC contract.
In the Hydrogen Generation Unit for HPCL in India announced just last week, where our hydrogen technology was a key factor in us winning the project. We are seeing particularly strong opportunities in ethylene, a value chain in which TechnipFMC has a leading market position. The recent announcement by Motiva to select our ethylene technology for its world-scale petrochemical complex in the United States is indicative of this trend. We continue to invest in our broader technology portfolio through alliances, acquisitions, and R&D.
Another key component of our strategy for Onshore/Offshore is the expansion of high-value services, including Project Management Consultancy or PMC. Indicative of this strategy, we can point to our most recent PMC opportunity in the United States where TechnipFMC is well-positioned to secure a substantial PMC reimbursable contract in the downstream sector.
And we are seeing growing activity in LNG. LNG is a core competency of TechnipFMC, and we are a leading EPC player and technology provider in this segment. We believe that the next wave of LNG projects is moving forward as evidenced by current FEED and tender activity. We are seeing prospects emerging in all regions, the Middle East, Russia, Africa, Asia Pacific, and North America, including many brownfield expansion projects where we benefit from an incumbent position.
Early engagement can be key to success on any project. Just last month, Sempra LNG & Midstream announced the selection of TechnipFMC as EPC contractor for the Energía Costa Azul LNG project under development in Baja California, Mexico. We will perform FEED and other preparatory activities as Sempra advances towards Project FID. In addition, the important FEED work for the Novatek Arctic LNG project continues to progress well, and we are beginning FEED work on the Nigeria LNG Train 7 expansion project.
Putting this all together, TechnipFMC provides considerable leverage to the three major energy investment themes: Subsea, LNG, and unconventional resources. In Subsea, we are the market leader and we are demonstrating real success as the industry's only provider of fully integrated solutions and services. In LNG, we are a clear market leader, having delivered over 20% of global operating capacity, and we are currently executing several of the industry's key projects and front-end engineering studies. And in unconventional resources, we have leading market positions in product and services that are instrumental in supporting ongoing efficiency gains for complex well completions. Through our unique business model, our differentiated technologies, and our execution capability, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry's best prospects for growth.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss the financial results in more detail. Thanks, Doug. We delivered solid operational performance in the quarter. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $377 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin is 12.7% despite the forecasted revenue decline and on track to reach 2018 objective, as we have outlined.
Looking at margins by segments, although lower, Subsea was quite resilient despite a significant revenue decline in a particularly strong margin comparison. Onshore/ Offshore continued to sustain robust margin performance on persistently strong project execution. And in Surface Technologies, we delivered a significant increase when comparing to the prior-year quarter, driven by higher activity levels in North America and further improvement in international markets. The sequential performance was also much improved after overcoming transitory issues experienced in the first quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.28, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.05 per diluted share. After-tax charges and credits in the period totaled $25 million. We have provided schedules that accompany our release which detail these items.
As a reminder, our guidance excludes the impact of certain items. These items of significance impacted the quarter included the following pre-tax charges: $24 million or $0.04 per diluted share of foreign exchange losses included in corporate expense, and $49 million or $0.11 per diluted share related to the increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners included in interest expense. When excluding the impact of these discrete items, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%.
Turning to slide 11, I will provide a few more details around segment highlights. Subsea revenue declined 30% from the prior-year quarter, driven by lower project activity in Asia Pacific, Africa, and North America. However, revenues in the quarter benefited from flexibles activity for Petrobras, continued work on Total Kaombo and Woodside Greater Enfield, plus a growing contribution from integrated projects such as Equinor Trestakk, Energean Karish/Tanin, and VNG Norge Fenja.
Subsea reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7%, down 607 basis points against the prior-year quarter on lower revenues, offset in part by merger savings and other cost reduction initiatives achieved. Adjusted EBITDA also benefited from the successful conclusion of key project milestones, although somewhat less significant than the prior-year quarter. We also announced in the period the delivery of the Skandi Recife flexible lay and construction vessel, owned in conjunction with our joint venture partner we have begun work under an eight-year charter contract with Petrobras for work in the Campos, Santos and Espírito Santo basins.
Inbound orders were $1.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2. As our full-year guidance has suggested, Onshore/Offshore revenue declined 26% versus the prior-year quarter as we moved closer to completion on major projects, primarily Yamal LNG. Project activity outside of Yamal continues to grow, driven by higher activity levels related to several large projects, including Jebel Ali refinery, SOCAR Petrochemical and PETRONAS RAPID project.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 16% from the prior year quarter, outperforming 26% reduction in revenue. We experienced growth in adjusted EBITDA beyond Yamal although the project is still a significant contributor.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 12.7% were up 238 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, with improvement across all regions. We saw continued strength in Onshore/Offshore inbound during the quarter, where orders more than doubled versus the prior-year quarter to $2.3 billion. Segment backlog has grown sequentially in each of the last quarters, ending the second quarter at $8.3 billion.
Moving to Surface Technologies, revenue increased 34% versus the prior-year quarter, driven by the significant increase in North America activity, with strong demand for hydraulic fracturing services, wellhead systems and pressure control equipment and services. International revenue also increased versus the prior-year quarter, benefiting from higher volumes of aftermarket work.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.1% increased 613 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, with margins improving in both the Americas and international businesses. We benefited from good volume leverage on an improved cost structure in North America, partially offset by continued pricing pressure in some international markets.
Sequentially, Surface Technologies had a strong recovery from the transitory issues we faced in the first quarter, providing support to our full-year outlook. In addition to the growth in North America, we experienced higher aftermarket activity in international. Backlog for Surface Technologies ended the quarter at $415 million.
Turning to cash flow, several items impacted our results in the period. Cash flow from operations was a negative $289 million. The decline was primarily a function of working capital outflow of $477 million, driven by timing of project-related activity. Clearly in the quarter, we saw our working capital uses greater than we had estimated. This is largely due to the timing of awards for certain projects tied to the $5 billion of Onshore/Offshore projects we have been tracking, which have not been received on the anticipated schedules. The award of these specific projects will have positive impact on working capital when inbound. Additionally, we had outflows for certain items that will not be repeated in the back half of the year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $82 million in the quarter. There were also several discretionary items impacting the quarter.
We distributed a total of $250 million to shareholders, including $134 million for share repurchase, our largest quarterly spend to-date, and $120 million for the payment of quarterly dividends reflecting the timing of cash payments for both fourth quarter and first quarter distributions. We also incurred $41 million related to acquisitions. In total, these discretionary spending items were $295 million in the period. Importantly, these items are supported by a very strong balance sheet. Our net cash balance stood at $1.7 billion at quarter-end.
Turning to slide 13, the company backlog ended the quarter at $14.9 billion. As the backlog schedule illustrates, we have very good revenue coverage for the remainder of 2018. For Subsea, we have more than 90% coverage for the midpoint of our full-year guidance when including first half results and the anticipated revenues from Subsea Services. Most of our services revenue is recorded when activity is completed.
For Onshore/Offshore, we have sufficient revenue backlog to meet our revised guidance for 2018, which has been increased to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion. When comparing to the revenue scheduling provided in the first quarter, we see a 36% increase in the revenue scheduled for 2019 and an even more significant change to the 2020 and beyond. Medium-term revenue visibility continues to improve on the strength of orders for the first half of the year.
Subsea backlog for execution in 2019 and beyond has increased more than 50% since year-end. Clearly, we are demonstrating good success in rebuilding the backlog, ultimately transitioning the company back to a period of growth. And we have significant project activity not included in the recorded backlog because of project structures. That will create future income beyond the visible revenue streams.
We are working on a few large projects where we only hold the minority ownership position. As illustrated in the backlog visibility slide, the pro forma backlog associated with these projects now exceeds $3.4 billion and serves as the basis for growth in our equity and affiliates income over the coming years. Importantly, this income stream is incremental to the opportunity that we have shown in our backlog disclosures.
Turning to guidance, we are updating our expectations for Onshore/Offshore to reflect both the incremental work awarded for 2018, as well as the continued strength in project execution. During our first quarter update, we indicated that revenue for Onshore/Offshore was trending towards the high-end of our previous range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. We are now increasing that expectation to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion for 2018. Additionally, we are increasing our margin guidance to at least 12% versus our previous guidance of at least 11.5%.
For Subsea, the strength of our first half results give us further confidence that we will deliver on our full-year commitment with no change to our expectations for the remainder of 2018. In Surface Technologies, the sharp sequential recovery in the second quarter results also supports our previous outlook for the remainder of the year. When we look to the second half, we recognize that the pace of improvement in North America has the potential to slow due to reductions in takeaway capacity in the Permian along with uncertainties related to tariffs and price inflations.
In summary, our second quarter earnings supported our updated outlook. Total company inbound orders of $4.2 billion were our strongest yet at TechnipFMC, with orders exceeding revenue in all segments. Backlog continues to provide solid coverage for 2018 with improving visibility for 2019 and beyond particularly in Onshore/Offshore. While working capital continued to be impacted by project maturity, new project awards should be generating improvement going forward. Importantly, our execution remains very strong as evidenced by our good operating performance in the quarter. Momentum in FEED activity and project tendering continues to trend positively, supporting an improving outlook across our end-markets.
Project selection remains a top priority as targeting the right projects and driving early engagement are critical factors that influence our project success. We remain focused on delivering best-in-class services, solutions and project execution. We have leverage to market where we see the greatest growth opportunities, namely deepwater, LNG, and unconventional, and we will prioritize our assets and resources towards opportunities that generate the maximum value for our clients and for TechnipFMC.
Operator, you may open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Thank you. Hey, good afternoon. Afternoon, Sean. So, Doug, maybe starting with Subsea, I was hoping you could give us a sense of your visibility on second half 2018 margin progression, given, in the first half you're 110 basis points above the full-year guide. Maybe just, what's kind of held you back in terms of lifting that margin guide for the full-year? Sure, Sean. So, as you know, there's a lot of puts and takes, and we have to consider what's in our backlog, some of the new projects as well as the projects that we're completing. In the second quarter, we reached several key milestones on some very important projects, as we indicated in the press release. And when we look forward to the second half of the year, we remain even more confident in our full-year guidance of achieving 14%. Okay. And so, another point, I think, that's on investors' minds, with respect to working capital. On the last call, I think the message was that you were expecting working capital to be neutral in terms of the cash impact 2Q through 4Q of this year, for the full-year being modestly, let's say, below the cash draw from last year, a little over $500 million. Do you have – Maryann, would you mind giving us an update of how you see that progression in the back half and any other moving pieces that you'd like to highlight there? Yeah. Sure, Sean. Thank you. So, clearly in the quarter, our estimates were exceeded in terms of uses. There's a couple of key reasons for that. First, as you can imagine, we're managing many, many, many projects and being able to get it completely right quarter-to-quarter is often a challenge. Overall, what we said or what I was – yeah, what I said last quarter was that, I thought the first half of the year, both Q1 and Q2 would be useful and we would see recovery in the back half of the year. We talked about that number in a range of $500-plus-million, and you can see we exceeded that in the first quarter.
We were expecting to see some awards, pretty significant awards, as I mentioned, tied to that $5 billion of projects Onshore/Offshore that would have had significant contribution had they been awarded. To the extent that those contracts get awarded in the back half of the year, we will see some recovery of working capital.
In addition, we had some items in the period in the first half that are non – I would say, that won't repeat in the back half of the year, and some timing around some other projects. So, the way that I would characterize it is clearly we see a path in the back half where operating cash flow would be positive in the back half of the year. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for the feedback. You're welcome, Sean. Your next question comes from James Evans with Exane. I'm sorry. Your next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Morning. I'll stick with Subsea margins here for a second, and more directly, Doug, similar question I asked you on the Q1 call. Visibility with regard to Subsea Services, we'd think that that would start inflecting pretty soon here given the sustained strength in Brent. Do you see that as a second half event, or do you see that more as a 2019 event? Thanks, Bill. And indeed, as indicated last quarter, we continue to see a good progression in our Subsea Services business, particularly when it comes to some increased operating expenditures requiring customers to (00:30:21) into their Subsea wells to run diagnostics or to do mechanical or remedial services inside of the wells. As you know, we're the leader in providing access to Subsea wells through our Riserless Light Well Intervention technology and our footprint.
On top of that, we get the opportunity to, in many cases, do refurbishments of the equipment. While that wellbore activity is being done, the trees are often returned to our custody to be able to do maintenance inspection and repair on that equipment, as well as our integrated life-of-field services where we're doing predictive maintenance through the extensive digital platform that we have on the sea floor.
So, for all those reasons, we continue and have and will continue to see a recovery, and we are seeing some of that occur in the second half of the year. It's important to note, tied to Sean's earlier question as well, we are in a situation where we're seeing a significant improvement in our Subsea inbound. Our orders are tracking extremely well. We will and we've committed over a year ago and are remain committed to ensuring that we retain the capability and the competency to be able to ensure that we can deliver world-class service on that increasing inbound.
So, if you will, there's a bit of a transitory period between the inbound and the conversion of that into revenue, but we will carry the resources necessary to ensure that we can provide world-class service for our clients. Okay. And, Maryann, obviously on and off margins have been super strong for reasons that we know, thanks mostly to Yamal. As we're getting the surge in impressive order intake, do you have any thoughts with regard to the normalization path for on/off margins over the next several quarters, not only second half, but just as a glimpse into 2019? Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, for the back half of the year, obviously for 2018, as you can see, we've taken the margins up another 50 basis points to 12% on a full-year basis. So, we continue to see good, solid, strong performance in the back half of the year. That's just not one single project. We've got good project execution throughout. As we get to 2019, as you can see, our backlog is improving by other projects that are non-Yamal.
Having said that, we still have more work to complete on Yamal in 2019. That project is likely not to complete until the end of 2020 and plus as we complete other key milestones. So, our margin performance in 2019 will still have the benefit of very strong execution. And despite the fact that we've got some other projects, still good execution coming from Yamal. So, a little early for us to be giving margin guidance, but we certainly have good opportunity set to keep margins in Onshore/Offshore in a solid place for 2019. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from David Farrell. Hi. Two questions from me. It's a bit unfair, but could you just kind of maybe explain why if Kaikias was so good for Shell, the same client in the same region decided to split Vito up?
And then, a second question around Process Technologies, I'm just wondering what opportunities you're seeing from IMO 2020 in relation to refinery upgrades? Sure. So, no such thing as an unfair question. We're very proud of, obviously, the results on Kaikias, and I'm sure you have read how pleased Shell is as well. I remind you, we did receive, following Kaikias, a follow-up order, and that was on the Gumusut integrated EPCI award that we announced last quarter. As you know, Vito was being tendered at the same time that Kaikias was being completed. And that experience had not fully been felt by the client. We remain confident that there will be additional iEPCI opportunities for Shell in the future, both in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond.
In regards to the Process Technologies, we certainly are seeing a benefit and we have announced and hopefully will be announcing additional refinery upgrade projects, which we can benefit from the technologies that we have in our portfolio, as well as some of the changes in regulations associated with refining. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Thanks. Good morning. (00:35:37) you guys. Doug, question for you on just trying to get a little more color perhaps on your thoughts on Subsea orders over the back half of the year, and I'm curious to get your thoughts on, there's a lot of different projects out there that seem to be moving ahead. You guys put five new ones on the board on your sheet, or six rather this quarter. How do we think about perhaps the mix of size of project and was it integrated or not, mid-size, large? How do you think about the direction in just overall kind of mix of orders in the back half of 2018, and the timing, I guess? Jud, thank you for the question. Honestly, a little bit of all of the above. There's a lot of activity going on right now. We've talked about our integrated portfolio, some of which are visible to the market, many of which are not visible to the market. They're maturing through the integrated FEED stage, which means they're approaching the opportunity to move into the integrated EPCI space and there'll be more to report on that in the coming quarters.
In regards to the size of projects, as you saw, once again, I think our Subsea inbound orders exceeded expectations. A lot of that was the unannounced awards, which included a significant amount of direct awards from our alliance partners, as well as smaller awards, and those will continue. We're doing a lot of work, helping our clients optimize particular field architecture that allows them to bring back or tie-backs into existing hosts.
And you may have heard in my prepared remarks one of the things that I talked about when I talked about the Kaikias, was I talked about the ability to be able to use flexible pipe in order to change, if you will, the geographical dispersion of the wells versus the manifold. That's quite unique to our company because of our in-house capabilities and our ability to be able to design in that way, and that will unlock additional opportunities for us.
Large greenfield developments are absolutely in the latter stages of tendering. As you know, I'm always cautious to predict a quarter or even a half when some of those projects will go forward, but there is no question that they are mature. Many of them, the commercial tenders have been put in place. Technically, they've been qualified, and it's a question of the FID and the selection.
Geographically, you're seeing more and more activity return to Brazil. You're seeing activity and quite a bit of activity in Africa. And as we had a very strong fourth quarter in the North Sea, we expect additional activity in the North Sea as well.
We've talked in the past about some of the emerging countries for our industry, being Guyana with the ExxonMobil Liza project, and being Mozambique with the Eni and the Anadarko opportunities. We're active in both, as you know, and we look forward to additional phases and additional awards as those two countries move forward as well.
So, we're very active on the – if you will, on the front-end engineering side. We're very active on the tendering side. And most importantly, we're very active on the iEPCI side. Okay, great. I appreciate the color there. And my follow-up, Maryann, if I could, I wanted to just follow-up on your answer to Sean's question earlier. I believe you indicated you believe that operating cash flow will be positive in the second half of the year. I wanted to just clarify that you were referring to cash flow, and not working capital, number one. And number two, would you expect operating cash flow to be positive for the entire year and not just in the second half of the year? Yeah. So, sure, Jud. My comment was made specific to operating cash flow. Yes, I did not give out specifics around working capital. We expect it to be in the back half. Obviously, some certain elements that I just talked about would need to come to fruition if the timing of those projects slip out, that would present a challenge to us. But certainly, in the back half of the year, we would expect operating cash flow to be positive and, therefore, could be for the full-year. Yes. Okay. Just wanted to clarify. Thanks, Maryann. You're welcome. Your next question comes from James Evans of Exane. Hi. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah. It's James Evans, Exane BNP Paribas. I wanted to ask a little bit about Brazil, if I could. I mean, it's really promising to see a few more projects popping up in the region. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about how you're bidding some of those pure Petrobras opportunities in terms of the first solution.
Secondly, whether or when we might see Petrobras return to some of the equipment ordering, be it around trees or manifolds, et cetera. And then just kind of combining those, is there any signs of Petrobras more seriously evaluating the integrated model? I guess, it must be a bit strategic long-term target for you. Thank you very much, James, for the question. And, again, yes to all of the above. So, we as well are very excited about the activity in Brazil, not just Petrobras. As you know, there's been a lot of activities by others in terms of investment and in terms of leasing, and we're doing a lot of work with many of the operators in Brazil looking at the best options for them to develop their assets.
When you look at Petrobras, we are still executing on several of the large equipment awards that came previously. Those are very important to us and we remain a key supplier, if not, the preferred supplier to Petrobras for that Subsea equipment and we were just acknowledged – actually, we were just acknowledged as the best supplier for Petrobras in that category. So, we're very, very proud of that. Those awards are important and we'll continue to satisfy those awards.
Maybe the slight nuance that we have to take into consideration is, as Petrobras moves forward with some of the newer developments where there is a different equity ownership structure and a different partner in structure that that may – they may or may not use equipment that is, if you will, from their prior orders and that may result in new equipment orders because of the change in the ownership structure of the assets. So, there lies an opportunity that we're tracking very closely.
In terms of the overall cadence, again, it's picking up and we're doing a lot of front-end engineering work and we're doing a lot of site visits, if you will, with many of the international operators as well who are now very eager and very excited to ramp-up their activity in Brazil. We are very well-positioned in Brazil. We have, by far, the highest local content. We are almost fully vertically integrated in the country. We supply Brazil from Brazil with a very strong Brazilian team that we're extremely proud of, and that's built a track record for our company and we have done most of the Subsea developments that have been done in Brazil with Petrobras and certainly for those that have been done with other international operators in the country. Thanks. Could I just ask, is there any signs of them evaluating the integrated model, Petrobras in particular? Thank you very much for the follow-up, and I obviously should not have left that off of the first answers, so thank you very much.
We feel quite confident that Petrobras will engage in an iEPCI type model. It may not be on some of the initial phases of some of the new developments, but we strongly believe that we will see an integrated tender in the future and that it could very well prove to be a very value-added, a very significant way to create value and improve project economics, which could then become more standardized. So, yes, we have been and are working with Petrobras on the application of an iEPCI model. I really don't want to say where or when because that's obviously a significant competitive advantage that we have. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Hello. Hey, Kurt. Hey. Hey, Doug, I was wondering if you could kind of provide us some color on the dynamics on the Subsea business in the context of – you talk about iEPCI, you talk about competitive advantages that FTI brings – technically FTI bring to the table. I would start to think that you'd see improvement in pricing and margins for those direct awards, for example, and for those iEPCI projects. But could you shed some light on your ability to maybe maximize pricing or maximize margins in what could still be maybe a competitive environment for Subsea and how that's all playing out? Sure, Kurt. Thank you. So, as indicated, over 25% of our activity that we – our new activity that we've inbounded this year has been iEPCI. That's important. Most of that is through direct award where we started the integrated FEED phase, we agree on an economical hurdle rate, and we optimize the project economics. And that's really what the customer cares about. It's not about lowest price or lowest unit cost. It's about the best project economics.
And if you can sit with the client early in the phase of the development of the asset and show where you can create real, structural and sustainable improvement in project economics, not a discount, not a promise of increased rate of return based upon the 25-year incremental recovery rate, but real upfront savings both in capital and then on the operating cost for the life of the asset, and most importantly, that you can accelerate the time to first production. That really drives the project economics in a favorable way. That's a mature conversation. That's a conversation where you're really truly looking for a win-win, and everybody is focused on the project and on improving the project economics, not just on their own individual financial statement. As a result, everybody wins. The project is successful. Success creates additional success, as I indicated on an earlier question that was asked. We have several repeat customers now in this category, and that will continue to grow.
It is important to point out, Kurt, that, as I said in my prepared remarks, not all integrated projects are the same, and there is quite a bit of bundling going on out there. We really try to focus where we can create the greatest value and sustainable saving. And the only way that we found to get there was by creating TechnipFMC, which allows us to put the proper investment into the company to really create a full Subsea system inclusive of the equipment, the installation, and everything in between to be able to drive real and sustainable improvement in project technologies. Okay. That's helpful, Doug. Appreciate that. And maybe on the follow-up comment in the similar vein on Onshore/Offshore. You talk about a pretty significant increase in opportunities for petrochemicals and I think world knows what's going on with the LNG part of the business and the substantial increase in demand for additional capacity there. Given the limited number of players that can do what FTI does, would it stand to reason that the prospective margins you can get on future bookings can potentially keep the Onshore/Offshore margins at a higher level than maybe what initially what's expected? Well, Kurt, what we have referenced in the past was that, on a run rate of about $5 billion to $6 billion, you would – we would expect to deliver on the higher end of kind of the industry average of margins of 4% to 6%. We did indicate at that time that that did not include LNG awards.
So, we do expect that the LNG players are fewer, these are significant projects, and there's less experienced competition in that area. We are the leader in LNG, having delivered over 20% of the installed capacity and currently working on a significant amount of additional capacity from Yamal, Prelude, as well as the Coral FLNG for Eni in Mozambique. So, we have a lot of current activity, but we're very excited about the next wave of projects, as you indicate.
And, yes, we would be very selective in those projects where we can create the greatest value for the project, for our customer, for ourselves, and for our shareholders. We'll remain very selective and we'll allocate our resources on what we think are those best projects for us. In many cases, that will mean we will be in direct negotiation, not only less competition, but in direct negotiation. That's a benefit you have when you're the incumbent, that's a benefit you have when you are very successful in one project and can potentially rule that skill, competency, knowledge onto the next project. So, we're very excited about LNG.
As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we're also very excited about Process Technologies. We have a very unique portfolio, representing over 50 different technologies, some in which we have a leadership position particularly around ethylene. And you heard me talk a bit about a next wave of ethylene projects. This would be very good for our company as well. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from Rob Pulleyn with Morgan Stanley. Hi. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll limit it to just one question. And I suppose no conference call would be complete without bringing up the why word. I just have one question to Maryann, and that is, at the time of the Analyst Day, you indicated very helpfully that around $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet was owed to the joint ventures as part of the joint venture partner, as part of their profit recognition from the contract, and also their upcoming working capital needs. I just wondered if you could give us an update on where that corresponding $1 billion stands today. Is it the same? Is it lower? Is it higher? That's it. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Rob. Yes, you're absolutely right. Back in November, we took a snapshot of the project at that point in time and said, yes, it was right in the range of about $1 billion.
As you know, the project has continued to do well over the last two quarters. You've seen that we've incremented the interest expense associated with it. And we've also made some payments. In the fourth quarter, we paid out about $80 million, as you've probably seen in the cash flow statement, and again, this quarter another $124 million.
So, as we sit here today, based on the way that we see the project being executed for the life of the project, we're now below $1 billion, probably somewhere between $700 million and $800 million yet to go. So, below the $1 billion now. That's extremely helpful. I will leave it at that because I'm sure other people have questions. Thank you. You're most welcome. Your next question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Hey, guys. Doug, on the 25% of new activity being iEPCI, can you tell me how many customers, different customers, does that 25% represent? Jim, to the best of my recollection, I think we're – we have seven that we've announced, seven different customers that we've announced. And I'm asking that just to know the breadth of adoption, if you would, of the fully integrated model, so that was really the question. And... Yeah. And, Jim – well, Jim, if you don't mind, I'll add color to that, then. Please. We had – in a previous engagement, we had kind of dissected that a little bit. And what you'll see is it's pretty well geographically dispersed. One region that we had not yet secured an iEPCI contract was in Asia Pacific. We secured that last quarter. I had a great question earlier about Brazil, and I hopefully answered it where people left with a positive message that we would expect to see iEPCI penetrate the Brazil market, which would really give us, if you will, at that point global coverage of iEPCI.
We also broke it down between partners and non-partners. There was actually slightly more non-partner than partner activity. We broke it down between tie-backs and greenfield opportunities. So, you'll see it's pretty well-dispersed. And when I look – more importantly, when I look under the hood and I look at what we have in the pipeline in our integrated FEED studies, again, many of which are not available to the rest of the market because they're being done in a proprietary nature with the client. I would say that dispersion is about to grow even greater. Okay. That's – and best of luck on that. My follow-up, if I could, relative to at least one of your peers, you're less on the geoscience end where they're less on maybe the construction end or something, and you're talking about such a full breadth of integration of capabilities. And most of the investors I talk to, their reaction to you guys these days is, gosh, I wish they'd sell Onshore/Offshore. Does your portfolio of what you own today, is that the full portfolio of things you need over the next five years to be the most effective? Or do you need more geoscience front-end? Do you need to trim what you currently have? Can you talk about strategically where you expect to be over the next three to five years in that breadth of capability? Sure, Jim. And I do want to point out, we have the industry's leading front-end capability, period, full stop. So, no, we may not go all the way, if you will, to the front end, but we have what we need in order to do development projects and production projects. So, we have the Genesis Group as our agnostic pre-concept, concept, and front-end engineering. And then, we now have – as well, we now have the industry's leading integrated or, if you will, vendor base front-end engineering group as well. So, very, very proud of that team, and they're the ones generating a significant amount of opportunities for our company, and I can't acknowledge them enough.
When you look strategically at our, if you will, value stream where there is white space, we do not see, and the industry has not acknowledged that that white space is necessary, completing that white space, if you will, is necessary in terms of creating additional value to drive further developments of Subsea projects. So, we're pretty comfortable, and we believe the industry has spoken that the integration that's required is the integration between what was formerly known as SURF, and what was formerly known as SPS, which is now known as TechnipFMC. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from Bertrand Hodée with Kepler Cheuvreux. Yes. Hello. One question around Subsea Services, because this is going to be probably next year an important part of your revenues, and do you see any momentum there? Because if I remember well, you were guiding for, by 2020, something around $1.6 billion. And last year was $1 billion. So, what momentum do you see there in Subsea Services? Thank you very much. Bertrand, thank you very much for the question, an absolute critical part of our portfolio. As you know, we have over 50% of the Subsea installed base is TechnipFMC. It requires ongoing inspection, maintenance and repair. And as I said, as more and more Subsea wells go into Subsea wellbores, need intervened upon, that helps us even more. What we said is that, we said we'd have a 17% CAGR through 2020. I think if the math comes out to just a tad less than what you indicated, but still a significant growth opportunity for our company.
You'll see us grow there both within our existing service line portfolio, which is the most extensive in the industry. But you're also going see us grow through new additional service activities that we'll be bringing into the capabilities of TechnipFMC. So, for sure, it's an important focus. It's one that we all spend a lot of time on. It is a direct award activity as it's kind of an OEM model, and we continue to demonstrate to our clients that we can achieve the absolute best-in-class service and provide that to our clients.
The one area or the one big opportunity in that space is digital. We've done a lot of work there today. We offer today the industry's leading predictive maintenance, if you will, based upon Big Data. We do that for many of our customers today, but we're now looking at, because now that we have the full capability, if you will, the full Subsea ecosystem, we now can extend that to a much greater footprint creating even more value for our customers. So, there'll be a lot more that you'll be hearing about how we're going to leverage our digital capabilities in our Subsea Services to expand and grow that, to grow and achieve the rates that – or the goals that we had set out previously. The last question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Afternoon. Just one question on Surface Technologies, Doug, as you think about the growth prospects, I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks I think international might be half of that segment. And it seems as though the growth profile might skew – start to skew more toward International than North America over the next 12 to 18 months. So, just wondering if you could speak to the opportunity set that you see in that segment in terms of growth going forward. Byron, thank you very much. And it was the last of the three that I was hoping we get a chance to talk about, and as my last slide in my prepared remarks. We are the leader in Subsea, we are the leader in LNG, and we have a very strong position particularly around completion optimization in Surface Technologies. So, really do appreciate you asking the question.
You're right, Byron. We all know the North American market has been strong. We know that it has some challenged optics, if you will, going forward for a transitionary period. That being said, in the North America market, our business is asset-light, if you will, and very mobile. So, as – if and when the customer base shifts, we can shift very quickly. As a matter of fact, we're kind of getting ahead of it as we speak. So, that plays to our favor, if you will.
The international market is where we have historically had a leadership position, and we still have and intend to maintain and extend that leadership position in the international market. That, as we've talked about before, has been a bit lethargic. It did not come around as quickly as we anticipated. You've heard others, who have reported before us, about the fact that they're seeing, I'd say, even more than green shoots. They're seeing some real momentum in the international market, and that is absolutely positive for our company as we will benefit, if you will, proportionally. That's even more important to our Surface Technologies segment, and we'll benefit from that as that international market recovers. That will probably be more of a 2019 effect, but we're very excited and look forward to that as well. Great. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the color. I will now turn the call back over to Matthew Seinsheimer. This concludes our second quarter conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call.
Total company revenue in the quarter was $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $431 million benefited from further cost reduction as well as another quarter of strong operational execution, a theme I will discuss in more detail on today's call.
Looking at the business segments, Subsea revenue and EBITDA demonstrated solid performance, as we continued to execute well on our backlog. Onshore/Offshore delivered exceptionally strong operating results, as evidenced by an improved EBITDA margin in the period. Revenue and margin for Surface Technologies were essentially flat when compared to the second quarter results despite softer market activity in North America, a risk we discussed on the second quarter earnings call.
Total company inbound orders were $3.6 billion, with total company book-to-bill again above 1. Importantly, this has supported a return to year-over-year growth in total company backlog, up 9% when compared to the prior-year quarter, with backlog growth occurring in all business segments.
For Onshore/Offshore, we previously communicated an inbound target of $5 billion, with downstream opportunities including refining, fertilizer, and petrochemical project. We have made notable progress towards meeting this goal, including in the first quarter an award for the Bapco Sitra refinery expansion in Bahrain, contracts for two fertilizer plants in India for the HURL joint venture in the second quarter, and in this quarter, an award of Vietnam's largest olefins project for Long Son Chemicals. This demonstrates our leadership in these important downstream markets, and we anticipate a further award in the near term.
Turning to our operational performance, strong execution continues to be a reoccurring theme across the project portfolio. In Onshore/Offshore, success is most evident in the performance of our largest individual project, Yamal LNG. Despite the inherent complexity of the project's size, scope, and location, execution has remained very strong.
We successfully delivered LNG Train 1 in the fourth quarter of 2017, and during the third quarter of this year we completed Train 2. We delivered the second train some six months ahead of the original schedule. This was in part a key driver of the quarterly performance improvement in Onshore/Offshore. Both trains have been operating within their nameplate design parameters. Train 2 reached this milestone in rapid fashion, just 17 days after first drop.
As we approached the end of September, 68 cargos have been offloaded from the project, bringing cumulative LNG shipped from Yamal to over 5 million metric tons. Our work on Yamal continues. Construction and commissioning of Train 3 is progressing well and is on track for another early delivery.
Our strong project execution extends beyond Onshore/Offshore. In Subsea, we have successfully delivered three integrated EPCI projects: Shell Kaikias in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we discussed in detail last quarter; and now two additional iEPCI projects in the third quarter, Visund Nord and Trestakk for our partner Equinor on the Norwegian continental shelf.
In September, Equinor announced that Visund Nord had come on stream below budget and two months ahead of schedule. Project completion took just 21 months from concept selection to first production, a new fast-track record for Equinor. An important factor in the success of this project was the strong collaboration with our partner Equinor and the integrated capabilities of TechnipFMC.
For the Trestakk development, we successfully delivered a commissioned production system to the seabed in 22 months, requiring only a single season of marine operations. This project also benefited from new integrated connection technology that provided a lighter, more cost-effective solution. Achieving this optimized schedule was made possible through the completion of an integrated FEED, which was then directly converted into an integrated EPCI award.
The successful execution of Kaikias, Visund Nord, and Trestakk clearly demonstrates the power of the integrated model. Through strong collaboration with our partners, beginning with integrated FEED studies, we have clearly demonstrated that we can significantly improve project economics with lower costs, reduced interface risks, and accelerated time to first oil. And we remain confident that integrated developments, which we pioneered, will increasingly become the commercial model of choice for the subsea industry.
Let me now turn to the outlook for our key growth markets. The overarching trend for E&P CapEx has turned positive in 2018 following three years of declining investment. We expect the broader oil and gas market recovery to continue as we move into 2019.
In Subsea, we are clearly in a period of recovery that began nearly two years ago. In 2017 we saw our Subsea order inbound increase 27% year over year, and we continue to expect 2018 inbound to exceed that of 2017. Favorable book-to-bill trends also lend support to growth in backlog. Year-to-date trends and final investment decision or FIDs for large offshore projects have been positive. Although FIDs have been tracking fairly in line with oil prices, it's encouraging that the number of FIDs related to larger projects has returned to levels last seen when oil was above $100 a barrel, as illustrated in the slide. This recovery from 2015 trough is supported by the considerable improvement in both deepwater project economics and operators' cash flows.
Our confidence is further underpinned by an approximate 90% increase in FEED studies year-to-date, with over 50% of these new studies focused on integrated projects. More importantly many of these FEED studies now also incorporate our next-generation subsea technology, Subsea 2.0.
Our second growth pillar LNG remains one of the fastest growing markets in the oil and gas sector, stronger than expected near-term demand driven by consumption in China and new geographies, continues to rebalance an oversupplied market. Industry forecast now suggests the next wave of LNG projects will need to be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond. Our experience and leadership leave us well positioned to capitalize on this growth.
Our early involvement in several potential projects includes greenfield projects, such as Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 and Sempra's Costa Azul, as well as brownfield extensions, including the Nigeria LNG Train 7 expansion project. Lastly U.S. unconventionals are undergoing near-term turbulence, with pipeline takeaway capacity constraints negatively impacting activity levels after a period of rapid growth. However, these constraints have proved to be transitory. And outside North America, we anticipate increasing demand for our specialized products and services.
As we turn to the broader market opportunity set for Subsea, we are encouraged by the increasing level of client engagement and project tender. In the most recent update to our Subsea opportunity slide, the market opportunity continues to broaden with new projects dispersed across South America, West Africa and Asia Pacific. And while the slide only captures projects in excess of $250 million, the market for smaller brownfield and tie-back projects remains quite large. The increase in smaller project and service activity is also reflected in our business mix. Of the more than $9 billion of Subsea order intake received since January 2017, less than 40% has been formally announced as a project award. And we continue to expect that over half of our inbound orders in 2018 will be direct awards associated with Subsea Services, iEPCI, and alliance partners.
Although we recognized the commercial environment and lower asset utilization remain headwinds near-term, we remain focused on selecting projects where we can deliver a differentiated result, driven by our unique integrated offering and next-generation technology. Given the market outlook and our differentiated position, we remain confident that we are well positioned for success.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss the financial results in more detail. Thanks, Doug. Let me provide some further color on the financial performance in the quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.31. After tax charges and credits in the period totaled $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share. We have provided schedules that accompany our release, which detail these items.
Pre-tax items of significance impacting the quarter for which we do not provide guidance included the following: $34 million or $0.05 per diluted share of foreign exchange losses, included in corporate expense, largely reflecting currency effects on cash and receivable balances in Angola for which there is no ability to hedge, a $93 million or $0.20 per diluted share related to an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners included in interest expense.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.7%, up 74 basis points against the prior-year quarter, largely the result of strong execution in the Onshore/Offshore business. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2% when excluding the impact of discrete items.
I'll provide you a few more details around the segment highlights. As our forecast indicated, Subsea revenue declined 18% from the prior-year quarter. This is driven primarily by a lower project activity in Africa, Europe, and Asia Pacific, partially offset by increased activity in South America. In addition, foreign exchange translation acted as a headwind in the quarter and included a $48 million impact due to the Brazilian real.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.6%. EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the anticipated revenue decline and more competitively priced backlog, offset in part by merger synergies and other cost reduction initiatives achieved. The timing of completion of certain projects continued to benefit margins in the period, although, the impact was less pronounced than in prior-year quarter.
Inbound orders were $1.6 billion in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3 for our Subsea segment. As we had anticipated, Onshore/Offshore revenue declined 34% from the prior-year quarter as we moved closer to completion on major projects, primarily Yamal LNG. Project activity outside of Yamal was down modestly versus the prior year but grew sequentially, led by increased activity on the Karish FPSO and strong growth in process technology.
Adjusted EBITDA declined only 7% from the prior-year quarter despite the projected revenue decline. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8% improved over 400 basis points. Key drivers of the performance included a bonus to the successful completion of Train 2 for Yamal LNG, continued strong execution across many projects, most notably in the Europe, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific regions and continued strength in our process technologies group. Onshore/Offshore order inbound increased by 45% versus the prior-year quarter to $1.7 billion resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the quarter.
Moving to Surface Technologies, revenue increased to 14% versus the prior-year quarter, driven by higher North American activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% decreased more than 200 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Sequentially, Surface Technologies revenue was broadly flat with the second quarter. Growth in international markets offset lower revenues in North America, where reduced completions activity negatively impacted flow line sales in the quarter. Backlog for Surface Technologies ended the quarter at $456 million, increasing 10% sequentially and by 16% over the prior-year quarter.
Here you can see we show the good progress made in backlog growth and improving 2019 revenue visibility for both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. For Subsea, quarterly book-to-bill had trended consistently above 1.0 since the fourth quarter of 2017, driving backlog growth of 7% over this period. Inbound activity has been strongest in our Onshore/Offshore segment, generating three consecutive quarters of sequential backlog growth. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $8.4 billion, an increase of over 30% from yearend.
Looking at the darker shaded areas of the two charts, we also highlight the much improved visibility we now have for 2019 revenues. In Subsea $2.8 billion of the $6.3 billion in total backlog is scheduled for execution in 2019, up from $1.6 billion at the beginning of the year. Key project awards contributing to this improved visibility include the iEPCI for Energean's Karish development, SURF work for Chevron Gorgon Stage 2 and a subsea production system for ExxonMobil's Liza Phase 2 project which we announced earlier this week.
Additionally, there will be in-bound received in the fourth quarter that will deliver revenue in 2019. We remain confident that our total inbound for the current year will be above levels achieved in 2017, and we anticipate additional revenue from project inbound and Subsea service work awarded in 2019. Combining these factors with growth in backlog and an improving market outlook, we continue to believe 2018 should be the trough for Subsea revenues.
Turning to Onshore/Offshore, as we have communicated before, revenue from Yamal LNG, our largest individual project under construction today will take another step down in 2019 as the project moves closer to completion. And although it will continue to be a significant contributor to 2019 segment revenues, we have more than replenished the decline in Yamal backlog with other new projects scheduled for execution next year and beyond.
We continue to expect that we will benefit from disciplined project selectivity, strong risk management and solid project executions. These, and other inbound awards, have driven scheduled revenues for 2019 to $4.2 billion. I would also remind you that this backlog does not include activity related to the nearly $2 billion from non-consolidated joint ventures, which are highlighted in the backlog scheduling slide provided in the appendix.
Turning to cash flow, we return to positive operating cash flow in the period, generating $141 million in cash from operations. As we suggested on the second quarter earnings call, we benefited from good cash management and working capital improvement, including the receipt of advanced payments in the period related to new project awards that were booked in both the second and third quarters. In an effort to continue improving our disclosures for you, we have expanded the detail on the cash flow statement to provide more clarity of working capital flow.
In the third quarter earnings release, we now show the current portion of changes in assets and liabilities, so that you can see the change in working capital from quarter to quarter. For the third quarter, working capital was a use of $117 million and for the nine months ended a use of $918 million. This does illustrate the improvement in working capital efficiency versus the first six months of the year where working capital was a use of $801 million.
Beyond the operating line, I will focus on the key drivers of our capital allocation strategy. First, capital expenditures were $122 million in the quarter. Looking at the other major discretionary spending items in the period, we distributed a total of $217 million to shareholders, including $158 million for share repurchase, our largest quarterly spend to date, and $59 million for the payment of quarterly dividends. In total, these discretionary spending items, both capital expenditures and shareholder distributions, were $337 million in the period.
The balance sheet remained very strong at quarter end. Cash was essentially unchanged at $5.6 billion. We ended the period with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion.
Now a comment on our updated guidance for full year 2018, for Onshore/Offshore, we are once again increasing our expectations to include the strong operational results posted in the quarter. We now expect revenues in a range of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion, with margins of at least 13%. This reflects the strength in the third quarter results for certain project milestone successes. EBITDA margin should trend lower in the period, as we do not expect additional bonuses in the fourth quarter.
Given the reduced market activity in North America, we are also updating our guidance for Surface Technologies. We now anticipate full year margin of at least 16%.
Additionally, we are revising our estimate for net interest expense. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Yamal financial liability, underlying net interest expense has totaled $30 million for the first nine months of the year. This result is better than previously forecast, as we have benefited from higher interest rates on cash balances. We now expect net interest expense in the fourth quarter to be in a range of $10 million to $12 million, excluding the impact of any further revaluation of the Yamal financial liability. All other guidance items remain unchanged.
In summary, our 2018 updated outlook is supported by our year-to-date performance. Our execution delivered higher adjusted EBITDA margins, even as revenues declined. Inbound orders for the quarter again exceeded revenue in all segments, supporting a return to year-over-year backlog growth and improved revenue visibility for 2019 and beyond.
Also in the quarter, we delivered much improved positive operating cash flow, benefiting from strong cash management and cash advances on certain inbound awards. We will provide our 2019 guidance on December 12 and will follow with a conference call on December 13.
Operator, you may now open the call for questions. And your first question comes from Michael Alsford with Citi. Hello, thank you for taking my question, just a question firstly on the subsea market. I wanted to get a sense, Doug, if you could, on the pricing environment. Clearly, it's good to see the FIDs and activities picking up, but you did talk a bit about the fact that there are some sort of ill-discipline I guess around bidding and I just wonder whether that has normalized at all at the current market. Thanks. Thank you, Michael, for the question. Clearly, we see less diversity in the results on the tenders in terms of the spread between the high point and the low point. Unfortunately, we still see from time to time some irrational pricing and some outliers on the low end. And that remains the challenge in the market that is, if you will, open for everyone to participate in. And again, on the positive side, we're seeing less degree of separation, but we are continuing to see some irrational pricing in that market. We believe some of those who have been active in that activity are to the point now that they will start to refrain from that going forward, so we do have a positive outlook for the trend over the near term.
It's important when you think about TechnipFMC, just to reiterate what I said earlier in my script, to recognize that over 50% of our inbound opportunities are not exposed to that market conditions that I just described, and that's because of our ability to be able to convert our integrated FEED activity to direct awards for iEPCI projects as well as our Subsea Services business, and our partner and alliance opportunities that we have. It's a real differentiator for our company. Thanks, Doug, and a follow-up, if I could, just on that. You talk a bit about saying that 2018 is going to be a trough on revenues in Subsea. So should we expect therefore that margins are also troughing in 2018? Thank you. As you know, we're going to be sharing guidance here in December of this year. I think when we look at 2019 and going forward, as I indicated in my script, there continue to be some headwinds. We obviously have some activities that will offset that, but we look forward to sharing more detail with you in December. Okay. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Thank you, good morning. Doug, I was hoping to maybe get your thoughts in looking at the order outlook maybe for the rest of this year and maybe some early thoughts on 2019. I guess number one, how do you handicap the odds of maybe booking another major award between now and year end for this year?
And then as you look into next year, how do you see the types of projects or mix of projects next year versus this year? Does it look materially different to you in terms of the number of large project opportunities or mix for integrated? I'd be curious to get your thoughts on how you see the market evolving over the next 15 months or so. Thank you, Jud. And you can see where we updated our Subsea opportunity slide gives a bit of that answer on the slide, but let me add some more color. So in the fourth quarter, we have to wait and see. It's one of the reasons we want to have an opportunity to have a few more weeks under our belt as we move forward and looking at our 2019 guidance.
You may recall in 2017 there was a flurry of project awards, particularly from Equinor, at the very last days of the year. I cannot either – I can't confirm or deny if that's going to happen this year. That's really a function of our clients and when they wish to sanction projects, be it at the end of one year or the beginning of the next year for certain budgetary considerations.
What we do see is a number of projects that we think are increasing in the probability of them being awarded, could be in the end of 2018 or in the beginning of 2019. Of that mix of awards, there is clearly a trend towards integrated projects, and there's clearly a trend towards larger projects being sanctioned. At the same time, as indicated in my script, the smaller awards or tie-back in brownfield opportunities continue to be very robust, and we continue to secure a significant portion of that work due to as well our ordinary (00:28:07) accounts and our integrated approach to subsea tie-backs. Okay, thank you for that. And my follow-up is maybe for Maryann. Maryann, could you give us your thoughts on operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and also maybe comment a little bit on working capital. You've made some progress this quarter on working capital, when do we start to see some tailwinds. As you book more awards, I would think working capital starts to turn more in your favor as you get payments. Can you give us any insight as to how we think about that in the coming quarters on when working capital starts to maybe turn more positive? Sure, thank you. So maybe just a bit of color on the quarter, as we shared with you on the second quarter, we're really trying to step away from giving specific working capital guidance and rather guide around operating cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was favorable as you saw, positive I should say $140 million. In the quarter, we saw only a use of about $117 million in working capital. We think that is demonstrating, if you will, the benefit of the order inbound turning our ability to receive those advanced payments and, as you know, we always try to stay ahead of the cash flow curve.
So again in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned on the second quarter call, we are expecting operating cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter. Inbound awards, I think I mentioned on the second quarter call, Doug mentioned the possibility for another one potentially in the fourth quarter also carrying with them advanced payments, certainly helps in further efficiency of working capital utilization. It's certainly beneficial as we are turning the corner with inbound.
So that hopefully gives you a little bit of color in our performance in the third quarter. You can see the benefits of increased in-bound and the effects of that on our performance. So thank you for that. So it would be reasonable to expect for operating cash flow to grow off the third quarter in the fourth quarter? Jud, there's a few things that can happen and timing of that is pretty critical but we certainly think that operating cash flow in the fourth quarter will continue to be positive. Okay, I'll take it there. Thanks. Your next question comes from James Evans with Exane BNP Paribas. Yeah, good morning, or good afternoon to everyone. A couple of questions for me on LNG. Firstly, a bit shorter-term on Yamal, is it fair to assume that you have additional bonus opportunities on Train 3? And can you just describe a little bit about what you're actually going to be doing in 2019, if we're almost there on the last train in terms of your revenue for next year? Is that the fourth smaller train coming through your revenue line?
And then secondly and a bit longer term, obviously very exciting market at the moment. LNG, it looks like it's not far, well, 100 million tons planned over a period about 18 months of sanctioning, I'm sure not all of it will go ahead, but can the industry really deliver all of this, or do you think you'll see any bottlenecks within the industry either in engineering or delivery? Thank you. Thank you very much, James. So first of all, on Yamal LNG, we're extremely proud of the level of execution, and of our team and the performance that we've had thus far on the project. There are still plenty of work left to be done around the delivery of Train 3. And based upon the success of that delivery, there could be an additional opportunity to be recognized for that delivery if it's done in an accelerated manner.
Beyond the delivery of Train 3, there is ample activity for us to continue to perform, keeping in mind that it's not only delivering the train, but it's being involved in the commissioning and startup and successful testing, and performance testing of the individual train. So indeed there is opportunity and additional works scope in 2019 on Yamal.
Looking at the longer term opportunities, I think you summed it up well. I think the market is there. There's more projects being discussed than will likely be sanctioned. Our choice, or our strategy, has been to focus on those projects that we think have the highest strategic importance and the best economics in terms of delivered product.
So, we look at each of those opportunities under that lens. And from that we prioritize the projects that we're going to put our resources on. Clearly, there will be bottlenecks. In some geographies, the bottlenecks will be around construction, and construction labor. More generally, it will be around the engineering as you correctly point out. So, therefore, as has been our approach to this business, we will continue to work closely with partners and diversify our projects both in terms of the projects that we are operating. As you know, today, we're operating three LNG projects, not just Yamal, but also the Prelude FLNG project as well as the Coral FLNG project.
On those projects, some of the partners are similar. In other cases, there's different partners. So, we'll continue to use that strategy of diversification, both in terms of the projects, the geographies, and the way that we partner on those individual projects. But we think we're very well positioned to be awarded or to secure some of those projects that we think have high strategic importance and will have very good delivered economics. Super, I'll turn it over. Thank you. Your next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Thanks. Doug, to start, since we can't talk about 2019 for another six weeks or so, how should we think about the underlying drivers of the solid margin performance we saw in 3Q for Subsea, taking in the context of there's some seasonal services benefit maybe from Riserless Light Well Intervention, and you had some these Equinor project deliveries. So, if you could talk about the underlying drivers there for 3Q, and then more importantly how should investors interpret the decision to leave the 2018 margin guide unchanged? Thank you, Sean. I actually think you answered the question very well. The only thing I could really add to your answer is, we also mentioned in our press release that we finished off the delivery around the North FPSO on Kaombo. This was the largest subsea project award at that time, and we had a very successful completion of that campaign. So it really does come down to the timing. We have many projects in the portfolio and reaching certain milestones or completing certain activities and/or closing certain projects, does have an impact from a quarter-to-quarter perspective. So when we look forward, we were looking at coming off of a Q2 and Q3 where we had several of those type of events that we don't necessarily see reoccurring in the fourth quarter. Again, timing is something that we don't necessarily control. It's our best outlook at this time, and coupled with that, as you pointed out some seasonal impact on some of our other service lines. Okay. I appreciate, Doug. And that all makes sense. And maybe to circle back on the pricing discussion for Subsea, it will be great if we could maybe dig a little deeper into how backlog pricing trends could be going across some of the different inbound streams. So just directionally or on a relative basis, it be great to better understand iEPCI versus the legacy procurement type of bidding SPS versus SURF, and even that within Subsea 2.0. Is there a margin premium that you're able to capture? There's a lot of pieces to unpack there but I think there's also a lot of moving parts for investors to interpret as well. Thank you for the question, Sean, because it is somewhat what differentiates us as TechnipFMC versus not having those individual streams. So if we were to break those down, the competitive – the open market, where you're bidding against the lowest common denominator, you're not allowed to apply an integrated model, you're not allowed to apply your latest generation technology, and you're going up on an agnostic FEED study that was done at the lowest common denominator, so that it could be tendered accordingly.
Again, as I said, on the positive side there was very large spreads between the top and the bottom and the various individuals in between and you can see this in those tenders that have been publicly disclosed and what you now see is you see a much less dispersion across the various entities that are bidding on the projects. Unfortunately, you still tend to see some outliers and in some cases outliers by a significant amount. That's not TechnipFMC.
Our strategy is not to be an outlier. Our strategy is to demonstrate where we can create project success by the application of our integrated model, by the application of technology, and based upon our leadership in the market and our demonstrated performance.
You see that coming through in the projects as we talked about. Kaikias last quarter now two additional projects this quarter being Visund Nord and Trestakk. These were not necessary – these were complicated projects that we were able to deliver in a very respectable manner and, in two cases, are being considered to be new records by our clients. So it's something we're very, very proud of and we believe we're just beginning and we'll continue along that trend.
So breaking it down further, that's the competitive market when we're able to secure a project. An iEPCI award is a direct to the integrated FEED activity that we're performing and we're able to secure that as a direct award. We're focused on the project economics. We're not focused on the individual line items or lowest common denominator. So we sit down with the client early. We understand the client's economics, the project economics, and our own economics. And we're able to find a solution that allows us to achieve an outcome and, in many cases, achieve outcomes that become records for the industry as we have demonstrated thus far.
Those margins are quite frankly tend to be at a higher level because we're being recognized and rewarded for that performance. And again we're working with the client with a common goal which is unlocking the potential of the subsea project, economics, and delivering it both in terms of lower cost but more importantly accelerated first oil.
Same applies for Subsea 2.0 but slightly different. We're able to apply our Subsea 2.0 technology, it may give us an advantage in time to first oil. In other words, we can use that as a differentiator in a tender or it may just give us a benefit in terms of our cost associated with that product or that set of products. As opposed to the competitors who are bidding at a Subsea 1.0, if you will. We have that advantage or that greater pricing elasticity as a result of our Subsea 2.0 family.
I will point out, although it represents 50% of our current activity, there is 50% that is still being competitively tendered. Our goal is to continue to drive that percentage up, that's in our favor. And we think the recent successes that we have will demonstrate to the market the benefit of going with the integrated commercial model and/or Subsea 2.0 technology. I think that was very well stated. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Hey. Good morning, Doug. Good morning, James. Doug, curious about, I guess one statement you made, 90% increase in FEED studies year to date. I'd call that not just a continuation of recovery, but certainly an acceleration here of the recovery, and I'm curious. In that 90%, and you just touched on a bit of that with Sean, 50% I think of the business right now was competitively bid. But of the increase we've seen this year, has that been moving more towards 50% relative to say this time last year? What's the trend in that mix? So the trend in the FEED studies is, if you just look at our activity, as you know, we started doing integrated FEED studies back at the time of FORCE Subsea. So we have built up a set of opportunities that in many cases are proprietary to our company that were never competitively studied by others, and now we're in a position to convert those into a direct award.
We have to deliver on the integrated FEED study and we have to deliver on reaching the agreed-upon project economics. When we do so, then it's obviously in the client's hand to decide when to sanction or FID that project. But we watch that opportunity set very closely because that helps us understand how we want to prioritize our own resources, which we would obviously prefer to dedicate to those type of projects based upon my earlier response that I gave to Sean, because on those projects, we can realize a higher margin.
So the overall mix is clearly moving in that direction as well as, as you say, the overall level of activity. But I would caution, just the 90% increase in FEED activity doesn't necessarily – is meaningful in the number and the acceleration, as you point out. But I would just caution that it's really the quality of those projects that you're working on. Doing a FEED study for the sake of engineering hours is not where our focus is. We clearly see our clients shifting to let's say a much more intimate conversation around production levels, a much more intimate conversation around the timing of projects to be able to achieve first oil in a certain accelerated manner, so it's a more serious discussion along that line. So therefore, I would say the quality more important than the quantity has improved quite a bit. That's a great point, Doug, and then one follow-up for me. Is there any way that you could quantify – I guess when we originally put FORCE together and then of course with the transaction with Technip and FMC, part of the driver here was to create market. Now we obviously went through a downturn and all these types of things. But do you have any sense of is that happening, and do you have any idea or can you quantify in any way how much market you think you may have created that wouldn't normally be there if you weren't able to provide these fully integrated projects? Thanks, James, a very interesting question. Let me point to two very real examples because I like to give real tangible evidence. Sure. Equinor has said that the Trestakk project was an economically challenged project, was a project they had looked to move forward in the past, but there wasn't necessarily the right execution model and commercial model to move that project forward. As indicated, we have now delivered the Trestakk project, and it was delivered on budget and ahead of schedule, and is considered to be a significant success by Equinor.
Likewise, Shell has said that Kaikias was a project that needed a new commercial model in order to unlock its potential. So I would simply point to those two projects, which are now full cycle and have been successfully delivered, as clear evidence of the ability of being able to unlock the potential of subsea projects. Beyond that, I would rather not talk about the number that we think are possible because, if you will, that's our proprietary set of projects... Fair enough. ...that we're working on that we've been doing studies for over three years in some cases that we have the opportunity to convert those into integrated projects. And if you will, I would see that as the accelerator to our growth relative to our competition. Okay, it makes sense. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from Mick Pickup with Barclays. Good afternoon, everybody, two questions, if I may. Firstly, just on On/Off, you've got $4.2 billion in hand for next year. That's the same you had at the end of 2017 for this year. So why aren't you saying that you've seen the trough in revenues in On/Off? So, Mick, I think when we look at the composition of backlog, hopefully you can see that from the slide as well. But when you look at the composition of the backlog, one of the things we're trying to indicate is year over year the composition of the backlog coming from Yamal has declined. We'll provide much more color as we get to the guidance call on the December 12 and tell you about the top line for Onshore/Offshore. But the point there was really just trying to say year over year that backlog is now made up of other non-Yamal projects and giving the indication that as Yamal continues to reach to completion, there is a very solid backlog of other project work. So it's just the ramp-up on that $4.2 billion is different than the execution of the $4.2 billion previously? That's right, Mick. You got it. Okay, right. And... If I could add to Maryann's comment because I appreciate your question. As I indicated, we've had a large award in each of the first three quarters for Onshore/Offshore starting with the Bapco Refinery and the two fertilizer projects for HURL in India, and then most recently in this quarter the award of the Long Son Petrochemicals project. That really shows clear evidence that we are delivering against the $5 billion target that we put for our downstream opportunities, keeping in mind that we indicated that there would be another award in the near term. In addition to that would be any opportunities in LNG. So we're very pleased with the progression of inbound in our Onshore/Offshore GBU, as we call it, or our segment. Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up on the 4Q margin in Subsea. Your guidance hasn't changed all year for greater than 14%. And if I look at your revenue guidance, it means 4Q is going to be by far your strongest quarter. And given where your guidance is, it means it's going to be by far your lowest margin. Now, I understand part of that is projects not completing. But is there anything else in there driving it down like flat spots at the start of new contract, seasonal impacts, or is it just the backlog that's being executed state of the business? Mick, as you know, it's a combination of many things and I think you touched actually on all of those and it includes the timing of certain projects, certain milestones and as we sit today and we look at what we can see, again we don't control the timing of each and individual project and the completion and milestones that are achieved. But as we look at it today that was the reason we maintain the margin guidance that we have in Subsea. Okay. Thank you, Doug. Cheers. Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. All right. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Kurt. So, Doug, I wanted to ask a similar question that came out a little bit earlier this one on the Subsea side of the business in the context of you talked about the increase in FIDs. So, I'm just kind of curious given the kind of recovery phase that we're in right now in the marketplace given some of the downsizing that occurred at the major oil companies, what do you think the market could handle reasonably with current resources and staffing with respect to subsea project awards in any given year, FIDs, or however you may want to answer the question. I'm just trying to gauge what can the industry reasonably handle at current kind of resource and staffing levels from a subsea standpoint? Thank you. Thank you, Kurt. I think if you look at it both from the operator side as well as from the service industry side, although there have been obviously an impact of this downturn I think given new commercial models like our integrated model, given the opportunity to have much earlier engagement like we do with the integrated FEED studies, or if you will vendor-based solutions as some people refer to it, I think what we have been able to demonstrate is we can deliver significant projects very successfully with the resources that are in the industry. In terms of the physical assets, be it manufacturing capacity, or be it fleet capacity, I think there is quite a bit of growth that the industry can continue to support.
So, I would – in responding to your question if you look at it through a very traditional lens and say we're going to continue to do projects the way that we always have as an industry, meaning every award is bespoke, requirements change on every single award, we are always building a first article item. We are using a subsea architecture that has never been used before. We have heavy engineering hours associated post project with each and every project, then I would be concerned about the constraints. We have inverted that. We have changed the way that we're approaching the subsea market. And we believe that with that change we'll be able to have much more elasticity in terms of the ability to be able to grow the market with a reasonable number of resources versus what we have done in the past. And a lot of that means going from bespoke engineering to the approach that we have done with our Subsea 2.0 technology and the ability to be able to do projects like Trestakk where we delivered it in a single season for marine operations.
When a project like that would have historically been done over two seasons, we because of the ability to be able to look at it as a single project and working in a collaborative way with our client, we were able to change the scheduling to change and synchronize the manufacturing versus the fleet capacity and to be able to do it in a single season. Those are profound changes, when you think about what we can do with the same amount of resources going forward. We believe that's the right way and we believe that's the way that projects will be done in the future. That's great. Thanks. And then follow-up I had for you just kind of staying on the Subsea dynamic, and this time maybe focusing on the economics through the lens of, say, the major oil companies or national oil companies, whatever it may be, what do you sense the oil companies, what kind of oil price level do you think the oil companies are comfortable with in kind of gauging their economic profile? Think about it maybe in the terms of Brent complex. Has it moved up over the course of the past 12 months? Are they more confident in a $50 or $60 oil price environment than they were? Are they still being very conservative and assessing projects more in a kind of $40 Brent environment? Any color on that would be helpful, Doug. I certainly don't want to speak on behalf of our clients, I'll kind of let them answer with the oil price environment that they're comfortable with. What I can say is in the discussions that I am having with them, they recognize that what we have done is enable subsea projects to move forward in that sub-$50 barrel range. And if you look at the projects that we've delivered and look at the comments that our clients have made around those projects, many of which they're saying were valid; it's economic at sub-$40 and even sub-$30. So I don't think it's an issue of the oil price unlocking the potential. We needed to change our behaviors in the industry. We needed to get away from this take-advantage in an upturn in terms of inflation and radical deflation in the downturn. We need to move away from bespoke engineering and think about doing things differently.
And we needed to find a way to be able to utilize our resources in a much more efficient manner as we were able to do on the Trestakk development. And by the way, I think that applies to IOCs, NOCs and independents who are an increasing portion of our customer base as well. That's great. Thanks, Doug. I appreciate it. Your next question comes from Bertrand Hodée with Kepler. Yes. Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is looking at big oil and the adoption of the integrated concept. Shell and Equinor tested successfully as a model. What are the push-backs you are getting from others like Exxon, like Total? And do you believe that you could get in the short term some integrated projects from those names? Yes, I am confident we will. Okay. And then a follow-up on Yamal. Novatek had been talking for some time now for an additional small 1 million ton train at Yamal. Is this already in your backlog, or is it something that you as a near-term opportunity you are still pursuing? Thank you for the question because I think it is important that we clarify. I'll leave the client to discuss what their plans are but our scope on a project like that would be simply to provide the interconnects from the third train to the fourth train. But the fourth train itself would have very little impact on us. What the client has discussed before was using a much more local content on a fourth train and as you indicated it would be a smaller train.
So the larger opportunity for us with Novatek would be on Arctic LNG 2, a project that we're working very closely, in the final stages of delivering the FEED study to Novatek, and we continue to work very closely with them to improve the overall project economics and hopefully build on the success of Yamal LNG. Thank you very much. Your last question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Good morning. Doug, a quick question on Surface. I was surprised by how robust the orders were in the third quarter given the dislocations unfolding with regard to Lower 48 frac, which albeit are transient, nonetheless are real.
I'm just curious with regard to, you lower the margin for the year, which I'm sure is in response to what's happening at ground level in Lower 48, but what are the discussions that you are having with customers, are orders being deferred or cancelled or both? And what would you expect to happen with regard to Surface inbound, which has been very strong and surprisingly strong in Q3 over the next few quarters as we wrestle with these Permian constraints? Thank you, Bill. We too were pleased with the robustness in our Q3. But again, let's be very frank, we are being impacted as everyone else is by the lower level of activities both in the Permian Basin and beyond. We do have an advantage other than – our business model is one that is not very asset-intensive, our Surface Technologies business. We have the ability to be able to move resources and to move our assets around from basin to basin, which does allow us to dampen some of that impact. But clearly there, we saw some and we'll continue to see the impact of the slowdown in the activity in North America.
Keep in mind, a large portion of that segment is not exposed to the North America market, our international business. And in our international business, we indicated that we were seeing the recovery in that market last quarter. And that has certainly continued in a trend that we would expect to continue into 2019. We look forward to securing additional awards very soon. Very large awards, frame agreement type awards, and we also look forward to demonstrating the value of our new integrated offering by receiving awards with our integrated offering as well. Okay. Thank you. And Maryann, two quick ones for me. I think you maintained the capital spending guidance of $300 million for the year, which implies I think once again a pretty significant step-down in CapEx in Q4. Is that correct, which would imply nice free cash flow improvement in the fourth quarter? And that's a lot, I know for one.
And then secondly ETR, I know that when we redomiciled to the UK, the objective, if memory serves, was to bend that tax rate down to the low to mid-20s%. Is that still where you think it lands over the next few years? Thanks. You're welcome, Bill. So first question the CapEx. Yes, you're right, we have not adjusted CapEx on a full year basis, so we still feel $300 million's an appropriate level of spend for 2018. So you're right, we have not changed CapEx consciously.
Your second question on tax rate, I'll call this a high class problem in a way, but you're absolutely right. Our domicile does give us benefits as we reach out in the next coming years. We're fortunate to have good success in key areas and those key areas right now happen to be tax jurisdictions that have higher rates than our domicile. So we're driving a lot of profitability through some higher rate jurisdictions. But ultimately as we continue to contract in the future, our ability to benefit in a more favorable way from that domicile should be seen in the coming years. Okay, thank you. We have reached the end of the Q&A session. I will turn the call back over to Matthew Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our third quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 PM British Summer Time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thanks very much for joining us. Operator, you may end the call. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TechnipFMC's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Matt Seinsheimer, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to TechnipFMC's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued yesterday can be found on our website.

We undertake no obligations to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call.
Let me start by providing an update on our ongoing efforts in cooperation with authorities to resolve investigations involving legacy projects. These matters have progressed to a point where we have made a provision of the probable estimate for an aggregate settlement with all authorities.
Let me be clear, these historical individual actions are unacceptable. Since our first day as TechnipFMC, integrity has been a foundational belief that drives the behaviors of the 37,000 women and men of our company.
How we do business is as important as why we do business and helps us to recognize and address the ethical dimensions to our everyday decisions. Our strong compliance program promotes a culture of accountability that gives me confidence in how TechnipFMC will always conduct business.
Now turning our attention to the market and our operational performance. Market adoption of the new commercial model that we pioneered is accelerating and in many cases the integrated model has become the industry standard for Subsea projects.
We have also restored growth in total company backlog with a continued focus on projects selectivity, positioning our company for future profitable growth. This provides us with a strong foundation for 2019 and beyond.
Total company orders exceeded $14 billion for the year, a 40% increase compared to the prior year. Orders exceeded revenues in all segments with onshore, offshore particularly successful in securing several key downstream and petrochemical awards.
In Subsea book to bill was above 1.1 with considerable growth in iEPCI project inbound, including our largest most comprehensive integrated award to date for Energean's Karish field development.
In Surface Technologies, orders grew 36% when compared to the prior year, driven by nearly 70%growth outside of the Americas. The impressive order intake for the total company drove a double-digit increase in backlog to $14.6 billion.
We exceeded total company financial objectives for a second consecutive year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.2% declined just 93 basis points from the prior year, despite the revenue decline of 17%. This outperformance was largely driven by continued strength in onshore, offshore execution as evidenced by the early delivery of Trains 2 and 3 on Yamal LNG. In fact, the third train on Yamal was delivered more than 12 months ahead of the original schedule, a feat unprecedented in the LNG industry.
Notable execution milestones in Subsea included the delivery of the industry's first three full cycle iEPCI projects. Our results were further supported by the delivery of merger and other cost saving initiatives and we remain on track to generate $450 million in annualized merger savings by the end of 2019.
And finally, collaboration with our customers and partners led to the development of several strategic growth initiatives during 2018, which seek to strengthen and differentiate our competitive position and further expand our market opportunity set.
Let me highlight a few of these initiatives. In Surface Technologies we announced the frame agreement with Chevron that leverages the value we can create through our integrated drilling and completion offering. This preferred supplier agreement enables us to further support Chevron's development program across the U.S. and Canada through the provision of Surface wellheads, production trees and related services well into the next decade.
In Subsea, I want to highlight two achievements. First, we signed a global strategic collaboration agreement with Equinor, which further expands upon our recent iEPCI successes. The agreement emphasizes collaboration from early engagement through the full project lifecycle on Equinor's global offshore portfolio. It also encompasses our full scope of products and services. The most comprehensive in the industry, including integrated project execution, next generation technology and digitalization.
Second, our Subsea Services business was awarded a master services agreement by Petrobras. This represents the industry's first integrated services agreement in Brazil, a market where we have the largest installed base of Subsea trees, manifolds and flexible pipelines. It also reinforce to Petrobras, as well as supporting the growth and outlook for our Subsea Services business. Collaboration is essential to the success of our strategy and we are working to secure additional agreements to further strengthen and differentiate our market position.
With the Subsea market recovery entering its third year, we are rebuilding our backlog in a disciplined way. The market for smaller awards including brownfield and tieback projects remains very active.
TechnipFMC has the industry's largest installed base which uniquely positions us to capture a high share of this expanding market. In addition many of these awards come through our alliance relationships and are often the result of a direct award.
Since the formation of TechnipFMC in January of 2017, we have secured over $10 billion of Subsea order inbound. The majority of this reflects smaller awards in Subsea Services work demonstrating that we are not overly reliant on large competitive tenders to support our business.
Subsea Services return to growth in 2018. We anticipate double-digit growth this year driven by an improving Subsea market, as well as strategic investments we have made in this business.
TechnipFMC pioneered the integrated model and has delivered the industry's only full cycle projects. The savings in both cost and time are now being realized. This gives us confidence we will see further market growth in integrated projects in 2019.
This year we have already secured new projects from BP and Lundin, bBoth first time iEPCI customers. Our expanding list of project references when combined with our unique breadth and differentiation of our integrated offering positions us well for continued growth in iEPCI backlog in the coming year. This will be driven in part by a further broadening of iEPCI alliance partners.
Now let me provide a quick update on the Subsea outlook. As evidenced by a recent awards. The deepwater market has moved into 2019 with strong momentum. We continue to anticipate another year of activity growth with integrated awards becoming an even larger component of the Subsea mix for both TechnipFMC and the broader market.
In our updated Subsea opportunities list, we have made several project additions that are reflective of more recent activity trends. With continued projects sanctioning and expanding opportunities in Asia Pacific and Brazil, as well as growing momentum across Africa, we have added four new projects to the list.
As previously discussed, there is a substantial market beyond large competitive tenders including work in the brownfield and tieback markets, Subsea Service and other strategic project opportunities for TechnipFMC.
Our comprehensive capabilities positions us well to capitalize on all of these market opportunities. It is also important to note that several projects on the list will serve to feed existing LNG infrastructure, while others will create new opportunities for large scale gas monetization.
Turning to onshore, offshore. I want to re-emphasize some of the strategic differentiators that we believe distinguishes us and drives our industry leading returns. We take a selective approach targeting projects where we have a real competitive advantage or the ability to create one.
We do this through early customer engagement, with our demonstrated engineering competencies and proprietary technologies, through strong client relationships and local presence and with robust project execution.
Now let me illustrate how these strategic differentiators contributed to our success in 2018. Inbound orders of $7.4 billion nearly doubled when compared to the prior year and backlog grew 27%. Over the last decade, this is the second highest inbound level for onshore, offshore.
And perhaps most importantly, we have sustained the same level of anticipated profitability from our non-Yamal LNG backlog during this period of significant inbound growth, a testament to our ability to both replace and further grow backlog without compromising project selectivity.
We will use this same strategy to successfully navigate the LNG market where projects are often large, requiring highly complex logistics. These project characteristics play to our strengths and we will remain disciplined and selective.
Stronger than expected demand for LNG is being driven by Asia Pacific with China notably importing over 40%more LNG in 2018 than in 2017. This is reenergized the LNG market and momentum on final investment decisions is now stronger than we envisioned during 2018.
When assessing the future opportunity set, we are currently tracking more than 20 projects in the LNG space globally. While we do not expect all these prospects to move forward, we see potential for significant new capacity to be sanctioned over the next 18 to 24 months.
This near term potential was well above historical growth rates and provides us with a unique portfolio of opportunities. We will leverage our most extensive reference projects, incumbent positions and global client relationships toward those projects that are most strategic to TechnipFMC and offer the highest probability of successful execution.
In summary, 2018 was a year of many successful milestones for our company, and we acknowledge and appreciate the steadfast commitment of the women and men of TechnipFMC and their achievements.
We enter 2019 with an improved backlog and even greater visibility on inbound activity than we had a year ago, driven by the strengthening momentum we see in international Surface activity, the next wave of LNG projects and the accelerated pace of Subsea projects sanctioning.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss the financial results in more detail. Thanks, Doug. Let me start by addressing several special items we incurred in the quarter. I'll walk you through these items individually to provide some clarity to the strength of the underlying results.
Impacting the quarter were after tax charges and credits totaling $2.2 billion, which included the following items of note. First, impairment. In our Subsea business, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1.7 billion consisting of $1.4 billion for goodwill and the remainder related to the carrying value of certain vessels within our fleet. This is a result of our normal annual impairment testing.
We carried $5.4 billion of Subsea goodwill as of the end of 2017 with less than half of that a result of our merger. The Subsea recovery was slower to evolve than we had envisioned at the time of the merger. The impairment test also coincided with a period of very high market volatility which impacted both the discount rate and the market valuations used in the test.
The resulting impairment does not change our longer view of the Subsea market, our leading position in Subsea or the demonstrated strengths of our integrated strategy.
Also in the quarter, we took a provision of $280 million representing the probable estimate for the aggregate settlement of outstanding investigations. We have been informed that the U.S., Brazilian and French authorities have been coordinating their investigations which could result in a global resolution. As we move closer to final resolution on our legal matters, we will provide further clarity on this estimated charge and the potential timing of any payment.
And finally, we incurred charges and credits totaling $37.3 million for restructuring and other severance charges, business combination charges and purchase price accounting adjustment. These are similar to what we have incurred in prior quarters.
Beyond the operating segments, we also had special items impacting our tax provision in the quarter, including a $12 million true-up for U.S. tax reform, and $202 million evaluation allowances. The valuation allowances reflect the probability that in certain jurisdictions deferred tax assets may not generate a tax benefit in future periods. As certain geographic markets recover our views of these deferred tax assets could change. There is no cash impact of this charge.
Excluding these items, we reported an adjusted net loss of $39 million or $0.09 per share. Exhibit 8 and 9 in our release detail all charges and credits taken in the quarter both on a pre-tax and after tax basis.
As we have communicated in the past, other pretext items of significance impacting the quarter for which we do not provide guidance included the following $39 million or $0.05 per diluted share of foreign exchange losses included in corporate expense largely reflecting currency effects and $109 million or $0.24 per diluted share related to an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners that is included in interest expense.
Full year interest expense of $361 million includes $322 million for the increase in the liability to joint venture partners in 2018. The underlying interest expense was $39 million.
Turning to operational highlights in the fourth quarter, total company revenue was $3.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA $342 million dollars with a margin of 10.3%. Let's look at the performance by segment.
Subsea activity was largely as we anticipated in the quarter, although the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian reais provided a headwind to revenue in the quarter. Execution continues to be strong, while margin was impacted by more competitively priced backlog, consistent with our previous comments regarding the outlook.
Onshore, offshore delivered robust performance, a higher revenue mix of lower margin work was largely offset by strong project execution and a bonus for completion of further milestones on Yamal LNG. And in Surface Technologies, the margin decrease versus the prior year was primarily due to the rapid decline in completions activity resulting in an unfavorable product mix. However, this was partially offset by increased activity levels and market share gains in North America.
Turning to cash flow, we generated positive operating cash flow in the period of $159 million. As anticipated, in the second half of the year we generated $300 million in cash from operations significantly offsetting the $485 million cash outflow experienced in the first half, largely related to accelerated project delivery on Yamal LNG.
Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $113 million in the quarter bringing full year expenditures to $368 million, primarily due to the acquisition of a dive support vessel.
Looking at the other major discretionary items in the period, we distributed a total of $118 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. Also in the quarter, we made cash distributions of $102 million to joint venture partners in the Yamal LNG project taking the full year distributions to $226 million.
The balance sheet remained very strong at quarter end. Cash was essentially unchanged at $5.5 billion. We ended the period with a net cash balance of $1.3 billion.
Focusing further on capital allocation. In December we provided our 2019 forecast for capital expenditures of 14 - $400 million. We are now revising that guidance to lower to $350 million.
Let me discuss a few of the key growth initiatives planned for this year. In Subsea, we remain committed to sustaining the competitive advantage the fleet provides us as a critical element of project delivery. As part of our fleet optimization strategy, we had the opportunity to acquire a new dive support vessel to replace the vessel we retired. The acquisition was somewhat opportunistic but allowed us to obtain a high quality top tier vessel significantly below newbuild cost and without a protracted delivery schedule.
The vessel will operate primarily in the dive construction, inspection, maintenance and repair markets in the North Sea and can also support our iEPCI initiative in the region. In fact, we have already secured significant backlog for the vessel and see strong potential to add more in the near term.
In Brazil, we're investing in a spoolbase to build upon a significant local content we have today in country and to support and differentiate our current and future bidding strategy. And in Surface Technologies, we have ongoing capital commitments for a new facility in Saudi Arabia to support an expansion of our product lines in the kingdom. These strategic initiatives will allow us to expand and support the growth activities we see in these particular end market.
I also want to highlight the completion of our previous $500 million share repurchase program that was implemented in September of 2017. Our Board of Directors approved an additional $300 million share repurchase program in early December.
In summary, while the fourth quarter was impacted by several special items, we are pleased with our overall operational performance in 2018. We exceeded total company financial objectives for a second consecutive year, despite a revenue decline of 17%from prior year, our EBITDA margins were resilient losing only 93 basis points over the prior year.
Our solid project execution and risk management combined with synergies and cost reductions supported our financial performance. Total company order inbound increased by 40%with growth in all three segments driving backlog improvement of 12%over 2018.
Operating cash flow performance in the second half of the year of $300 million was much improved from the first half despite the working capital headwinds of major projects nearing completion. And we return $681 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchase activity.
We begin 2019 with good business momentum. Order inbound year-to-date has been strong notably in Subsea and we have improved visibility on near term award potential, including additional iEPCI awards. The LNG outlook has further improved in several LNG projects we are tracking are making good progress toward final investment decisions. And Surface Technology activity continues to strengthen outside the Americas as evidenced by growth in our backlog.
With our company integration now largely complete, we are resolute we focused on initiatives to drive growth, as well as disciplined capital allocation to drive returns. We have reduced our capital spending intentions, while still allowing growth investments to continue. We reaffirm the remaining items of our 2019 financial guidance and remain very confident in the outlook for our company.
Operator, you may now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the linen of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thank you. Starting out maybe in Subsea, is there anything else to highlight in terms of the revenue shortfall in the quarter relative to guidance. I know, Maryann, I think, mentioned something about FX in Brazil, but just curious is there any project deliveries worth mentioning that slipped into the next quarter and I think about how that influence margins in 4Q and just thinking about the implications for that 11% full year margin floor in ’19, is that a manageable baseline quarter-to-quarter or is it still too early to say? Hey. Thanks, Sean. So let me try to address the topic around the revenue numbers. From an activity standpoint, our expectations in terms of how we provided guidance for full year ‘18 and including our margins were largely consistent. As you know, certain milestones get achieved, certain milestones may slip to a different quarter. But overall our activity levels in the fourth quarter were largely as expected.
I think you know there was strength in the dollar. I call out the Brazilian reais because we certainly have quite a bit of activity. You know, the dollar strengthened against the NOK as well. So we certainly saw a bit a headwind with respect to revenue. Obviously IT didn't change the margin percent.
As we think about 2019, no change here. You know, there is always some seasonality and some sequential change in their revenue profile of Subsea. We don't expect that to be any different than we've seen in prior years frankly. And no change to our guidance for 2019 with respect to those margins. We still see margins of at least 11% for Subsea for all of 2019. So nothing in particular to call out that gives rise to any change or for 2019. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for that feedback. Just curious if we could switch gear over to On,Off just how we should think about future potentially Yamal, JV partner liability, revaluations and the settlement payments. Now we've had the third Train delivery I'm not sure that changes anything. Last quarter you quantified the expected impact of Yamal on cash from ops. How do you think about payouts on the mandatory renewable liability impacting cash from financing in ’19? Yeah. Sure, Sean. Thank you. We will come back in the first quarter and give you a better look for at the full year of 2019. Having said that, you should expect that in 2019 given where we are against the completion of the project that we would expect to make additional payments to cover partner or partner liability.
So we will - you should expect that 2019 we'll see further payments. I'll come back in the first quarter and give you a little more clarity around how that will unfold for the balance of 2019. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of James Evans from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on Subsea. Following the wins on a Mero and hopefully on confirmed on - confirmed on Golfinho fairly soon it looks like you're pretty busy from ‘21 to ’23 on some large baseload projects. Is that enough now to lift your expectations or pricing or discipline further on serve [ph] work or do we need to see some further wins I guess to lift things a bit further? Thanks. Thank you, James for the question. Rest assured, we have remained very disciplined throughout this period. In prior quarters, I had described how we are confident because of the success that we have in the base load that we have already because of our installed base with our Subsea Services activity, direct award for many alliance partners and more importantly the iEPCI opportunity set that is proprietary to our company because of the integrated FEED work that we have been doing.
So whereas we have - had the opportunity to add some additional awards and we're excited about those awards. The real question is how does it stack up for the rest of the market for our competitors. And will that drop reduce some of the level of predatory pricing going forward particularly in the area of the installation contracts. And is there have been a series of awards that have been won by us, but as well as by our competition. We think that does indeed set up well and we would expect to see that normalization of pricing.
But again I just want to conclude by ensuring that we have had a strategy all along to maintain our assets to be able to use them where we can create the greatest value for our clients and the greatest differentiation for TechnipFMC and that is on the iEPCI projects and that is why we have been patient and we have been very, very disciplined along the way. Okay. Thanks. And if I could switch gears onto onshore, offshore and talk a little about LNG. I mean, is also a great pipeline. But are you seeing any additional LNG and take opportunities arise because of financial distress elsewhere in the sector or is that not likely to have an influence on you directly? James, interesting question. It certainly is a benefit and we have always been quite disciplined from a financial point of view to maintain that - the strength of our balance sheet, and that certainly plays to our competitive advantage.
That being said, we have maintained our process of selectivity that we have done throughout our portfolio, including on our downstream portfolio in petrochemicals, our refining and fertilizers that you saw us secure in very successfully in 2018.
So in regards to LNG, we think we are well positioned. We are tracking over 20 projects globally. We have focused on five strategic projects. Interestingly there over five different countries, we have seven different partners or potential partnerships across those projects. And that's the way that we will make sure that our portfolio is properly represented and carries the right opportunity and risk profile as we move forward. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon, James. Doug, when looking at the LNG opportunity set you know, as we've done our work on LNG, we're looking at some 100 million tonnes per annum receiving FID this year, so a record year clearly for LNG in our minds. I'm curious as to - as you guys look at the opportunities set, are we too high or too low. How do you guys see or size the market opportunity and maybe you want to take it longer term 18, 24 months? Yeah, if you go 18 to 24 months, I think it's a realistic expectation James, I was going to make the comment, if you look at it over any 12 month period or even the 10 months remaining in 2019, as you know these are big, big projects. They will move around predicting the actual timing of a project, I don't think is beneficial in this environment - or in any environment just because of the size of the projects.
So we remain a bit prudent. We have a strategic list of projects, we work those very diligently. We having a very strong level of front end engineering activity and detailed engineering, which as you know is meaning we're getting close to moving - potentially moving forward with project FIDs and we monitor those very closely and we have a very dynamic approach to our - and selective approach to the way that we look at the opportunity.
So always difficult because of the potential timing, but I could concur that there are certainly offered an opportunity set out there that could meet the metric that you've - that you've laid out. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just switching gears here on the Subsea side with the volatility we saw in commodity prices late last year. Any pause in the activity set or your work on that side and tendering and project progression or has really the train kind of left the station here on Subsea and deepwater - offshore deepwater and were pretty much all systems go? Well, this will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can only relay to you what we're seeing in our activity. We have not seen any change in the momentum if anything we have seen in acceleration. You may know we have already announced several projects in the first quarter. The value of those projects exceeds the total value in bounded in the fourth quarter of 2018, already in the first quarter of 2019 of just the announced projects and as you know we always have a very strong foundation of Subsea Services and other activity that’s direct awarded mainly in the brownfield and tieback arena.
We are very confident in the level of iEPCI awards. We’ll be accelerating. Why is that James? We have a unique proprietary set of projects that we only have exposure to because of the activity that we've been doing over the last years with the integrated FEED projects which are then converted to a direct iEPCI award.
We've already announced three iEPCI awards in 2019 to date, two for Lundin and one for BP, both new customers to the iEPCI model. So we remain quite enthusiastic about 2019 and the opportunities that we will be presented and we think the first half is setting up to be a really strong performance for our company. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning. Thank you. If I can just ask regarding the exposure to Russia, not so much Yamal related, but as we think ahead to Arctic LNG 2, which I believe you're interested in being involved in. Do you foresee any challenges relating to this proposed bill in the U.S. Senate regarding additional sanctions on Russia and Russian Energy in particular?
And secondly, just a very quick one from Maryann, does the impact on goodwill assets lead to a lower depreciation charge? Thank you, guys. Thank you for the question Rob. Indeed Arctic LNG 2 is a strategic opportunity for our company. We have been performing the FEED study and we are now in the detailed engineering phase of that project. We think we have a significant amount to contribute to that project following this very successful Yamal LNG project.
As we did in Yamal LNG project, we will continue to move forward, whilst respecting and acknowledging that sanctions that are in place or potential sanctions that could be in place. But at this time, we continue to actively engage and we'd be very proud to be part of the Arctic LNG 2 project and have another successful project as we did on Yamal LNG. Hey, Rob, Maryann, here. So you know, no change to depreciation on goodwill because there isn't any, but certain on the portion of the asset impairment regarding fleet we will see some lower results there for 2019. Okay. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Your line is now open. Good morning. Question for Maryann and Doug, it seems like you've upgraded your outlook for Subsea Services which carries a significantly higher margin than Subsea as a whole, yet you maintained your overall Subsea margin guidance. Maryann, can you talk about the interplay between those two? Let me let me start Bill, then I'll turn it over to Maryann. We have said - we had anticipated an increase in our Subsea Services activity when we did our forecasting. We’re obviously just validating that and providing some additional color around that at this time. So I just want to make sure that that's clear.
But we - indeed you are correct, it is a very important portion of our portfolio and a real differentiator for our company as we have the largest installed base of Subsea equipment and flexible pipes in the industry. Okay… Bill, Maryann, here. So with respect to margins, certainly as we look at the Subsea services piece it typically carries a much stronger margin as you know than the project portfolio put for several reasons. As we look at our 2019 guidance we have reflected that growth, as Doug said into our margin assumptions. So that would be currently a part of our 2019 guidance around margins. Okay. Thank you. And then the second question Maryann. We haven't discussed the outlook for free cash flow in 2019. Would you expect to be generating free cash this year? Bill, let me let me try to address it in a couple of parts. As you know, as we talked about 2019 on our December call, we offered what we believe to be the view from an operating cash flow level and that is positive. If you allow me to exclude the impact from Yamal here as we talked about, what I share with all of you is $400 million, $500 million of the non- Yamal businesses, meaning Subsea, Surface the remaining onshore, offshore and corporate.
As we look at 2019, we can talk about the pieces here as well. We've just declared CapEx in and around $350 million now for 2019. We just announced our dividend for the last quarter it would be our expectation that we would see similar dividend payments throughout the year. And as I said, we also announced a $300 million buyback.
One of the things that we haven't been as I would say we haven't given you detail on is how we would expect that $300 million to be repurchased and part of that is as I mentioned in my remarks as well, we are highly focused on improving our returns and see - we will use our ability here, our cash flow to be sure that we are opportunistic and where we can put that to work.
The last thing keep in mind and I'll give you some more color in the first quarter. As we are completing the Yamal project, one of the outflows that we will see is the beginning of the payments associated with that MRO and we will have more cash flow for the MRO as well. Okay. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions please. The first one is in the onshore, offshore the order intake was actually quite strong. So I understand there was some good FEED and reimbursables in there. But could you give us some more color into what you think some of these contracts can lead to into further follow-on work, kind of maybe outside your just LNG what it could lead to?
And my second question is a bit more housekeeping. Just if you can talk a bit about the IFRS 16 adjustments to your financial statement? Thank you. Sure so I'll take the onshore, offshore. Amy thank you for the question. Indeed, we had strong reimbursable activity associated with some of our ongoing projects. Keep in mind what I said earlier on some of our LNG activity, we've had very strong activity including moving into the detailed engineering phase, which would mean additional activity and additional revenues associated with it.
And we also had previously announced and we continue to increase our work that we're doing on a reimbursable basis on the Exxon Mobile blade project in the U.S. So actually quite a bit of activity as you pointed out that was not if you will name projects, but very strong level of activity based on our existing portfolio projects, plus a couple of - plus a couple of new reimbursable projects as pointed out, and more activity moving from FEED to detailed engineering on our LNG opportunity list. Amy, your second question around lease accounting IFRS 16 adjustments, I think we'll give you the detail as we come out on the first quarter. We're largely through a lot of that work, but not yet complete. I'll give you a couple of high level comments here.
You know, at this juncture based on the work we've done, we don't see any significant impact on the P&L, just given the way that our leases are structured. Obviously we'll have a bit of a balance sheet impact as we put some of that in PP&E. But we are not expecting at this juncture any significant P&L impact from that. We'll come back in the first quarter and give you much more color as we complete that exercise. All right. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, Doug you do a great job of kind of highlighting all the projects and the sizes in the Subsea market and now we're talking about these 20 LNG projects. Could you just kind of help us understand kind of the size is how the scope of these projects range. I don't know if you can put a small, medium large like you do on the Subsea side, but just give us a sense as to kind of how the size of these awards or what they could potentially be? Sure, David. Thank you for the question. I guess, you'd have to say medium to large. There is no real opportunity set in LNG that would be small and you can look at that based upon the projects that we're currently operating or that we have delivered in the past.
But let's put it in you know in the size of number of potential trains, right. So there is a project we're looking at right now that we're working with our partner KBR to deliver the FEED study and that would be for the Nigeria LNG Train 7. In that case it's a brownfield project. There's six existing trains, so this would be the addition of one train.
In several of the other greenfield projects that we're looking at, we're looking at up to three to four trains on those projects. And then you take a brownfield project like Qatar gas expansion, which, because of the size of the trains and the number of trains in the expansion could actually be as large as any of the greenfield projects that are being investigated at this time.
You further should consider when you think about it from how it impacts if you will our profile going forward, is as I said earlier on those five strategic projects that we're following we're looking at seven plus different partners, sometimes multiple partners on a project or one other partner on a project and that's a good way for us to also ensure that we can use our resources where we can create the greatest value on each and every one of those projects, while partnering with very competent partners to provide other portions of the scope. It also allows us to further diversify our portfolio and our exposure to any one of those projects.
If you want to try to put it into dollar terms you know, you're looking at - you know it's billions of dollars up to tens of billions of dollars, realizing again that we would - it would be unlikely that we would take the scope of a full $10 plus million project without a partner. But I couldn't imagine any of this turns into revenue in '19, right? This is revenue that starts in ’20, 2020 and beyond? Depending upon the timing of the sanctioning. You know, again we tend to be a bit conservative, back to the earlier question on LNG opportunities. But there are some projects that could move forward earlier in the year and we could see some benefit from that.
Keep in mind to the earlier comment or question from Amy, we're doing on some of these projects we've moved from the FEED to the detailed engineering which can bring you know a very sizable engineering contract of you know in the hundreds of millions of dollars of detailed engineering work.
So there are sizable opportunities for our company that come up just prior to a potential project FID. So if it came early enough it's possible, but lots and lots of detailed engineering, additional detailed engineering we could be doing for the throughout the remainder of the year and with a potential sanctioning if it happened earlier in the year there could be some revenue from the project. But you are correct in saying that that would likely come over a period of years. And Doug one final little question here, on the $280 million global settlement you talked about here - that you announced, what you think the sum it could be. Is there any talk about a compliance monitor here in place or are you confident that this is simply going to be a fine, and we could all just kind of move on from this? So we're still early in the discussions. And as you know, when these type of things - when a settlement is reached there's multiple aspects to a settlement. And it's very early for us to comment on it at this time.
And yes, there could be other elements to the settlement. Although I have to say we are very pleased with the level of cooperation and discussion that we're having and we will continue to work in a very collaborative way to resolve these historical issues. Thanks for the comments Doug. Your next question comes from line of Jean-Luc Romain from CM-CIC Market Solutions. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions about the impairment. The first is how much did a change in the discounting rate, you used - how much it will exchange in discounted rate impact the impairment?
Secondly is you are saying that the long term outlook for your business is unchanged and your position is unchanged and that justifies uh deleting about one - further one quarter of your offshore goodwill. Is that a very big chunk of your goodwill that we raised for just a few months of volatility? Thanks for the question Jean-Luc. So let me try to answer – you got a couple of questions there, so let me try to take them in pieces and hopefully I can address everything that you're asking me.
So first and foremost obviously the timing of impairment is critical. Most of the change that we saw was largely in the discount rate. We certainly have impact from the discount rate.
When we talk about the fact that our view is unchanged. If you remember when we did our merger we had a view of the market back a few years ago. And frankly what has happened is the view over the long term has not changed, but certainly our ability to deliver in the short term is different.
You know we sat here a few years ago and would have thought as I shared earlier that 2018 was a year of recovery. And just if I might, you know as we as we think about you know the value you said it's roughly a little bit more than 20%of the value in the goodwill in Subsea, you know some of that goodwill was original goodwill if you will and not much of that goodwill was added as a result of the merger.
Just a few things to keep in mind. So let me try to summarize again. Yes, there is certainly you know a significant piece of our impairment that has to do with a discount rate. Look at the timing of that and look at the market conditions as well. Long term view, we still have a very similar view as we look at the margins in our profile, as we think about Subsea over the over the long term. Thank you. Can you tell what the discount rate was this time? Yeah, for Subsea we'll actually be including that in our K. So if you will allow us to issue the K will provide you that discount rate in the K. Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Good morning, Kurt. Hey, Kurt. Hey. So if I may on the first question here, I want to come back around to some commentary I think that was provided coming out of the Analyst Day and shortly thereafter that you had either a line of sight or target or otherwise, I don't want to put words in your mouth. So you feel free to correct.
iEPCI [ph] orders making up roughly 25% of inbound. Just want to get maybe an update on that and how you think that could progress in 2019 and within the confines of that, I think the other dynamic that you discussed various times was you know, by utilizing - by launching the Subsea 2.0 and then the iEPCI dynamic around it that there could be a number of projects that would not have been deemed economic that would be pulled off the shelf. I wonder if you might be able to comment on how successful you know that's been as well? Kurt, thank you very much. On the first one on the iEPCI as a percentage of our revenue, I'll tell you what I got that one wrong. The good news is I got it wrong in the right way Kurt. We feel quite strongly that when 2019 iEPCI will exceed that 25% target. And in terms of Subsea 2.0, we talked about it earlier most - the highest percentage of our FEED studies now include Subsea 2.0 technology in those FEED studies. They are now beginning to be converted into projects, which gives us increased confidence in the ability to be able to have more demonstrated success of that technology in the marketplace.
When you commercialize a platform, a change in a platform like we did with Subsea 2.0, you have to go through a series of qualifications with your clients before they're made to be part of their standard procedures going forward. We've now accomplished that with the majority - the vast majority of the major Subsea operators. So we’re actually quite excited about the progress that we made. And as I said it's in the FEED studies now and now being included into the tenders. Thank you. Yeah. Great and thanks, Doug. And I want to follow up in all the conversation around the growth in LNG opportunities. I wonder if you can give us a refresher on two things. The first being you know what typically the revenue recognition period for four LNG projects?
And then secondarily can you give us some general sense as to what the margin differential is on LNG projects relative to let's say the average downstream you know onshore, offshore type of project? Kurt, you know, again it really depends as I said you know when you're looking at a 1 train expansion of a brownfield site you can obviously accelerate that because a lot of the utilities is already in place and a lot of the permitting and infrastructure including some potentially some foundation activity is already in place.
When you're looking at a pure greenfield site there is certainly - it's spread over a longer period of time. Typically if you look at a pure greenfield remote site it can be five to seven years. If you look at an FLNG opportunity it tends to be in the range of 60 months. And if you look at some of these brownfield activities it could potentially be in that 60 month range as well.
So that would be - so it's pretty broad because again the opportunity set that we're looking at goes across all of those categories just mentioned. So I guess if you wanted to summarize it you'd say around 4 to 7 years depending upon other project type. And any margin differential on those projects relative to say your typical downstream onshore, offshore project? Yeah. Clearly there's a - those at least that have demonstrated the ability to be able to deliver these projects and to deliver these projects not only on schedule, but in some cases ahead of schedule. It's a list of a few companies and we're very, very proud to be on that list, recognize the women and men of our onshore, offshore global business unit who have been able to achieve such an outstanding performance.
So because of that we would expect on these very large projects that the customer would recognize that and we would be rewarded accordingly. What does that mean if it's you know a couple hundred basis points or something in that range. That's probably realistic to assume. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate that. Your next question comes from line of Michael Alsford from Citi London. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I've just got a couple as well please. So just firstly on the fleet and I guess the long term investment requirements of the business you mentioned obviously the CapEx has come down to 350 for 2019. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fleet in terms of the outlook versus your pipeline of projects that you potentially could be awarded. And I guess where you see sort of longer term investment levels for the business. My first question? Thanks. Sure. So as you would expect Michael we have an ongoing fleet strategy. It's important for us as you say to understand what is our opportunity set versus our capacity and our capabilities. We've been very conservative in not chasing work that would tie up our fleet, that we could not leverage on our iEPCI opportunities and I think that's playing out very well in our favor and we will see the benefit from that for the years to come. And so that's point number one.
Point number two we continue to invest in our existing fleet, where we have opportunities in long term contracts like we recently announced in Brazil we were able to add a vessel under a long term contract with our partner DOF, under our JV and we were able to replace one of our existing dive support vessels with a vessel with much higher capabilities at an opportunistic commercial model and bring in a new dive support vessel into our fleet.
I think looking forward though the whole industry has to reflect upon what we have – the situation that we have created for ourselves. As long as we focus on having the biggest the largest and the highest quantity of large fixed assets, regardless if it's vessels, rigs or frac units for that matter, we'll continue to underperform the level of returns that is expected from our investors.
We are prepared to step up take leadership in this area much as we have across the Subsea space. Certainly with the creation of the integrated model that we have now created and is been adopted broadly across the industy.
We will do the same thing in regards to our fleet. So you should expect us to be very prudent to work well with others to be willing to collaborate with others in order to be able to ensure that there is an overall level of capital and assets in the industry that can deliver reasonable and acceptable returns to the investment community through cycle. Thanks. Thanks Doug. And then just a follow up just on the - to Maryann on working capital so maybe I missed this earlier but Mary could you just give a bit of color as to sort of the phasing of working capital outflow ‘19 if you could. Thank you. Hey, Michael. Maryann here. So I think when we talked about our cash flow from operations at the end of 2018, I didn't specifically give working capital color, but rather color around cash flow from operations. I would expect that throughout the year we will see and probably particularly more front end loaded given the completion around Yamal, those outflows happening earlier in the year rather than later in the year. So that would be the way that I would characterize cash flow from operations, meaning the working capital impact would be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year than in the back half. Thanks. I should took a similar profile that forces sort of ‘18 and what would you say on operating cash flow? That would be fair Michael, yes. Great. Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Mike Urban from Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for sticking me in. Wanted to follow up a little bit on that because Kurt's question, I think everybody agrees. You guys have done a good job in bringing in the business, executing the business and you know one of the big push backs I get is just understanding the - you know the long term margin profile for onshore, offshore. And so definitely helpful on the color in terms of the margin uplift you get from LNG.
But is there anything you've done through the merger that are execution projects election we should talk about in terms of a structural uplift in the normalized margin for the mid and downstream of the traditional EMC work. I think the concern is that over time the margin just kind of migrates back to that kind of mid single digit EBITDA that you've been at, you are at historically? Michael, thank you for the question. Look I think what we've done as a result of the merger is support the onshore offshore GBU you and continue to provide the tools and resources that they need to execute their work. This is a high performing part of the business and has been for a long time.
So you know humbly I would say what we've done is continued to support them. We have some of the very best project managers in the industry. We have the best leadership in the industry and they've proven themselves year after year by performing some of the world's most complex projects and delivering financial performance that outperforms their peer group. Okay. And so I guess given that performance versus peers hopefully that means that our margins and I guess really to follow up a bit of a housekeeping question. Good to hear the improved outlook for Subsea Services. So the is the baseline for that double digit growth you talked about kind of roughly a $1 billion in revenue in ‘18. Is that about where you came in? That's a reasonable assumption. Yes. Okay. That's all for me. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8 p.m. Greenwich time today. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining us. Shelly you may end the call.

We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. Total company revenue in the first quarter was $2.9 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $296 million. Inbound orders were very strong in Q1 with total company orders of $6.2 billion. This represents our highest level of quarterly inbound since the fourth quarter of 2014. And with book-to-bill above 2, we had sequential growth in total company backlog of 22%.
Subsea orders of $2.7 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.3x reflect the increasing trend towards integration with 4 new iEPCI projects awarded in the period. In addition to these integrated orders, we were awarded an equipment and installation contract for the second phase of Equinor’s Johan Sverdrup project in the North Sea and Petrobras’ Mero 1 project in Brazil. While this level of order success will be difficult to replicate for the full year, the timing of these recently announced awards supports our revenue outlook for the current year.
In Surface Technologies, weaker-than-expected activity in North America significantly impacted our quarterly results and has led to a change in our business outlook. We no longer anticipate the recovery in North America completions activity we had originally forecasted back in December. We now expect completions to be down modestly versus the prior year. Outside of the Americas, our expectations remain unchanged for high single-digit to low double-digit activity growth.
Following a near record year of inbound orders in 2018, onshore/offshore delivered another strong quarterly inbound of $3.1 billion. Orders were more than double the revenues booked in the quarter. We inbounded 3 major onshore/offshore projects in the quarter, demonstrating the breadth of our capabilities in downstream and gas monetization as well as our geographic reach. This includes a reimbursable contract with ExxonMobil for the Beaumont refinery expansion in the United States as well as large offshore gas FPSO award for BP’s Greater Tortue project in West Africa. First quarter inbound also included the MIDOR refinery project in Egypt that we announced late last year. In addition to these projects, we have engaged in a number of agreements and investments in Saudi Arabia to support the growth we anticipate in both our onshore/offshore and Surface Technology segments. With strategic collaboration and local content development, we can further improve our competitive position and expand the market opportunity for TechnipFMC.
Moving to one of the largest market opportunities, the outlook for LNG remains strong for our company. The need for additional LNG infrastructure is well understood driven primarily by increasing demand for natural gas from Asia Pacific. With the next wave of LNG upon us, we will leverage our experience gained from our extensive list of reference projects, our incumbent positions in front end engineering design activities and our global client relationships.
When assessing the future opportunity set, we are tracking more than 20 projects in the global LNG market and see potential for significant new capacity to be sanctioned over the next 18 to 24 months. Of these, we are prioritizing 5 projects that are most strategic to TechnipFMC and offer the highest probability of successful execution. These 5 projects are with 5 different customers across 5 different countries with a minimum of 7 potential project partners. TechnipFMC is among the small number of contractors that can deliver these critical liquefaction facilities across the globe. We are well positioned to participate in this next wave.
Turning to Subsea, our integrated FEED capability in pipeline is a key differentiator for us and has been instrumental in securing the majority of our iEPCI awards. We have been working on iFEED studies now for nearly 4 years and have developed an extensive diversified set of project opportunities. In 2018, we sold a number of new iFEED studies, nearly double from the prior year with continued growth in 2019. Many of these are proprietary providing an exclusive opportunity set to TechnipFMC. The portfolio of iFEED studies continues to mature and we anticipate further conversion of iFEED studies into iEPCI project awards.
Taking a closer look at our portfolio of iEPCI projects, the strength and breadth of customer adoption has far exceeded our initial expectations. We have developed the largest and most diversified portfolio of integrated projects in the industry. In the first four months of 2019, we have secured 7 new iEPCI projects, 4 in the first quarter and 3 in the month of April, with additional awards anticipated very soon. We are proud to have further expanded our integrated portfolio with new projects from BP, Lundin, ENI and ConocoPhillips, all first-time iEPCI adopters. We are now forming new iEPCI alliances with the next generation of deepwater operators, including Lundin, Hurricane, Neptune and Energean, and we are working to secure additional agreements to further strengthen and differentiate our market position. These iEPCI alliances are incremental to our extensive list of more traditional alliance relationships, some of which date back more than two decades and set the foundation for much of the Subsea work we are executing today.
Let’s now consider how transformative the integrated model has been. We pioneered this commercial model and it is having a profound impact on our company and the broader Subsea landscape. It has clearly been disruptive and has challenged the industry to think and act differently. As the industry’s only fully integrated service provider, integrated provider of Subsea solutions, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend towards greater project integration. In 2018, iEPCI represented approximately 25% of our Subsea orders. And in 2019, we are confident that iEPCI will exceed 25%, which would also indicate a higher absolute level of integrated projects given our expectations for further order growth.
Another benefit of iEPCI projects is the ability to leverage our assets, most notably, our people, our manufacturing operations and our fleet. This will accelerate the recovery of our fleet utilization. In fact, the majority of iEPCI awards announced this year will have offshore campaigns beginning in 2020. Our innovative Subsea 2.0 platform brings further differentiation and continues to experience growing market acceptance. Since the beginning of 2018, 60% of our Subsea FEED studies have included Subsea 2.0 technology. We are tendering full Subsea 2.0 production systems and have already deployed Subsea 2.0 equipment. The outlook for the Subsea industry continues to improve. We are encouraged by the increased level of client engagement and project tendering. In the quarter, the majority of our awards came from a diversified mix of iEPCI projects as well as subsea services and alliance partner direct awards further highlighting our competitive differentiation.
Our updated Subsea opportunity slide reflects the positive trend for the broader deepwater market with growth in both the volume and value of Subsea projects. We are well positioned to capitalize on these market opportunities. Our company has returned to growth and our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from the continuing improvements we are experiencing in many of our key end markets. But in this cycle, we intend to do more than just position ourselves for a market recovery. As an industry, the oilfield services sector has displayed a similar pattern of behavior across many cycles, over-investing for a peak cycle scenario, deploying too much capital in undifferentiated assets and often depressing shareholder returns creating little, if any shareholder value. Our industry needs to prove to the investment community that it can invest in a disciplined manner, while offering the prospect of financial returns that exceed our cost of capital on a through-cycle basis.
For TechnipFMC, capital discipline starts with the balance sheet. We will ensure that we have sufficient capital to grow the business either through investment, new business awards or strategic M&A. We will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Our quarterly dividend currently yields over 2% and our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility for opportunistic share repurchase. And when these actions are combined with our strong operational execution, we can drive our capital returns higher over time.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss the financial results in more detail. Thanks, Doug. Strong order momentum throughout 2018 has accelerated in the first quarter. Total company backlog is now up 27% year-over-year to nearly $18 billion. The first quarter added more than $4 billion to our backlog for execution in 2020 and beyond, supporting our medium-term growth outlook. In the quarter, total company adjusted EBITDA was $296 million in the quarter and compares to $387 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined versus the prior year quarter to 10.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.06 when excluding after-tax charges and credit of $0.01 per diluted share.
Other pre-tax items impacting the quarter for which we do not provide guidance include the following: $85 million or $0.19 per diluted share related to an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners that is included in interest expense; $12 million or $0.02 per diluted share of foreign exchange loss included in corporate expense. We reported corporate expense of $72.6 million in the quarter excluding charges and credit. This also included the $12 million of foreign exchange losses. Full year guidance excluding FX remains unchanged. We reported $14.5 million of income tax expense in the quarter. Adjusted net income was negatively impacted by the reversal of a $40 million non-cash valuation allowance, which will benefit tax expense in future period. We continue to estimate our full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%.
Turning to our operational performance by segment, Subsea delivered first quarter revenues in line with prior year quarter. Modest growth in subsea services more than offset the forecasted decline in project revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8% is supportive of our full year guidance of at least 11%. The revenue decline in onshore/offshore versus the prior year quarter is a result of lower activity on major projects moving closer to completion, most notably Yamal LNG. Several key projects awarded in recent quarters are in the early stages of completion and are expected to contribute more significantly to revenue in subsequent quarters as projects mature.
We delivered robust margin performance of 14.6% as a result of strong project execution. And in Surface Technologies, the margin decline was driven by lower completions-related activity, onetime charges related to new product introduction and unfavorable product line mix in North America. Operating profit outside the Americas was negatively impacted by delays in shipments of backlog orders, now expected to be delivered throughout 2019.
In December, we provided our 2019 financial guidance for each of our business segments. At that time, our assumptions for Surface Technologies were predicated on sequential improvement in completions-related activity into North America over the course of 2019. However, North American activity declined further in the first quarter of 2019. Our completions related revenue experienced a sequential decline in the mid single-digits. We now expect completions-related activity for the remainder of the year to remain largely unchanged from current level. The reduced operator spending in North America has also negatively impacted pricing as the market adjusts to the excess product and service supply created by lower activity. This led to a revision in our business outlook for the North American market. Outside the Americas, our expectations remain unchanged. We anticipate high single-digit to low-double digit activity growth.
Given this updated market outlook, we are decreasing our 2019 revenue and margin guidance for Surface Technologies. We now anticipate revenue between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion and EBITDA margin of at least 12%. We are increasing our revenue and margin guidance in onshore/offshore. Given the strong first quarter inbound, we now forecast revenue in a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion in 2019. We are also raising onshore/offshore EBITDA margin guidance from at least 12% to at least 14% to reflect the good performance in the first quarter as well as our expectation for continued strength in project execution as we approach additional milestones on projects nearing completion. In Subsea, our 2019 financial guidance remains unchanged and it is well supported by the growth in backlog.
Turning to cash flow, we generated positive operating cash flow in the period of $121 million. The quarter benefited from the receipt of customer prepayments on key project awards. Yamal was a modest use of our operating cash flow in the period. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to be positive in 2019. And when excluding the impact of Yamal, cash flow from operations will approximate $400 million to $500 million. Beyond the operating line, we remain committed to disciplined capital investment and intend to meet our full year capital spend guidance of approximately $350 million. Included in the quarter was the closing of the dive support vessel transaction for $80 million. Since this was a sale leaseback transaction, we have netted the CapEx against the debt financing in the all other category as we have shown on our cash flow walk in Slide 13. We do not own the vessel, but it is consolidated within our financial statements as we retain control of the asset through the remainder of the lease term.
Other uses of cash in the quarter included share repurchase totaling $50 million in the quarter of which $33 million was settled in the period. I will also note that we declared another quarterly dividend of $0.13 in the period, a reduction in our net debt position of $336 million excluding the vessel financing, and a cash distribution of $175 million to our joint venture partners in the Yamal LNG project. In total, cash decreased modestly to $5 billion. We ended the period with net cash of $1 billion.
In closing, Subsea inbound further improved revenue coverage for the year before considering the addition of revenue for subsea services. Unannounced Subsea awards were consistent with the strong orders posted in Q4. And the success of our integrated model is increasingly evident as demonstrated by our 4 new iEPCI awards in the quarter. We raised 2019 revenue and margin guidance in onshore/offshore to reflect solid execution in inbound while lowering Surface Technologies guidance on a revised outlook for North American activity.
Total company backlog is now up 27% year-over-year. With this growth in backlog, we are preparing for broad-based improvement across the portfolio. We will remain disciplined in the spend to support this growth while leveraging our differentiated strategy and superior execution to deliver profitable growth and higher returns for all of our stakeholders.
Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Good morning. I think that’s me. A question starting off with Subsea, you are still guiding to minimum of 11% margins. You started off above that in the first quarter. Maryann, could you maybe talk about how to think about margin progression going forward? Does that mean we are going to dip below 11% in the next couple of quarters or is that still you being a little bit conservative? Do we think margins can kind of hold out in this level over the next couple of quarters, just help us think about that, please? Thanks, Jud. So as you know, our first quarter is typically our softest quarter just given the seasonality and so we typically see that top line declining. As we look at the inbound that we have seen and the revenue coverage, we certainly feel like our revenue guidance could trend toward the high end of that. As we talk about the EBITDA margin guidance strong performance, we would certainly expect to see a little bit of volatility as the projects move up and down, but we are highly confident of EBITDA margins of at least 11% in the period. Okay. I guess my follow-up is going to be kind of addressing the cash flow kind of progression going forward. Could you give us any additional color on how to think about timing for either the MRL or some of how Yamal will kind of flow through the cash flow statement? From a pacing standpoint, you have been pretty clear to some degree on the annual amount can you help us think about how things progress from a quarter-to-quarter basis at all? Sure, Jud. So in the quarter, you may have seen we actually did make a payment of approximately $175 million to our JV partners in the quarter. At this juncture, we do not have a planned payment for the balance of the year, but certainly the partners, have the ability to request that and so that is certainly a possibility for the balance of this year. As it relates to cash flow from operations, as I have shared with you before, on a full year basis, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be positive. Having said that, we expected probably the front end of our cash flow, the first half of the year, to be weaker than the back half of the year and that’s probably no different than what we are expecting again. So Q2, Q3, probably a little bit weaker and then obviously back half of the year, stronger, so a similar pattern, if you will to what we saw last year. Okay. So first quarter came in from an operating cash flow perspective was pretty good. So you still think that the front half of the year, a little more front-end loaded in terms of Yamal kind of working capital movements, so that’s still the case? Yes, we were quite successful. As you can imagine, working capital efficiency is a critical component and we had good success in the quarter. Obviously, some of the new inbound orders carried advance payments. We made good progress on the receivables, etcetera. But just given the progress on Yamal, as we have talked about continuing to progress that is probably still the case that we see. Okay, thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley. Hi, thanks. Yes, good morning. A question to Doug please picking up on that return on capital point that you made in the prepared remarks. Could we think about a little bit the capital intensity of the recovery from TechnipFMC side given obviously the strength in order intake? We note the emphasis on capital discipline, but ultimately, the question is how much leverage can your returns have or do you really need to refresh the asset base anytime soon? I think that would help understanding quite where return on capital can go as the cycle leads up? Thank you. Thank you, Rob and thank you to all of you that are on the phone today. We know today is a particularly heavy day in terms of companies that are reporting. So thank you for your interest in our company. Rob, you bring – you raise a very interesting point. One of the real benefits we have as an integrated company and the only integrated company is we have an opportunity to leverage the timing, the utilization of our fleet, which is the heaviest part or if you will the most capital intensive part of our business. So in other words, the manufacturing cadence feeds the installation and we can also do things that are quite unique as in let’s say doing – installing a tubing hanger and later coming back and installing the tree or the tubing hanger around the tree and later coming back and installing the manifold. When we operate under an iEPCI project, we manage that schedule, we manage that scope, we manage that cadence and therefore we create much greater leverage than we had historically or that our peers do when they operate as independent companies or through an alliance. So, this is a real benefit that we have already been – that we have begun to experience in the projects that we have delivered, three of those full cycle to-date. We see that benefit within the way that we operate. In addition to that, as we move more towards the deployment – or further deployment of our new Subsea 2.0 technology, this technology, we have a much greater throughput through the same manufacturing capacity because of the way and the simplification and the way that the equipment was designed for manufacturability that allows us to really drive an improved performance to our facilities. So, we do indeed anticipate increased leverage. Thank you. Thanks very much, Doug. And if I can just follow-up on the same theme, you mentioned many of the awards in Subsea filling out utilization for 2020 and I understand that 2021 and maybe even beyond are also filling. Could you maybe talk a little bit to how you are load out, if that’s the right way to think about it for both the equipment and the vessel side is looking for these outer years as it stands today? Thank you. Thanks, Rob. So, two things, one, when we do an iEPCI project and we use Subsea 2.0 technology, we are able to accelerate the time to first oil throughout the entire schedule. So if we can do that, we can bring the installation portion of the contract earlier than it would normally be done under a conventional contract. So, that’s one benefit and that’s why on these iEPCI projects, we begin to see early inbound award in the first quarter. As was clearly stated, we had an absolutely spectacular first quarter and we are saying, we will see some of that, not all of that, but some of that installation activity, begin to occur in 2020. Typically, that would not have occurred until 2021 on a conventional Subsea project. So, that’s the benefit of the iEPCI is that we can bring some of that forward. Indeed, when you get to 2021, you start to see from an industry point of view, you start to see the level of utilization of assets start to increase quite significantly. We have and we will continue to partner very well and work well with others as a way to ensure that we prioritize first and foremost our iEPCI activity, but then to ensure that we have access to the right capability to be able to ensure our continued success. Thanks, Doug. I will turn it over. Our next question is from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. James, it’s possible you could be muted. Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me now? Very well. Thank you, James. Okay, perfect. Good morning, Doug. Good morning, Maryann. So Doug, great comments from both of you around corporate governance, focus on returns, curious though one of the things that we can’t glean from proxies and other things is you say you pushed this down to the business levels, which we totally agree with are necessary to drive this at the whole company. Could you maybe go in a little more detail on exactly how that’s done if they are ranked against the same performance metrics that we see in your disclosures? Sure, James. Thank you for the question. So you are right, you see the NEOs in the commentary that we made. In our UK remuneration report, there is some additional detail, but let me provide some additional granularity for you. We take all of the top leaders of the company, so everybody that’s basically operating a P&L statement down to the business unit level, so that’s quite a few people, share the same objective as we share when it comes to driving returns and improving returns in the company. I think that’s quite critical, because if it’s only the corporate team or the executive team, you begin to get a disconnect in the organization and it actually can create a bit of confusion and it doesn’t allow you to achieve the optimum results. So, we felt quite strongly when we created TechnipFMC that we would instill that culture and that behavior all the way through all those responsible for not only improving the returns and the turns on our assets, but also as they look at investment ensuring that we are making the right decisions. So indeed, it is shared and it goes quite deep within our organization. Perfect. I 100% agree with that strategy. And then I guess the follow-up here, not related to the returns question, but for the Subsea business, obviously, a huge quarter this quarter, more to come in Subsea this year, perhaps not the same types of massive levels, but how is the overall margin profile roll into the backlog? And at this point, is the behavior in the market still fairly disciplined or is there some – maybe some pricing leverage coming through? I understand and of course the iEPCI awards probably come in at a better margin, because it’s much more of a partnership and that’s growing, so hopefully that is, but maybe with the other more competitive projects, so what are you guys seeing on pricing? Yes, James. And indeed, you summarized it quite accurately and I am going to answer the – if you will, the second part first. In terms of our strategy, clearly being able to work as we have through an early engagement, through an integrated FEED study with our clients and often on an exclusive basis where we have a shared objective on project returns and when we meet that threshold, that the project is then direct awarded to our company is obviously a favorable position to be in. Now, why is that important? In 2019, we have secured 100% of all iEPCI awards, 100%. Of those awards that we have received, approximately 90% have been direct awarded to our company or said it different way, there was only one that was not a direct award. So clearly, James, that’s the way – that gives us a huge advantage as opposed to being exposed 100% to the competitive market. Those iEPCI awards are coming close to over 40% to 50% of our total award value coming from iEPCIs thus far in the year. So it’s quite a huge impact.
Now, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we did have a couple of other announced – we did have two announced awards that were not – that were competitively tendered that were not iEPCI projects and then there is the unannounced awards, again, many of those being direct awarded by our alliance partners. But those other two awards, I mean, it is still quite competitive. Although looking forward as was asked earlier by Rob, we all do the same planning for our assets, people and project managers as well as capital assets, manufacturing capability to ensure that we can deliver the most successful projects to our customers. And as you start to look forward you see where that is becoming, if you will, the utilization rates are improving or the under absorption is decreasing depending upon how you look at it. So, there is a behavioral shift that is occurring and we are glad to see that. We said we would be patient. We would not load up our capacity on those more competitively priced tenders and we did just that. I will be candid with you. It made 2018 a little lighter at times than what we were seeing from some of our peers, but we knew we had this proprietary opportunity set. We kept saying all we had to do was to convert that and you’re seeing us do that. That’s a timing issue because you have to get through the FEED study. The project has to be then sanctioned by the client before it’s direct awarded as an iEPCI, but it was a huge advantage of us. And when we took that strategic direction, we stood firm and we’re now seeing the benefit of it. So that will continue to be our strategy. There’s going to be more iEPCI awards that we’ll be announcing. Okay perfect. Thanks, Doug. Our next question is coming from the line of James Evans from Exane Paribas. James, perhaps the mute? Apologies, apologies. Second James - James Evans from Exane BNP Paribas. I’ve got a couple. Firstly, just sort of digging into the detail, I mean, I noticed a big reorganization charge in onshore/offshore. It seems a bit surprising to me given great margin performance, the growth that was coming through. So, can you talk a little bit about what you’re doing there in that business? And then secondly, on Surface, I think one of the things that you’ve mentioned as being an impact in Q1 was the cost of introducing a new product there. Could you just give a bit more detail about what it is that you’re introducing; if this is going to be significant to you on a more positive slant going forward? Thanks. Thanks, James. Let me start with the Surface question and because I think it is really important that we address this. Look, I take full responsibility. The results in the first quarter related to our Surface business were unacceptable. It was 3 distinct things that came together. One was the market, the lack of a market recovery. As you may recall, when we provided our guidance, we actually provided a graph that showed our expectations of the completions-related activity that we had built into our forecast and therefore, our planning related to the market. That has not occurred. And as a matter of fact, we do not expect that to occur now for the remainder of the year. So, we’re making the necessary adjustments as a result of that, but that was a very material impact. The second area that impacted us in the quarter was the behavior by our pressure pumping customers. As you have heard many of those already report so far this season and probably a consistent theme throughout has been the fact that they are either idling assets or removing assets from the fleet. It is true that, that affects the product mix, if you will, for us. We are a leading provider of the high-pressure consumables for the hydraulic fracturing industry and our clients are the pressure pumping customers. So as their behavior modified quite dramatically, just within a period of couple of months, that had a very significant impact on our business. One thing we know is that that’s a cyclical business and that, that will that will be those assets will need to be replenished. That equipment is consumable. It needs to be inspected, maintained, repaired and replaced. And as the activity recovers, that business, which is a very strong business for us, will recover as well. And then finally, we had an issue with a new product. It was actually an upgrade to an existing product that we were introducing into the market. And we got ahead of ourselves and we allowed our cost to get ahead of ourselves on that market introduction. We’re now addressing that, but that had an impact in the quarter, in the latter stages of the quarter that required us to be able to make some adjustments. So, it was really those three things coming together, James, that really led to the results. We’re making the adjustments that are required and we will and as we identified in our guidance, we will certainly see an improvement from where we are. If you back off those kinds of one-off items, as I’ve indicated, particularly the ones around the product introduction, it had a significant impact in the quarter. So, we’ll get the margins back up, but we did have to lower the full year guidance and that was lowered as a result of the market activity. James, Maryann here. I think your question was what was the charge and the adjustment in onshore/offshore for reorganization. So in the period, we completed a change in the business model, in the business partnership that we were using to access a particular market in onshore/offshore, and so we closed out that business model and there were final payments to complete that structure so that we can now enter this jurisdiction with a different manner. That also will lead us to be able to have greater opportunity and growth in that particular region as well, so all-in-all, really a positive business restructuring for onshore/offshore to allow them to more effectively compete in a particular jurisdiction. Okay. And at the risk of sneaking an extra one in, I just want to ask Rob’s question in a slightly different way about returns, and I guess the question with the CapEx is, say, $350 million to $400 million, is that a sustainable level even with the growth that you see over the next 2 to 3 years in your end markets? Obviously, James, it’s a function of the growth rate and it’s something that we’re monitoring and forecasting, but we are going to continue to be very prudent stewards in terms of the way that we address both CapEx and just overall, the way that we address our capital across the company. We are quite again, pleased with this new business model. It gives us just an enormous amount of capability in terms of the timing, the utilization, the phasing of the utilization. It’s a very different world we live in and we’re liking it very much and we’re learning from it. And the more we learn from it, the more we realize how much leverage that we have. That being said we will always ensure that we have the highest level of assets available for our people to perform their activities in the most safe and efficient manner to create success for our clients. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your question please. Thank you. Doug, how should we think about the cadence of revenue in on-off as we go through the year? I mean in the first quarter revenue came up short versus our model. As you noted, Yamal and other legacy projects starting to wind down, but you also moved up the guidance for the full year. And so, I think a point of concern for investors has been trying to model that wind down of Yamal and evaluating how much new inbound can backfill some of that revenue EBITDA. So, with the new guidance, how should we interpret that with respect to the interplay of Yamal wind down, typical seasonality in the business and then the replenishment of the new project revenue? Thanks, Sean. I appreciate the question. I want to just take us put it frame it a little bit. In the past 5 quarters, in that business, we have strategically targeted and inbounded over $10 billion of new opportunities, $10.5 billion to be exact. And if you take the BAPCO project and you actually take the full value of the BAPCO project, you’re closer to $12 billion in 5 quarters. That was really important and we worked really, really hard and I’m really proud of the team. We stayed focused. We stayed strategic. We only focused on those projects that we had laid out, that we had shared with you and your colleagues quite a while ago, I guess, 2 years ago now. And we delivered on that, and actually, exceeded our original expectation. So that’s what we’re seeing. Sean, we now have the opportunity, the first big award of that $10.5 billion, excluding the fully consolidated BAPCO, which gets you closer to $12 billion was back in the even in the first quarter of last year. So, we’re seeing that now turn to revenue and we’re seeing the projects that we secured throughout the quarters last year turn into revenue. And even our most recent major award that we announced, which was MIDOR, as you know, we started activity on that actually in the fourth quarter. So that’s what you’re seeing. You’re seeing us strategically ensure that we were providing that continuity and that bridge, if you will, to the next wave of LNG. So, all of that $10.5 billion plus that I have referred to was ex-LNG, that was all a function of downstream, particularly petrochemical refining as well as fertilizer. And we went after those projects. We got them. We were strategically positioned, most being direct awards or projects where we had done the FEED study and had a significant advantage in terms of de-risking the project and that’s what we are out there executing today. In the meantime, our commercial team is active looking at other opportunities. I remind you, in the prepared remarks, we talked about the ExxonMobil BLADE project in the U.S., a fully reimbursable downstream project and they’re also out there looking to grow our next opportunities in LNG. We’re not we’re going to be remain very focused. We’re going to target those projects that we believe we can be most successful on, and we think we have a really high-quality list of projects that we’re working and maturing as we speak. That’s very helpful, Doug. In a somewhat related topic, net contract liability looked pretty flat sequentially in the quarter. So, at the bottom of the cycle, we’ve seen cash outflows, some closing out projects and as you pointed out, you booked some very large projects here and there are more coming. How would you characterize the interplay between payouts of legacy projects versus progress payments on new projects in terms of how has the interplay impacted the numbers that we’ve seen so far? And how should that trend in the next few quarters and years? Sure, thanks. It’s Maryann. So yes, you’re right. We saw a bit of leveling on the contract liabilities even with some new inbounds coming in. Keep in mind that some of the larger projects, in particular, Yamal LNG, as they come to closure, those contract liabilities will be extinguished, right? So, we would see a reduction of those contract liabilities happening as we reach closer and closer to completion. One of the things that we know as we reach project completion on many projects, our ability to avoid risk is a positive because those contract liabilities will get extinguished either 1 of 2 ways. We’re either going to pay a third party or a vendor in terms of cost or if we are able to mitigate that risk and not incur it, then that will remain as incremental profitability. If you take the Yamal project as an example, if we are able to do that going forward, 50% of that extinguishment of that liability will actually wind up as profitability to TechnipFMC. So, you can expect some unwinding of that liabilities this year, particularly as some of these projects close to completion move along to their completion curve. Here you go. Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Guillaume Delaby from Societe Generale. Maybe, I would say, nearly a chronological follow-up on the previous question. I’d just like to come back to the old debate I had with another analyst about the Yamal cliff. Basically, could you give us what might be your most recent steer regarding the end of the Yamal project? Is it planned, I would say, by mid-H1 2020? Could you provide some more color on that, please? Sure. So, as you know, we certainly have some work to do in the balance of 2019. As we reach 2020, we’ll be headed toward project completion. But keep in mind, we do have a bit of warranty left on that project. So, for 2020, I think you can assume that we will still have some work to complete on Yamal, not quite done, but most of the project completion should happen largely in 2019 with the exception of warranty later in that project. Okay very clear. Thank you, Maryann. Our next question is from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Hi good afternoon. Doug, you guys have done a great job laying out the outlook and the business dynamics and how you guys are differentiating your efforts on a number of different fronts. And what I would like to do is maybe circle back on the Subsea 2.0, the iEPCI dynamics. And I know in prior discussions, we have had over the course of the past 12 months, 15 months, as you’ve been rolling out the strategy, is some of the challenges that you may have been facing in having discussions with customers and saying, okay, look, this is a very significant value proposition that we’re providing to you and I’m sure the pushback was, yes, that’s great, but I can go across the street to company XYZ and get this at X price. So now that you’ve been able to penetrate the market further that you’ve been able to demonstrate the value proposition and book more awards with a broader number of customers, is it becoming easier to get better pricing on these iEPCI contracts and basically, breaking this glass ceiling that you traditionally maybe had to deal with on kind of a 3 Bid and a Buy process? Any insights on that would be really helpful. Kurt, thank you. I agree with everything you said and trying to be not overly dramatic, but I believe we shattered the glass ceiling this quarter and this was the quarter that we were really waiting for to demonstrate that to you and to your colleagues. It does take some time, but success breeds success. And what we were able to do on the first 3 fully integrated projects that were delivered full cycle and the feedback from our clients to the community, to their shareholders and to the broader industry, has really created a significant amount of momentum. Likewise, we had to mature some of these FEED studies that we’ve been working on and that’s why you just can’t replicate it overnight. It’s not just about forming a relationship. You have to be working on – these things take quite a period of time to actually do the work, but we had to move from the theoretical. And it is true, Kurt, we were living in a theoretical world for quite some time, where we were demonstrating on paper, through FEED studies or other vehicles, that there should be and could be and would be value in the project delivery. But now that we have moved past that and actually have the actual case studies and have been able to show that and have 2 of our clients are calling their first projects that were done with this model, their most successful Subsea projects done to date, builds a tremendous amount of credibility. They’d come back as repeat clients. Just this quarter, we announced 4 new clients. We are moving clients from existing traditional alliance relationships, which is another word of saying they were really around the Subsea equipment as many people know to now making them and converting them to full iEPCI alliances and with many of the next generation of Subsea clients coming in, they’re going directly into iEPCI alliances and that’s something that I think is really important.
I talked about it on my prepared remarks, but we now have Lundin, Hurricane, Energean and Neptune, just in a quarter’s time and there is going to be more of those iEPCI alliances that we’re going to be announcing going forward. That makes a big difference and this gives us a tremendous amount of momentum, Kurt. We think it’s important and it’s not just important for the success of our company. It’s important for the success of our industry and we’re proud when we see other people follow this direction because it’s what’s going to make Subsea a sustainable investment for our clients going forward. Great. I think that’s awesome. Now with the context and with the value proposition that it is providing to the oil companies, I was also curious as to how you think this has reduced their let’s say, their threshold their economic threshold on a Brent price, let’s say. And I know as well when you guys launched this business dynamic, that you suggested that it could even wind up pulling some projects off the shelf because of the value proposition. So, I was wondering if you’d give us some insights on that as well. Sure, Kurt, and indeed, it has. Some of the projects that we’ve announced, we often get the phone call from other people in the industry or from people in the investment community saying, we hadn’t had that one on our tracking list, where did that one come from? Well, it often came from a bucket of projects that our clients have that they had a strategic interest in moving forward, but they didn’t have an economic a viable economic model in which to move it forward. And when you put the combination of Subsea 2.0 technology and our iEPCI-integrated offering together, we can help unlock that potential. So, it makes a big difference and it creates both momentum in the order rate and it also creates, if you will, some additional opportunities that would not have been there otherwise. So again, it’s a tremendous amount of hard work being done by many, many dedicated women and men that’s creating these opportunities. It’s early engagement. It’s intimate relationships. We’re building on a really solid foundation as we move this forward. Great. And if I may just have a housekeeping question, maybe for you Maryann, on the financials, you mentioned that the corporate expense and guidance doesn’t change for the full year. If you do back out that FX from the corporate expense number, the first quarter would be about $16 million, which would mean the run rate for the rest of the year, we’d have to probably take it down to get you that $160 million to $170 million kind of full year. Is that, am I thinking about that the right way vis-à-vis the first quarter and the guidance for the full year? Yes, Kurt, you are. When we gave our guidance, as we always have, for corporate $160 million to $170 million on a full year basis, we always exclude FX. So yes, you’re absolutely right. That’s the way that we would expect to see things unfold for the balance of the year. And then on CapEx, the $350 million, does that exclude the vessel? It does, Kurt. Okay thank you very much. Appreciate that. And maybe, Kurt, if I can give you a little bit of color on that, just to be sure that you’re clear on the way that it’s handled. If you take it to the cash flow, you can obviously see the vessel included in the CapEx. There was no cash outflow associated with the vessel in the period. So, we are trying to show you, if you will, kind of what that pro forma looks like. It’s a sale leaseback and so because we have control over that vessel, we have to consolidate that. So just wanted to be sure that, that was clear, hopefully, that answers your question but feel free to come back to me. Yes, that helps. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks, Doug. Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilson from Jefferies. Your question please. Okay thank you. Good morning. Very good color so far, in fact, my question on CapEx has actually just answered straightaway there, but I will just check on that if you see any other additions to the fleet required in the medium term. And then the second point and you may not have given this, but I just wanted to check if you said, Doug, what are those five targeted projects you are looking at in onshore/offshore, if you haven’t given that guidance, that’s fine, obviously? Okay, Mark, and I’m glad we were able to answer the first part of your CapEx question. The second part, look, within that $350 million capital budget, there are certain upgrades that we’ll be doing to the fleet. Again, I repeat what I said earlier. We’re always going to ensure that our dedicated women and men have the best assets in the industry in which to work with and work from and to deliver our projects. Our requirement for additional CapEx beyond the CapEx to maintain and enhance and improve and upgrade the fleet, again, will be a function of our opportunity list as we look forward and our preferred path to be able to work very closely and work well with the rest of the industry. This goes a little bit back to my comment, I made, at the end of my prepared remarks. The industry needs to start thinking and acting differently. And if we all build CapEx or capacity or be it the vessel fleet or manufacturing capacity or anything else, are all based on individually peak capacity of the peak cycle of the market, we know what will happen. We’ll destroy returns once again through another cycle. We are going to step forward and we’re going to act differently and that’s what we are demonstrating in our behavior. And we think it’s the right thing to do and we trust that it will be recognized and will be rewarded accordingly. We partner really, really well with people, both with our clients, with other providers as well as with our suppliers. That’s the type of company we are and we believe that’s a way to create leverage and create success. I have not named to your second question I have not named the 5 strategic LNG projects. We do obviously have strategic projects in downstream that we’re also pursuing. But what I’ve said is that of the 20 that we are actively engaged in on LNG prospects, 5 of those, we have considered to be strategic. I have not named those 5 and would prefer not to, but let me tell you this, those 5, they’re pretty well known because either we’re the incumbent and it’s a direct negotiation or we’re doing the FEED study today. Only in 1 case are we not the incumbent or doing the FEED study and we’re working with a very good set of others partners to be able to pursue that project and it’s a very keen project for us. We’ll see how it plays out. Obviously, we’re looking at the other 15 as well, 15 plus, but we have 5 that we are prioritizing and that we have made strategic, we have put on our strategic list, and we hope to see and expect to see some of those projects begin to move forward. That’s very clear. Thank you and good luck going forward. Our last question comes from the line of Bertrand Hodee from Kepler Cheuvreux. Go ahead please. Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may. The first one on the 5 LNG projects, so Doug, I know that you’re not going to list the 5, but they, I guess, are pretty obvious to us. Can you share with us not the name, but what could be the total value you are looking at? And also, would you have the capabilities internally to execute those 5? Because on my thinking, those 5 are very well advanced, most of them have completed the FEED and all the partners are really trying to go ahead and to finalize the offtake as soon as possible so in order to be able to sanction them. And my second question will relate more to the Subsea and the comment you earlier made on utilization rates, given your success in iEPCI. Can you do you believe that going back to 65% next year is achievable, if you’re able to continue to secure orders given that, I guess, the trough you guided for a utilization rate in ‘19 would be around 55%? Thank you, Bertrand. Let’s start with the LNG question. So, I have not given the total value for the 5 projects. I did that when we were targeting some LNG or some downstream projects, but with LNG projects, as you know, it depends which scope we provide as a company versus the total scope. And that’s one of the ways to your second question, that we manage our capacity. So, in certain cases, we maybe the lead, in other cases, we maybe we may not be the lead on a project. We may do the trains. We may do the utilities and infrastructure. It just depends how we actually manage our resources to be able to ensure that our contribution to the project and the overall project will be a success. In general though, you are talking about it depends on the number of trains, but you are looking in the range of $3 billion to $10 billion per project. Some of them are smaller. As you know, one of the projects that’s being contemplated right now is an expansion project to add a single train and others are greenfield projects to add to that would start off with 2 or 3 trains. So, it really just depends on those projects. And again, the way we manage our capacity is to manage the scope. We have demonstrated historically, the ability to be able to cover, and not only just cover, but successfully deliver 2 to 3 LNG projects simultaneously. I remind you that’s what we are delivering now is 3 simultaneous LNG projects that we are currently engaged in as we speak. So I think that’s a good rule of thumb. I would agree and we have no intention of stretching our resources in order to try to cover more than we feel we are capable of doing. That is probably one of the biggest mistakes that companies make and that the industry has made in the past and we will not allow us to do that. The leadership of the GBU has been steadfast and focused on ensuring around selectivity that we have the right projects and the right resources, which starts with the right project manager and the right project director office to ensure that we can deliver the most successful projects. So, we’ll continue to do that and we’ll make sure that we don’t overextend ourselves. Always better to have more opportunities and not less opportunities and, therefore, one can be more selective. Moving on to your Subsea question, the short answer is yes. It’s not a slam dunk. Certain things need to work in our favor and the timing needs to be sequenced, but as we look forward, we could see getting back to 65% utilization of our fleet in 2020. Many thanks. Thank you. And now I am turning the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer. Go ahead, sir. This concludes our first quarter conference call.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call.
One month ago, we announced the resolution of investigations into Conduct dating back over a decade ago resulting in a settlement of $301 million with authorities in the United States and Brazil. This brings to close the compliance matters under investigation by all U.S. and Brazilian authorities. This Conduct taken by former employees does not reflect the core values of our company.
We have zero tolerance for such behavior and are committed to doing business the right way. Our foundational belief of integrity dictates how we operate everywhere all the time. In recognition of our robust compliance program, there will not be a monitor assigned to the company in conjunction with this settlement and we expect no impact to our ongoing business operations.
Turning to our business highlights, strong order momentum continued throughout the second quarter. At over $11 billion, total company inbound orders represent an unprecedented level setting a new record for our company. Subsea orders of $2.6 billion were in line with the robust levels experienced in the first quarter.
In fact, Subsea orders for the first half of the year exceeded the levels achieved in all of 2018 and we are well positioned for full year Subsea order growth of over 50% when compared to the prior year.
For onshore/offshore, second quarter inbound of $8.1 billion was also unprecedented, a new record for this business segment. The award of Arctic LNG 2 drove quarterly inbound orders to levels that exceeded all of 2018 in the second quarter alone.
And the impact of the strong first half orders to our backlog is substantial with total company backlog approaching $26 billion, an increase of more than 75% from year end. This remarkable growth in backlog provides us with even greater confidence in our 2019 outlook, which we have revised higher today as a result of the continued strength in inbound and operational execution.
The new order backlog received in the period also provides improved visibility as we look to 2020 and beyond. Over the last 18 months, there has been considerable market focus on the LNG wave. The LNG market growth continues to be underpinned by the structural shift towards natural gas as an energy transition fuel helping to meet the increasing demand for energy while lowering greenhouse gases.
Our demonstrated leadership in this important growth market will continue as we anticipate additional LNG awards in the coming quarters. There is a structural transformation called iEPCI that is occurring within the Subsea industry as a result of the creation of TechnipFMC. This paradigm shift was pioneered by our company resulting in an entirely new commercial model that creates value for both the operator and ourselves.
This unique integrated capability is now having a material impact on both the total market and our business. We have seen growth in integrated award activity every year since our introduction of this model in 2015.
The industry remains on track for continued growth in 2019 having exceeded $3 billion in integrated project awards in the first half of the year and we are referencing actual project awards as opposed to feed studies that simply have the potential to convert into an award.
Even more compelling is the fact that TechnipFMC has secured two-thirds of all integrated projects awarded over this time with that number reaching 100% for the first six months of 2019. During the quarter, we were awarded our largest integrated Subsea project today for Anadarko’s Golfinho development in Mozambique.
Mozambique is frontier region in the development of hydrocarbons, significant offshore natural gas reserves have made the country a clear beneficiary of increasing LNG demand. TechnipFMC was a first mover in Mozambique and this award further strengthens our leadership position in the region.
For the country’s initial LNG development, we are progressing well with the construction of a floating LNG structure, the first for Africa and third for our company.
On this same project, we are also executing contracts for much of the Subsea scope. And now we are honored to have been selected by Anadarko to execute the country’s next Subsea development using our unique integrated model.
These projects are all benefiting from our expanded local presence having opened the first oil and gas engineering center in Maputo earlier this year and we will make further investments to ensure we have the capabilities needed for continued participation in the country’s expanding set of opportunities by further developing a local expertise.
Golfinho is our solar first project undertaken in strategic collaboration with Allseas. This partnership enables enhanced access to world-class opportunities like Golfinho for both companies. We view this approach as the most efficient way to secure access to complementary assets and delivery capabilities while avoiding significant capital investment and driving through cycle returns.
Most importantly, the Golfinho award is a part of the broader structural trend towards greater levels of integration on Subsea projects. We have clearly seen an acceleration in market adoption since the first project was awarded in 2016 with this year’s activity representing 20% of all Subsea industry awards.
For TechnipFMC, the impact of iEPCI has been even more profound. Integrated projects exceeded 50% of our inbound orders in the first half of 2019. More broadly, the integrated model has been adopted across multiple regions and with multiple clients.
Several integrated awards have come as a result of our iEPCI alliances which can lead to new market opportunities, most of which are exclusive to TechnipFMC and subject to achievement of targeted financial returns.
Today, we are proud to announce our latest iEPCI alliance with Wintershall DEA, one of the largest E&P operators in Europe. This further expands our already successful partnership by creating additional value through integrated feed, integrated iEPCI and integrated life of field services for the newly formed Wintershall DEA.
In the second quarter, we inbounded the Arctic LNG 2 EPC contract. We are honored by the confidence and trust of Novatek and the opportunity to contribute to this exciting development. This is Novatek’s second major LNG project in the Arctic region and an example and an award that exemplifies our experience in the delivery of large-scale modularized fabrication for harsh environments.
The project will bring onstream nearly 20 million metric tons per annum of new capacity comprising of three LNG trains on gravity-based structures. This is an innovative engineering solution we worked on extensively during the feed stage of this project. We will leverage our recent successes from Yamal LNG through the continuity of leadership, execution model and lessons learned.
We will also benefit from our extensive experience in complex module fabrication and integration obtained from projects such as floating LNG, and gas FPSOs that utilize a confined footprint. The detailed engineering scope is well advanced and procurement activities will continue to ramp as long lead items are being ordered.
The execution phase of the project will extend for several years with launch of the first stream currently expected in 2023. Looking ahead, the future LNG opportunity set remains substantial; we continue to be very selective focusing on a strategic set of projects that we are pursuing today, some of which could reach FID over the next 18 to 24 months.
In closing, this was a very strong quarter for TechnipFMC. The unprecedented level of order activity experienced in the quarter demonstrates that we are winning with an intense focus on project selectivity, and commercial differentiation.
Operationally, total company revenue increased 16% versus the prior year to $3.4 billion with growth in all three business segments. And total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% versus the prior year to $450 million highlighted by the notable strength in onshore/offshore and sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins for both Subsea and surface technologies.
The strength of these results and significant growth in backlog across all segments is assuming greater confidence that we will achieve our increased full year guidance and provides us with improved visibility as we look to 2020 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann, who will cover the financial results. Thanks, Doug. We are very pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to benefit from both strong execution, as well as risk mitigation on several of our key major projects. This is evident in our total company and segment results.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $450 million and compares to $377 million in the prior year quarter with an increase in adjusted EBITDA margins to 13.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.39 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.18 per diluted share. Total after-tax charges and credits were $78.6 million, primarily related to legal provisions, business integration costs and severance charges.
The legal provisions which net to $55.2 million in the period including the – included the following: if $70 million provision to maintain a probable estimate for the settlement of an investigation related to historical projects in Equatorial Guinea and Ghana.
A $21.3 million charge related to the final settlement with the U.S. and Brazilian authorities to resolve investigations related to Brazil and Unaoil; and a net litigation credit that included a favorable settlement for a commercial dispute.
Adjusted earnings per share also includes other pretax items impacting the quarter for which we do not provide guidance. These include $140 million or $0.31 per diluted share related to an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners that is included in interest expense; and $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share of foreign exchange losses included in corporate expense.
On an after-tax basis, these two items total $0.34 per diluted share and again, these items are included in our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.39.
Turning to our operational performance by segment. Subsea delivered second quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, an increase of 24% versus the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased project activity, including work associated with recent iEPCI award.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3% primarily driven by strong project execution and further risk mitigation on projects nearing completion. Therefore utilization in the second quarter was 69% in line with the prior year quarter.
In onshore/offshore, EBITDA margins improved to 18.7%, a 600 basis point improvement from the prior year results. This outperformance on full year guidance was driven by continued strength in execution and risk mitigation most notably on the Yamal LNG project. Further, we benefited from the receipt of an incremental bonus for successful completion on key milestones on Yamal train 3.
And in Surface Technologies, revenue of $421 million increased 5% versus the prior year quarter driven by higher wellhead sales globally and frac rental services in North America partially offset by reduced flow line sales.
The decline in North America completions activity resulted in weaker pricing and unfavorable product-line mix negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA margins. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 7% from the first quarter as growth continued outside of North America where activity is trending towards low-double-digit growth.
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased more than 340 basis points to 11.1%. Our margins reflect the actions we took to address the internal items that impacted our first quarter results. The challenges faced in North America market remains. However, the underlying improvement in operational performance helped our margins recover sequentially.
Turning to cash flow, we generated positive operating cash flow in the period of $97 million benefiting from the receipt of customer prepayments and key project awards. We have now generated positive operating cash flow in each of the last four quarters.
Beyond the operating line, we remain disciplined with our capital spend. Capital expenditures were $92 million in the period and we remain on track to meet full year guidance of approximately $350 million excluding the impact of the sale leaseback transaction of $80 million we recorded in the first quarter for the Dive Support Vessel.
We ended the period with a net cash of $840 million. Given the strength of the first half and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we have increased confidence in meeting our full year guidance for positive cash flow from operations. Looking to the back half of the year, we will incur $164 million in cash payments related to the settlements with the authorities in the U.S. and Brazil in the third quarter.
However, we also expect there will be additional prepayments associated with expected inbound awards. While the timing of operating cash flow will vary by quarter, we do expect the second half in total to be positive.
This quarter we have shared additional disclosures for the Yamal LNG joint venture in Exhibit 6 of our earnings release. As a reminder, we consolidate 100% of the JV in our financial statements although our ownership is just over 50%.
When we think about the future profit of this project, we look at contract liabilities as an approximate for revenue. At the end of Q2, these amounted to $1.7 billion. As we reach project completion, this amount will be extinguished in one or two ways as cost paid to vendors or as profits for our partners and for us.
Looking ahead to the rest of 2019, we expect to reduce this liability by approximately $400 million to $500 million. If we continue to execute well, as we have done for each of the last ten quarters, a significant portion of this amount would become incremental profit shared between our partners and us.
For all of 2020, we anticipate another reduction of $400 million to $500 million in contract liabilities. The remaining balance post 2020 would be available to fulfill any warranty obligations that may arise. And should we continue to see strong execution, these anticipated reductions in the liability should also result in incremental profit versus incremental cost.
Similarly, with the warranty period, the absence of warranty claims would also generate incremental profit. Once we have recognized profit, we record our partner share as a mandatory redeemable liability of the call of the MRLs.
The current balance of the MRL is $413 million. We expect to pay the majority of this current MRL balance in the second half of the year when combined with the first half payments to our partners of $221 million. 2019 will be the highest level of partner distributions for the project in any one year. We will see a significant step down in payments in 2020.
Turning to our 2019 financial guidance, given the strong first half inbound, we now forecast Subsea revenue of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion for the full year 2019 versus previous guidance of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. We are also revising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to at least 11.5% versus previous guidance of at least 11%.
The revision is driven by the strength and execution in the first six months of the year and driven by the achievement of the milestones on certain projects. For onshore/offshore, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from at least 14% to at least 16.5% to reflect the strong first half results, as well as our expectations for continued strength in the second half of the year.
We are also reducing our expectations for net interest expense. We now expect net interest expense to be in a range of $30 million to $40 million for the full year excluding the impact of the MRL versus the previous guidance range of $40 million to $60 million. This revision is primarily driven by higher than anticipated interest income earned on our cash balances.
We have modified our tax rate guidance to 26% to 30% for the full year. The rate now includes the discrete adjustments primarily associated with the valuation allowance recovery, it provides the ability to use tax assets in certain jurisdictions in the future.
And finally, we have now achieved the remaining $50 million in synergies related to our merger winning the total synergies to our commitment of $450 million.
In closing, this was a very strong quarter for TechnipFMC. Our operating results demonstrated strong execution and risk mitigation in both Subsea and onshore/offshore and a significant sequential improvement in the operational performance of Surface Technologies despite the challenges faced in North America market.
Order inbound momentum accelerated in the second quarter. We achieved a record total company book-to-bill of 3.3 supported by an acceleration in integrated awards including our largest iEPCI to-date Golfinho and our largest single project inbound to-date, Arctic LNG 2.
All these factors give us even greater confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year which is reflected in our upgraded guidance for both our Subsea and onshore/offshore segments. While total company backlog growth of 80% from the year end provides us with much improved visibility, we look beyond 2019.
Operator, you may now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Angeline Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good morning, Doug and Maryann. First, congratulations on a very impressive quarter and a really amazing first start to the year on your inbound order. Thank you very much, Angie. You are welcome. So, on the integrated Subsea awards and just Subsea awards in general, certainly, this model works and very few can compete with what you are offering at TechnipFMC.
So, we think about the pace of inbound Subsea orders into the second half of 2019 and even the pace into 2020 given this very strong order rate here in the first half. Do you think that we will see some slowing in inbound orders in the second half of 2019 first? And then if we think about 2020, could 2020 be as strong as 2019 as far as inbound total Subsea orders? Thank you very much, Angie. And just before I start, I wanted to recognize all of you who have participating on the call today. I realize it’s a bit of a, I guess, technically called the super Thursday of earnings and particularly for the entities in Europe. So thank you all for taking time to be on our call. We are humbled by your support for our company.
Angie, so let’s talk a little bit about kind of how things have materialized thus far. So, it was a similar question on Q1. How could anything stack up to Q1 and then we delivered Q2 in line with Q1 whereas now the first six months of orders for our Subsea business has exceeded all of that of the prior 12 months or last year.
As we look forward into the second half, we continue to see strong order activity. The absolute value will really be a function of one or two very large awards. There is a few billion dollar plus Subsea awards that are out there right now that it could come in the second half of the year or in the beginning or the first half of 2020.
Obviously, the timing of those awards would have a material impact both in our inbound and on the total market activity in terms of new orders. But we continue to see a very resilient market. We publish our view of the market including the major opportunity set. As you will see, that has increased, not decreased as a result of the activity this quarter where there were some very strong awards for our company.
But that opportunity set has largely been replenished and you can see that in our back up materials. So we continue to have a very strong outlook in terms of the second half of 2019, as well as 2020. Again, it’s a function of the timing of a couple of these very large awards. If they occur in the end of 2019 or if they move into 2020.
Beyond that opportunity set that we publish on our Subsea outlook, I remind you we have a proprietary opportunity set that we have been developing for several years to our integrated feed activity, many of which when converted are exclusive to our company including the announcement of another iEPCI alliance this quarter with Wintershall DEA which we are very proud of.
So, we have the market outlook is I’d say, that is available, others participate in and then we have that proprietary opportunity set. So, we will see based upon the timing of a couple of big orders which could occur in the first half of 2020 versus the second half of 2019. But we remain – we see the market as very constructive and in no way do we see this as a isolated event. We see this as a trend that will continue. Okay. Thank you, Doug. Very helpful. And then, maybe I can ask Maryann on the margin side first for 2020 and then maybe even beyond at a very high level. With the Arctic LNG 2 award, how does that change? Or does that changed the margin progression in 2020 and again with the high level integrated awards on the Subsea side, could that imply that margins maybe actually up in 2020 versus 2019?
And then, longer term, I think Doug and we’ve had a conversation about this. As we go into 2021 and beyond, is it possible to return close to peak margins in Subsea at near 20% given the integrated awards, but also with vessels coming on in 2021, 2022 and beyond and high utilization levels? Angie, let me start with a few high level comments and then Maryann will add additional color. Look, we believe that we have done – we have taken the necessary steps to provide a structural and sustainable change in Subsea project economics that is unlocking the potential of these projects and making them economically viable and competitive to other investment choices for our clients and meaning other geographies and other types of investment.
With that has obviously been working very well and we are seeing the benefit of that. We have also taken the necessary steps and benefited as a result of the merger as Maryann indicated, we’ve now delivered the full guidance around pretax operating synergies, six months earlier than plan. So we’ve now delivered the full $450 million of pretax cost synergies as a result of the merger.
So when you put all of this together and we continue to innovate and develop the next generation beyond the current generation, our current generation, the next generation of Subsea assets, we remain very constructive on the outlook for the progression or for the expectations of our Subsea margins. I will add to that though, it’s a question of the progression of that margin.
And what is true is, as you point out, we are seeing capacity utilization improving in the out years, 2021, 2022, which will certainly help with the expansion of the margin at that point in time. I think it’s just we have to be prudent in the way that we model out the margin progression in Subsea.
But it’s clearly moving in the right direction and are very strong inbound a very high quality projects mainly being iEPCI representing over 50% of our inbound in the first half alone give us a reason to have increased confidence in our margin outlook. I will just again, caution to temper a bit on the progression of that margin as we get through the second half of 2019, 2020 and then see the overall market capacity tightening in 2021 and 2022. Maryann, did you want to touch on the Arctic LNG contribution for onshore/offshore? Sure, thanks, Doug. Hello, Angie. And maybe just a little more color around onshore/offshore. As we think about it, Angie, risk management is a critical piece of the way we try to manage that project portfolio frankly across all of our portfolios. But in the very early stages of our contracts, we obviously take a very measured approach as we get through engineering phases and heading to further plays and project completions.
So, I think, very similarly to the way that you see, perhaps even if you look at Yamal as a model as we reach that final completion, our ability to avoid risks in the project allows us to generate greater profitability.
I think that’s a reasonable assumption, Angie, when you look at the way we will start that very large Arctic project we will be cautious as we get through those early phases and that good risk management should allow us to have a similar profile in the future on Arctic. Great. Thanks. I’ll turn it over. Your next question comes from the line of David Farrell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi, congratulations on the results. I had a quick question on Arctic LNG 2 and the comparison to Yamal LNG in terms of how the contract is structured. I think Yamal was structured to a French entity and therefore encountered very high tax rates on it. I was just wondering how the Arctic LNG 2 contracts has been structured and whether there is the potential for improvement on tax rates there. Thank you, David for the question and thank you for the congratulations, but it really goes to the 37,000 women and men of our company who generated the results. Maryann and I just have the honor of representing them here today. Yes, indeed, the Arctic LNG 2 will also flow through the French entity from a taxation point of view at least a large portion of it will.
The overall structure of the contract is, in many ways similar to Yamal, although it is a different technology that is being used. But the way that we have structured the contract in terms of a large reimbursable scope and then the remainder is a lump sum scope is actually very similar to the Yamal contract. Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, it kind of tells us kind of the second wave of the integrated model for Subsea. I am just wondering, when you got to look at the – base, do you think that’s still like experimenting with different vendor suppliers or do you think that you’ve kind of settled now on the companies they want to use? Interesting question, David. You see the results, right. So, year-to-date 2019, we’ve received a 100% of those integrated awards. So, I guess, in some ways, we are confident that will part of the pack. We are currently obviously well positioned. I believe that the clients are looking to and as you said potentially experimenting with other opportunities to bring that same skill set through different companies.
I hesitate a little bit in my response, David, because, it’s very difficult in our opinion to deliver an integrated Subsea project due to the complexity and due to the trade-offs between the manufacturing and the installation as a joint venture or an alliance. I remind you, we tried that path. We were unsuccessful.
We recognize that the way to unlock real sustainable demonstrated value to our clients was to come together as a single company, remove the natural friction that occurs between the manufacturing and the installation activities and generate now as a result of having this incredible group of employees under a one roof.
The total R&D capability of the next generation of Subsea systems including the integrated delivery system is part of that. So, I do believe and we encourage additional integration. You see it happening. The market is clearly moving in that way. But I think it’s very difficult to be able to deliver through such a structure, at least it was difficult for us. We are much happier now as a single entity. Okay. Great. Thanks very much. And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks guys and yes, fantastic quarter. Congrats. Maryann, my question is for you on the cash flow outlook. Very clear on the second half of the year and we talked about this previously, but as we think about the business normalizing, how should we think about targets of net income conversion to free cash flow?
And given this order uptake and as those things progress, should we expect a higher level of free cash flow and say, 2020 as the order cycle continues to unfold? Yes, Dan. Thanks. So, the answer to your question is yes, we should. As we talked about the unwinding of Yamal in 2019 is the significant piece of that, it will take a step down pretty significantly in 2020. So we would expect from 2020 and beyond with the incremental addition of inbound awards both from the Subsea and the onshore/offshore side to see a much higher conversion of net income to free cash flow.
I think, when last time we talked – we were talking in, in range of about 80% to 85%. I think the thing to keep in mind is we have some growth opportunities across the rest of the portfolio and certainly, as we think about that growth, that would be part of the constraint there. But we certainly expect in 2020 and beyond much higher conversion net income to free cash flow. Okay. Thanks. And then, just on onshore/offshore margins, if we think about a normalized level, I think you talked around about 6% in the past, but now that you are through the full capturing of all the synergies on the deal and if I recall correctly, a large portion of those synergies were expected to be in the onshore/offshore segment.
You are also seeing a big wave of LNG as Doug has talked about. So, taking all those into account, should we think about at least for the next sort of foreseeable future, for the sort of non-Yamal margins to be above that that range as you’ve talked about in the past. So, Dan, a couple of thoughts here or a couple of considerations. First, the contribution from Yamal was not complete as we – I hope provide a greater visibility and made it bit clear as a result of the increased disclosure around the Yamal project.
So number one, it’s hard to – from this point forward, it’s hard to answer the question in that manner, because again there will continue to be a contribution from the Yamal project which has been a highly successful project.
In terms of the overall margin outlook without LNG again, we have run this business and managed this business around quality versus quantity ensuring that we match the projects with our demonstrated capacity to ensure a very successful outcome on the projects that we take on, both for our clients, ourselves and for you as our investors.
And that remains our practice and our priority in terms of focusing on some activity and ensuring that we have the capacity and the competency to deliver those projects.
So therefore, I would stick with our prior outlook, which was $5 billion to $6 billion in revenue with a 4% to 6% margin for this business ex LNG and we said, with LNG and with a increasing percentage of LNG, you could see 200 basis points improvement as a contribution of the LNG activity.
What is true is that the LNG EPC providers remaining that are fiscally sound and have demonstrated the capacity to deliver these type of projects is more limited than it was in the past and the opportunity set is great. So, therefore, you should expect us to be very focused on ensuring that we have the right projects with the right terms where that can drive the best financial results for our company. Well, excellent. Thanks for the time. Your next question comes from the line of James Evans from Exane BNP. Your line is now open. James Evans, your line is now open. Sorry, second call in a row. Thank you for the detail on the Yamal, Maryann, very, very helpful. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the future on LNG. So, obviously, great to see Arctic 2. You are bidding a lot of other projects.
What’s happening to the sort of underlying cost trends? It looks like some of these fabrication yards, et cetera quite busy, as we won’t trust to replicate your very successful approach on the Yamal modularization.
So, is there any danger those sorts of yards are filling that up? And then sort of a second question, sort of relates to that obviously, some concern about cost is expressed, but also this downward pressure on longer term pricing in LNG.
We are sort of hearing about lot of projects and plans. So, is there any just acquire from clients yet? Or was it still absolutely full steam ahead in your conversations open? Thank you, James. So a couple of things, many of the LNG projects that are being considered today are still stick built. They are not modularized. So, yes, there is increasing activity in the fabrication yards. Because of the success that we had, not only on Yamal LNG but on other Subsea and onshore/offshore projects where we focused on modularization, I think we have – we have demonstrated experience and we have very good relationships with those yards.
I believe they see us as a partner of choice when they are considering our projects versus other potential projects. Culturally, execution model-wise, and ultimately project success drives that alignment in that relationship.
So, you are correct to point it out. It is something that we are well aware of, but we believe by having the experience that we have gained across multiple different yards and having optionality across those fabricators and a very good sense of partnership that we will ensure that we select the right yards and that we can therefore deliver very successful projects.
If I capture the second part of your question correctly in terms of the client outlook, how would I describe it? I think there is an accelerated pace realizing that not all LNG projects will be sanctioned this way.
There is more projects then can potentially be sanctioned and because of some of the tightening constraints in some geographical markets, for instance, the U.S. Gulf Coast, where manufacturing capacity is becoming – construction capacity, excuse me - is becoming a significant concern.
I think that you see some projects in other parts of the world maybe if you will accelerating in the queue potentially just as a result of the overall capacity in the market. So, look, we continue to be widespread as I’ve indicated before. Our targeted strategic projects are spread around the world. If we have future announcements and we certainly intend to, but we would have different partners on the projects and you would see us have projects be announced in different geographies.
We believe this is all good ways to mitigate risk and manage the portfolio approach. And again, in those more challenged environments, we would always partner with somebody who had those capabilities that we could ensure that we would have access to the right talent to be able to deliver those projects.
But if anything, I would say, I have seen a bit of an acceleration not a deceleration in terms of the desire of – especially our major clients to bring forward the sanctioning of LNG projects. Super. Very clear. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thank you. Doug, we’ve been talking for the last few years about the integrated model as a way to grow the pie of potential projects and enable FTI to get bigger slice despite the fact that you already have the largest market share historically. And so, it seems like, the first half of this year really validates that strategy.
If you go back a couple of years, I remember, you were taking some heat for holding on to engineering talent ahead of this order cycle when we were at the trough. And so now we use – got $25 billion of backlog still more on the way.
Could you just talk a little bit about the execution fairway and how you prepare to manage the throughput over the last few years in terms of engineering and manufacturing capabilities? Thank you very much, Sean. Indeed, our engineering capability and competency along with our project management competency and capability are two of our differentiating strengths, always have been and continue to be and as you pointed out, we made a decision to hold on to those resources even when it meant a bit of underabsorption.
Likewise, if I could extend the conversation for a moment, recall, we did the same with the fleet. So, back in the prior years, when there were vessel only or if you will, C&I type contracts that were on the market are very competitive, many of our competitors having larger fleet sizes than ourselves and therefore the problem set being a bit more substantial for the industry.
We saw very aggressive pricing and those projects will have to flow through. We set that out as you recall. And we said, we were going to hold back the capacity and utilization of our fleet to put those on to integrated projects.
I think I remember saying, I will be – it will be clear if I am wrong, because if we don’t announce integrated projects that will absorb the capacity of the fleet, then that would obviously have been a poor decision.
The good news is, we have and we continue to and as you know, since our last earnings call, we’ve announced three additional integrated projects again representing now 50% of our total awards to-date and we have received 100% of those awards. We have a good line of sight on additional integrated projects that we will be awarded most likely in the coming quarters.
So we will see the benefit of that. Now that will flow through obviously in the 2021, 2022, because we have to go through the manufacturing phase before we can go through the installation phase of those contracts. So, look, we manage capacity very, very closely. We understand that at the end, we are projects company.
It’s important that we have the right capacity to be able to deliver on these projects and we are quite comfortable because of the decisions that were made that we have that capacity to be able to deliver world-class projects for our customers. Got it. Thank you for that. And then, maybe a little more on the near-term. I was hoping if we could spend a little bit more time on the puts and takes to the implied 11% Subsea margin guidance for the back half of the year?
So, obviously very good result in 2Q. It sounds like some project completions help that number. Thus the utilization is also quite good. But maybe in line with what you’d expect seasonally. So, what are the factors that influence the shift in guidance for the back half and confidence you have in that floor? Yes, Sean, so, you know, obviously, we raised our Subsea margin guidance from at least 11% to at least 11.5%. And you are correct, mathematically, if you look at that it implies back half guidance – back half result of at least 11% to reach that guidance. Look, always to get off – always good to be ahead of the game.
Always good to get good early start to the year both from a inbound point of view. Again, just staggering to look at our results, six months of inbound exceeding the whole prior 12 months which by the way was 27% above the trough. So, quite significant and the book-to-bill obviously reflecting that as well in the growth in the backlog.
So, these things all give us increased confidence and we are always prudent in the way that we approach the guidance and how we set the targets. And we believe at this time, based upon what we can see and indeed as you point out the fact that the vessel utilization we stick with our prior guidance of 50% to 55% for the full year.
So that, this was indeed a bit of a seasonal effect. We think it’s the right place to increase the guidance to for 2019. Lot of positive things happening, but it just takes a bit of time for those to develop. For sure. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from the line of Guillaume Delaby from Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Yes, good afternoon and congratulations. Two questions if I may. First, Doug, regarding the sausage business, I would like to have your view regarding 2020 i.e. the decline in North America spending which is likely, it’s 2 2019. Is it temporary according to you? Or do you see it as maybe a little bit more structural?
First question and my second question is for Maryann. Just would like to know, if you could elaborate a little bit more about the cash flow profile of Arctic LNG 2? Because I thought I think I wrote that somewhere that as the cash flow profile might be less front-end loaded than Yamal. So cash flow may – it may be a more balanced stream according to different lines going on? Two interesting questions. Thank you very much. I wish I could reverse the order with Maryann, because the answering to the first question, as you well know, no one will get it right. So, let me talk about the North America market in the way that we see it.
So, I am going to step back and remind you that for our Surface Technologies business, approximately 50% of our business is outside of North America. That business we have seen an inflection in activity and we are now seeing an inflection in pricing. So we have a very constructive outlook for our business outside of North America which comprises 50% approximately of the segment.
Now turning to the North America market. We – the way we will manage towards the market is, I think quite unique. There is two parts of our business that we – two parts of our business that serves the North America market.
One is the support that we provide where we provide the very high-end consumable equipment to the pressure pumping industry in terms of – allow them to safely and efficiently provide the hydraulic fracturing services. And the second part is the conventional product business in the North America market. We will plan conservatively that there will not be a significant recovery.
I am not necessarily saying that I believe that will be the case in 2020 versus the second half of 2019 as you pose the question. But we are going to plan that way and let me explain why. Much of our business is not tied to the drilling and completion activity. Increasingly, it’s tied to the production activity.
So you will see us continue to put forward a strategy that allows us to further differentiate our business and to move our business from being heavily drilling and completions related and more production-related.
The reason that’s important is that, the production activity – the production spend will continue to increase even when the drilling and completion market is flat and that’s just a function of what’s called stacking. The stacking effect in the North America market and we can talk more about that perhaps at a later date. But a very exciting opportunity for us in a way that we will transform our business. Maryann? Yes, thank you. And for your second question regarding the cash flow, if you will, for Arctic 2, first and foremost, it is clearly our operational objective as we set out for all of our projects, but clearly for Arctic that we maintain obviously a cash flow neutral, or a cash flow positive position across the life of this very large project.
In the quarter, we were successful with receiving one of several payments that we expect in the very early phase of the contract that will also allow us to have a similar profile, if you will, to Yamal. Having said that, the size of these projects are a bit different.
And so, may not have exactly the same profile as you may remember from Yamal, but very similar in its structure in terms of the early phase, advance payments and the cash flow mechanism, if you will, that we or the profile that we will maintain over the life of that project. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon where you are and thank you so much for squeezing me in. Congratulations on a phenomenal run over the last 12 months. So, kudos to everybody there in your organization and kudos to you guys as well. And so, Doug, I just maybe hit on one of the earlier topics which along with the success you’ve had on project awards and increased backlog for both Subsea and for onshore/offshore.
How do you – can you walk us through a little bit more about the dynamics at play on the execution front? And how – what you are driving within the organization to maintain that execution profile that you had in the past?
Right, a lot of this as you mentioned in some of it’s unprecedented in terms of the backlog that you have in the business.
That’s one part of the question. Second part of the question is, with that increase in activity, project awards and so on, what are you doing to kind of mitigate cost creeps if that’s possible at all? Hello. Hello. Sorry, Kurt. I didn’t had my button on. So, thank you very much for the question. I got to practice if they are on mute. So I’ll start again. The – it’s important to know that the activity level is even though quite robust that we have reported in terms of inbound are below that of our demonstrated capacity both in Subsea as well as in LNG specifically.
So, we are very comfortable with the continuity particularly of the leadership and project management direct to it that we will be able to – that we will continue to provide exceptional project execution to our clients.
That’s what our clients entrust us with some of their most important and complex projects in their portfolio and our commitment to them and to you as the investment community is that we will ensure that we only take on those projects where we are confident that we can provide excellent results in terms of execution and this was key to the earlier question of why we invested and maintained and developed our capacity during the periods of activity that were not as robust.
In terms of cost creep, we obviously consider that in all of our contracts. There is either cost escalation built in, tied to an index or there is just a general cost escalation calculation that’s done at the time of the signing of the contract. Great. If I have time for me, one follow-up. Given the tremendous success you guys have had in capturing these project awards and as you mentioned kind of driving a paradigm shift in the ways of your customers are kind of looking at these projects.
I am just curious, can you get a sense that the competitors within the Subsea space are getting pulled in your direction or do you think there may be a dynamic here where the lack of market share, if you will, or the market share gains on your part might result in some questionable pricing behavior from your competitors. What – can you give us a general sense on how you might see that dynamic play out? Kurt, briefly, I think it’s difficult to predict what the competitors will do. We are focused on our strategy and being successful in the execution of our strategy. Look, I think, I am not so much worried about unpredictable type behaviors.
I think people understand the opportunity set and I think, maturing understanding of the growth of the market will be – will this lead to further restructuring or not. I leave that up to our competitors. But I’ll tell you what, we are really glad. We did ours back in 2017 versus considering something like that right now at this point in the growth cycle of our major markets. Okay. Thanks. Always appreciate the insights. Thank you very much. And we have reached the end of our Q&A session and our last question comes from the line of Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. I have two questions related to your Subsea business please. The first one is just, could I get some updates on your Subsea equipment manufacturing facilities, precisely more the Subsea tree manufacturing and the flexible pipes manufacturing?
What the utilization rates there are for this year and with the orders to-date, what do you think the utilization could be higher or lower in 2020?
That’s my first question. And my second question is just a bit more, going back to revisit the Subsea margins. A question we asked earlier in the year was, whether 2019 was going to get a trough for the margins in that business?
And at the time earlier in the year, you answered, we’ve got to kind of see how the order flow goes through 2019 and now that we are half way through the year and with all the bookings that you have, do you feel confident, if you can answer whether 2019 is the trough for the margins? Those are my two questions. Amy, actually a great question and with – we don’t give utilization of our individual manufacturing facilities. I will say we've been very prudent in the way that we’ve invested in our manufacturing facilities including moving and incorporating robotics into our plants to extend the capacity without having to extend roofline.
In addition to that, our next generation of Subsea equipment which we call Subsea 2.0 actually uses a much – is a much faster cadence through the manufacturing facilities thus allowing us to extend our demonstrated capacity through a similar roofline or even a reduction in roofline.
Specifically, to your question, yes, we expect 2020 utilization or absorption of our manufacturing footprint to be greater than 2019. And indeed at this point in time, given the success that we’ve had in the first half of the year and our outlook, we would expect that 2019 is indeed the trough for Subsea margins. Thanks very much. That’s very clear. The Q&A session has ended. Now I would like to turn the call over back to Mr. Matthew Seinsheimer. This concludes our second quarter conference call. A replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. British Summer Time today.

Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Matthew Seinsheimer. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon, and welcome to TechnipFMC's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued yesterday can be found on our website.
I'd like to caution you with respect to any forward-looking statements made during this call. Although these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding future developments and business conditions, they are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.
Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the French AMF and the UK Financial Conduct Authority. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Joining me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of New Ventures and the CEO-elect for SpinCo.
In the third quarter, we announced the transaction that will create two diversified pure-play market leaders: RemainCo, which will retain the TechnipFMC name, will be a fully integrated technology and services provider that will continue to drive energy development; and SpinCo, a leading E&C player poised to capitalize on the global energy transition.
The separation will enable both companies to benefit from distinct and compelling market opportunities across the energy value chain; dedicated focus on management, resources and capital; and unique value propositions with differentiated investment appeal.
Our balance sheet will support the creation of two financially strong companies. The capital structure of both companies will be tailored to their specific business needs and we remain confident that both will have investment-grade metrics. We believe strongly that providing independence for these two world-class high-performing businesses will unlock further opportunities and value creation for all stakeholders.
When thinking about the two companies, it's helpful to understand where the operational leverage resides. For RemainCo, 89% of the trailing 12-month revenue mix has been driven by Subsea projects and service technologies outside North America. We believe these international markets provide the best opportunities for growth.
More specifically, we expect the Middle East will continue to lead our international growth in Surface Technologies, and we anticipate future Subsea activity will be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana, whereas an industry leader and first-mover focused on sustainability we have created a strong footprint to help unlock the tremendous resource potential in both regions. We also expect activity to strengthen in Brazil as a result of the development of pre-sold assets.
For SpinCo, we are providing additional insight into the significant backlog in hand today, which currently equates to nearly 3 times the revenue projected for 2019. Looking at the backlog in greater detail, approximately 56% of the $18 billion of total backlog is related to future work on LNG projects including Yamal LNG, Prelude FLNG, Coral FLNG and Arctic LNG 2.
Our recent announcement of the Rovuma LNG award, which the client has suggested will likely be sanctioned next year is not included in these figures. The announcement of our intention to create two distinct companies has also refocused the market's attention on the appropriate peer group for both entities.
For RemainCo, we believe large-cap service companies and equipment manufacturers are the most relevant peers. This includes a select group of companies that have capabilities in subsea equipment installation and services or capabilities in drilling and completion equipment and services, a global franchise across major upstream basins and a capital structure that provides the financial strength required by our customers. We consider the most relevant peers to be Baker Hughes, Halliburton, NOV and Schlumberger.
In addition to these large-cap peers, there are a few companies with smaller market capitalizations that could also be considered including offered solutions, Oceaneering Subsea seven and The Weir Group. For SpinCo, the company will be one of the largest global E&C pure-plays with leading positions notably in the LNG market.
SpinCo's strong competitive position in the marketplace is driven by leading capabilities in LNG, a differentiated portfolio of process technologies, the ability to successfully execute the industry's most challenging projects, capabilities and services particularly around front end and project management consultancy and proprietary products and equipment.
Evaluation of the global peer group identifies only a handful of players with demonstrated LNG capabilities including Fluor, JGC, KBR and Saipem. There are many other companies with whom we compete, but we firmly believe that this more limited set most appropriately reflects the key differentiating attributes and leadership positions of these two unique pure-play companies.
Turning to Subsea. Orders in the third quarter reflected continued strength driven by the integrated awards, services activity and the award of the industry's first 20K Subsea system. The momentum of the integrated commercial model continued as we inbounded several new iEPCI projects in the period. The value of integrated project awards in 2019 has increased by more than 90% from the levels we reported through the first nine months of 2018.
Subsea's services continue to benefit from the industry's largest and expanding installed base with growth in the quarter reflecting increased installation, asset refurbishment and well intervention activities. Subsea services remains on track for double-digit growth for the full year. Also in the quarter, we received the industry's first award of a high-pressure high-temperature system for LLOG's Shenandoah project in the Gulf of Mexico.
This new technology was the result of a joint industry program led by TechnipFMC that included five major operators. This was the first time the industry collaborated to develop a new subsea system, focused on the delivery of a single-part number and designed to handle hydrocarbons under the industry's most extreme pressure and temperature conditions to date.
Taken together, we reported inbound orders of $1.5 billion in the quarter, which again exceeded revenues in the period. Inbound through the first nine months totaled $7 billion reflecting a year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.7 times. We continue to believe that order growth for the full year will exceed 50%, significantly better than the total Subsea market growth, which we estimate closer to 20%. This high level of growth is coming in the third year of a market recovery and is the highest annual growth rate we have experienced in a decade.
This year's order growth has been driven by increased adoption of the integrated model and the successful introduction of iEPCI was only possible due to the creation of TechnipFMC. While 50% growth will be difficult to repeat, we do see potential for next year's inbound orders to match the absolute levels we anticipate for 2019.
Moving to the LNG outlook: The supply of new liquefaction capacity coming online today reflects investment decisions made as far back as seven years ago. While we acknowledge near-term market sentiment, we continue to believe that natural gas is critical to the energy transition and that there is a need for significant new capacity to meet future gas demand. It is also important to remember that the decision to sanction projects today is based on first gas in 2023 and beyond. The demand scenario at that time will be very different than the one we currently face. Five projects over the last five months have either been sanctioned or as highlighted in public disclosures moved closer to FID in 2020. Two of these have progressed to the benefit of TechnipFMC.
We announced the first project Arctic LNG 2 back in July. And just two weeks ago we announced the contract award for the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique through a consortium including TechnipFMC, JGC and Fluor. The Rovuma project -- natural gas liquefaction trains with total nameplate capacity of 15.2 million metric tons per annum as well as associated onshore facility. The award builds upon our expanding capabilities in the region where we are already present through our work on the Coral FLNG project and the Golfinho Integrated Subsea project. This serves as further confirmation of TechnipFMC's leadership in LNG and our strong capabilities in the delivery of remote projects.
Selectivity of projects like Rovuma is paramount to our success. To emphasize this point we have re-prioritized previously targeted projects where the commercial terms fell outside our acceptable limits. We remain focused on securing the right projects where we can leverage our differentiation those that have the right contractual terms for us and those with the best project economics for our customers.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in the quarter. Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter highlights included solid orders in Subsea, strong execution in Onshore/Offshore and double-digit international revenue growth in Surface Technologies. We continue to build backlog for execution in 2020 and beyond providing further confidence in our medium-term outlook and a solid foundation for our upcoming separation into two well-capitalized companies. We also generated positive operating cash flow in the quarter which has now been positive for five consecutive quarters.
Moving to the results, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.12 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.07 per diluted share. Other pretax items impacting the quarter, for which we do not provide guidance, included, $0.22 per diluted share related to an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners that is included in interest expense and $0.09 per diluted share of foreign exchange losses included in corporate expenses. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $379 million with cash flow from operations totaling $92 million. We ended the quarter with net cash of $596 million.
Turning to the segment results, Subsea delivered third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion an 11% increase versus the prior year quarter, driven by increased activity in Subsea projects and solid year-over-year growth in Subsea services. The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installation, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities, with notable strength in Asia Pacific and the North Sea.
While we experienced solid revenue growth over the prior year period, this growth was impacted by the timing of key project milestones, shifting recognition of some anticipated revenue into the coming quarters. Revenue growth was also impacted by foreign exchange translation adjustments, which reduced the growth in revenue by $44 million versus the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $139 million with a margin of 10.4%. We remain confident in our full year guidance for Subsea. Onshore/Offshore reported third quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter. This was our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, benefiting from the significant expansion of our backlog.
Adjusted EBITDA was $304 million with a margin of 19.1%. The solid margin performance in the period reflects the Yamal LNG contribution and the continued strength in execution across the portfolio.
Following quarter end, we announced the award of an EPC contract for Mozambique's Rovuma LNG Project. While we will perform some early work on the project in the near-term, the impact on our backlog will not be material in the fourth quarter. The full contract value will be included in backlog when full notice to proceed is given. The client has indicated that the Final Investment Decision is anticipated in 2020.
Surface Technologies' revenue of $397 million was down modestly in the quarter versus the second quarter with continued strength in international markets nearly offsetting the headwinds in North American activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% was largely unchanged sequentially, primarily due to lower volume and further pricing pressure in North America.
Turning to cash flow, we generated positive operating cash flow in the period of $92 million which would have been $256 million excluding settlement. This included a $9 million contribution from Yamal LNG. This marked our fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow.
Year-to-date we generated operating cash flow of $288 million and we expect cash flow from operations to be positive again in the fourth quarter. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $98 million in the period and included investments that will support for future growth. Please note that our full year guidance of approximately $350 million excludes the $80 million impact of the sale leaseback transaction we recorded in the first quarter for the dive support vessel.
And lastly, on the Q2 earnings call, I stated our intent to distribute the majority of the $413 million liability to Yamal LNG joint venture partners before year-end. In the third quarter, we made a cash distribution of $223 million and expect to make an additional payment in the fourth quarter. Any further increase in the liability incurred in the second half of the year as a result of increased project profitability will likely be distributed beyond 2019.
Turning to our full year outlook, we have provided updates to our guidance for Surface Technologies and corporate expense. For Surface Technologies lower North American activity continues to negatively impact both volume and price.
Many of our international markets remain healthy and we now expect our international revenues, which account for just over half of the segment total to grow at a low double-digit rate for the full year. This trend supports our full year revenue guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, although we are trending toward the low end of this range as a result of the weakness in North America.
However, we are reducing our margin guidance to at least 10%, down from our previous guidance of at least 12% due to the market challenges we are facing in North America.
For corporate expense, we're increasing our full year guidance to a range of $210 million to $215 million versus our previous guidance of $160 million to $170 million, excluding the impact of FX.
Our corporate cost have been impacted mainly by accelerated IT spending where we elected to go forward with certain initiatives including a global PC refresh. This incremental spend is materially complete. The updated guidance reflects approximately $40 million to $45 million of corporate costs for the fourth quarter, which is in line with the underlying run rate of the first nine months of the year. Given the discretionary nature of the incremental spend, we're confident in our ability to deliver this level of spend in the quarter.
Finally, we do not provide guidance for the impact of foreign exchange. I want to comment on the $53 million expense we recorded in the quarter. The majority of the FX impact was driven by the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza as the country's Central Bank took steps to more closely align its published rate with those offered in less traditional foreign exchange markets. We do not have the ability to hedge this exposure. Given continued devaluation in the month of October, we could see a further impact in our fourth quarter results.
Last quarter we shared incremental disclosure on contract liabilities and project cash flows for Yamal LNG, because of the importance of this project on our results. We also noted that the project had largely been funded given the project's physical progress is nearly complete. This funding has been included in our reported cash balance.
As a reminder, contract liabilities reflect revenue that will be converted into cost or profit through project completion. In the third quarter, a contract liability was reduced by $284 million. Given the strong financial results reported in Onshore/Offshore, it would be reasonable to assume that a meaningful portion of these revenues were recognized as profit, as strong project closure mitigated additional costs and not as cash payments to vendors. And of that profit, our 50% share will remain with TechnipFMC.
We now have $1.4 billion in contract liabilities remaining on Yamal LNG. Keep in mind that as the contract liability is reduced the potential remains for us to convert more of this estimated liability into profit as we demonstrated in the third quarter. And this will shift a higher portion of a liability into profit and result in a reduction in the potential cash outflow needed to complete the project.
In closing, the quarterly highlights largely support our full year outlook with improved visibility for 2020 and beyond. Onshore/Offshore's strong profitability is sustained, while the Rovuma LNG award is further confirmation of our LNG leadership position. Strength in iEPCI orders is sustaining market-leading book-to-bill trends in Subsea, where our full year order growth is expected to exceed 50%, the highest annual growth rate for our company in a decade. And we delivered positive operating cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter, a trend we see continuing in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead, we are making good progress on our plan to create two independent pure-play companies and remain on track to meet an accelerated time line for completion in the first half of 2020.
With that operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Thanks, good afternoon. Good morning, Sean. So Doug maybe we can start by addressing what I think is driving some of the weakness in the stock in Europe this morning the Subsea margin in the quarter. I think you've indicated for some time that given the lumpiness in the business, a 10% type of number was possible for a quarter, but 2019 should still be the bottom with modest year-over-year improvement next year and a better step-up in 2021 on the backlog that you booked in the first half. Could you maybe just give us some more context on the milestones that flipped in 3Q? Anything else that you would call out? And -- or otherwise is there any change to your -- the broader strokes that laid out heading into next year? Thank you for the question Sean. Absolutely the way you summarized it is what we had previously stated and we remain committed to that statement. And nothing has changed in our outlook for the Subsea business or its ability to be able to continue to deliver improved results. As a matter of fact the very strong inbound levels that we've enjoyed this year year-to-date a book-to-bill of 1.7 times only gives us greater confidence as it gives us a greater revenue coverage and allows us to improve and accelerate the utilization of underutilized assets in the company as we move forward.
So you are absolutely right. Nothing has changed. The timing and the -- when we actually achieve certain milestones is not entirely within our control and it's very difficult to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which is why we give full year guidance. But we remain fully committed to the 2019 full year guidance and our outlook has remained unchanged if anything strengthened by the quality and the quantity of the inbound we have received year-to-date. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And as we think about -- with Rovuma making its way into your project queue at some point here, how does capacity look for incremental projects for the On/Off business overall and specifically for LNG? You'll be working on several projects at once. Execution of course is critical. Maybe could we just talk about engineering capacity and how you think about managing some of the incremental projects that you still have on your board for LNG in particular? This is a very critical question and one that we put a significant amount of focus on and it's why selectivity is so important across our portfolio. But I'm going to ask Catherine MacGregor to talk a bit more about what is being done within Onshore/Offshore and how we track that utilization and make sure that we're matching capacity to our proven and demonstrated capability. Yes, sure and good morning, Sean. So the way we look at our capacity in LNG is really not just in a number of projects, but looking at different factors, such as the type of projects, within the project what scope are we looking at and of course the timing, because as you know, those projects tend to be very long and depending on the phase, they are in the workload requirement is very, very different. We have demonstrated in the past, as you know our capability to deliver and work simultaneously on three very, very large projects at the same time. And since then we really have increased in terms of our flexibility to our operating centers with a multi-country footprint which we can leverage on. So frankly, when I look at what we have today in our backlog and adding to that some of the opportunities that we are looking to integrate in the future, we're very comfortable that we can take and deliver and continue to execute on those project that we are involved in. This is really a topic that is central to the discussions that we're having internally. And systematically every time we look at an opportunity we ask for the projection of our workload, again leveraging our multicenter footprint across the globe. Thank you for that feedback. Your next question comes from the line of Angeline Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys. Hello Angie. Hi, Doug, So could you -- it's good to hear the confidence you have around Subsea orders remaining strong in 2020. So it's great to hear a little bit about the visibility you have just in general and specifically around iEPCI awards next year. A little color will be helpful. Certainly Angie. We publish our updated opportunity list for Subsea projects that we believe the market will likely move forward within the next 24 months. That's available in the materials that went out with the press release and on our website, and reflecting on that we see a change in value a positive change in value taking out those awards, removing those awards that were -- those projects that were awarded in the quarter and those that we replaced by incremental projects. So that is up almost 3/4 of $1 billion in terms of the opportunity set. Many of which are moving forward quite into their advanced stages where there could potentially be awards in the much shorter timeframe than the long end of the 24 months. That's what gives us the confidence.
On top of that Angie, and I think it's really important to reflect on a quarter like Q3, the quarter that we're here talking about this morning in terms of Subsea. There weren't many announced awards in the quarter, yet we delivered a book-to-bill of 1.1 and we delivered a very strong total inbound dollar value. That just shows the underlying strength of our Subsea services business, our unique alliances that we have with our clients some of which that are over two decades old and exclusive to our company; our new integrated EPCI or iEPCI alliances of which we added yet another this quarter, which most of those will lead to direct awards to our company in terms of the continued activity in the brownfield and tieback area.
So this just all points to the continued strength and resiliency of what we've been able to do with our business and how we've been able to transform the market. In terms of iEPCI looking forward, quite frankly it's becoming more well it's more than 50% of our business today in terms of inbound level. So it's really becoming the norm. Someday we'll be talking about non-iEPCI projects, not iEPCI projects, because the whole market is moving in that direction. We have several customers who have now publicly stated that this is the only model that they're going to use going forward, because it just makes sense. It makes sense for us and it makes sense for them and delivers a true win-win. Great. That's very helpful. And then I appreciate the context around margins and the confidence that 2019 will be the trough. Maybe looking a little bit further with 2020, is it fair to think that the gains in margins would be relatively modest, but in 2021 as the installation process begins that the margin gain could be even a little bit greater? Yeah, Angie. I would agree with your analysis. I think it's really important to remind people when we announced an iEPCI project or an integrated project that includes Subsea delivered installed on the seabed, the only company that can do that as a single entity, and why we've been so successful today. But in order to be able to deliver that type of a business model, we made a decision to ensure that we would have the capabilities in terms of the installation capabilities available to be able to meet those commitments.
So reflecting on that that means we are prioritizing our fleet towards those integrated projects. As a result of that and when we announce large awards a large volume of awards like we've already announced 90% improvement year-on-year, over 50% of our total inbound coming from iEPCI. We do have to design engineer – engineer, design and manufacture the equipment before we can install the equipment.
So therefore it's realistic to think it takes in the neighborhood of 12 months to 24 months depending upon the project to complete the first phase before you move into the installation phase, which is why I think your analysis is quite appropriate in terms of we'll really start to see the total impact once we're into that installation phase which will be more into 2020 – 2021, 2022 time frame as you point out. Right. Thank you, Doug. I’ll turn it over. Your next question comes from the line of James Evans with Exane BNP Paribas. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wondered on the spin-off in SpinCo, what the key steps on the road are now the sort of key hurdles for you to get over in the near term? Thank you, James, and good afternoon. The -- because of the nature of the transaction, most of the critical steps are let's say within our control. Right now the process that we are undertaking is the finalization of the drafting of the prospectus that will be delivered. And then we will work with the agencies in terms of answering any questions that might be generated until that is finally approved and made public.
As a result of that, I would say that's the one thing really James the whole team is focused. There's many aspects and I'm really proud of the progress that we're making. I would say in most cases, we've built a little float into the schedule, which is what project companies do.
We've gotten some things approvals and acknowledgments ahead of plan. But really right now it's around the prospectus and that tends to be an iterative process, but we are in discussions and well advanced on the draft and looking forward to getting that process initiated very soon. Thanks. And then one for Maryann on Yamal LNG. I appreciate all the additional disclosure, inevitably yet another question. I just wondered roughly how much in 2020 we should think about the unwind of that contract liability given that if everything keeps on going well it is quite a significant contributor to the margin? Thank you. So you're welcome James, and thanks for the comment on the disclosure. What we're anticipating right now fairly consistent with what I think we shared last quarter in a range of about $400 million to $500 million unwind in 2020. That's -- as we see it today that's what we're expecting. Not much change from where we thought as we shared that last quarter. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Hey, Doug a question on your Surface business. You said recently that would disparity E&C business. You can then focus your attention on the Surface. And now Surface becomes a obviously on a relative basis a larger part of RemainCo. Could you elaborate a bit on those comments about what you mean by focusing on it? Are you specifically targeting on the U.S. side of the business? And if so is this simply a question of your integrated strategy whether how it's going to work, or is there other self-help measures that you're looking to implement in there? David, good morning and thank you very much for the question. So I'm going to build up to the answer, if you don't mind. Just to remind everybody, that when we talk about our Surface Technologies business, 50% of that resides outside of the U.S. where we are very well positioned.
It is a very resilient business for us. And we have a very high degree of vertical integration and technology differentiation, in that part of the business. In that business as we indicated, in the earnings press release and prepared remarks, we are seeing an improvement in activity, in the early stages of improvement in pricing as well.
So that's, really important to keep in the context of the discussion. Certainly, we are doing things. And we'll continue to do things. You may recall, we made a small investment or acquisition in that space last year to help expand our capabilities, in the international Surface Technologies market.
And we'll continue to look to invest in that part of the business, which has the returns level that we feel, is appropriate, for our company, and for our shareholders. When we look at the North America market, look, we're all are waking up to a new market reality.
We certainly, had a different expectation. At this time last year, for the North America market in 2019. Unfortunately, that did not transpire. That has led to us having to revise our margin guidance. When I think forward to the surface business, there's really three key activities that we're undertaking, surface North America business, let me be more specific.
It's at the high-grading of our contracts, which is most evident by the fact that you saw our announcement, of our long-term agreement with Chevron, to be their provider of our products and services that we provide to them in the North America market.
That you'll see us do more of that. That's very important for us going forward as who we are associating with and the type of contracts that we have in place. Secondly, is we are looking -- or we will be moving forward with further restructuring simply to reflect the new market reality. And that is underway and that will continue.
And then finally, the point that you made earlier, which is our strategy is to transform the business, by really looking at it differentially. And taking all the lessons learned we've had from Subsea, where we've been quite successful.
And changing that from a product sale of business, to now a fully integrated services business and doing the same thing in the production market in North America. When you do that, David the point that maybe I had made previously about focus is it really takes a high-level of client engagement.
Typically when you -- to be able to change the commercial model with -- in an industry as we did in Subsea, it was not possible without very high-level endorsement from our clients. And I can't say, how appreciative I am, that they were able to see, and understand, and embrace, the need for change, and understood that we were bringing something unique into the market.
And that led to the early success and continued success that we were having in transforming the subsea market. It will require that same amount of engagement, attention and focus to be able to transform the North America surface market.
That being said, when I -- when we talk about the transformation of the North America surface market, that will be where we will begin, because of the share of magnitude. And let's say the criticality to our company to address that. But it is also applicable to the global Surface Technologies market.
We'll just start with a focus in North America. So Doug on the same line as you're talking about the high-grading of the contracts and the Chevron contract, how much does your work with say on Subsea side, translate over here onto the surface? Is there that same link?
I would assume there's a familiarity that Chevron has with you, having worked with them for geez probably decades here. Does that translate into that surface business? Is that how we should kind of think about that that's sort of where you have that advantage against some of your smaller competitors on North America market? Look, you have to compete against the peer group in any market in which you participate. So I think first and foremost, we have to be the best in what we do. But certainly having high-level client engagement, and in some cases intimate and long-term relationships in one part of the business or the other, allows us to be able to have some leverage as well. But in this particular instance and when we talk about this transformation, what we're most excited about is taking some proven subsea technologies and bringing those into the surface market.
Look, you've heard me say this before, we have to fundamentally change the way that we operate in the North America market and that means we have to focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. And we believe, we're going to bring it to the market and it will be embraced by the market an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 50% during the production phase of these assets. Great. Thanks Doug. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Alsford with Citigroup. Hi, there. And thanks for taking my questions. I've just got a couple. So just firstly, on the onshore and offshore E&C business, I was just wondering, given the awards that you've seen if you, Doug, could -- or maybe Catherine could update us on your views as to what your sort of medium-term margins will be for the portfolio? If that's changed at all, if you've got more confidence on that outlook now those awards have come through? That'll be my first question. Thanks. So, Michael, I just want to make sure that we're clear when we answer your question. You're talking about the offshore portion of onshore/offshore? No. In the division as a whole, Doug. The division as a whole. Okay. Catherine? Yes. Thank you for the question. Obviously, we are very pleased with the recent inbound we've had both on the Arctic LNG 2 as well as Rovuma, even though it's not in our numbers yet, but very, very pleased with the way the portfolio is shaping up in the onshore/offshore GBU.
Of course, Yamal has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our margin. It will wind down. Other projects will ramp up. The profile of margin of this project will be different. But when I look at the backlog, the mix we have, the LNG contribution, which, we've said is today at 56% of our backlog, we are very comfortable with the guidance we've given you in the past of 4% to 6% with a 200 bps improvement based on the LNG contribution.
As we continue progressing through the transaction, we'll have further engagement with our investors community. And, of course, we will look forward to giving you a little bit more color on what this margin will look like in the next few quarters and years. Thank you. Thank you. And sort of an unrelated follow-up really, I guess, is on the spin-off. I was wondering whether you can give any more color as to how you see the capital structures of both businesses, please. Thanks. Sure. Thanks, Michael, for the question. We will be providing some good color here coming as you see the prospectus looking into the way that we are anticipating these structures for both SpinCo and RemainCo. As we've said before, our intent is to create two investment-grade companies, both SpinCo and RemainCo and that continues to be our goal and objective as we go forward. So as you will see the prospectus, you'll have historical information and you will also have a view of the way that we see the capital structure being outlined. And that will be coming very soon. Okay. Look forward to. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning Two different questions. The first one, I just want to kind of go back to Subsea margins. And when you gave you guidance this year, I believe, vessel utilization is running higher than you expected and you're seeing a little better growth rates out of the service side of the business, which I also thought carries slightly higher margins.
So is there an offsetting factor that maybe you didn't see coming into the year when you issued the guidance that's not providing upside to that margin target? Has pricing been a little bit more competitive than you thought, or is there anything else that we should be thinking of? Sure, Dan. And I don't disagree with the comments that you made, so I won't repeat those. Keeping in mind when we look forward, there's really two things. One is, you kind of got to predict the timing of when you're going to meet critical milestones, which again, you can't do on a quarter-by-quarter basis, both in terms of as you're going to roll off a higher-quality backlog from the historical backlog and then, obviously, the new projects and the new inbound that's coming in.
It is clear and I have said this repeatedly and I know it maybe hasn't been consistent across the sector, but we are not seeing a material improvement in competitive pricing when it is vessel-only contracts or, if you will, day-rate-type contracts. That's why we've tried to stay out of that market unless we had a strategic reason or a true differentiation to be able to participate in those contracts.
Instead, what we've done is we've decided to stay focused on keeping that capacity available for our integrated projects, again many of which are targeting around a total project economic or total project return to where it's a true win-win for us and for our clients. And the ones that we've completed to date have all met or exceeded, their project returns. So we're building a really incredible and strong case of references. That's why we're seeing so many repeat orders from our clients as this business model continues to be adopted and recognized going forward.
So -- but look Dan, I'll repeat again and I know it hasn't -- I know others are saying different things. But we are not seeing as -- when it gets out there in just a -- let's say, a commoditized tender where you're voting where you're tendering on just a vessel or just a vessel day rate that we're seeing a strong -- a change in the pricing behavior.
We have a walk line. We will not go below that walk line, and we have lost awards. And you will see us lose awards in the future, because we are just not going to go to that level. These contracts are locked in for anywhere from two to three years, and there's no reason to do that at this point in time, particularly given the strength of our integrated offering and the fact that over 50% of our orders are coming from that integrated offering. Okay. All right. Thanks. That's helpful. My follow-up question is just on the cash return profile. Just given the backlog that you see, how are you thinking about the dividend growth or kind of bringing back the buyback? What's the outlook over the next maybe into 2020? Thanks for the question. Obviously as we continue to work through the separation of our two companies, we'll be refining the capital allocation strategies for both TechnipFMC and for SpinCo, and those policies will be clearly communicated to you. As Catherine said, she'll be looking forward to providing incremental color on SpinCo. And certainly for RemainCo, we'll give you greater color on the way that we see the capital allocation policy unfolding going forward. Okay. All right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jean-Luc Romain with CM-CIC Market Solutions. Jean-Luc, perhaps you're on mute. Jean-Luc, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Hey. Good afternoon. Good morning. Good morning, Kurt. Doug and Maryann, thanks for the incremental color here this morning. It's always an interesting dynamic on how investors kind of react to certain information. But I want to come back around to some discussion points Doug, and maybe give us some perspective as to your viewpoints on what is -- what you see happening and what your vision is for Subsea beyond 2.0. I think some investors out there might think that pretty much Subsea 2.0 and the benefit of that will have pretty much run its course in 2019, and kind of wondering out loud what the encore is to Subsea 2.0. So any perspectives on that I think would be helpful. Thank you, Kurt. So, I would reassure the community that Subsea 2.0 certainly will have not run its course in 2019. I think there's much more to be done. Obviously, we've talked before about the fact that the largest percentage of our FEED studies or front-end engineering studies now includes Subsea 2.0. We keep talking quarter-after-quarter about the deployment of additional Subsea 2.0 technology. I think there were at least two references to that in the press release this quarter.
But the real beauty of it, Kurt is as it runs through our organization, because the Subsea 2.0 philosophy, it's more than just about the equipment. It's about a change in the operating model for the way that we run the company, and it gives us much greater leverage across our cost base that we will be able to recognize and benefit from that going forward. So I would say we're actually far from seeing -- or just I'd say in the early stages of seeing the impact from the Subsea 2.0 technology. And on -- beyond Subsea 2.0, it's easy to get me wound up and I want to leave time for other questions.
But look we have a clear vision that goes far beyond Subsea 2.0. Subsea 2.0 was just the beginning. And I remind everyone that Subsea 2.0 was born a vision and most of the engineering was born before the merger and creation of TechnipFMC.
So now with the increased scope of Subsea activity, meaning including umbilical risers flowlines and installation, it is baffling how much we'll be able to do beyond Subsea 2.0. We have 14 discrete engineering programs underway right now supporting what will be and could be the building blocks for Subsea 3.0 and beyond. So Kurt I -- it's what gets me excited. It's what keeps me going if you will. There's a whole lot left to be done and we're just in the early stages of it. We're super proud of the creation of TechnipFMC. We're super proud of the iEPCI. We're super proud of 2.0, but it's really just the beginning. Great. That’s good color. And then maybe as a follow-up. I think in terms of the value proposition that Subsea 2.0 and maybe the next leg of what you just mentioned right? And correct me if you think I've been mistaken on this but it's -- part of it is accelerating the time to first cash flow for these projects for the oil companies. And the reason I bring that up is doesn't that kind of take you out of the realm of having to do a pre-bid and a buy process? And don't you think you have maybe a little bit more upside on margins than what you would have historically seen in the Subsea business? By nature I'm very conservative and I -- so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here but let me just be -- let me just stick to the facts. As you know most of our awards in iEPCI have been direct awards again as a result of early engagement with the client, working in an open and collaborative way to redesign the Subsea architecture, removing waste that was nothing but cost to the project and changing our execution model to where indeed we can have a significant improvement in the time to first oil, which really drives the project returns. And that's why we have been able to be so successful. Impossible to do unless you're a single company that controls all the levers. Very, very difficult to do otherwise. That's why we couldn't be more happy -- happier and we're seeing the benefit and the market is recognizing the benefit of the creation of TechnipFMC and the integrated Subsea solution. So more to come.
As I said, yes, there'll be more leverage from it, the greater the level of penetration into our backlog and into our business. We are demonstrating to our clients again on a repeat basis now the benefit of this type of methodology. And just if you think about the conversion rate, I mean it's just -- it's astronomical to think that we could in such a short period of time have such a significant conversion rate.
And in my prepared remarks it may not have been picked up on so I'll just repeat. When we talk about a 50% improvement in our inbound order rate in Subsea, the highest in over a decade but the market in the same time frame or the one-year time frame with the 50% improvement only improved by 20% one can interpret what that means in terms of the way that the market is recognizing our success. That's great color. Thanks Doug. Your next question comes from the line of Bertrand Hodée with Kepler Cheuvreux. Yes, hello. Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. When do you think you will provide the market with a Subsea margin for 2020? This will be my first question. I’m sorry I don’t think I have my microphone on. Bertrand, good afternoon, thank you for the question. We will report the -- we will be providing 2020 guidance when we have our Q4 and year-end earnings call. Okay. And one follow-up on Subsea services. You clearly pointed that Subsea services is gaining traction this year if I recall the slide plus 17%. When I look now at your backlog scheduling in Subsea for Q4 excluding Subsea services it looks already very strong at above $1.42 billion. So it looks like -- so it's implicit, I would say Subsea revenues for Q4 looks around $1.7 billion so quite a step up compared to Q3. And then where do you see Subsea services going forward? Is it well-established now at above $1.2 billion per year and you see further growth to that numbers possibly? Okay, Bertrand. I'll cover the first part and then I'll pass it over to Maryann. I want to thank you for recognizing and emphasizing the fact that when we look at our backlog schedule most of our Subsea Services businesses is not reflected in that backlog schedule because it's book-to-bill and it has to be added to it. So you're right. We're in a very strong position. Again, the benefit of having such a high level of inbound year-to-date and it being front-end loaded is actually a great benefit when you start to look forward at revenue coverage or the outlook for 2020. So you're right to point that out. I'll let Maryann add the additional color. Thanks, Bertrand. So just a few more items around your question for the fourth quarter. You know, our guidance on a full year basis is in a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, which likely we could trend towards the lower end of that range versus the top-end of that range. When you look at the backlog scheduled for the remaining three months or for the balance of 2019 you're sitting at about $1.4 billion. But just keep in mind our Subsea Services is not backlog. So you would need to add the estimate for Subsea Services.
And as we've kind of talked about numbers that several hundred million of backlog that you wouldn't see in that number this merely reflects the iEPCI or the project element. So services will be inbound in the quarter just like it is every other quarter. And that's how you would get to the full year range that you said in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Very clear. Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Thank you. First question has to do with the corporate expense. Maryann, you helpfully mentioned that fourth quarter would be $40 million to $45 million. And I appreciate that there was some IT spending previously, but even throughout the first nine months of the year it was materially above that level. Should we expect a $40 million to $45 million kind of run rate for the combined company beyond fourth quarter, or could you talk to how you see that developing? Yes. Sure. No appreciate the question and understand. Yes, you're right. From a run rate perspective kind of underlying that's been our trend and that's a trend for the combined company TechnipFMC. I certainly don't want to try to give you color right now on what the combined corporate expense would look like for SpinCo and TechnipFMC. Obviously, we'll give you some guidance around that. But from a run rate perspective, it's been fairly consistent with the exception of that sort of unique spend of that discretionary spend this year. Okay. Is there anything in that $40 million to $45 million that is related to preparation for the separation? You know, look it's hard to say unequivocally yes or no. Obviously, there's lots of people right in the organization who are working on the spin. But I think it's reasonable to say that there are certain activities that we are targeted to get the spin complete and meet our accelerated time line. I think that would be a fair assumption. Okay. Great. That’s all I had. Thank you very much. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our third quarter conference call. A replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 P.M. British Summer Time today. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you so much for joining us.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 proved to be a year of significant quote for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equaling $22.7 billion representing order growth of nearly 60% versus the prior year.
Our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new subsea technologies, our integrated subsea model iEPCI, and continued strength in both LNG and downstream project sanctioning. In Subsea full year inbound of $8 billion grew more than 50% versus 2018. This was the highest annual growth rate for our company in over a decade and more than two times the industry's growth. This growth was driven by iEPCI with our award value more than doubling prior year levels and accounting for more than 40% of total inbound orders. iEPCI is no longer just an alternative commercial model. It has become the model of choice for most of our customers.
In Onshore/Offshore, inbound orders grew almost 80% versus 2018 driven by more than $8 billion in LNG awards. This included the Arctic LNG 2 contract from Novatek, which builds upon the success of Yamal LNG. We were also a part of the winning consortium on ExxonMobil's Rovuma LNG Project, although we recorded limited inbound value ahead of the project FID expected this year.
Total company backlog now stands at $24.3 billion, an increase of 67% from the same time last year. Backlog grew across all segments with Onshore/Offshore increasing almost 90% versus 2018. Importantly, over half of our total backlog is scheduled for execution beyond 2020 providing us with unrivaled visibility.
Total company revenue in 2019 exceeded $13 billion benefiting from higher activity across all segments. Fully year Subsea revenue increased 14% in the year led by a 15% growth in Subsea Services and an increasing mix of integrated project activity. 2019 also marked the trough for segment revenue in Onshore/Offshore.
We have seen the revenue inflection and have now experienced three consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. And when excluding Yamal LNG total segment revenue increased more than 25% versus 2018, demonstrating solid growth and diversity in the remaining businesses.
And in Service Technologies, we experienced growth of more than 15% outside North America. Our international business now accounts for more than half of segment revenue. This strong growth more than offset the decline in North America with the total segment delivering a modest revenue increase.
Now let me turn to our market outlook and segment guidance for the coming year. Starting with Subsea, we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to midsized brown field projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects. Activity continues to be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana and strengthening activity in important markets such as Brazil and Africa.
We also anticipate that Subsea Services will again experience double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by digital monitoring services, well intervention, and asset refurbishment activities. This strength in both project activity in Subsea Services provides the framework for 2020 Subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019. However, this remains dependent upon the timing of one or two major project awards.
Turning to Subsea guidance, we see revenue in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 11%. In the first quarter we expect to see normal seasonal impact with margin improvement over the remainder of the year due to project timing and increased asset utilization.
For Onshore/Offshore we remain confident that additional LNG projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. The outlook for long-term demand requires this additional capacity. And just this morning, Sempra Energy announced the selection of TechnipFMC as the EPC contractor for their Energía Costa Azul LNG project. We are very proud to have been chosen for this strategic development.
Beyond LNG, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical, and biofuel project opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, particularly where we can benefit from early engagement or leverage our process technology portfolio.
For Onshore/Offshore guidance, we see revenue in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%, reflecting a lower contribution from Yamal LNG and an increasing contribution from projects in early stages. This guidance includes the impacts that we can estimate at this time for the coronavirus.
In Surface Technologies we anticipate double-digit revenue growth outside of North America, driven by market activity and supported by our high tier products and technologies. This growth serves as a strong foundation to our outlook as our international franchise makes up more than 50% of total segment revenue.
We anticipate North America activity to decline 10% versus 2019, which assumes an improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year. For Surface Technologies guidance, we expect revenue in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 12%. Maryann will cover all other guidance related topics later in this call.
In addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019, we have been taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond. The announced separation of our company is a bold visible step in this regard, but only represents one aspect of the transformation that is taking place in our company.
In Subsea, we are further optimizing our organization. To maintain market leadership, you need a combination of innovative technologies, fit for purpose assets, and global execution capabilities in order to deliver an integrated value chain. Part of our optimization efforts are focused on our assets, ensuring that we have the right assets with the right partners in the right geographies. And to achieve this, we will continue to right size and reallocate our assets to better align with the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery.
And we are also forming new strategic partnerships as demonstrated in our recent announcement with Allseas that can provide us with access to unique assets in a more capital efficient manner. These actions will lower our operating and capital costs and increase asset utilization and when coupled with the accelerating adoption of our next generation Subsea products and technologies that can help our customers reduce cost and cycle time for greater efficiency.
In Surface Technologies, we will leverage the strength of our international franchise in order to capitalize on the growth we anticipate in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the North Sea. In North America, we continue to transform our business by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
We are optimizing our services in operating geographies and when the economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit rather than simply optimize to the status quo. And in Onshore/Offshore, which will very soon become Technip Energies, we are transitioning into a new growth cycle, one that is underpinned by the strength of more than $15 billion in project backlog.
Our global teams have successfully executed complex projects in some of the most remote regions and we will continue to leverage this experience and intense focus on the work that lies ahead. And we will remain selective in our project choices, focusing on those prospects that offer the best opportunity for success for both our customers and TechnipFMC.
As you can see we are taking actions across all of our businesses. Importantly, these initiatives are supportive of our strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation. 2019 was another transformational year for TechnipFMC. In August, we announced we would further reshape our future through the separation of our company into two industry-leading diversified pure plays. The spinoff remains on track for completion in the second quarter.
As we have also shared, our new company Technip Energies plans to host a Capital Markets Day in Paris ahead of the transaction close. In 2019 we reinforced our position as the only fully integrated technology and services company. In Subsea we exceeded 100% growth in iEPCI inbound driven by the acceleration in the market adoption of our integrated model.
iEPCI, which served as the catalyst for the merger, accounted for more than 40% of the total Subsea inbound orders in 2019, and has become the model of choice for most of our customers. When combined with double-digit growth in Subsea Services, we delivered full year Subsea inbound of $8 billion, an increase of more than 50% versus 2018.
In Surface Technologies we grew more than 15% outside of North America when compared to the prior year with international revenues now accounting for more than half of the segment revenue. Our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook. We continue to demonstrate our global leadership in Subsea, LNG, and the international Surface market.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to further discuss our financial results. Thanks Doug. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $5.43 per diluted share.
The total after-tax charges and credits largely reflect non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $2.3 billion, which we disclosed earlier this month, and are detailed in our earnings release, evaluation allowance of $108 million impacting the tax provision, separation cost of $47 million, and a net restructuring credit of $1 million, which included a gain of $83 million in Subsea related to the consolidation of the PLSV joint venture. These charges reflect the specific actions we are taking to better position our company for 2020 and beyond as Doug outlined in his remarks.
Included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulted from increased liability to joint venture partners of $0.22 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.13 per diluted share. The FX impact which is included in corporate expense was almost entirely driven by the significant devaluation of the Angolan Kwanzaa in the period.
These two items impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.35 in the period and if excluded, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.38 per diluted share. And lastly, with regard to internal controls, we have fully remediated all previously disclosed material weaknesses. This will be reflected in our upcoming annual filings.
Turning to the operational highlights in the quarter, Subsea delivered fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, a 21% increase versus the prior year quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in both project and services activity in the period. iEPCI project activity continues to represent an increasing share of revenue, reflective of the well-established market trend towards integrated project development.
The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installations, well intervention, and asset refurbishment activities. Subsequently, Subsea Services revenue was essentially unchanged despite the seasonal impact of weather. And adjusted EBITDA for Subsea was $185 million with a margin of 12.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved modestly from the prior year as cost reduction activities and project completions offset the impact of the more competitively priced backlog.
Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million with a margin of 14.2%. Operating results in the period benefited from the strength in execution across the portfolio.
And finally in Surface Technologies revenue of $408 million was down 2% versus the prior year, whilst sequentially we saw modest improvement as we benefited from the strength in the international markets offset by the lower North American activity. Sequentially adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% increased to 150 basis points and reflects the benefit of a higher international mix of business and cost reduction activities.
Turning to cash, we have now generated positive operating cash flow for six consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $459 million of cash flow from operations some of which resulted from the timing differences between project milestones and vendor payments. Operating cash flow was $849 million for the full year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $86 million in the period.
Our full year spend was $374 million when excluding the $80 million impact of the sale-leaseback transaction for the dive support vessel we recorded earlier in the year. We paid $58 million in shareholder dividends in the quarter and for the full year we made $233 million in total dividend payments. Additionally, we made a distribution of $119 million to the Yamal joint venture partners. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash on hand.
Now I would like to provide additional details around our 2020 financial guidance. With regard to our revenue guidance, please note that the segments reflect the new business parameters as reflected in our separation announcement. Businesses with approximately $120 million of revenue in 2019, most of which came from Surface Technologies are now included in our Onshore/Offshore segment in 2020.
Let me highlight the revenue coverage from backlog. In Subsea, at the midpoint of our guidance, approximately 71% of our anticipated 2020 revenue is expected from backlog scheduled for execution in the current year. We anticipate the remaining revenue, approximately $1.8 billion will be met by book in turn activity from both Subsea Services and projects. Subsea Services revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion in the year, only a modest amount of this revenue potentially is in backlog today, and most services orders quickly convert into revenue.
In Onshore/Offshore, backlog supports approximately 86% of our expected revenue for 2020 at the midpoint. We anticipate approximately $400 million to $500 million in revenue from Yamal LNG.
Turning to the remaining guidance items for 2020, we expect corporate expense net to be $180 million to $190 million for the full year when excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect net interest expense of $80 million to $90 million for the full year when excluding the impact of revaluation of partners' mandatorily redeemable financial liability. The increase from the prior year is largely the result of lower interest income associated with the company's cash balances.
We forecast the full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%. Capital expenditures for 2020 should be no greater than $450 million and we expect cash flow from operating activities to exceed $1 billion with the back half of the year being a little stronger than the first half.
In closing, Subsea revenue benefited from increased activity in both projects and services, while order growth reflected the acceleration in market adoption of our new Subsea Technologies and integrated Subsea model. Onshore/Offshore revenue has clearly inflected from the 2018 trough as evidenced by the achievement of our third quarter of sequential revenue growth, while in Surface Technologies we continue to leverage the strength of our international franchise.
Lastly we generated nearly $850 million in operating cash flow in 2018 with positive results in all four quarters. Looking ahead, we begin 2020 with more than $24 billion of secured backlogs. We have strong revenue coverage for the year in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. We see revenue growth in all three segments at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range.
As importantly, we are proactively taking actions across all our businesses in support of our focus on market leadership and continued business transformation, and in 2020 we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1 billion.
Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Evans from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is actually on Surface obviously a decent Q4, the guidance pretty good, quite high restructuring charges, I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail there on what you're doing to drive improved performance as we head into next year and what deals from a size of the opportunity is?
And secondly around just Subsea, I mean I think the guide for 2020 is maybe a little bit weaker than had been expected. I mean could you just clarify any reason for the deviation? And just actually an update on comments on the external environment, things like pricing, et cetera and also just the gap between margins on integrated awards and normal awards and when we see that benefit really coming through your business in the results you deliver? Thanks. James, I will, I think that set the record for the most questions packed in a short period. Thank you very much. I think I captured four if not five there. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to walk us a little bit through the Subsea margin guidance, because I actually think that will in some ways address most of the other parts of your question and quite frankly maybe is the most prevalent and what is most new at this point.
And if you don’t mind James, I'm going to take just a little bit of time on this and I think it is important that we kind of walk through the progression of this cycle and what ended up resulting in our 2020 guidance. So as you know, for TechnipFMC we had tremendous inbound order growth of more than 50% in 2019.
And by the middle of the year, following the very robust orders of the first half, our integrated projects or iEPCI was representing more than 50% of the total Subsea orders. And at that time, I stated my confidence that 2019 would likely more to the margin trough at that time.
However, I also noted that 2020 would be a transition year with the main obviously question for us being more about the progression of the margin improvement. If we go back to what we talked about a few times as an iEPCI company and the only integrated company, we have the benefit of being involved in the whole lifecycle, but that also means that the conversion of the inbound or the orders into revenue happens over a longer period of time.
So again, we first have to design and build equipment and this takes 18 to 24 months before we can install and commission, which can take up to another 18 months, meaning that the orders from the first half of 2019 won't really drive margin improvement until late 2020 and beyond, as I had stated in earlier calls.
I've also said the inception of the integrated business model that we will continue to prioritize our assets for these iEPCI projects and report our alliance partners. This was quite important, as it has been a very competitive period when bidding only day rate contracts on vessels. And while I was clear that this strategy would result in lower utilization during this period, we ultimately will benefit from a higher quality backlog driven by direct awards from both our alliance partners and those that we can convert [ph] from integrated feed to iEPCI projects.
And we now have delivered on the first part of this strategy as evidenced by the strength of our 2019 inbound. Our Subsea guidance that was issued last night is also consistent with this message. And while it is still possible that 2019 was the absolute margin trough, the significant ramp in activity we are experiencing not only impacts our company directly, but also our suppliers and the supply chain in general.
The elasticity of the supply base is not proven to be as robust as that of our own company. Therefore we are experiencing incremental cost to strengthen our supply chain. These efforts are well underway.
As these transitory costs come down, and as we move further into the offshore campaigns, we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our stated guidance, driven in part by the higher utilization of all of our assets. It is important to emphasize our strategy and outlook remains unchanged and we are confident we will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020 and we will remain confident that we will deliver margin expansion over the coming years.
With that, I'll pass it to Maryann to talk a little bit about the restructuring charges that we have announced today. Sure. James, thanks. I think your first question was referencing the restructuring charges in North America. As you've probably seen, we've recorded about $37 million directly attributable to Surface. You heard Doug say we're taking a very focused approach and ensuring that we are exiting businesses and product lines where we are not meeting the profitability there.
So that charge that we recorded in the quarter represents the exit of certain product lines and certain headcount reductions. And as you can imagine, that is largely North America related, so that we see performance improvement deliver the margin improvement and the success that we are focused on for 2020. So that's what you're seeing being recorded in the third quarter, again largely attributed to North America. I appreciate the answers, and I think I probably [indiscernible] so I won't ask a follow up. Thank you. Your next question comes from Angie Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Angie. Good morning. So I appreciate the detail on the Subsea margin Doug, that was really very helpful, but maybe if we could ask a little bit more on that. On the comments you said, strengthen your supply chain, which is obviously very fair, is that the occurrence that we'll see only are predominantly in the first half and the second half we could see a larger ramp with both the awards you saw in 2019 and the elimination of those additional costs? Maybe talked us through 2020 and going into 2021 on that margin ramp? Sure, Angie. So maybe and an analogy I could use is, we came out of the gate really, really strong. And again, our growth in 2019, we doubled the industry growth, so okay, that could be translated into obviously an expansion in our market share. And all of that combined at the same time has to be translated through this - has to trickle through the supply chain if you will. We've been working with the supply chain. We've resolved most of the matters. We're very well advanced. I don't want to leave any doubt. And I appreciate the follow up question that the matters are well under control.
I'm just pointing to the fact of going back to six - almost nine months ago now, and the comments about the 2019 being the trough in the margin and where we came out with the guidance, which was I think just a small rounding here below that was really just to emphasize and put a little bit of color around what's actually happening. So to your question, yes we see – we will have the normal seasonal activity decrease in activity in the first quarter. There is no way around that. That just has to do with certain geographies at which there's very little Subsea activity because of the sea conditions in the first quarter.
But we would expect to see a ramp then through the end of the year and an exit rate that would be more reflective of the type of margins that we will be able to generate from this much high quality and high level of inbound that we had in the first half of 2019. Okay, thank you, very helpful. And then I mean, if you have any color on the exit rate, feel free to share, but then I would also ask on Subsea orders and the outlook for - I mean, obviously, you've had a very impressive year in 2019 on iEPCI and if you could talk about the opportunities for iEPCI in 2020, as far as total and as a percentage of inbound orders? And then you made the remark of course that Subsea orders could approach 2019 levels, but is dependent upon one or two major awards and maybe if you could give us some further color there? Sure, in terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it Angie is, it is kind of - it's just our way of doing business going forward. We, so I think that we've somewhat established that and I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that which I guess is somewhat flattering. Where we go in 2020 versus 2019? I see no reason why the percentage of iEPCI would not be at a similar greater level than it was in 2019. Again, we have a very healthy portfolio of integrated feed studies. It's important to remember that our ability when we convert those integrated feed studies to integrated iEPCI projects, these become direct awards to our company.
We also have an expanding list of exclusive iEPCI alliances. We added two more in 2019 with two additional customers, meaning 100% of their integrated work is coming - or 100% of their Subsea work is coming to us through our new integrated model. So with that, I would expect over time, as we've clearly demonstrated in just two years from zero to close to 50% of our business being integrated, you know a trend that is very likely to continue, not just for us, but eventually for the rest of the industry as well.
So, you know, I think that continues to look quite strong. In terms of the absolute order level, always hard to tell, hard to state at this point in the year, and you know we don't give absolute guidance on order intake. It's very difficult given the size of our projects and the difficulty to time them within a particular 12-month period.
But what we do show is an opportunity set over the next 24 months. We publish that. We update that regularly. It remains robust. But I remind you that a large percentage of our awards don't show on that list. That is the projects that are, let's say, publicly available to us into our competition or some of our competition that would qualify to do that work.
We have that exclusive set of proprietary opportunities, again, from our alliance partners, or from the iEPCI integrated feed studies, excuse me, that can turn into direct award iEPCIs if we reach a certain project economic threshold that benefits both the client as well as ourselves, typically driven by an accelerated time to first oil.
When we look at it, and that's the reason I made the comment, I did, yes 2019 was a very robust year. Some things obviously we would have to continue to have a very strong year and we would have to have some things go right in 2020, to be able to match that level of order inbound. We had some billion dollar plus awards in 2018 and in 2019. We may not see those billion plus awards in 2020, although we do have a portfolio of large opportunities, that if they all came together and the timing all happen, by the 31st of December of 2020, we could be in a very similar range as we are going forward from 2020 versus 2019. Great, thanks. I'll turn it over. Your next question comes from Lillian Starke from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to, if you could provide a bit of color on the operating capital guidance? And I recognize some of that may be partly driven by cash advances that you might expect from clients, but I was just wondering if there's also any underlying improvement that you're seeing on your own working capital dynamics? And then the second question I had is on the back of what we're seeing on the coronavirus, is there anything - I know you are working with certain Chinese yards, is there any delays or any concerns at this point in time? Okay, sure. So, thank you, Lillian. I'm going to make a comment around the coronavirus and then I'm going to pass it to Catherine MacGregor, who's with me, and as you know, is the CEO-elect for Technip Energies and has been very involved and is currently the President of the GBU for Onshore/Offshore and is very involved in those projects. So I'll let her add some additional color. And then Maryann will add some additional color around the cash flow comment that you made, which I appreciate you pointing it out.
We're very proud of the progress that we've made, to continue progress that we've made, and a good progression, and I'll just remind you that we are a business of projects and there will always be new projects coming in and projects closing out. And we are very pleased with the trend of our cash flow and the projections that we were able to share for 2020.
Just in terms of the coronavirus, look first and foremost we are deeply concerned for those who have been impacted. We are very much monitoring the situation and have put in place the appropriate actions to try to ensure the health and wellbeing of all of the 37,000 women and men of our company, and the many, many more contractors that we work with in the various sites and the various projects around the world.
I'll let Catherine again put some additional color around these, so maybe an example or two of what's actually happening on the projects. Yes, thank you. And indeed, we are in light of the context of the coronavirus working very actively, and I would say collaboratively as well with our customers, but also with our subcontractors and with our partners to make sure that we take appropriate measures to really mitigate the impact on our project. So what we said is that the guidance that we gave you on Onshore/Offshore reflects what we see today as the impact of the coronavirus.
So to give you a little bit of example of some of the things we're doing, again working very collaboratively with our customers and with our suppliers in one of our projects. For example, we were able to transfer some engineering hours from one of our Chinese based subcontractors to one of our operating center. In other projects, some orders were placed or were diverted from a Chinese supplier to a European based supplier. And we have a number of actions like these that we are able to take, again working as productively as possible with our partners, suppliers and customers. Lillian hi, Maryann here, and maybe just a little more color around the cash flows and again, thanks for your question. I think you know and certainly given the backlog that we have and the significant project component, our objective is certainly to be cash flow positive or at minimum cash flow neutral against the entire portfolio. So I think what you see happening as we continue to execute along that backlog is that continued improvement and certainly working capital is a piece of that. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for the color. Your next question comes from Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Thanks, good afternoon. Good morning, Sean. So, maybe to follow up on the cash flow guidance, on a traditional basis you implied more than $500 million of free cash flow sounds very positive. Can you maybe just put some parameters around the influence of prepayments on LNG awards, so a little more granularity with respect to working capital and then just how you see the impacts of cash from financing with the MRL in 2020 on cash? Sure Sean. So again, I pass to Maryann to provide the more detailed answer, but I just think it's important that we – you know we are a projects business. We will always have new projects coming in and advanced payments, as you well pointed out from those, but we also gave 2020 cash flow guidance. So I think what you'll be able to see very clearly is the continued improving trend, that is also reflected in our guidance. Maryann? Sure, Sean. And maybe a little more color around the MRL. I think as you asked there, and you know, you can actually see it when we produce the 10-K, but our MRL today sits at about $300 million. So at a minimum, assuming no other further changes on the project, that outflow will happen to the partners at the time at which both TechnipFMC and its partners decide for that payment to happen. So that happens in the financing section as you well noted, but that outflow will happen.
I think the second part of your question again, was around working capital, and we certainly won't try to get as granular there. But as you know, a big piece of the changes in 2019 were and as we talked about that, the big outflows that we saw from Yamal as we continue to progress toward completion of that project, I think you can expect that the outflows from Yamal will be much less than 2020 than they were in 2019. Okay, that's very fair, thank you for that. And then, Doug's comments were interesting when he mentioned the supply chain not proven to have the elasticity of your company and that's led to some incremental costs that are perhaps transitory. Does any of that carry into the CapEx budget for 2020? I was hoping we could maybe get a little more granularity of that $450 million that you're planning for this year. Thanks, Sean. No, not directly from the supply chain considerations. The capital budget, which you'll see reflected in the capital budget is those incremental commitments we may – that are part of particularly the large Subsea projects. So when it's a Greenfield project, and we are providing the full iEPCI, including the life of field contract, which we call iLOF or integrated life of field contract, most of those come with a certain level of capital expenditure in order to support a 15, 20, 25, even 30-year life of field Subsea contract. And if you think about it this way, that's kind of the tooling and the assets that are required to go out if there's any need to be able to recover for inspection, for repair, for monitoring services associated with those Subsea installations. Got it, very interesting, okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from Bertrand Hodée from Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is open. Hello, everyone. Two questions if I may, one on Subsea margin. Thank you, Doug for providing a kind of the main moving part, but can you quantify what is the impact of those supply chain incremental costs you're seeing for 2020? And also, can you give us some guidelines around the utilization rate of the vessels you expect for 2020? And then I will have a follow-up question on the coronavirus? Okay, sure. Thank you, Bertrand. So let me cover the first one, which was to quantify the impact of the supply chain. Look, I think it's again I want to make sure it's very well understood. It's well under control. We took these orders in the first half of 2019. We started placing the orders with the supply chain during the first half of the year. We have a complete understanding. This isn't a new discovery. We have a complete understanding of what's happening and we took that into account and reflected that in our guidance.
So hard to quantify the exact impact, but I guess you can tell by the guidance level that we provide, you know, it's not a huge number and it's well under control, which is why we were able to provide the guidance and the confidence that we have in the guidance for 2020 of at least 11%.
In terms of the guidelines around utilization, again, we don't really see utilization improving much until the second half, and really not until 2021/2022. And that's when we'll see a meaningful impact in the overall improvement of the utilization of the fleet tied to those iEPCI awards. Okay, thank you, and then the follow up question on the on the coronavirus. So, if I understood well, your guidance in Onshore/Offshore already includes some of the impact that you can estimate at this time for the coronavirus. Can you help us understand what was this impact that you've currently included, is it potentially in terms of revenues being deferred or in terms of margins? Yes, because obviously, we are not quite ready to give you a number, because what we've done is that, we looked at the project portfolio and on the aggregate estimated the impact on some of the internal milestones that we could see moving and made a judgment to give you the revenue guidance in 2020 to really integrate all of these impacts. So, we won't give you and we don't have really a breakdown at this stage and I think you've summarized it very well, that our current view of our revenue, the guidance we gave you integrate the impact that we see today of the virus. Okay, fair enough. Thank you. You are welcome. Your next question comes from Vaibhav Vaishnav from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Hey, guys, good morning. I guess I was trying to expand on Sean's question. So can you help us think about the $450 million of CapEx, what are the bigger buckets you mentioned, life of projects, but if you can expand more on that and boats and what are the other – typical bigger buckets? Sure, I'll provide you some additional color. So there's a certain level of maintenance CapEx associated with the existing asset base, both the manufacturing assets as well as the fleet. The increment and the only increment that you're really seeing is tied to that tremendous inbound growth that we pointed out in 2019 and the continued investment to support the growth rate of our Subsea services business, which as I pointed out, grew substantially in 2019 and we expect it to repeat in 2020. Okay, and I guess, you have talked about owning boats as being not essential for the Subsea business. Can you talk about what are your latest thoughts if there are any - if there are ways or if you have any thoughts around divesting that piece of the business? Well, I think the whole industry needs to restructure and really get focused on driving through cycle returns, not just peak returns. And in order to do that, we have to look at the capital structure of our industry and we have to look at the capital structure of our individual companies. As in many other attributes, particularly in the Subsea business, we believe that we are leading by example.
So you know, we took some very decisive move. We announced some asset sales during the last year and we will continue – and we announced a very important partnership as well with Allseas and we will continue to look at ways that we can work collaboratively with anyone at all in order to ensure success for the industry going forward, and once again make it a very attractive place for the investment community to put their money, because of the type of margins that we'll be able to demonstrate on a through cycle basis.
If we keep looking at it individually as to the own size of our assets, regardless of what type of assets they are, we tend to end up in a situation where the industry is over capitalized, and we don't generate the type of returns that are required. So, we are very open to working with anybody and we have demonstrated that, and we will benefit from that in terms of the type of returns that we'll be able to generate because of that type of behavior. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Wilson from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, good morning, Doug and Maryann. I'd like to ask about an update on the Brazil riser and I think that the situation flagged by Petrobras, can you just give us an update there Doug and Technip's involvement in it? Sure. So, the issue as we know is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the presalt reservoirs and the presalt composition of the hydrocarbons that are produced. And therefore, we see an accelerated rate of stress corrosion cracking in that environment.
Why am I emphasizing that? This is a well-known physical phenomenon. It happens anywhere where there is steel placed in a certain condition, where this type of event can occur. By the way, a standing structure, a bridge if you will, made out of steel is experiencing stress corrosion cracking, it's not, you know, it's absolutely well-known and understood. When the presalt was developed, because of the high Co2 content, and the fact that a flexible riser if the when the annulus is flooded can accelerate that phenomenon. So it's a well-known phenomenon, it just becomes accelerated.
So look, the industry – this is an industry phenomenon. We are obviously the leader in the flexible pipe, both technology and certainly in the install base and continue to be. So we've been working very actively actually with industry, but and very much directly with Petrobras and making sure that we could clearly understand the phenomenon in this condition, and then be able to model it, so that we could predict the - let's say the impact of the effects of the stress corrosion cracking, whilst at the same time and in parallel, developing solutions that will be less, will be more resistant or even stress corrosion cracking, SCC if you will, stress corrosion cracking free. And that's exactly the process - and that's what we're doing. So it's multi-dimensional as I am pointing out.
We are well advanced on the first element, which is now being able to model and predict and working very closely with Petrobras on that. So it's very - it's a combined issue and it's now a well understood issue and we're able to model it.
At the same time, we're developing the solutions hand in hand with Petrobras, and we're very pleased, and they are - more importantly, they are very pleased with the progress that we're making. We just had a review on the subject matter two weeks ago with the Petrobras leadership team, and we'll continue to work with them in an open and collaborative way to solve this phenomenon and ensure that we will have a product that they'll be able to use across their portfolio, because it's important to understand what we're really talking about is a small application of flexible pipe.
If you look at the total amount of flexible pipes sold, this is a very small portion of that total market that is impacted. It's not all of Brazil. It's not all of Petrobras. It is not all of presalt. It's in a very specific, isolated situation. That being said, we're committed to solving it, as I pointed out, and are making good progress in that situation. In regards to the rest of the business around our flexible product line, it continues unchanged if you will, and continues to be quite robust. Excellent, thank you very much Doug. And then one short follow up, Maryann, just in 4Q cash build was about $400 million of additional contract liabilities came in the working capital, I just wondered if you could give a split between Subsea and Onshore/Offshore for that? So the cash flow change in the quarter as you pointed out is largely driven by the change in contract liabilities. And as you know, we try not to be so segments specific, it gets to a level of granularity. But if you think about some of the major moves in the projects, and you can think about how they might be as we're progressing through in the early stages, both Doug and Catherine have talked about that, it might be helpful. But certainly milestone payments, as I mentioned, we try to stay ahead of that cash flow curve. And that indicates obviously, we've got we don't - we've got work to complete. You can think about the size of some of the major projects that we've announced recently and that might help in the thinking about the separation between what is Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. Okay, thank you. I'll turn it over. Your next question comes from Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions from me, please. The first one is just a reference to your tremendous success on winning integrated SPS and SURF projects. The industry seems to have embraced the solution and yourself and another big competitor seems to be mopping up a lot of the market share.
So can you talk about what other competitors are doing or reacting to this seeming increasing take up of integrated solutions and how they're trying to compete with you on that front? And then my second question is bigger picture, just – can you talk more in general about your technology leadership in Subsea? You touched on your flexible 2.0 program, but also want to understand and some other emerging technologies like 20K play, how important will this technology be for you to sort of maintain or even start to win more market share as the tendering pipeline progresses? Thanks. Thanks, Amy. And look, I'll be brief on the first one, on the - what is the competition doing around iEPCI? I am sure they're talking about it. I'm sure they're trying to figure that out right now. It's not evident to me what they're doing. But what is clearly evident is, this the way that the market is going. We're real thankful that in 2016 we had the vision. We're even more thankful that in 2017 we completed the transaction, and obviously most thankful for the recognition by our clients in the amount of over $7 billion of integrated awards that they've given us thus far. The vast majority of those being direct awarded to our company, so we're just very thankful for the situation we're in.
In regards to technology leadership in Subsea, it's obviously an important - it's one of the important elements. The commercial model has been usually successful. But the ability be able to merge that with a technology program that not only drives the expansion of the Subsea market in an example like 20K that you pointed out, which is very important indeed. It also can be fundamentally changed the way that we conduct our business or our operating model, both in terms of our physical footprint, as well as in terms of our assets.
So Subsea 2.0 has had a profound impact on our manufacturing footprint in a positive way, if you will, from a cost point of view or from a returns point of view and I strongly believe that Subsea 3.0 and beyond will have the same type of impact on the installation capabilities going forward for ourselves and ultimately for the industry. All right, that's very interesting. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we only have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is open. Good morning or afternoon and thank you very much for fitting me in here. I appreciate that. So Doug, I just wanted to maybe follow up real quick to make sure I understand correctly how you were going through that very detailed explanation of the transition year of 2020 and the impact on the Subsea margins related to that transition of much significant backlog flowing through the system.
So would it be safe to say that maybe at a baseline of the margin that you have in backlog that would be maybe 100 basis points higher than that minimum point of guidance that you've provided, and therefore the difference is all that incremental costs that are incurring through the supply chain to make sure you can execute on these projects, is that a fair way to maybe look at that? Certainly a creative way to put me in the corner, Kurt. I'm not going to fundamentally disagree with your statement. Okay, that's fair enough. And then on the - just the last one here on Surface Tech, when the split does occur, that will be roughly 20%, looks like 20% of the Technip FTI EBITDA. I found interesting your commentary about the North American market where you thought the second half would be stronger than the first half. That seems to be running a little bit countered. There is some other commentary that we've been picking up throughout the earnings period. So I just want to get your perspective on how you see that evolving and just want to try to calibrate that with other things we've been hearing? Yes Kurt, look I'm not going to pretend that I have a crystal ball that others don't on the North American market and doing it for too long. I don't think anybody's ever gotten it right over a 12-month period. It's just way too dynamic of a market. Most of our competitors are now only giving H1 guidance. And yes, we could have went that route as well.
We put out the view that we understand from our perspective, understanding kind of our market position and what we're trying to do in the market. But I think like everybody else we'll see how the first half develops and we'll come out with updated guidance for the second half when it's more appropriate. Okay, and I think just to finish off on here, you've indicated that there's an opportunity to take the integrated model from Subsea into Surface, just want to get an update from you on how that may be progressing? So thank you very much, it's a great note to end on. It is going well, and we’ll be talking a lot more about that at the TechnipFMC Analyst Day later this year. Right, thank you. And if I could operator, I've never done this before, but I'm going to ask a question because I'm a little bit surprised, we didn't get a question around. We just announced an LNG award as part of my prepared remarks. The award came just maybe one hour before this call. That is a huge, huge element for our company and for Technip Energies going forward. So Catherine, could you tell us a little more about the award that Doug announced earlier today? Now this is a setup. Thank you, Doug for your question. I’ll just say a couple of words to say that, in general, we are still extremely positive about the LNG outlook for future demand, additional infrastructure will be needed. Additionally, our own positioning within the LNG market is very strong and not to come across as overly confident, but there are only a few credible players that can tackle these complex LNG projects. And so today, the announcement from Sempra Energy of this award is really coming as a great satisfaction.
We are very, very pleased with this award. It’s the result of very early engagement with our customer’s recognition of our global LNG track record, also experience in Mexico, which we had before. So we are very, very pleased and looking forward to deliver on this project. So thanks for the question. And I would like to turn the call back over to Matthew Seinsheimer for closing remarks. Thank you. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call. The replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relation’s team. Thanks for joining us. Operator, you may now end the call. Thank you.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Matthew Seinsheimer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon, and welcome to TechnipFMC's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued yesterday can be found on our website.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we’ve dialed in from different locations across the globe, another side of the impact the COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives.
Two months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those two months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shifting in OPEC policy and the sharp selloff in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, for others will lead to real lasting change. Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment, and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape.
Over the short-term, we're taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs, and preserve liquidity. First amongst these is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve, and we are taking a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures, such as social distancing, staggered shifts, and health screening to ensure safer work environment, and strict self isolation procedures for employees who may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines.
We're also maintaining business continuity by providing our employees with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes, and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned.
Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity.
Second, on April 1st, we announced a series of cost reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment, and Corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company.
The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction to my salary and a 20% reduction to the Executive Leadership team through the end of the year. Our Directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%. And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution.
Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into two diversified pure-plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the latent stage of separation activities. However, the strategic rationale remains unchanged and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the two companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover.
Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must adapt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition.
Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely align with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success. The change will be most profound for us in Subsea. We're taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization, and reduced cycle times.
We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 40% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice and our Subsea Studio digital platform will host 70% of our frontend and system engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultrafast digital development.
iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adapt will stay ahead in the new energy landscape. Meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader.
Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward.
TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet. $22 billion, that's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We're not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020 with the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond.
The size and duration of our backlog in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryan will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future.
Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today we have three LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results: Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; Coral Floating LNG, which is now more than two years into project delivery, and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently underway, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond.
While the near term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG in particular remain strong given its critical role as a transition fuel.
We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Sempra’s Costa Azul, which the customers are indicating will be sanctioned in the near term. Rovuma remains an important project for Technip Energies. And despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed.
In addition to these projects, we were involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East and we have recently secured FEED rules on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at three or close to four, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with projects selectivity foremost in our mind, as we consider future opportunities.
Turning to downstream, this sector typically proves to be more resilient during downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019 we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound. And we remain laser focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion.
And our strong foothold in energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front end loading services for future NEXBTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste’s partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long held alliance with BP to include the Infinia technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste.
Moving to Surface Technologies, in North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now hold for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics, in light of recent events additional deferrals are likely.
We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities. Our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries, and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We therefore anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America.
Moving to Subsea, we believe that deepwater will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our Subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24 month timeframe. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities. We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months.
In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities which often lead to direct iEPCI project awards. And beyond project activity, we generate additional revenue from Subsea Services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment in operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services activity as a result of the expected shift by some clients from greenfield developments to brownfield intervention.
In our earnings release yesterday we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio.
In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient Subsea Services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation, in lieu of traditional guidance, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for Subsea revenue and margin.
Turning to revenue first, our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We're still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated the record inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us.
It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues for future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond.
In Subsea Services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the Subsea installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth.
And lastly, with respect to book and turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source, could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019. Next the factors impacting Subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore less book and turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions.
Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progress through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact and travel restrictions, leaving us with a limited flexibility to mitigate costs refine/replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term.
Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we're advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our Subsea outlook for the remainder of the year.
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies, we are relatively insulated in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business, the resilience and maturity of the projects in backlog and our diversified global footprint.
To-date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the year has been impacted by: First, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of which we be believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 are partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we're revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which still remains at or above our 2019 results.
Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix.
And finally, Surface Technologies, our shortest cycle business has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- or during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020.
In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings. Most of this will occur in North America where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe. With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year when excluding charges based on our current outlook.
Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months.
Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic crisis, we're responding to all three on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We're spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead.
And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We're also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near term challenges.
We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cross reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and Executive and Director compensation. We're uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we're doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC. Through everything we have faced, they have shown a level of strength and resiliency that is nothing short of inspiring in these most difficult times.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann? Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect non-cash charges for goodwill impairment in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period.
We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts which are not specifically called out but included in our adjusted results.
Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share, and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These two items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share.
We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year.
I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year.
Turning to liquidity, we had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31st. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from which just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC.
Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.
Operator, you may now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is open. So I appreciate you making the best efforts here to fill in parameters for 2020 where you have visibility over just pulling all of it. It's very helpful and I certainly appreciate the uncertainty given COVID and the shifting plans on -- for your customers on their projects. Given the outlook there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash, minimizing cash burn. You’ve reduced the dividend, you cut CapEx, you're taking cost out, but there also likely be some cash drag in 2020 that -- to effect that. Perhaps prepays are less in this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity, where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021? Sean, thank you very much for the question and I think you framed it very well. I think you hit on many of the key elements and the parameters that we're dealing with as a company and more broadly that the industry is currently dealing with. And as you pointed out, we've taken very swift and decisive steps to ensure that our utmost focus is -- always has been and remains on the liquidity and the strength of our company.
As you know, we have a very strong balance sheet and we have a very strong backlog. And those provide the key foundations on which for us to continue to operate. At the same time, we'll move forward with aggressive cost reduction activities and some of the other items that you noted. I'll hand it over to Maryann to add some additional details around the subject. Maryann? Thanks Doug. Yes, thanks, Sean. So look, based on the outline of our segment performance and the views that Doug has provided and that incorporates all of that. We expect cash flow from operations to be positive but it will be below the $1 billion that we previously provided or we previously guided. Our guidance assumes then that certain inbound projects along with their corresponding milestones as you've outlined, and payments we would receive in 2020.
And as we shared, we are seeing some deferrals of those project awards and therefore obviously some cash flow impact of those deferrals. A good example is one that Doug talked about, that’s the ExxonMobil's Rovuma project being delayed into 2021. But as we further develop the segment views and have greater clarity on the range of outcomes, we'll update our cash flow projection. But again, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be positive this year but it will be below the $1 billion previously guided. Got it. I appreciate that. Thanks for all that feedback. And then in the opening comments, I thought that the ones around digital, with Subsea Studio were interesting. It's becoming a consistent theme this earning season. These initiatives aren't new but they're getting highlighted, given the pressure your customers are facing. Could you maybe elaborate on the impact of these types of initiatives around further reducing FEED cycle times, manufacturing cycle times, ultimately, time to first oil for customers. Is there any more you can elaborate around how that can help drive project economics? With pleasure, Sean, thank you for the question. So, we have been systematically attacking the cycle time of Subsea since the creation of TechnipFMC. It was one of the fundamental reasons for creating the company. We've done that very successfully in the execution phase. We're now able to execute projects with a 50% reduction in the normal -- in the time that it would take to do those projects and using a traditional approach. And we've done that on a consistent basis.
Hence the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realize that we need to attack the front end and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually two ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time. And we'll begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization, and the cycle time.
In addition to that is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology and that new technology coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we’ll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns which will become even more critical as we move forward. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Alsford from Citigroup. Your line is open. So firstly, Doug, I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on your comments around the Subsea business. EBITDA margin was worth about 400 basis points down quarter-on-quarter. And I'm just wondering if you could perhaps give a bit more granularity as to what was driving that decline between seasonality, I guess the backlog mix, and clearly the challenges that you're facing around the COVID-19 situation? And really the reason for the question was to try and quantify and understand how big the sequential decline would be into 2Q? Thank you. Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1 as always would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter.
The consensus number I have to say did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one. Point number two is, the COVID-19 impacts are real, and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company.
I spoke about my prepared remarks that we’re going above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and wellbeing. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other -- or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms of potential COVID related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just remove that individual and continue business as normal, we went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we've prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and wellbeing of our employees.
We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service and we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that.
In addition, we had two vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time simply due to crew availability, due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had a 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real and these are meaningful. In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product and finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics.
We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due to local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera. So these are all the types of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed -- was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves.
We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought can put the health and wellbeing of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision. And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping, that we will continue to face and we will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, we'll obviously have even more.
So as we’ve said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology, and our differentiated offering of iEPCI, has clearly proven to be the winning combination.
We have the strength of our backlog, almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 billion remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog. And we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient Subsea Services business and we have reaffirmed we will deliver over a $1 billion in additional book and turn backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Doug. That was really helpful. And if you don't mind a quick follow-up actually on the previous question around the balance sheet and Maryann has been -- or the cash flow, sorry, on Maryann’s comments. Maryann could you maybe say whether you think you'll be free cash flow positive, i.e. after CapEx in 2020, given the lower CapEx guidance that you provided, and maybe just to sort of cover off the payments around the redeemable liability, it was $4 million I think in the quarter, $300 million is on the balance sheet. How much do you think you'll pay this year? Thank you. Sure, Michael, thank you. So we expect to make another payment to partners in the second quarter, that will further reduce that $300 million MRL liability. And then we'll evaluate that in the back half of the year. It will not be all of that MRL in Q2 however. So, you may want to assume maybe half of that in the second quarter, if that's helpful. And we continue to expect to see full year for Yamal in a range of $400 million, $500 million in incremental revenues in total, as we have explained before, and that guidance remains.
To your first question, again, still a little bit in a range of outcomes to talk about, you're absolutely right now, we have reduced CapEx, and that will certainly be contributing, as you heard, $175 million and further benefit coming from the dividend reduction. And we do expect cash flow from operations to be positive but that's in a range of outcomes. And as we continue to get the feedback from our clients and further refine our guidance, we'll be able to give you some clarity. But certainly all of the things that we're doing truly help us improve that position. But at this time, it’s a little too soon to call free cash flow. Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. So, Doug, maybe you could talk a little bit about the separation and the conditions that you would need to see to move forward again on that separation. And if you think about, could factors change around what was originally planned such as Technip Energies having a U.S. ADR. And is there a scenario where you believe it should not move forward for separation? If you could give us a little more color? Yes, Angie. Thanks for the question. Look we still consider it to be -- we still consider the transaction to have a very strong strategic rationale. That has not changed. And we do believe that it is a way to create shareholder value. Our intent is to continue to track and complete the transaction in a timeframe that would be conducive. There's a variety of different factors that we are considering. But clearly the current market environment and the dynamics of the market would not be an appropriate time. So, it's likely to be in the near term but in the medium term we would intend to move forward. I appreciate you asking the question specifically about potential ADR listings for Technip Energies, as we would move forward as a separate company. That Angie -- that is very much a consideration and very much part of the workflow and the processes that we have ongoing that we would be communicating further as we move forward to advance our decisions.
I want to make it very clear so that there's not a sense of, let's say, uncertainty in the -- how the transaction would move forward when the market conditions would prevail. We will be able to move very swiftly. We believe that we will be able to complete from announcement to the completion of the transaction in a 90 day window. That's really important because we don't want to create this period of information vacuum. So, we now have advanced all of the critical steps both internally and with the regulators to be able to -- from announcement very quickly, provide things like prospectus, Capital Markets Day, ADR listing requirements, things like that in a very swift manner, removing that uncertainty that was created through the process initially. So I appreciate you asking me that question so I could clarify that. And then maybe we could go to Maryann on the Subsea margins. I know it's challenging to give a lot of color here. But is it fair or maybe not to think that Q2 could be the trough for the year or the installation campaigns and the push out of that, how does that play in the second half, coupled with the cost reduction program that you clearly have underway? And do we move back on track to where the original path was as we go into ‘21 or is it linger as we go into ‘21? Yes. I'll go ahead and take that Angie, I think that's a really -- again, I think it's a key question. At this time -- and again, none of us fully understand the duration or the ultimate impact of the COVID-19. But from what we know at this time about the virus, what we know at this time about the business, et cetera, or looking forward indeed, we would expect you to be the trough. We would expect recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to know TechnipFMC in our Subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45 over almost 50% of that was enabled by the creation of TechnipFMC and iEPCI model.
In Q1 alone we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and two new iEPCI awards this quarter. So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year. And keep in mind whatever the ultimate results for 2020 may be, they will include the clear challenges and disruptions of vivid and a very swift shift in the market demand. It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to fulfill delivering 2021. So again, I think it has to be looked in the context of this very unique environment, not as an indication or a rebase lining of what we're able to deliver as a company. And our next question comes from the line of Mick Pickup from Barclays. Your line is open. A couple of questions if I may, a bit of a follow-on first from Angie. On the slippage of projects, I can understand onshore you slowed down engineering, you slowed down procurement and your crews and your staff on site to reduced numbers. But in offshore you have vessels that are involved these days. Just wondering if the slippage of projects into ‘21 given that you already have a pretty healthy ‘21 already lined up, is starting to cause issues and whether there will be availability issues middle of next summer, if this year's workload starts to move on top of next year’s workload? Yes, thank you, Mick. In the -- the offshore installation activity in Subsea was ramping up in the second half of 2021 and ultimately to ‘22. That being said, we're working very closely with our customers aligning schedules, still fluid. As Maryann pointed out and I want to reemphasize, our clients have not made their decision yet. We're working very closely with them in a very collaborative way. And they are only -- they are now working on and reworking their project schedules.
And in some cases, we don't expect to have that final deliverable from our clients, which is if you will, the input for our plans until the middle of this upcoming month if not the end of May, is the schedule that they are on and the decisions that are being made by our clients. Now, that being said, from what we can see at this point, and we have a fair amount of visibility in terms of the vessel requirements, we're confident that we will be able to deliver upon those needs. Although, yes, it will create a bit of a stacking effect but we think it's manageable at this time. And a follow-up from that. Can you just talked about the conversations you're having with clients? Clearly, you have some solutions, which would unlock in the Subsea going forward. Can you just talked about the early conversations you're having, whether they're coming to you and talking about things they haven't previously talked about, what sort of changes they are making? Yes. So obviously, all the conversations that I'm having with clients right now are under the strictest confidentiality. Because they're making very serious decisions about their plans and the scheduling of their projects, and that is impact on their partners. And it has impacts on local governments and other key stakeholders. So, I'll just speak at a very, very high level, and I have to be a bit opaque here. The good news is we're having those conversations across our company. That's the benefit of having these deep, intimate client relationships that we have built up over many, many years.
We're in a very unique position. They are telling us, they're speaking to us. They are not talking to others. They consider us to be a trusted partner. They're trying to work with us to mitigate the impact on our company. There will be an impact on our company but to mitigate the impact on our company versus some others. Our customers are becoming very aware that not everyone will make it through this cycle.
So they are reaching out and trying to ensure that they are shifting their spend and showing up, if you will, who they believe will be the winners. I don't want to say survivors, it's more than surviving, who will be the winners when we get through this period. There could be up to a 50% reduction in available capacity in the marketplace both in terms of people and assets -- or in terms of companies and assets, excuse me, when this is all said and done. I would say that's the biggest realization in this cycle. It's not just about squeezing and hammering and trying to enforce changes of commercial terms, there's a real serious discussion at least going on with our company. I can only speak for our company and I believe at least from what our clients are saying, it is somewhat unique to the discussions they’re having with us versus others. It's really about ensuring that we're going to be there and we're going to be strong for them when this is all said and done. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. So Doug, as you did mention the company is in a very unique position with $22 billion in total backlog and obviously for anybody key here is look beyond 2020. So I'm hoping you could provide some insight as to kind of the margin and backlog for Subsea and Energies? And what can be done above and beyond what you've already discussed this morning to protect or maximize those margins. Any insights on that would be fantastic? So I'll start with Subsea and then I'm going to pass it over to Catherine to talk about Technip Energies. Look, Kurt, an important question. We've emphasized a couple of times in the script and again verbally here and I wanted to just do it one last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is, us all working and sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick.
So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humble and we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our customers. So it hasn't affected the margin in the backlog, if you will, which is to get into your question and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin in backlog was declining as we were working through some higher margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less favorable backlog. And it's now being more influenced by iEPCI including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of 8 billion for Subsea where almost 4 billion of that came from my iEPCI, and that's good high quality gross margin. So yes, the gross margin and backlog. Yes, the gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us.
Now it comes down to execution, the challenge we’ll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie and I think it's really important, you can't look at the company in the lens of today and say this is their ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained in our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of finished products, to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to be the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and wellbeing of our employees, including the examples I gave, the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier, where we're going to put the health and wellbeing of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times.
But you have to set that aside and Kurt and you have to look forward. And you have to say this company still has $22 billion in the backlog, total. It still has $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated repeatedly the high quality, the ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario, it doesn't end when the COVID virus is addressed, it obviously will have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebase lining of our ability and what we'll be able to deliver in 2021 and beyond. And I thank you for the question. Catherine? Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question, Kurt, and everybody. So, I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying. On the Technip Energies side, we have, first, very, very strong backlog. We have US$13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in ‘21 and beyond.
Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it’s the result of a well-advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also it's a combination of all that which helps us protect margin and more importantly the T&C under which we will deliver the project, which in the EPC world the T&Cs are quite critical.
So really when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously you always have to normalize for the mild winding down. But I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And it is underpinned by our ability to execute, which again is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to remind the market that we have been able to execute projects and it is a condition needed then to put margins and almost more importantly than the absolute numbers is the consistency of these margins over time. And at this stage, I'm very, very comfortable on where we stand. And I hand it back to you... And our last question today will come from the line of James Evans from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Doug, I wanted to ask about the Subsea order outlook. You said it could be down as much as 50%. Frankly feels a little bit bullish to me given the customers seem to have bought everything to a halt. But I know you spend a lot of time with them. So maybe give us a little bit more detail, pardon me, around geographically or by theme just where you may do see some additional commitments being made by the customer base through the back nine months of this year? Thank you. Thank you, James. Clearly we're sharing our view with you of the information that we have available to us at this time. As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans and final decisions have not been made with -- internally nor have they been shared with our companies. But we have had a series of decisions -- discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we've provided was based upon those I’d say real time discussions that we're having.
Clearly if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we share with you, now the large greenfield projects, all but maybe one or two are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24 month timeframe. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original timeframe, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are obviously first and foremost economics but there are also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights, in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward.
So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have at this time. Again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete, I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that’s the spirit of how we've always operated and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity and both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects.
Bearing in mind when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence i.e. the drilling, those costs are likely to be even -- reduced even further than where they are today making the Subsea project economics even more attractive.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.
Before commenting on our operational and financial results, I would like to begin by recognizing the resilience of our global workforce. While the health and wellbeing of our employees, partners and customers is our top priority, these dedicated teams worked tirelessly to maintain business continuity in a safe and responsible manner.
And throughout this very challenging period, they continue to advance projects and meet customer requirements, which was evident in our second quarter results. We also made solid progress in three core areas, strengthening our balance sheet, progressing our backlog scheduling, and accelerating our business transformation, all to ensure the success of TechnipFMC both through the current cycle and over the longer term.
With regard to the balance sheet, we took a series of proactive steps in the quarter. We increased our liquidity by $1.2 billion, bringing total cash and liquidity to nearly $7 billion. And we secured a permanent modification to our primary debt covenant, which favorably impacts the company's total capitalization ratio. Together, these actions were taken to ensure that we have more than sufficient liquidity and can maintain full access to this liquidity in these challenging times.
Turning to backlog. We experienced no cancellations, highlighting the resilience of the nearly $21 billion of backlog we have today. This significant backlog provides us with good visibility that extends over the next several years. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had constructive conversations with our customers. The dialogue has been very different than what we experienced in prior cycles.
This has resulted in a more collaborative approach, creating new opportunities for us, enabled by our proven innovative solutions and demonstrated excellence in execution and supported by the financial strength we possess to weather the market cycle. These unique attributes also allow us to more deeply engage in the way we partner and work with our customers.
Looking at the second half of the year, we continue to add new projects to our backlog. TechnipFMC has been selected for the Mero 2 SURF EPCI project located in the Santos basin. We will soon announce a new iEPCI project in Asia-Pacific that will be using our latest 2.0 technology. And we have secured several projects that will be inbound upon final sanctioning, including subsea installation contracts recently announced by Equinor and the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex we announced earlier this month.
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and our extensive backlog have also provided us with the flexibility to accelerate our business transformation. With global actions underway to generate annualized cost savings in excess of $350 million by year-end. We first highlighted the business transformation during our fourth quarter earnings call. These initiatives are driven by changes and opportunities created from the successful introduction of new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions across our business.
First, going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions. We will have fewer operating bases, service facilities, and manufacturing sites. We are optimizing our operations across geographies and if economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit.
We will have a smaller fleet. We continue to rightsize our assets to better align with our differentiated offering and the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital efficient manner.
Second, we're taking targeted actions across the portfolio, particularly in Surface Technologies. In North America, we continue to transform our operations by working with our customers to further drive wellsite operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And we are leveraging the strength of our international franchise to capitalize on the longer term growth anticipated in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the North Sea.
And finally, we continue to leverage digital technologies across our organization. Looking at one of our most recent innovations, we are accelerating the development and implementation of our Subsea Studio digital platform. Subsea Studio allows us to significantly reduce the time required for front-end engineering by as much as 50%, utilizing machine learning and AI to rapidly evaluate field development scenarios, leveraging the industry's largest database of prior projects and best practices.
All of these actions are fully aligned with our strategy of market leadership and business transformation. These actions will drive the most value when we aligned with those clients and partners that demonstrate a willingness to embrace new commercial models and new technologies.
We're further streamlining all of our businesses towards simplification, standardization and reduce cycle times. In 2019, the vast success of our Subsea integrated model was driven by the strength of our partner relationships and resulted in the company's highest annual growth rate in order inbound in over a decade. And we expect to enter into another exclusive iEPCI alliance that will be announced in conjunction with the client’s first integrated project award.
As I've said before, those that adopt innovative solutions are more likely to succeed in the new energy landscape. And we're even more convinced of this today, given the dramatic change in the external environment and its impact on our customers.
And lastly, the third pillar of our business transformation is focused on the strategic initiatives across our portfolio that will deliver new sustainable solutions to our clients. These initiatives will allow us to leverage our core competencies in engineering, manufacturing, and project management, skills that are transferable and can be applied beyond traditional market segments. In Subsea, we have created fundamental change in the way we design, manage and execute projects.
Incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform and greatly simplify the Subsea infrastructure while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. When combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefit. Our vision for subsea includes an all-electric subsea system powered by renewable energy. This will further simplify the subsea infrastructure and reduce if not eliminate environmental emissions.
In Technip Energies, we have significant expertise and prospects in the area of sustainable chemistry, notably in biofuels as Neste’s partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. And we have further expanded our footprint in the circular economy through our collaboration with Carbios to demonstrate their recycling technologies. We have recently extended our Genesis offering, to provide a portfolio of advisory services across all of our markets with a particular focus on energy transition. And we see a very exciting future for hydrogen, where we already have proven technology and references for blue hydrogen and are well positioned for the emerging market for green hydrogen.
In Surface Technologies, we offer high efficiency solutions that enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Today, we have a project utilizing our integrated production system, iProduction, allowing the client to capture over 50% of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere during the production phase of an unconventional development. In summary, we have the expertise across all segments of the business to deliver the innovative, sustainable solutions that will enable our clients to meet their carbon reduction ambitions.
Let me turn to the subsea outlook. On our first quarter call, we noted that up to 50% of the estimated $15 billion in project value captured on our subsea opportunity list could be extended beyond the 24-month window. The updated list now reflects real evidence of this trend. Based on public disclosures made by operators, we have identified eight specific projects that have been extended beyond mid-2022. Importantly, none of these projects have been canceled and they remain longer term opportunities for future awards. There have also been new projects added across four different basins that we believe will be awarded within the next two years, suggesting that the previously identified reduction in value for this opportunities once thought to be as high as 50% is actually closer to 30%.
Remember, the subsea opportunity list is not a complete list of opportunities available to TechnipFMC. Beyond this large active – large project activity, our orders have been driven by subsea services, direct iEPCI awards and small project activity, much of which is exclusive to our company. This opportunity set has generated over $3 billion of inbound in each of the last three years and is enabled by our market leading installed base, growing list of alliance partners and unique integrated FEED capabilities.
Our front end engineering teams remained very active, and more than 60% of all integrated FEED work is leveraging the benefits of subsea studio. We believe this will generate additional proprietary opportunities, some of which will come from our exclusive alliance partners over the next 12 to 18 months.
For 2020, we continue to believe inbound orders will approximate $4 billion. In the first half of the year, we had $1.7 billion of subsea inbound. And with five months remaining in the year, we already see a similar level of inbound for the second half of the year, coming from subsea services, small project activity and large project awards, pending public announcement. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with our customers as they adjust to the current environment, and we are excited to serve the new entrance that will likely step in to operate potentially stranded opportunities. That said, long-term success in subsea is driven by economics, innovation and relationships; all key attributes of TechnipFMC. This makes us uniquely qualified to remain the subsea partner of choice now more than ever.
Turning to LNG, we are currently in the delivery phase of two major projects, Coral Floating LNG and Arctic LNG 2, and we continue to advance through the warranty phase of Yamal LNG. Yamal has been the industry’s most successful project ever, and the strength in our execution certainly played a role in the Novatek-led consortium’s decision to direct the word Arctic LNG 2 to TechnipFMC.
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we’re making good progress on all of these projects. On Arctic LNG 2, we continue to expect the activity to ramp as scheduled over the remainder of 2020. And on the Coral FLNG, we continue to achieve key milestones relating to module integration and instrumentation. Successful execution of these technically and logistically complex projects create strong references, leaving us well positioned to be a key player in the development of the industry’s most strategic LNG projects.
Market dynamics have shifted in recent months, and this will alter the broader LNG landscape in the near-term, the number of economically viable projects is likely to decline. But the same can be said of the list of qualified EPC contractors, which will be challenged in this period of subdued project sanctioning. This is not the case for Technip Energies. We have demonstrated remarkable resilience through past cycles, but we don’t see this as the start of an extended downturn for us.
We have already been awarded two additional projects, the first being Rovuma in Mozambique and the second Energía Costa Azul in Mexico. Both remain subject to final investment decision, and either of these projects are included in our backlog today. While Rovuma has been delayed until 2021, the operator for Costa Azul continues to indicate that FID will take place this year.
In addition, we are actively tendering a major project in the Middle East and performing front end engineering work on other LNG prospects. Some of which are likely to move forward due in part to their strategic importance to their host country. This potential portfolio of LNG projects will provide us with well-timed project overlap and operational continuity. And the portfolio beyond LNG remains diverse. We have built a solid track record of successful execution, delivering strategic references in areas such as downstream and petrochemicals that leave us well positioned for future project awards.
We entered this period with a solid foundation built upon the strength of our balance sheet, backlog and execution. While client conversations remain on going, the increased visibility we have today gives us confidence in our full year guidance for all business segments. This is further supported by the acceleration of our business transformation initiatives to maintain if not expand our market leadership.
I’ll now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North America. Year-over-year revenue decreased as a result of reduced activity, operational headwinds from COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $241 million. We accelerated our cost reduction program and are on track to deliver cost savings of more than $350 million by year end. And we expect a greater benefit from these savings in the second half of the year with the full impact realized in 2021. We estimate total cash costs to achieve our planned cost savings target to be approximately $75 million. Underlying corporate expense have improved over the last three consecutive quarters, giving us confidence to lower our full year guidance, which I’ll come back to in a moment.
Beginning with the second quarter, foreign exchange impacts are now reported separately from corporate expense to provide greater clarity in our financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 when excluding after tax charges and credits. Included in our adjusted earnings, our expenses resulting from increased liability payable to joint venture partners included an interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Together, these two items impacted EPS by $0.12 per share in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.22 per diluted share. The company ended the period with cash of $4.8 billion, net cash was $303 million. We have increased visibility on our cash uses and inflows for the remainder of the year and have provided guidance around our free cash flow outlook.
Turning to the segment highlights. Direct COVID-19 expenses for the company totaled $57 million in the second quarter. Year-on-year Subsea revenue declined by 9%, but would have been unchanged when excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation of $129 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. While year-over-year comparisons are usually more relevant for this segment, the 10% sequential improvement in Subsea revenue demonstrated our ability to mitigate COVID-19 related disruptions in the quarter.
Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was down 510 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative operational impacts related to COVID-19 and more competitively priced backlog, mitigated in part by cost reduction initiatives. Sequentially, the margin only declined 120 basis points as strong execution partially offset an entire quarter of COVID-19 related disruptions.
Looking at Technip Energies. Execution remains solid across the portfolio. Revenue increased versus the prior year quarter driven by higher activity across LNG, downstream and our Process Technology business. The continued ramp up on Arctic LNG 2 more than offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% remain strong even as we returned to more normalized levels, given a reduced year-on-your contribution from Yamal and lower margin realization on early stage projects.
Although no project awards were announced during the quarter – second quarter, inbound orders of $836 million demonstrated good activity in services, process technology and loading systems, as well as expanded scope on existing contracts. And in Surface Technologies, revenue was significantly affected by the dramatic decline in operator activity in North America. Revenue outside North America proved to be resilient with only a modest sequential decline supported by solid activity in the Middle East. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 400 basis points to 3.4%. The decrease was driven by the significant decline in recount and completions related activity in North America.
We are aggressively addressing our cost base. In North America, where the majority of our restructuring for the segment has occurred, we have significantly lowered the breakeven point, which supports our expectation for positive adjusted EBITDA in North America for the full year. As Doug mentioned in his remarks, we have taken actions to reduce the impact of the current economic environment on our financial and liquidity position. We added two additional liquidity sources in the quarter of €500 million revolving credit facility, this facility is undrawn. And a £600 million Bank of England COVID-19 commercial paper facility, this facility carries lower interest rates than most of our other sources. We took the opportunity to secure this for the incremental liquidity if needed, but it has the benefit of lowering interest expense in these challenged credit markets.
Given the access to lower cost funding, we repaid the $500 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility when considering all actions taken in the quarter and including cash of $5.6 billion. Net liquidity stood at $6.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $1.2 billion, when compared to the end of March.
In the quarter, we also secured a permanent amendment to the debt to capitalization covenant of our revolver, allowing for the add-back of $3.2 billion of previously impaired goodwill. This significantly increases the equity value used in the calculation, providing us with strong support of liquidity available to us today. The ratio for the second quarter is 38%. In the quarter, we also took steps to extend our debt maturity profile first with the private placement that came due this month. We are currently working to address the short-term maturities coming due in 2021.
Turning to guidance. We are now providing 2020 guidance for all three operating segments, as well as free cash flow. In Subsea, we are guiding full year revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion supported by the backlog scheduled in the second half. In addition to backlog, we continue to expect full year revenue for Subsea Services to be approximately $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8.5%, implying a second half recovery. For Technip Energies, guidance is unchanged from the first quarter with revenue in a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%.
The implied step up in second half revenue is in line with the continued ramp in major projects as supported by our backlog scheduling. And in Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $950 million to $1.15 billion with revenue outside of North America, representing around 60% of the total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 5.5%, broadly in line with the first half, but demonstrating recovery from the second quarter low.
Turning to other guidance items. When excluding charges and credits, we now expect corporate expense of $130 million to 150 million. This is an improvement of more than 30% at the midpoint of the range versus prior year. The expense reduction reflects earlier than expected achievement and the cost reductions that we discussed last quarter and lower spending in the first half of the year due to COVID-19 constraints. This guidance also assumes a more normalized operating environment in the second half of the year.
We expect our reported tax provision for the full year to be between $80 million and $90 million, excluding discrete items. While adjusted net income is forecast to be higher in the back half of the year, the tax provision should be slightly lower due to work change in jurisdictional mix. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures is expected to be between cash flow neutral and $150 million. All other guidance remains unchanged from the first quarter. Beyond free cash flow, we expect to make an additional cash dividend payment to the Yamal joint venture partners of approximately $100 million in the second half of the year.
In summary, in an extremely turbulent time for the sector, our execution has remained strong and we are well on track to exceed our targeted cost savings. We continue to take steps to improve free cash flow and remain focused on our cost structure. Our strength in cash and liquidity and robust backlog have enabled us to accelerate our business transformation. And with the support of our cost reduction initiative, our demonstrated ability to execute against a multitude of external headwinds and our improved visibility into the backlog, we have provided guidance across all segments, given the greater confidence we have in our full year outlook
Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Alsford from Citi. Your line is open. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. One on Subsea, if I could please, and just really – could you talk a little bit about the margins for Subsea? I think within the guidance, you've obviously split out direct related to COVID costs out of Subsea margin, but it's still quite low quarter-on-quarter, like you guided, or like they talked about. So it could perhaps talk a little bit about, what's the driver of that weaken margin, please. Thank you. Thank you, Michael, very much for the question. We – not only did we deliver on the Q2 results, we also provided you guidance now for the outlook for the remainder of the year, which actually has an increased delivery in the second half of the year, relative to the first half of the year, and an expectation of margins for at least 8.5%. Clearly, in the second quarter, we were challenged operationally by direct COVID expenses that were called out. But also indirectly, obviously the overall business and the flow of the business was impacted. Happy to report that through the quarter, and certainly, since we spoke in this forum most recently back at the end of the first quarter, conditions have certainly improved.
At that point, we had a significant number of our total operations that were either temporarily suspended or extended – or suspended for an extended period of time. We're now back to having all of our facilities operating that being said, we're not back to a 100% operating efficiency, although, again, the resiliency of the workforce and their dedication has really delivered some phenomenal results. So we expect that to continue to improve, obviously with the caveat that we don't know exactly what will be the future impacts of – if there were to be future impacts related to the pandemic. But very proud of the work that the team has done, the progress that they've made, the ability to now have the confidence to give you the full year outlook for 2020 with margins continuing to improve in the second half. Thanks, Doug, and I appreciate the extra visibility from the call given today. Just a quick follow-up, if I could on Qatar. You seem very well placed given the work that you're doing on the feed. I was just wondering whether you get any sense as to when that might come to be awarded. Is it like to be pushed into next year? Or do you feel that there might actually be 2020 sanctioned? Thanks. Certainly, a very exciting opportunity. And I'm going to ask Catherine to provide more color. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you for the question. Certainly, extremely exciting opportunity, as you rightly said, we've been engaged in that project for a long time with a partner of choice. We've also been involved in previous projects in the past. So this is a country, an environment, customer that we know very well as well as the technology. So we absolutely delighted to be involved in the feed and preparing for the standard.
As far as the timing of the sanction and the FID of the project, obviously, all the indications tend to confirm that this project is indeed of its strategic importance for QP. The signs and the communication that we are receiving from our customers make us look forward to this project to be sanctioned in the near future. Now, whether it can be this year or early next year, frankly, it's very difficult for us to say. I could not answer precisely to this question. But the key for us is that this project is indeed a very important interesting and indeed likely to be sanctioned in the near term. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Catherine. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Your line is open. Thank you. I guess, first question, just looking at – you mentioned some of the COVID disruptions and you called out the expense in the first quarter and the second quarter. As you lifted to the back half, can you give us any sense of, what sort of an adjustment we should be expecting? Sure. As I mentioned on the earlier question, we're certainly have made significant progress and really, again, putting the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees first, set some industry standards and best practices that we've now shared, not only with our clients, but with our peers and competitors on ways to really try to minimize the spread of the virus, particularly, in tight quarters, as an example, on vessels, in the manufacturing plants, et cetera. And we’re really, really pleased with the progress that we've made. Obviously, the challenge remains of will there be additional implications that we are not aware of yet today that could occur in the second half. And I'll ask Maryann to provide a bit more color. Certainly, thanks, Doug. So as we think about these COVID-19 costs that we call out directly, maybe a bit about what they are. These are extraordinary expenses, they are unplanned. We do not expect them to be recovered. These would be, as Doug mentioned, when we have facility that is closed as an example. These are not costs of inefficiencies in our plant, as Doug mentioned, meaning lower utilization, lower operating rates, the impact of delayed supply chains, those stay within our margins.
And as Doug explained, we are beginning to see some return to normal. So assuming that trajectory continues and we all know we can't necessarily project that we would expect to see less than the third quarter. These are costs that we would expect to be eliminated from our operating structure, given their nature. So as we stand today, again, challenging to project, what would happen with COVID, but we would expect them to be less in the back half. And then as we continue to return to a more normal environment, we certainly wouldn't be calling them out anymore. The rest of those costs would remain as they do in our margin. Sure. Okay, thanks for that Maryann, Doug. On the cash flow, the back half cash flow that is implied by the full year guidance is pretty strong kind of $250 million to $400 million is the implied range. I'm just wondering if there's anything unusual milestone payments or anything like that. Or if we should think about that kind of implied conversion of EBITDA out free cash flow is, what the business can really do on a recurring basis? Now an important question, and we appreciate you asking it. Because we would like to provide some additional color in. And when we think about our company as a projects business having prepayments on awarded projects, if you will, is not unusual, right? It's part of the overall mix and part of the projections that we need to make. And Maryann will provide some additional color. Sure. Thanks, Doug. One thing to keep in mind, just as you look at the year-to-date performance in particular, in the quarter, we had two items that happened in the quarter that I would say are certainly not necessarily operational and not repeating. And the first is, we made our second payment against previous lease that will have litigation. And that outflow happened in the second quarter. Obviously, that's not repeating in the back half of the year. And you also may have seen the discussion of a settlement of about $113 million in the Technip Energies segment, while we were successful and good news in settling that this quarter, we will not see the cash flow attributed to that settlement until the beginning of next year.
The second part of your question is whether or not you can consider the back half of the year as a more normal conversion. And I would say we’re beginning to get there. As you well know, as Yamal continues to be a smaller contribution to our EBIT and, frankly, less impact on working capital, we have less working capital impact in the back half of the year, and you can begin to see greater conversion. We are obviously assuming a series of projects milestones. We stay – obviously, try to stay cash flow positive across those. You see the EBIT in the back half of the year based on our guidance, would be improving. So you can begin to look at the back half of the year as a better representation of the conversion that you should expect in a more normalized environment. Great. Thanks so much. And our next question comes from the line of Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is open. Hi, good morning, good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, on your Subsea order intake, you sound very confident that you’ll hit that target. Can you just talk about some of the conversations that you’re having with your clients? What are kind of the sticking points for them to make FID? How is pricing evolving? Just give us a bit more color on those conversations please? Sure, Amy. And good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energies. So in Subsea, I talked about the project in Brazil. I talked about a project in Asia Pacific, which, by the way, is an iEPCI project utilizing Subsea 2.0 technology. And I talked about a portfolio of projects in the North Sea recently announced by Equinor. In addition for Technip Energies, we announced the Assiut project, which is over $1 billion in total value.
So it’s been a strong period for us in terms of awards. We have not been able to inbound all of those yet, conditions haven’t been met, but will be met. It’s not a question of if the projects will be sanctioned, it’s just a slight timing issue. And unfortunately, a few of those fell outside of Q2, but they certainly will be in Q3. That’s what provides us the confidence. So in my prepared remarks, to be very clear, I said that we have $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. And we already have a clear line of sight on another $1.7 billion.
So, I think you have to look past the Q2 order rate just because a lot of things fell into early Q3 or were awarded in Q2 but will be FID-ed in Q3. So if you add those together, we have five months to fill in the last 10% to approximate the $4 billion of the guidance that we had previously provided and, therefore, I still have confidence, Amy, that we will achieve that. In terms of the conversations and the pricing, the clients are very much focused around ensuring they can achieve the very best project economics.
Therefore, the majority of the conversations that we have and a very large portion of the total awards that we receive are direct award into our company, most of which don’t actually come from that Subsea opportunity list that we publish, which is the list for the public domain that others also have access to. We have a list that – and I indicated in my script, as much as $3 billion a year on a reoccurring basis that is exclusive to our company. This is what makes us so unique and which allows us to not only be the market leader, but extend our market leadership with our new technology offerings and our new commercial models.
So those conversations really aren’t around pricing, Amy. They are on the project economics. And we work together with a client in a very collaborative way to achieve those most favorable project economics. That’s the difference between our company and the others in this space. That’s very good insight. Just a quick follow-up for Maryann. For the cost savings, could you quantify how much of the cost savings were realized in the second quarter, please? Yes. Thanks, Amy. As you know, what we’ve indicated is, by 2021, we will have achieved all of the $350 million plus. So that run rate going into 2021 will be at least $350 million. We’re ahead of that trajectory as we get – as we’re planning to get there. So we are more than 50% complete with all of the actions that we need to take in order to achieve that through the half of this year. Great. Thanks very much Maryann. I’ll turn it over. You’re welcome Amy. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug, just to start on – or actually to continue on the Subsea margin discussion. The guidance for fiscal 2020 implies a 9% plus type number for the back half. So directionally, that’s constructive. It’s early, but investors are going to start looking to 2021. So maybe too early for guidance, but maybe not too early to think about some of the building blocks. This year, you guided to at least $4 billion of awards. That’s below 2020 revenue so maybe growing revenue next year is a bit more challenged, that’s where we end up.
But I think your award commentary sounds pretty constructive here for some potential upside, maybe that’s back half 2020 or first half 2021. Services opportunities could be better if COVID disruptions recede. Book and turn, still obviously very important. How would you frame those building blocks in terms of what drives margin progress back towards a more normalized level next year? Good morning, Sean, thank you for the question. And I think you highlighted the building blocks very well. If you look at the order inbound projection for 2020, as we just discussed, you can start to project that in 2021. We already have a lot of the potential revenue covered. We have a strong backlog. We’ve obviously just got done talking about additional awards and the additional awards in the second half of this year.
So as far as the revenue line, and you’re right, it’s early to give 2021 guidance, let’s remember, we just, today, are giving H2 2020 guidance, given the disruption that the world experienced last quarter. But it’s fair to talk about. And as you said, we’re seeing a nice progression of the margins in the second half of the year based upon the guidance that we provided.
And as we look into 2021, we expect to continue to improve in terms of getting back to more normalized operating efficiency. We have a strong backlog. We’ll be adding new orders, as we just discussed. So when you look at it, again, it gives us confidence that we’re going to continue to be able to go back to more normalized level of margins.
Now one headwind – we have several, but the one headwind that I would point out that didn’t come up in the – in your question, is the fact that as some of this backlog rescheduling has occurred, it’s naturally pushed out the latter stages of the iEPCI projects or any Subsea project. When we – certainly, for us, it’s the benefit of having the iEPCI projects. It’s pushed out that installation campaign, in some cases, pushed it out of 2021 and into 2022.
So that’s the one headwind will be basically the fleet and the fleet utilization and the economic – the low utilization, the economic impact that, that would have. That would have largely dissipated in 2021 based upon the strong orders we had in 2019 and, again, what we were originally expecting for 2020.
So, it’s kind of a balance. But I think when you look forward, you – the backlog’s strong. The backlog’s resilient. We’re getting new orders and certainly have a very large portion of the total market. We continue to add new alliance partners. It may not have come across in the script, so I’ll repeat it. We are about to announce a new iEPCI exclusive alliance partner, a serious player in the Subsea space.
So, things are moving in the right direction. We obviously have to allow the COVID impact to dissipate, get back to a more normalized environment. We don’t know what the future will bring in regards to the pandemic. So we have to be cautious. And we also have to consider that there’s a bit of a headwind. But all that means is we’re going to continue to move forward in the accretive and constructive direction in terms of the Subsea margins. But realizing that the real benefit of the recovery of the fleet to the installation will now be more likely in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 versus – which would have been more in 2021. I hope that helps you, Sean. That’s very helpful, Doug. I appreciate that feedback. Maybe, we could just have a similar discussion around Technip Energies, just thinking about building blocks into next year. So in this case, Yamal roll off is likely a headwind year-on-year for margins. Some big new projects still starting up. That’s likely another headwind, at least for 2021. But maybe coverage for revenue looks more secure than Subsea.
So that probably helps to some degree. Just curious how confident you are in terms of being able to stay in that sweet spot but perhaps lower margins than when Yamal was a bigger part of the mix, but still staying above that underlying downstream level. So perhaps somewhere in the high single-digit type of range. Sure. Well, Yamal is not over yet. And we do have a large portfolio of other projects that are very important to us as well. And I’ll pass it to Catherine to provide more color. Yes, thank you very much. Because similarly to Subsea, I have to say, you also described the building blocks very well. Thank you. So we have, as you know, very, very strong backlog, USD 13.8 billion at the end of Q2, which is going to generate, indeed, a lot of revenue and strong revenue next year. In terms of mix, you’ve described it well, we’re expecting a step down in Yamal revenue, which will obviously affect the aggregate EBITDA of our results next year.
On the other hand, the remaining of the portfolio has been accumulated in our backlog from a very selective approach. As you know, we’re very far in the way, and we make sure we choose, and we’re very selective in the prospect in the project we are involving. So that is reducing in a very sound gross margin side backlog ex Yamal. And that you will see that next year in our portfolio.
So very much linked with the execution that we’ve demonstrated that we are demonstrating. You can expect consistent delivering EBITDA. We’ll have to normalize, for sure, for Yamal. We’ll have to take into account that Artic LNG 2 is progressing well. It’s going to continue to ramp up. It will continue to be in the early phase, which obviously is associated with a prudent margin recognition. But overall, I would say, very strong, consistent margin profile that we expect from next year with that change in mix that you’re understanding very well. That’s very helpful. That’s Catherine. You’re welcome. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Good morning, Kurt. Hi. My initial follow-up question is for Maryann on the free cash flow guidance that was provided for the full year. Just wanted to get some clarity on that. Does that free cash flow already embed the $100 million of expected payments that are going to go to the Yamal JV partners? Hey, Kurt. So, that Yamal payment actually fall below free cash flow, you see that in the financing section of the cash flow. So short answer is no. That payment is not in our free cash flow expectation, because it doesn’t fall there as it unwinds. But the back half of the year does include, obviously, assumptions for project progress and inbounds and other milestones around the projects as we outlined. Hope that addresses your question. Yes. That does help. And then Doug, you definitely aroused my curiosity with respect to your commentary around some of the strategic initiatives for the Subsea and Technip Energies, especially as it relates to the all-electric-powered Subsea system as well as your commentary about blue and green hydrogen for Technip Energies. So I know it’s going to be way too early for this to have a financial impact within the next year or two. But I’m just wondering what kind of momentum you see building for techniques, specifically for FDI and specifically within the course of the next, I don’t know, six to 12 months. And what kind of traction do you think you can get within that time period for those initiatives? Well, Kurt. You touched on the two key ones. A lot of the other initiatives, I would say, are not obvious in terms of their momentum and certainly not obvious in terms of the returns associated in those – in some of the renewable space. And although we are participants across the renewable space, we really want to focus on where we can provide differentiation and we can have returns that are very attractive versus, if you will, some of the more commoditized parts of the renewable space. So you touched on the two key ones. And it’s very much how we see it, which is the electrification of the offshore, which is a big opportunity.
I would say there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and momentum on the subject. And we are very, very uniquely positioned here, because there’s a lot of attributes and technologies that are required to be able to do this. It’s not simply providing the electricity, but it’s the infrastructure and the equipment and the design and the interfaces with the Subsea completions that are really, really unique. We’ve been working on this for a period of time.
We’re partnering well with others in this space, and we believe this will be a very attractive opportunity for our clients as they have stated environmental ambitions that we can become a key partner for them and help them reach those ambitions. And this is an example of how we could do that. We’re looking beyond just the electrification, and we’re actually looking at the electrification through renewable energy.
This is where our experience of being involved in the very first offshore floating wind farm gives us a lot of credibility in this space and a lot of experience and knowledge in this space. And as an example, not necessarily from offshore floating wind, but that could be a very unique solution and one that we’re very well positioned to be able to provide to our clients. Another potential energy source could be hydrogen, as you point out, and we’re very excited about that. I’m going to pass the microphone to Catherine and let her talk a bit about our vast experience in the area of hydrogen. Yes, sure. And thank you – thanks, Kurt. Thank you for the question. Obviously, we are extremely excited by the momentum around hydrogen these days. We do believe that hydrogen is going to play a pivotal role in the future energy mix being such a clean energy carrier, many, many different applications. The nice thing for us is that we've been in hydrogen for pretty much 60 years. We've installed 270 plants around the world. And obviously, this was called – this is what we call gray hydrogen. But we've also – and people might not know that. We've actually built 50 blue hydrogen units also across the world.
So we have a very differentiated offering with a proprietary steam reformer unit. We have capabilities with some special equipment that help reduce CO2 emissions. So we have a lot of technology references and experience. In addition, we have a technology partnership on carbon capture. So when you combine all that, you understand why we are so excited about the prospects in blue hydrogen. And of course, when you look at the projection of hydrogen demand and hydrogen projection, there will be the need. And the most exciting proposition, if you like, comes from the green hydrogen, which is pure clean hydrogen.
However, the economics and the commercial equation does leave a lot of room for the blue hydrogen, which is the gray hydrogen with carbon capture, which is something that we commercially can today – can provide today. So that's a very exciting, strong position for us today. If you look at the green hydrogen, obviously, it's a little bit more emerging. We also are excited about the capability and the potential of integrating green hydrogen units at industrial scale. So for large industry, which will benefit from green hydrogen, we think that our role as an integrator, project management skill integration will be very useful in helping making the economics of this project work.
So no matter what you look, where you look in hydrogen, we think Technip Energies, indeed, has a big role to play. So that's very exciting, and it's starting now, by the way. So back to you, Doug. Thank you for that. Appreciate that color. [Operator Instructions] Our last question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from ATB Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. You've talked about the green hydrogen and other energy transition ideas. Would you say that within all your different ideas – and is the hydrogen aspect the most exciting that you're working on? Number one. And number two, as a percentage of revenue, what is the contribution right now from these emerging or energy transition stories? Sure. So thank you very much, and I appreciate the question. And obviously, an exciting subject to follow up on. I'll be brief because I know we're running out of time. Actually, the electrification offshore, I would say, is as exciting about is hydrogen and could be very, very impactful. We're talking about going to zero-emission production that is quite significant. When you look at hydrogen, yes, of the renewables and of the differentiation that we have in this space, for us, it is the most exciting. And we believe or we can create the most differentiation and get very constructive returns, again, as opposed to a lot of the renewable space, which is the award numbers are large, but the returns are poor.
And that's not the type of projects that we want to focus on. So we're going to keep driving and doing our part. We just joined the Hydrogen Council, and we want to be an active voice and an active advocate and really help to push the development in those areas. In terms of a percentage of the total contribution, we probably don't have enough time to get into all the dynamics of it.
The question is, do you look at LNG as a very critical energy transition fuel, we certainly do. It certainly has a significant impact and the ability to be able to make it a fungible commodity through LNG. If you include LNG, it's a large percentage. If you exclude all hydrocarbon and just look at the pure renewables, it's a smaller portion of the company today, but we're pivoting strongly in this direction and securing to secure our future as well. Thank you. Thanks. If I can, maybe just one last question. The digital technology or digitization of the – in the Technip Energies solution business. That's something that you talked about last year. Where are you in the progression in that – introducing those ideas into that business segment? Sure. So we're looking at the digitalization of our company across the board, internal processes, external processes. We highlighted the last couple of quarters – actually introduced last quarter and highlighted a bit more this quarter Subsea Studio. This is really, really significant. It's going to just drive our differentiation wedge even greater, and we're seeing evidence of that very quickly. It's going to expand beyond the front-end engineering. It will become, if you will, the way Subsea will be develop digitally from the initial front end all the way through the life of the field of the project. So there's a lot more to come on the subject. We'll be continuing to communicate that to you and others as we go forward.
In the area of Surface Technologies, we're moving to a fully digitized system for well completions. That is really, again, quite exciting and has the impact in terms of the natural benefits of things being digital, but it also has a benefit from a greenhouse gas emissions as well. And Catherine, I'll let you conclude today's call by talking a bit about the digital transformation within Technip Energies. Thank you very much, Doug. And similarly, in Technip Energies, we are progressing very well in some of the game-changing technologies around digital, particularly on digital twin, particularly on carbon assessment tool, particularly around ultra-front end tool, which allows optimized development and you need to be deployed and designed for our customers. So we have a series of very good and game-changing solutions that we will be looking forward to talking much more in the future. Thank you very much. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our second quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. British Summer Time today.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are; Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer and; Arnaud Pieton, President and CEO elect of Technip Energies.
We delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, just months after the start of one of the most challenging periods the global community has ever faced. I want to once again thank our entire workforce for the resilience and dedication that they have shown throughout these unprecedented times. Our success is evident in our ability to continue winning, to continue executing and to continue accelerating our business transformation, while remaining steadfast in our focus on health and safety.
In the quarter, inbound orders exceeded $2.2 billion, largely driven by Subsea. This was our strongest quarter thus far in 2020 and represented a sequential increase of 45%. Our strong results stem from the success of working collaboratively with our clients, where our innovative solutions demonstrated excellence in execution and financial help provide our customers with confidence to move forward projects during such challenging times.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $321 million, with a margin of 9.6%. Importantly, all three segments showed sequential margin improvement as the execution momentum continued across the portfolio. And looking at our business transformation, we continue to accelerate our cost reduction efforts and have already achieved the full targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million.
As we leverage our new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions, we will continue to drive further cost reduction and efficiency gains across the organization. Taken together, our inbound orders, our operational results and our cost reduction initiatives provide us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2020.
As our clients continue to reprioritize their portfolio of investments, we have seen an improvement in our award activity. Having announced 6 projects globally since July, totaling $2.8 billion in aggregate contract value. Well most of these projects were already in our backlog, the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking complex, a Technip Energies award that exceeds $1 billion is anticipated to be inbound in the fourth quarter.
We also announced an award from Shell for the revamp of their Moerdijk plant, where we will provide proprietary equipment and related services for 8 ethylene furnaces. This award further demonstrates our leadership in ethylene technology and helps drive a reduction in CO2 emissions.
In addition, our LNG opportunity set remained strong as we have been awarded 2 major projects, which will inbound upon FID by the client. For one of these projects, Sempra's Energia Costa Azul, the client has indicated a likely FID by year end, and we are actively tendering a major project in Qatar, a prospect with good momentum is evidenced by recent award announcements for several project work scopes. While we believe TechnipFMC is well positioned for this opportunity, the EPC contract is being competitively tendered.
In Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength and resilience of our leading international franchise with 2 important growth opportunities captured in the quarter, both in the Middle East. In Kuwait, we received an award for high pressure gas equipment and in-country services. And in Oman, we secured a five-year frame agreement with Petrogas, an operator that has significant drilling plans in the country. We believe these awards provide us the opportunity to further expand our market share across the region.
And in Subsea, we were awarded our latest iEPCI project with Shell in Malaysia. It incorporates our Subsea 2.0 technology, as well as a diverse set of other projects in some of the most active basins in the world. In Brazil, the Petrobras Mero 2 project, in Norway, the Breidablikk project for Equinor and the ExxonMobil Payara Project in Guyana.
50% of these projects were the result of a direct award to our company, due to our unique capabilities, our competitiveness and our technology leadership. These awards clearly demonstrate the resilience of strategic offshore basins where through cycle economics are highly competitive within our clients' investment portfolios. We remain on track to secure approximately $4 billion of Subsea inbound for the full year.
Looking ahead, we see a healthy set of Subsea opportunities and we continue to grow our proprietary market opportunities by focusing on long-term strategic relationships with our partners, to optimize project economics and returns, utilizing our unique and proven iFEED, iEPCI and iLOF capabilities.
Therefore, I am pleased to announce another exclusive alliance with an operator in the UK North Sea leveraging our integrated Subsea business model, iEPCI to support and optimize future development opportunities from the early concept phase through production and Life of Field services.
Additionally, our Front End Engineering teams remained very active. In fact, we have seen an acceleration in study awards in recent months, with double-digit growth now expected above our prior expectation. And half of our study to days are integrated, which leverage the benefits of our digital Subsea Studio offering and positions us well for future iEPCI awards.
Digital is another key enabler of our business transformation and our digital strategy is focused on three pillars; becoming a data-centric company, developing intelligent products and assets and driving towards autonomous operations. Subsea Studio and our recently introduced iComplete offering are 2 solutions that exemplify these pillars and further expand our leadership position.
Let me start with Subsea Studio. This solution is transforming the conventional concept, feed and tendering phases of Subsea projects. Working with our clients, we are now able to develop ultra-fast digital field architectures that bring together decades of engineering knowledge with artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize product configurations, accelerate execution and maximize value.
Subsea Studio has an open architecture that allows integration with other engineering and manufacturing systems, eliminating the need for multiple handoffs and resulting in as much as a 50% reduction in the time required for Front End Engineering. And we are extending the platform beyond Subsea system design to incorporate the execution and field management phases of a project. Once fully implemented, we'll have a complete digital thread from concept design all the way through to the life of the field. And we are taking our learnings in Subsea and applying those on land.
iComplete is a revolutionary approach to shale completions. And we're the only company to focus on making a completions pad that is truly integrated, efficient and simplified with digital automation and control. iComplete has 50% fewer components and reduces operating expenditures by 30%. The integrated system also removes 80% of connections across the well site, improving efficiency, while reducing risk.
Digital integration is a key element of the iComplete package. All of the data gathered at the site is available in real-time. It is actionable information that enables operators to make evidence-based decisions at every step of the process. And when combined with the automation features, it reduces personnel required on site by up to two-thirds. iComplete is experiencing broad market acceptance, with award secured from operators at all major US basins, leading to increased market share.
Earlier this month, we announced that Arnaud Pieton will assume the role of President and CEO elect of Technip Energies, and I would like to welcome him to the call with us today. Arnaud has been with the company for over 15 years and a valued member of our Executive Leadership team since the formation of TechnipFMC. He has extensive project related experience and he most recently led our Subsea business, taking it to new levels of commercial and technological success. Simply put, he is a seasoned professional and an integral part of the foundation of the company we know today.
Well Arnaud will undoubtedly bring new energy and new ideas to his new role, he and I are fully aligned on business strategy and committed to realizing a successful future for Technip Energies. And what an exciting start to his new role. Just last week, we announced the strategic partnership and investment in the green hydrogen arena with McPhy, a leading manufacturer of equipment used in the production and distribution of green hydrogen.
We are already a leader in hydrogen today, and with McPhy, we will leverage our established brand and customer relationships, as well as our core competencies in engineering, technology integration and project execution to develop large scale and competitive green hydrogen solutions from production all the way to liquification, storage and distribution.
We're also joined by Chart Industries, whose expertise in equipment development is complementary to our process technology and project capabilities. We firmly believe that both innovative technologies and partner collaboration will be needed for the world to achieve net zero carbon targets. And this collaboration between the McPhy, Chart Industries and ourselves stands as a real example of the many ways in which TechnipFMC will play a material role in the energy transition.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.3 billion in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $321 million. Backlog at the end of the period was $19.6 billion, with $12.2 billion scheduled for execution through the end of 2021. The size and duration of our backlog have remained resilient throughout the current downturn and provide us with strong visibility over the next several years.
I will focus my comments today on our sequential performance. In this environment, it is important for us to more clearly demonstrate the underlying improvements in the quarter. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by higher activity in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA improved more than 30% versus the second quarter, driven by strong project execution, higher asset utilization and increased benefit from our cost reduction activities.
As Doug discussed earlier, we completed our targeted run rate cost savings of more than $350 million ahead of schedule. We see the benefits of this in our indirect cost, including corporate functions. Cash flow from operations was $168 million in the quarter, capital expenditures were $73 million, resulting in free cash flow of $95 million.
Net cash improved sequentially to $384 million and benefited from significant debt reduction activities during the period. Net liquidity stood at $6.6 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.17 per diluted share.
In the period, we identified direct COVID-19 expenses, totaling $36 million, down 35% sequentially. Over the course of this year, we have adapted quickly to mitigate the incremental cost impacts of the virus on our business.
Included in our reported results were foreign exchange gains of $6 million or $0.02 per diluted share, and the expense resulting from increased liability to joint venture partners of $62 million or $0.14 per diluted share. These two items impacted earnings per share by $0.12 in the period and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.28 per diluted share.
Let me turn to the segment highlights. The information in the accompanying slide on segment results provides operating highlights when comparing to the third quarter when comparing to the third quarter of 2019. But here again, I will focus my comments on our sequential performance.
Third quarter Subsea revenue increased 9% sequentially to $1.5 billion, due to continued improvement in operational performance. We experienced increased project activity in the US, Asia and Africa as well as increased activity in Subsea services. Sequentially Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7% increased 250 basis points, driven by project completions, improved asset utilization and increased efficiency.
In Technip Energies, revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by the improvement in operational efficiency within our supply chain and construction sites. Importantly, our projects are progressing well. These same factors, as well as the continued strength in execution across our portfolio projects also benefited adjusted EBITDA, which increased 7% sequentially to $175 million, with a margin of 10.9%.
In Surface Technologies, revenue of $226 million declined sequentially due to lower market activity in North America. However, revenue outside North America was largely unchanged and accounted for nearly 70% of our total segment revenue. Despite the decline in segment revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7% increased 430 basis points sequentially. The significant improvement was primarily due to a favorable product mix, the benefit of our accelerated cost reduction initiatives and improved manufacturing execution in our international business.
Adjusted corporate expense in the period was $24 million, driven by the acceleration of our cost reduction initiatives. Year-to-date corporate expense stands at $89 million. We revised our corporate expense guidance last quarter to a range of $130 million to $150 million for the full year. Given the actions we have taken, we continue to trend towards the low end of this range.
Our financial guidance is unchanged from our second quarter update. We remain confident in achieving our full year outlook in each of our business segments, assuming no further material degradation from COVID-19 related impacts.
Turning to cash flow, capital expenditures were $73 million and now totaled $250 million in the first nine months of this year. We remain committed to disciplined capital investment and are confident in our full year capital spend of approximately $300 million.
The improved operational momentum experienced throughout the quarter supports our confidence in achieving our free cash flow guidance of neutral to $150 million for the full year. In the quarter, we reduced debt by $647 million, with net reductions in both commercial paper and fixed maturity debt. These actions have reduced our absolute funding cost, while lowering our blended interest rate.
We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion. Net cash improved $81 million sequentially to $384 million. In summary, we delivered solid operational results with all segments showing sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. We continued winning new awards despite the very challenging market backdrop, with the sequential increase in Subsea backlog. And we have achieved our targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million ahead of schedule.
Beyond the operating line, we significantly reduced debt in the period and we remained intently focused on managing the balance sheet. Sequentially, our net cash position increased and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, as implied by our full year cash flow commitment. All of these successes give us confidence that we will deliver on our financial guidance for 2020.
Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Thanks, everyone. Good morning, Sean. So maybe we could start with a little more on the free cash flow guide that seems to be really the critical piece reiterating that guide for the fourth quarter. Could you maybe just walk through a couple of the moving pieces as you see it? And then just thinking about working capital implications and if we think about free cash flow and the mandatorily redeemable liability, what could cash look like as we exit 2020? Sure, Sean. Thank you and thanks for the question. So, you know, with one quarter remaining obviously, we have strengthened conviction in operating performance. So that will deliver obviously increased cash flow as you've seen working capital is improving from our middle of the year and we expect to see continued working capital improvement in the back half the year.
I think as we discussed maybe last quarter, you know, we've identified a range of outcomes that would potentially deliver the neutral to our $150 million and we still see a clear path, given the opportunity for performance in the back - sorry, in the fourth quarter.
I think your second question was around the payment for the Yamal redeemable liability. And we continue to expect in the fourth quarter that we'll have approximately $100 million payable, as you know, that's below the working capital line and below that free cash flow from operations. So we do expect as we head into 2021, that obviously we'll see that free cash flow improvement and net cash as I had mentioned in my comments, we will see improvement as well. Got it, thank you for that. I appreciate that explanation. And then I think the other really critical piece for the stock today is getting to a resolution on Technip Energies. And so clearly, Doug, you know, your commitment to the spin has been unwavering. Can we maybe just get a little more transparency around the gating items to executing the spin? And are there any other dual tracks that you're running around value creation with this business? Just looking to really, I guess get as much granularity we can on how we get to the finish line on that piece? Thank you. Certainly, Sean and thank you for the question. You're absolutely right. I remain steadfast in my conviction to the creation of Technip Energies, as an independent company. The strategic rationale remains unchanged. And I would say, if anything, it has become clearer in the importance of moving forward with such a transaction.
I think it's important though when we think about your question around what could be triggers, et cetera, is to reflect back on, you know, what led to the decision, a difficult decision at the time to defer the transaction. And that, you know, to me, there was really three factors that weighed into that decision. One was complete panic in the financial markets, driven by both the pandemic as well as the commodity price.
There was a lot of - secondly, there was a lot of uncertainty in our clients' plans at the time. And then finally, it really came down to ensuring that we had an environment that was conducive to what I'd like to say us leaning in versus us leaning out in terms of our position within the industry.
So when we fast forward to today, certainly there's still anxiety and uncertainty in the market, and there always will be. But I think we've come past that point of just a complete fear and panic and, you know, a concern about where the bottom could actually be.
In terms of the industry, I think it's been quite remarkable. And as evidenced in our Q3 results here in the inbound numbers that we just shared with you for Subsea, if anyone's done them, you know, had an opportunity to look at the math, it's a 1.1 book to bill for the third quarter for Subsea, which was quite a substantial win and winning very important and strategic projects and 50% of those being direct awarded to our company. We're in a really unique position.
And that really takes us to the third part, which is, you know, we're leaning in, we're winning. So when you kind of put those three together, I would say, we feel we're in a very different environment than we were in at the time that we suspended, where we didn't know what our customers plans are going to be, for instance, we weren't sure what impact it was going to have on our backlog. I can reaffirm today there have been no cancellations at our backlog.
We didn't know what impact it was going to have on our supply chain and our ability to be able to execute and deliver some of the world's most complex and strategic projects. And as our financial results indicated across all 3 of our business segments, we continue to execute very well. So we're in a different situation now, Sean. We'll continue to look at what is the right timing and what is the right scenario and structure to move this transaction forward. But it would be our intent to continue to move in that direction. Fair enough. Thanks, Doug. Our next question comes from the line of Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon guys. A couple of questions from me. The first one relates to just some news flow recently that the French government is proposing to end export guarantees for the oil and gas industry. And as - if I - as far as I understand, it's not overnight, but if there's going to be like - oil projects from 2025 and gas projects from 2035. So just wondering like how that might impact TechnipFMC in terms of maybe your clients that may rely on French export credit or you know, for the more maybe, when you guys try to help client arrange export credit facilities, how that could impact your ability to win some of these projects? Yes, good afternoon, Amy. Interesting question. And I think you really used the key word there, which was help or assist. No we don't do project financing. But it is true that from time to time we're in a position that we can try to, if you will, link the two parties together, but that we do nothing more than that and that's the only role that we play in project financing.
It is true, we're reading the same things that you're reading. And we're not privy to any additional facts or timeline than you are. But I think it's also realistic to assume if the project has good returns for the client, the project will source funding and that in any single project there tends to be multiple sources of funding, it doesn't rely on any particular single source of funding.
So my assumption, Amy, and you know, I - we don't have, you know, none of us can predict the future on this. But I feel quite certain as we've seen over time that the funding has evolved on these major projects from different sources, that a project with good economics would be able - would source funding in whichever way it deems most appropriate.
So, you know, we'll wait and we'll see how things play out and we'll continue to play our role, which is nothing more than to help or assist, which we normally don't do. But when asked, we certainly do what we can to support or assist. But again, we're not in the project financing game. Great. That's helpful to get your thoughts on that. Just a follow-up and it's still along the lines of understanding your order intake, potential order intake pipeline. I mean, I think your, you know, conversion of orders, you know, in the second half have been pretty good, particularly for both Subsea and for Energies.
But to what degree some of those projects kind of, you know, were initiated from or converted from projects that were, you know, you were already in discussions, you know, pre the COVID pandemic, and the purpose of the question here is really trying to understand maybe some early thoughts on 2021 you know, what projects? And have you started new negotiations with clients? Or is it becoming more difficult in a pandemic environment, just to understand your thoughts on directionally how 2021 is going to look like? Sure, Amy. We - I knew we were going to get to 2021 quickly. We got there on the second question. So thank you or no, thank you, maybe. Now look, Amy we'll give you as much. I'll give you some kind of qualitative thoughts, obviously quantitative thoughts at this time would be premature. Our customers are still developing their budgets, their plans for 2021. So they do anything quantitative, I think would be a bit premature, but in the spirit of your question, I'll be willing to give you some qualitative outlook.
I'm going to cover Subsea and Surface International and then I'm going to ask Arnaud to make some comments on his thoughts on the subject regarding Technip Energies. So let's start with Surface International. Look, we are continuing to see very strong momentum in our order outlook for service - Surface International. And I keep emphasizing international only because in North America, as you know, it's a book and turn business.
So the inbound that we expect to come from the Service International will continue to pick up. I know that's a little a bit contrary into some of the other comments that may have been made about the international market. But I think it's important to understand our position in Surface International, it's actually quite unique. The level and the specifications in technology required for that equipment far exceeds that that's used in for instance, the North American market.
There's really us and maybe one other supplier of that high-spec equipment. It's totally - it's vertically integrated. We do it all in-house, it is not outsourced to China or anywhere else, as is - as it is in the North American market. And it requires very, very sophisticated machine tooling and materials to be able to provide that equipment very similar to Subsea, hence the reason we're so successful.
So we see that continuing to expand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've always had a strong position in the Middle East, North Africa. We just extended our leadership position in the Middle East, announced a couple of the new awards and we continue to work very, very closely with all of the key players in the region and expect continued success and growing success in 2021.
In terms of Subsea orders, what I would say at this point, Amy is, it seems like forever, but it was just a few months ago, a few quarters ago, you know, I mentioned that I felt we could achieve $4 billion of order inbound for Subsea in 2020. I think for the largest part, it was discounted and you know, there's a lot of skepticism around that. Obviously, we've come a long way to achieving that already and we have one quarter left to complete and we remain committed to that.
And I think as I, at this point, look towards 2021, I could see kind of a similar, you know, I could see 2021 resemble 2020. Again, it's a bit early, there's some moving pieces still we're trying to lock down with our customers to really understand the timing. And as always, Amy, you know, one large project shifting from Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of 2022 could change things. And that's why I'm saying we just don't have that level of granularity yet from our clients.
But when I look at, you know, the success of our execution, when I look at our growing activity in our FEED, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's now it's grown double-digit, the majority of that being iFEEDs, the majority of our iFEEDs are direct awarded to our company, this is that proprietary opportunity set that the rest of the market does not have access to. Again, why we were able to do $4 billion this year, which is the majority of the Subsea market. You know, we expect that to continue on next year again with probably more iEPCI projects and more direct awards.
And then finally, it's important not to forget the strength, the resilience of our Subsea services business, that continues to be a strong foundation that we continue to build from. So when you put all that together, again, we have to really understand what projects are going to move forward and the timing of those projects, but I expect that to - you know, I expect 2021 to resemble 2020.
And just maybe one last thought, you know, you may have picked up in my prepared remarks. But if you didn't, we signed another exclusive alliance for Subsea. So we're really proud of the progress we're making. Arnaud? Yeah, thank you, Doug and thank you, Amy. So for Technip Energies I would add that, you know, as expressed by Doug and his previous [technical difficulty] by Doug in his prepared remarks, there is a potential to inbound for Technip Energies to projects or prospects, you know, exceeding $1 billion each before the end of the quarter, before the end of the year. So it's, I think this alone is, you know, giving you a good idea of what the year can and will look like for Technip Energies inbound full year.
And also maybe something that I'd like to share is that for Technip Energies, you know, the LNG wave isn't over yet for us. And there's a very solid pipeline of opportunities into next year as well. And you know, all building blocks are in place I would say for Technip Energies to have another solid year in terms of inbound next year.
And one fold of your question was also about are we having new conversations or new types of conversations? And or are we just relying on the you know, past conversations pre-COVID and converting the opportunities? But in actual fact, yes, we are having new types of conversations and new conversations about new prospects and opportunities.
And very interestingly, including in a traditional markets or what I'm going to call traditional markets in a position to, I don't know if you know, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen, but there is an energy transition perspective in every other conversation we are having with our customers, including in the more traditional markets with a, quite a huge emphasis on, you know, being placed on, you know, decarbonization by our customers.
So, you know, there's a real opportunity set here for us in a grid as well as Brownfield activity set for Technip Energies. So, you know, a nice mix of conversation, if I may say for Technip Energies going forward. Thank you. Thank you, Doug and Arnaud for your comments. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Your line is open. Thank you. I feel like we always end up in this situation with the way you guys put the guidance out where, you know, we've got an annual target and we can kind of solve for fourth quarter. And I know you, you don't want to get into too much detail, but it would be great to hear just any kind of thoughts on the progression from third quarter across the 3 segments. And particularly in Subsea, you know, how much of help was realized in the third quarter related to the project closeout? And what do we think seasonality could do in the fourth quarter? Sure, Marc. I'll cover Subsea as indicated, you know, we had a very solid third quarter, we provide annual guidance, you know, it's not necessarily quarterly guidance and therefore, one can imply the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter will be a bit softer in Subsea, this is the way it always is. The fourth quarter with the exception of maybe one or two instances is always a bit lighter for us and this has to do with the reduced amount of activity, particularly in the North Sea related to our vessel activity and our project reactivity in the North Sea.
But the way that I would maybe summarize it is, you know, that we remain very confident in our full year guidance. And Marc I'd add to that, that, you know, keep in mind that we're saying at least 8.5% and we are very confident in that. And did you want more than that Marc on the other? Yeah, no, certainly, I mean to the extent you can talk about the other businesses, I mean for example, Surface, I would suspect that there's potential for some revenue improvement from third to fourth, just kind of given the momentum that we're seeing in the - in North America. But, you know, perhaps the international exposure is something that could offset? Marc, Surface North America is a bit hard. As you know, a lot of times they run into budgetary constraints at the end of the year and you actually see a bit of softening in North America in terms of the revenue trend in the fourth quarter. But right now, I would say it's a very fluid situation. But we're very proud of our international franchise and the strength of our international franchise. And Arnaud, did you want to make a comment on Technip Energies? Yeah, thank you, Doug. I mean not really much to add other than you know even you're being confident in delivering the guidance for the year. So, I know you have three quarters in hand now so it's a, yeah, I mean just confident for the rest of the year so. Right, okay. Well, maybe if I could just ask a follow-on to '21 is, we just think about the progression of Subsea margin. You know, I think last time we talked, there was some expectation that yeah you wouldn't quite be to the level of utilization where we could really see a nice uptick in margins. But you did mention here in the third quarter, you had had some nice utilization. Just kind of curious how that factor plays out in '21 just based on what you know, right now? Yeah, Marc, industry-wide, the best utilization next year will not be good. So don't anticipate that there's going to be a big uptick in the utilization and I'm talking, you know, across industry, still way too much capacity, projects had gotten deferred as a result of the pandemic that's pushed some things to the right, that's pushed maybe some of the utilization recovery for the industry to the right.
Now as you know, we've been selling vessels, we'll continue to pursue that path and it may be cold stalking, it may be selling, it just depends upon what the opportunities present. And we're not building new vessels. And I would encourage the industry to quit building new vessels. We need to learn to work together. And we're going to be the leader in that. And we're going to lead by example.
And we're going to continue to form strategic alliances and work with others and make sure that we can feed our very healthy, integrated projects and ensure that we have the capability to deliver and continue to grow those integrated projects. And we're very happy to do that through collaboration, versus through direct ownership and adding capacity into the market. So this is a big change. We're leading that change. It's the right thing to do for the industry and it's certainly the right thing to do for our company and it's most definitely the right thing to do for our investors. Yeah. Thanks for that, Doug. I'll turn it back. Our next question comes from the line of Jean-Luc Romain from CIBC [sic - CM CIC] Market Solutions. Your line is open. Good afternoon. It seems that ExxonMobil is asking for a price reduction for its Mozambique LNG project before it sanctions it definitively. Could you give more your thought for this? Sorry, we were having a bit of trouble here. We had some audio issues here. I believe you were asking regarding some of the recent media coverage and discussions around the Rovuma project, is that correct? That's right. Sorry, thank you very much. Look, as you know, we remain very - in very close collaboration and working very closely with ExxonMobil on this project, an important project for us and for our partners, we remain very excited about this project. And you know, and our singular focus is to work with ExxonMobil along with our partners to ensure that we can reach the best project economics for the project.
That's been the way since the very beginning. It's why we were selected and our consortium was selected. And we should expect that we would continue to do so. I don't think there's much more to read into some of the media coverage than just good, normal project practice and project engineering. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is open. Hey, good morning, Doug and Maryann and the rest of the team. How are you? Good morning, Kurt. Good morning - Very well. Thank you. Excellent. So Doug, I'm really curious, you know, with the push here that's going on from the industry on reducing, decarbonizing, you know, not just the energy industry, but other industries, you know, a lot of hype around, you know, the hydrogen opportunity and, you know, your participation now with McPhy. So, I'm curious about, you know, what do you see is the potential addressable market opportunity for both Technip Energies and for FTI you know Subsea, you know, piece of the business if there is one that exists. I was just looking for some additional context inside, anything you provide on that would be very helpful. Sure, Kurt, you can't see me, but I have a big smile on my face. But you're not going to fully like my answer, I know that. We have the answer, but I have a keynote presentation in, I think two weeks' time, little less than two weeks' time and I really don't want to steal my thunder or the thunder for the company.
But Kurt, I think we're going to have to say will be very, very compelling. The opportunities are our most definitely apply across the portfolio. And we're going to show Kurt and it just our style. I'm not suggesting it's, you know, the best, but it's what we do. We tend to really build our - you know, build up and have some real credible examples, we say, making it real versus just kind of going out, you know, let's say with pure ambition and belief and you've heard us do more and more of that.
You've heard me talk about iProduction, reducing future greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. You've heard me talk about Subsea 2.0, reducing greenhouse gases by 47%. And you saw us make our strategic investment in green hydrogen with the recent investment we made at McPhy, which I'm going to ask Arnaud to tell you a bit more about the hydrogen market.
But Kurt, I apologize to you. But I promise, the, you know, it's a very compelling message I'd like to deliver that message in the proper setting. And the work has been done, we actually - we will talk about what we have done, where we've been investing, because in some of these areas we've been investing for over five years, this isn't anything new.
We're going to talk about the fact that we're doing it, because we believe it's the right thing to do, not because it's, you know, because of a popular demand, you have to believe in what you're doing. And we're going to show real examples of the impact that we're having, we're going to set forth the ambition, overall is going to also set forth a three-year measurable plan and a scorecard that our progress can be judged against.
So we're going to focus on those markets where we can actually generate good returns. So we're going to be selective. And you've heard me say that before, there's some very popular offshore markets right now that people were pursuing. But when you really look at it, and it does - it doesn't take long to analyze it, there's just not enough left for the installation company to make a decent return.
So these packages are being split - upwards of 8 contractors, which would typically be done between 1 or 2 contractors. So if you're the 8th on the list, if you don't have the technology, if you're not bringing together the integration, if you're not the, you know, if you're just doing the installation, that we don't believe we can generate the type of returns that our shareholders expect from us.
So we're looking at other things and you're going to hear me talk about some things in a couple of weeks that I think will really be surprising, but they'll be backed up by facts, they'll be backed up by real examples of what we're doing and it'll be an ambition that is - will be very, very compelling. I'd like to let Arnaud talk a bit about the hydrogen market. This is a market we've been in for quite a while and we're very excited about our recent investment in green hydrogen. Arnaud? Yeah, thank you, Doug and thank you, Kurt for the questions. So as Doug stated, you know, we do have as TechnipFMC and Technip Energies a very rich history in hydrogen, you know, we basically we have an installed base that is you know, 270 plants - utilizing our proprietary you know, technology. And when you combine that with our, you know, leading CO2 management capabilities, one can say that we have pretty much everything we need to be a very credible player in the blue hydrogen industry space as it evolves.
So, blue is going to mature, green is not totally mature, but will mature as well. And this investment in McPhy is basically a way for us to position Technip Energies to be - to continue to be a leader on, you know, large scale hydrogen market, including the green. So, of course, this is the beginning with McPhy and there might be other opportunities going forward.
But part - partnering with McPhy is partnering with a Tier-1 electrolyzer supplier. And we will, you know, help with the iFEED development how to scale and accelerate the technology. And we're super excited about it, because it's a way to be forward-looking and continue on that hydrogen journey that we started many decades ago and where we do have a leadership position. So it's about preparing for the future really. Great, thanks for that. And, Doug that teaser alone should probably worth about four to five multiple points on the stock, so looking forward to that presentation. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilson from Jefferies. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I was going to ask on energy transition, but I think you've answered that very clearly and we look forward to that presentation. So maybe I'm just to cover off on that. But firstly that the alliance you've announced in the North Sea, did you give a name for that new alliance partner? They most definitely have a name. It is a very well-known name. But they would like to, let's say, have a bit more - they want to wait for an event and the event is when we will announce our first integrated project with them. We're right now in the integrated FEED phase on their portfolio. And we would expect that to become, you know, to come in, to be one of those, at least one of those to convert into an integrated project, which is when we would then that's a formally announced along with the, our client and partner's name at the same time.
We've done that a few times. Again, for us, we, you know, we like that as well, again, it makes it more real, you know, it's not about marketing, it's about reality. And I think once again, the industry will be surprised at, you know, projects that are moving forward and the economics that are move - you know, and it's enabled by the economics because of our unique integrated offering. So we're working on these on a proprietary basis. All we have to do is to move them from the iFEED to the iEPCI, if they convert then ours is a direct award and exclusive relationship, long-term relationship with yet another Subsea operator, we could not be more proud. Excellent, okay. Thank you. And Maryann then to cover up on your mouth. Could I ask what is the profile we should expect those remaining contract liabilities to roll off over? Is that a two-year period or shorter than that? Thank you. Thank you for the question, Mark. So I would say certainly no more than two years as we are in the warranty phase. And as you know, those trains had multiple warranty periods. This year, you saw a fairly significant unwind. We've had multiple successive quarters of project improvement, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in the execution, excellence and the ability to avoid risk. And therefore, that unwind should be no more than two years, but certainly quite successful as we see the project progression. So we expect that to be a positive result, Mark. Okay, and those revenues will still pass through the top line and the MRI grow as you work off the warranty. That's correct. They will, they will come through as revenue just as you've seen. Absolutely correct and unwind the contract liability, yes. Okay, thank you very much. You're most welcome. Our next question comes from the line of George O'Leary from TPH & Company. Your line is open. Good morning, Doug. Good morning team. Good morning, George. Good morning. On the - I know you guys have historically had a position on the biodiesel front. But renewable diesel seems to be catching more headlines these days. I wondered if you could lay out for us if there's any opportunity for TechnipFMC on that renewable diesel side of the equation and what you guys are kind of seeing in that end market? So you're right, there's been a lot of focus both on biodiesel as well as renewable diesel. I think the renewable diesel market, we all - you know it's still very, very early stages, I think we all need to spend just a little more time before we make too strong of any comments regarding the renewable diesel market. But as you know, the biodiesel market is an area of strength for our company, we couldn't be more proud of the relationship that we have with Neste that continue projects that we have with Neste in this very strong execution that we've had along the way. So I'd like to turn it over to Arnaud to add a few of his own comments regarding the subject. Yeah, thank you, Doug and thank you, George. So yeah just it's going to be a short addition to Doug's comments, but other than so but yeah, we do have - we are enjoying a very strong market position today in biodiesel. We have the technology to know how and you know, we have that long history with Neste. And we are their preferred partners and, on the projects, with many references, biodiesel biochemical, biojet. And, you know, there is our technology and that partnership continues to bear fruit, if I may say so.
I don't have much to add other than just, you know, we're very, very pleased and very happy about the collaboration and it is deep entities recurring - a recurring one which, you know, which we are enjoying and that when we can have this type of relationship and making us a leader in biodiesel and biofuels. You know, we are happy and we are going to, we are nurturing it because it's an important one for us. But we have many references as you may know and we continue to work with them on scaling each and every time we get on with them. Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then Doug, you mentioned the iComplete system earlier, and I appreciate the 50% reduction in equipment and I realize that probably helps from connections point and having to have less people out on the well site just by virtue of having less equipment. But I wondered if you could explain the offering just a little bit more to better help us conceptualize, you know how and why it reduces labor on site and some of the efficiencies that drives you know, even if at a high level just to kind of help us better understand the offering and how it's differentiated versus the competition in the market? It sounds like you're making good headway, getting those systems into every major US basin. So any color there would be extremely helpful. Sure. And it'll be - I'm going to maybe use an analogy, it might not be a great analogy, but I think it helps us visualize, if one hasn't been on, you know, one of these, you know, multi-stage 24/7 kind of operating environments that is happening in most of the US shale today, it's kind of hard to appreciate. So I'll try to visualize it for you.
There's just a scurry of activity. And then there's the actual execution or if you will, the pumping of the stage at which point everybody goes back. And it's highly automated and it's really, you know, managed quite efficiently. But it's - what happens between those stages, that is, at best orchestrated and at worst, chaotic. I describe it as a bunch of ants just scurrying around a bunch of simultaneous operations, you're dealing with high pressure regions, you're dealing with a very, you know, trip hazards. It's just - it's very common, it's very complicated. But it's the way that the industry has been doing it forever. I say forever, since I've been around.
But what is - we looked at it and we consider ourselves to be an integrated architect. And it's what we do in the Subsea, everything in Subsea uses automation and control, you don't have people running around in between operations, because obviously, they're unable to because it's at the bottom of the ocean. So we said, “Well, why can't we do that on Surface”. And of course, initially, people say, “Oh, it's not possible, it's not applicable, et cetera.
But when you put really smart people on it, and we have a tremendous amount of really smart people and talented people, and give them the challenge, it's amazing what they're able to do. And what they were able to do was to look at it and take that part of the activity that nobody owned, it's owned by many different contractors, and say, “What, why doesn't somebody kind of, you know, take charge here and really find a way to make most of this activity automated, removing that interface, removing all of those activities, and at the same time, accelerating, improving the overall efficiency, and most importantly, the safe environment in which to operate.
And it's really quite amazing. And I don't know if I'm giving it just as the way that I'm describing it to you. But you know, we went from a best orchestrated to worst chaos to now something that's, you know, remotely operated, the client controls everything from an iPad. All of those activities that have to happen in between are now, you know, are now fully automated. And it's quite meaningful and the market acceptance, you know, it was barely introduced. I know, it's the first time we're talking about iComplete on an earnings call. It's really because it's relatively new. We've been working on it for a while. But it's just amazing how quickly it's spread. Because again, it's just one of these things. If you come up with the right solution that makes sense that the customer can get real upfront benefit from that we get tremendous benefit from in terms of our operating efficiency, and in this case, our market share, these things tend to be very successful. So don't make them overly complex, focus on the things that matter and deliver real results, that's our company. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Arnaud. And our final question today will come from the line of Guillaume Delaby from Societe Generale. Your line is open. Yes. Good morning, Doug. Thank you for taking my question. The final question basically, if we go back to the last six months, what is the main, also two main lessons you would draw from the last six months. And from that lesson, are those lessons are currently reshaping your vision of the company for the next two to four years? What is different now how do you see now TechnipFMC in two to four years versus how you used to see it six months ago? That's a great question. It's hard to get it down to two lessons learned. But for the sake of time, I will do my best, there is quite a few lessons that have been learned over the last six months. You know, if I just tried to pick two, you know, the first one is, do what is right, do what is right. If it - you know, it's got to feel right in the mind and it's got to feel right in the heart. So what do I mean by that?
Be it you know, the way that we reacted to the pandemic, by putting 100% of focus on the health and well-being of our employees, our partners and our contractors, trusting them, giving them the tools that they need, helping them through this very difficult period and then allowing them to perform.
And it's just amazing to me, what was done during this period of time, when, you know, many other companies failed when many other companies struggled, because the complexity of adapting to the number of changes that were being thrown at us on a weekly, daily and in some cases, hourly basis and our project directors and project teams and our manufacturing staff and our crews that route on the vessels, I just, I can't say enough. So if there is a lesson learned there, take care of them, keep them healthy, give them the tools, they need to do the job and have faith and trust and confidence. And it's amazing. It's amazing what people will do.
The second one is really around the change of behaviors. You know, becoming too internally focused, not staying close to your customer, I think has really hurt a lot of companies. We remain very close to our customers. We weren't pestering them, they obviously had to work through their own challenges that were coming at them, but letting them know that we were there, we would support them in whatever way that we could. And we did in some very unique ways, in terms of helping them mobilize people, in terms of helping them with some early COVID testing kits, whatever that - whatever was required, just builds so much loyalty and so much trust. And they also are now extending to us even greater, let's say latitude to operate.
So I see in the future, where we've always wanted to get, but when it comes to remote inspections versus on-site inspections, when it comes to more integration versus less integration. Look, I think this is the new reality, it is proven, it is creating value. And I think that this very terrible crisis that we went through, in some cases, probably accelerated some of this adoption - adaption and adoption by the industry, I would argue by maybe as much as five years. And I think - I do think it's here to stay, I don't think it will revert. We're talking to clients very seriously now about how they're going to operate their major projects going forward, both in Technip Energies as well as in Subsea, and I think you'll find our company playing a much more prominent role than we have historically. Thank you very much for the color. I would now like to turn the phone back over to Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our third quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website, beginning at approximately 8 PM British Summer Time today.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined by Alf Melin, our Chief Financial Officer.
Today, I'll start by highlighting the tremendous successes of our company over the course of 2020 in the face of one of the most challenging years on record.
First, we protected our people. Our success has always been the result of the tireless efforts and unwavering commitment of the women and men of TechnipFMC. What they accomplished in 2020 was nothing short of exceptional, given the hardship and difficulties that occurred across the globe. Health and safety is our top priority, and drives every decision we make. We took the steps necessary to protect our workforce, as well as our fellow employees of our customers, contractors and suppliers. And these actions won praise from clients and ensure that their projects move forward safely.
Second, the initial outlook we provided last February was clearly impacted by a multitude of events. But our teams quickly responded with a revised view that we provided in July. Our aggressive cost reduction plan focused on project execution, and resilient backlog provided us the confidence and visibility to issue guidance at a time when few others in the energy sector are willing to guide for the next quarter. We delivered on our revised plan with full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin, meeting or exceeding guidance for all operating segments.
And third, we protected our backlog. Importantly, this speaks more to the relationships we share than the contractual terms of any one project. We all face challenges, our suppliers, our customers and TechnipFMC. By working together, we found solutions that help mitigate if not eliminate, many of the obstacles we face together. While no projects were canceled from backlog, the more enduring impact to our company will be the strengthened relationships that have resulted from the collaborative engagements with our partners during this unpredictable operating environment.
And beyond these successes were many other notable achievements with regards to our ongoing business transformation. First was our separation. Throughout 2020, we continue to work to separate TechnipFMC into two industry-leading pure play companies with the transaction now completed through the partial spin-off of Technip Energies. We took specific actions in response to investor feedback that were incorporated in the final spin process. We accelerated the spin timeline, closing the transaction just 40 days after announcement. We added an ADR that will trade over-the-counter in the U.S. broadening the base of eligible shareholders for Technip Energies, while also creating additional liquidity. And we addressed investor concerns regarding share flowback and capital structure with the addition of Bpifrance as a long-term reference shareholder, and our near-term retention of a minority stake in the new company. February 16th marked day one for an independent Technip Energies. But its real significance is the expanded opportunities and enhanced focus of management, resources and capital that will serve to benefit stakeholders of both organizations.
Beyond the separation, we also accelerated our cost reduction efforts across the entire company in 2020. We announced targeted cost savings of more than $350 million, which we achieved on an annualized run rate basis well before the end of the year. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment to reduce capital expenditures for the full-year by one-third versus our original plan with the current spend at a level that is sustainable over the middle-term.
In November, we provided a comprehensive overview of our efforts around ESG. TechnipFMC was created with the vision to drive real and sustainable change in the energy industry. This included the introduction of a three-year sustainability roadmap that has resulted in a number of successes for our company.
We have progressed well in reducing our own emissions of greenhouse gases, and are committed to helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint with innovative solutions and technologies like Subsea 2.0 and iProduction.
We're driving inclusion in the workplace as demonstrated by our initiatives, advancing fair and diverse representation and ensuring equity of our rewards. We're supporting the development of the local communities in which we live and work through educational programs focused on science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And we'll continue to ensure that our actions are aligned with shareholders through executive compensation programs that are focused on driving behavior that creates sustainable shareholder value.
We also established an extensive set of new commitments to be realized through 2023 that will have real impacts and will be measured using an annual scorecard to provide transparency on our progress. At the core of our environmental initiatives is 50 by 30, a board commitment to realize a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 equivalent emissions by 2030. That's a 50% reduction before the end of this decade.
Over this very same time period, we'll continue to deliver real solutions for the energy transition, including lower carbon alternatives, such as our all electric production system for Subsea and iProduction for surface markets, both of which are available today. We'll also introduce zero carbon alternatives, such as our Deep Purple initiative, which I will discuss shortly.
TechnipFMC has a strong history of challenging industry convention to develop, design and integrate new innovations, and Digital is a key enabler for continued success. We introduced elements of our digital transformation over the course of 2020, with a particular focus on Subsea Studio. Subsea Studio was initially developed solely for Subsea system design. We have since extended the platform beyond the front-end to incorporate the execution and field management phases of our project. Once fully implemented, we'll have a seamless digital thread from concept design, to tendering, manufacturing and delivery and continuing all the way through the life of the field. These digital initiatives improve economics, enhance performance, and reduce emissions, driving sustainable change that makes us the partner of choice for our customers.
And once again, we're leveraging our Subsea expertise by bringing digital innovation into the surface arena that enhance the customer experience for both iComplete and iProduction. iComplete is a fully integrated, digitally enabled wellsite operations and control system. It creates a seamless digital experience with fully autonomous maintenance and remote data access initially from the completion phase, and ultimately extending through the production phase. iComplete significantly improves efficiency, with 50% faster rig-up and rig down times and 66% reduction in the personnel required on site and cost savings that exceed 30% for our traditional work scope. More importantly, it also increases safety by eliminating thousands of red zone interventions on a typical completions pad by using automation and control to engineer out risks and hazards.
iComplete has already achieved significant market penetration since its introduction in the third quarter, with 10 customers utilizing the new integrated system. iComplete is a real example of business transformation and its early success supports our expectations for growth in our completions revenue in 2021 to outperform the overall market.
Turning to the key drivers of our 2021 outlook for Surface Technologies. International revenue has grown to become an even more significant portion of our business mix. For the current year, we expect a gradual and steady recovery in well count to drive modest international market growth with spending increases led by National Oil companies, particularly in the Middle East. Our unique capabilities in this market, which demands higher specification equipment, global services, and local content provides a platform for us to extend our leadership positions.
For North America, we anticipate full-year revenue will likely be flat to down modestly versus 2020. Overall, Surface Technologies continues to benefit from the adoption of our digital solutions and the broader market recovery. We remain levered to more resilient international markets, where we expect to source approximately 65% of our full-year revenue.
Moving to the Subsea outlook. The Subsea opportunity list has expanded since our last update, reflecting our view of renewed customer confidence, given the improved economic outlook, lower market volatility and higher oil price. Four new projects were added in the period, increasing the total estimated value of the opportunity list by more than 15%. Two of the projects came back on the list after being extended beyond our 24 month view, during the height of the pandemic.
We experienced strong momentum in front-end activity in the second half of last year and we expect this to continue throughout 2021, creating an environment for a more sustainable deepwater recovery. Additionally, we expect at least 60% of the projects undergoing field studies in the current year to include an iEPCI solution, many of which will be direct awarded to our company.
As we have said before, we're increasingly less dependent on the larger publicly tendered projects. In 2020, just over 25% of our inbound came from projects on the opportunity list, and in 2021, that number will likely be lower. Much of our 2021 inbound sits beyond the opportunity list. We expect we'll be awarded more iEPCI and more Subsea services and we expect we’ll see more direct awards to our company than in the prior-year. This will include project work from our newest Alliance partner, Repsol Sinopec, where we have recently formed an exclusive five-year alliance to support oil and gas development in the United Kingdom, deploying both iFEED and iEPCI and leveraging our extensive installed base across the region. For 2021, we're very confident that orders will exceed the $4 billion achieved in 2020. We anticipate Brazil will be the most active region of the world for new projects driven by continued investment, and we see additional market growth potential coming from the North Sea, Asia Pacific and Africa.
The strong front-end activity we're experiencing today should support a multi-year outlook, driving our expectation for continued Subsea order growth in 2022.
Looking beyond the near-term Subsea outlook, we're excited for the role TechnipFMC will play in the energy transition with significant opportunities including novel wind, wave energy, carbon storage and green hydrogen. With over 70% of the world's surface covered by water, we view offshore, and more specifically, Subsea, as the next frontier for the energy transition. Offshore opportunities will require more technology innovation, involve an expanding list of players, and necessitate a higher level of collaboration. Our core competencies allow us to transform new technologies into commercially viable renewables projects.
We're well positioned to serve as system architect from technology development to project delivery and life of field services for these large scale renewables ventures.
Last year, we introduced Deep Purple. Deep Purple is a collaborative effort between TechnipFMC, our clients and partners. Our common goal is to integrate offshore renewable electricity and Subsea hydrogen storage to provide power to Subsea infrastructure and win at scale to provide clean energy to consumers. We have made significant progress with the conceptual and technical phases of this project. This includes the optimization of a hydrogen flexible flowline and riser qualification.
We have secured an innovation grant in Norway for a three-year pilot project, where we will lead the efforts to develop and optimize offshore wind, hydrogen and Advanced Energy Management. And we'll also develop a dynamic model in digital twin, further contributing to our overall digital strategy and Deep Purple is just the beginning for us. Further success in the energy transition will come from collaboration. Partnerships will be instrumental in this transformation.
We recently partnered with Floating Power Plant, a clean technology company for an EU grant deal application to fund an offshore green hydrogen pilot for the Canary Islands.
And we have also partnered with EDP Energias de Portugal on the beyond hydrogen project study Offshore Portugal. The ultimate path to commercialization for these and other opportunities will be driven by our ability to provide innovative and proprietary technologies that are unique to TechnipFMC.
Partner with our clients is the architect and integrator of the new energy system, and build new partner alliances that leverage our expertise in integrated project execution. Importantly, these are the same core capabilities that have driven our success in the traditional energy markets. And we'll also invest in early phase projects and solutions that accelerate the role of our technologies in the energy transition as we continue to redefine offshore energy.
I'll turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results in more detail and provide you with our outlook for 2021. Thanks, Doug.
Total company revenue was $3.4 billion in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $301 million. Total company inbound orders were $4.2 billion in the quarter, with Subsea meeting our expectation of approximately $4 billion in orders for the full-year. Backlog increased sequentially to $21.4 billion. Backlog for Subsea was $6.9 billion, or which $3.6 billion is scheduled for execution in 2021.
Cash flow from operations was $555 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $41 million, resulting in free cash flow of $514 million. Net cash more than doubled sequentially to $854 million.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.05 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.14 per diluted share.
Let me now discuss the segment highlights. Fourth quarter Subsea revenue decreased 10% versus the prior-year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by lower project activity in the North Sea and Brazil. The revenue decrease was partially offset by increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa and Asia Pacific. Subsea services revenue was largely unchanged from prior-year quarter. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7% decreased 370 basis points driven by lower activity and COVID-19 related impact.
Adjusted EBITDA for all operating segments included direct COVID-19 expenses in the current quarter. As a reminder, these expenses were excluded from adjusted results in previous quarters in 2020.
In Technip Energies, revenue of $1.8 billion remained largely unchanged, versus the prior-year quarter, and benefited from the continued ramp-up of Arctic LNG and higher activity on projects in Africa and Asia Pacific, which largely offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG and lower activity on projects in the Middle East and North America. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% declined 360 basis points versus the prior-year quarter due to a reduced contribution from Yamal LNG partially offset by continued strong project execution.
And in Surface Technologies, I'll focus on our sequential performance to demonstrate the underlying improvements in the quarter. Surface reported fourth quarter revenue of $262 million, a 16% sequential increase, driven by an expanded services offering and strong international backlog conversion, as well as increased drilling and completion activity in the United States. In the quarter, international represented more than 65% of total segment revenue. Surface acknowledges reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8%, a 410 basis points increase versus the third quarter, with North America posting a positive contribution for both the quarter and the full-year. The significant improvement was driven by higher activity and the benefit of our cost reduction activities throughout 2020.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow improved sequentially to $555 million driven by a significant improvement in working capital. Capital expenditures were $41 million in the period. For the full-year, capital expenditures of $292 million were within our guidance of approximately $300 million. Free cash flow for the period was $514 million, with full-year free cash flow of $365 million exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Free cash flow in the quarter benefited favorably from timing of targeted collections and expenditures, including advances from recently awarded projects. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, net cash improved $470 million sequentially to $854 million.
And finally, let me provide you with our 2021 outlook. Our guidance is based on continuing operations and does excludes the impact of Technip Energies which will be reported as discontinued operations. In Subsea, we're guiding full-year revenue to be in range of $5 billion to $5.4 billion. Backlog scheduled for execution in the current year is $3.6 billion. Subsea services revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion, the vast majority of which is not included in backlog today. Taken together close to 90% of revenue at the mid-point of our guidance range is fully supported by services and scheduled backlog. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to a range of 10% to 11% driven by the execution of higher margin backlog, improving vessel utilization, and the benefits of cost reduction activities.
For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion, with international revenue representing around 65% of total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to a range of 8% to 11% driven by the benefits of the lower operating cost base and a favorable revenue mix.
Turning to the other guidance items. We expect corporate expense of $105 million to $115 million which includes depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million. We expect net interest expense of $130 million to $135 million. We expect our reported tax provision for the full-year to be between $110 million and $120 million. The tax provision is impacted in the year by approximately $40 million of separation-related items and approximately $20 million of withholding taxes, which are taxes paid on revenue.
We expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million. Free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, is expected to be between $50 million and $150 million for the full-year. Importantly, I want to highlight that approximately $70 million of non-recurring separation-related expenses are included in this outlook. And this figure includes the $40 million in tax-related items just mentioned.
Lastly, I want to provide further comments regarding the capital structure of TechnipFMC. In our filing made at the time of separation on February 16th, we indicated that our pro forma capital structure consisted of approximately $2.2 billion on net debt.
Looking to the remainder of this year, we expect a reduction in net debt to be driven by the following: $200 million in proceeds from the sale of shares in Technip Energies to Bpifrance which we now have received. In early March, we will receive approximately $80 million in settlements associated with foreign exchange hedges related to debt repayments made at the time of the spend and free cash flow of approximately $200 million to be generated post separation when assuming the mid-point of free cash flow guidance for the year. Additionally, at the time of separation, and prior to the sale of shares to Bpifrance, we hold a 49.9% stake in Technip Energies that is currently valued at approximately $1.2 billion, which we intend to monetize subsequent to the 60-day lockup period and continuing over the next 18 months. Thank you, Alf.
Before we move to Q&A, I just want to close by expressing once again, how much excitement has been generated by the creation of both Technip Energies and TechnipFMC. We're very optimistic about the future for TechnipFMC and uniquely position as an international company with over 90% of revenue generated outside North America. An industry pure play highly levered to the Subsea market, which we believe is poised for a multi-year recovery; a fully integrated technology and services provider, supporting both the traditional and renewable energy industries; and a company that is focused on providing innovative solutions to meet the world's demand for energy, with innovative low carbon offerings like iProduction and all-electric Subsea; as the partner of choice, leveraging our extensive references as an architect and integrator, as our customers look offshore and Subsea to achieve the scale required for the new energy system. And through investment in early phase projects and solutions that accelerate the role of our technologies in the energy transition.
And we'll remain, we will maintain an intense focus on capital discipline and cash flow generation to accelerate the improvement in our capital structure as we continue to drive material and sustainable change in the markets we serve.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions].
Your first question comes from the line of George O'Leary from TPH & Co. Your line is now open. Just wanted to start-off with the competitive landscape in the Subsea space and the acceleration you guys have seen in awards as of late is included in the press release and the presentation. You guys have clearly kind of changed the game in the Subsea space taking costs way down adding in more digital and kind of automated technologies. And it seems like the competitors have stagnated a bit there. So just curious if it's really mostly the international paradigm that's led to you guys taking share in that market and changing paradigm there or the competitors that just kind of dropped the ball. How do you view that competitive landscape overall in the Subsea side? Thanks, George for the question. No, look I'm not going to comment on the competitors and their strategy. I think it's just important to reflect back on our strategy. We had a very clear vision and what you're seeing is the manifestation of that vision.
First and foremost, it begins with our people looking out for the health and wellbeing providing the tools necessary to do their job, and letting them execute in just a phenomenal way.
Secondarily, it's our partners. And you notice I'm not saying clients, I'm saying partners, many of our clients are partners in either Alliance agreements or Frame agreements, that that give us a unique capacity in the marketplace that others simply don't have access to. And again, it's really just seeing the vision become a reality. This started with FORCE at Subsea quite some time ago, when we first launched the concept of an Integrated FEED study. Then the transition to create the company on the 17th of January 2017 allowing us to actually to deliver integrated projects, the only company that can deliver an integrated project as a single company, having all the levers within their own control and we call that iEPCI.
Keeping in mind this whole time we were developing the next-generation of Subsea Equipment Subsea 2.0. And I gave updates in the many quarters preceding this, that talked about how we were progressing and how much of the FEED studies were integrated, how the increase in the integrated projects and the delivery of those projects, how Subsea 2.0 was beginning to saturate and become a large portion of our backlog. So with all that in hand, and a whole lot of discipline, because let's not forget, in 2018, I was having to defend why we weren't chasing market share for vessel utilization. And we made it very clear at that time, we believed in our vision, we believed in our model, it would show up, and we did not want to load our backlog with a low priced no-profit or very low profit backlog as a result of chasing market share, particularly on vessel-only contracts, where vessel day rates were at an unacceptable level in our opinion.
So we suffered for a short period of time, lower utilization, but now we're beginning to see all that manifest into the margins of the company and our ability to set ourselves up for continuous outperformance as you have indicated earlier.
And that's really it. It sounds simple, but this was a multi-year journey. It was difficult at times. But we are -- we could not be more thrilled in the position we have put our company. And right now, we also believe and obviously outside of our control, but certainly welcome an inflection point for the offshore and Subsea market that we believe will have a multiyear runway ahead of us. Thanks for the color there, Doug. And then just thinking about the Surface business, you guys provided the margin targets range for the 2021 timeframe. I assume through time, even the top end of the range, you want to get EBITDA margins above those levels? What's the long-term target from an EBITDA margin perspective for that business? And what's kind of the roadmap in your mind to get more there? Yes, very good question. Again, as I always talk about when I talk about the Surface business, in the Surface market, it's really a tale of two cities, international and North America. As we've indicated, we continue to progress our differentiation market share and presence in the international market. We actually added two key markets in the Middle East. And our presence in the Middle East through two very strategic contracts, and continue to benefit from the activity going on in the Kingdom, where we have a very important, long-established relationship, footprint and local content.
So if you will, that side of the equation is doing well. And when we look forward, we see -- it's always been quite stable, much less cyclical, much higher margins, why is that, the equipment we provide is just at a much higher standard than the equipment we supply in the North American market. And that's just due to the demands of the market, the demands of the types of reservoirs, flow rates, et cetera are very different between the international, most of the international market and the U.S. market. And much less competitive, we have much further differentiation.
The North American market, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we see the market having some signs of recovery. We're transforming the market with our iComplete offering, which is having significant market penetration and continue to drive our iProduction initiative in the North American market as well.
When we look forward in our ambition around the margins, we'll continue to do the right things and expand the market, the margins in the international market. But in the U.S. market, we're going to need a whole lot of help in terms of higher level of activities, absorption of capacity, et cetera before we see any real expansion in the North American market. Your next question comes from the line of Amy Wong from UBS. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning Doug. I had a few questions about the all-electric Subsea production systems. Firstly, I'd like to understand from a pricing perspective, or kind of more discussions with your clients. How different is the pricing of using an electric system versus more conventional traditional systems. And when you're discussing with your clients, what are some of the key kind of pressure points of getting them to adopt an electric Subsea production system? Good afternoon, Amy. Thank you. Look, we're super excited. I think I said this last quarter, or maybe two quarters ago, we think this transformation could and should happen very quickly.
First and foremost, we'll come to pricing; I'll answer your question. But first and foremost, the discussion with the client is around greenhouse gas emissions. And it's not just greenhouse gas emissions, but there are other emissions associated when you're using hydraulic power versus electric power. There's a lot more generation on the top side in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. And then there's also the reality of using a hydraulic fluid versus electric and associated risks of such. Operationally, it's preferred because you remove the latency that you have with hydraulically operated systems. And from our point of view, where it gets really exciting, Amy, is we can increase a tieback distance up to four times, four times.
So imagine the opportunity set when we have 50% -- over 50% of the world's infrastructure on the seabed today and growing as our market share continues to grow. Imagine the capacity that brings to our company for very high return projects for our clients to tieback satellite fields their own or others like in the recently announced alliance we formed with Repsol Sinopec back to their producing platform. So again, the discussion is around helping them reach their ambitions around the energy transition. This is a key enabler, allowing us to move forward and expand the opportunity in the market set, leveraging our installed base and helping our customers improve their returns, and then, finally, pricing. When you put it all together, you would expect that we would receive a higher level of pricing on these type of our projects, because our customers are receiving significant benefit. So it's a win-win situation. Very clear. Just a quick related follow-up, care to take a stab at, let's say by 2025, or some timeframe, you pick what your penetration is going to be and have the new system enrolled what's going to be electric versus non-electric? You'll hear about some awards for sure, in that timeframe. I won't go too far. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here. But you will definitely hear from us. We have the most let me back up just one second, Amy, we have electric in Subsea today, we have electrically operated in controls in Subsea today. And we have by far -- by far, more than the rest of the industry combined times a multiplier, the number of all-electric activated controls in Subsea today.
And one that we've talked about before that we continue to be very excited about is not just all-electric, and not just replacing the hydraulic with the electric controls, but the inclusion of robotics and using robotics for actuation much further simplifying the infrastructure as well. We call that our Subsea robotic manifold. They’re on the seabed operating today in Brazil for Petrobras. And we're excited to say we just received another award to build more subsea robotic manifolds which are just, we're talking Subsea 4.0 now, Amy, this is just well ahead of 2.0, as we continue to expand and develop.
So you'll hear more awards, we'll call them out, and what's the level of penetration, there's a large installed base out there. So it's not something that you can just flip overnight. But I think anybody looking at Greenfield projects today, or any sort of long distance tiebacks today would be well served, and certainly our clients and our partners are looking at all-electric as an option. Thank you, it's very, very exciting. I'll turn it over. Your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Thank you. And congrats on getting the spin completed. Good morning, Sean, and thank you very much. We're excited for ourselves. And we're excited for our friends at Technip Energies. So maybe just to start on the guidance. One of the biggest investor push backs coming into this release was margin progression in 2021 after the challenges in 2020, so I think there has been a lot of skepticism regarding your ability to improve margins if revenue is down year-on-year. And so there are a lot of moving parts, we've got costs have been taken out, COVID impacts are hopefully receding as the year goes on, Subsea services mix can be a help, vessel calendar has been a challenge. So you maybe just help us unpack those pieces that drive the margin guidance, including the upside and downside of that range? Sure, Sean. It's a little -- I won't repeat everything that I mentioned when I was responding to George's question a bit earlier, but the same playbook applies, right? This is the manifestation of the vision and our steadfast determination to deliver it. So, you heard in Alf's prepared remarks, I don't think you've heard that from us before or certainly from anyone else that our margins in backlog are improving. So, this has to do with the fact of an intense amount of discipline, not chasing projects at any cost, walking away from the table, you see this on the large public tenders that are made public, the results are made public, you see where we typically fall. When you have almost 50% of your revenue being direct awarded to your company through your alliance partners, Subsea Services where the conversion of integrated FEED studies to direct award iEPCI, both of which we said will grow in 2021. That's a very different environment than being out there bidding competitive day rates for vessels in a market that is, that has too much capacity in the market today.
As I mentioned earlier, we took a -- we took some hard comments back in 2018 because of our surf market share, which was shrinking at the time. We said we were doing that, because we believed in our vision. We believed that we would get the iFEED studies converted with the iEPCI projects, which would flow through and provide a higher margin and higher returns. But to do that, we needed to maintain the capacity of the fleet, and not fill it up with these low day rate, no margin or zero margin contracts. So we passed on those. And now what you're seeing is the benefit of that.
So look, I appreciate what you said, Sean, it's the secret sauce. It shows we're doing something; we're not sitting back and waiting for revenue to recover, for margins to recover. We're a company that is extremely disciplined that has a vision that has an absolutely unique operating model, and an incredibly favorable client and partner base that we respect and honor and cherish and support every single day. Yes, I appreciate that. And I think it's certainly good to see the turn unfolding. Maybe just turning to cash flow, some one-time cash items are impacting free cash flow this year. But the CapEx guidance is 4% of revenue. Is that a good run rate for capital intensity for the business now? And how do we think about normalized free cash flow for this business? I mean, it could be a free cash flow margin of sales; it could be conversion of EBITDA, some type of metrics that you point us to think about what this business can look like when we get through the transition period here? This is Alf here. So let me start with I think the capital expenditure question, as you mentioned. I think it's a fair level that you're seeing a data $250 million right now, where we can sustain our business model as we see it. And you don't expect significant growth CapEx above that as we go-forward.
In terms of cash flow, I don't know that I can commit to a certain level as a ratio. But clearly, what we are embarking on as a company, given our profile of our balance sheet et cetera is that we are going to be committed to generating cash. So, as you see us operating from this year and onwards, we're going to be intensely focused on generating cash. And in that, we obviously expect to drive up these ratios over time as we progress. Your next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Your line is now open. Thank you. Sticking with cash, the bridge from the old, the pro forma capital structure to what was most recently announced you talked about now you've got an expectation for $200 million of free cash flow post-close. And I'm just wondering if you could square that with the guidance for the year of $50 million to $100 million or $150 million excuse me, $50 million to $150 million for the year? Yes. So let me try to keep it pretty simple in this. So first of all, without going through maybe all the details of what I said before, getting from the current capital structure that we had now with the Bpi funds in hand. And then with some of the proceeds from the foreign exchange hedges that were mentioned, the reality is that we've had about $100 million of outflow in the first -- maybe [ph] during the year and we're going to get $200 million in the back half of the year. And that's the way we get back to the capital structure. Got it, got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then the other question relates to Surface and the margin that you're guiding to here down from fourth quarter as the range is down from where you were in the fourth quarter. And Doug, I know your commentary about the international being better margin, it looks like international is going to be higher mix for you in 2021. So I'm just curious, I would have expected that margin to be improving from where you were. So maybe you could provide some commentary around that? Sure. So look, in the fourth quarter, particularly in our international business, we had some very favorable settlements or recent favorable milestones and therefore was able to recognize that in the fourth quarter. But really nothing to add beside the earlier comments, we're well positioned, we have the right, we believe we're in the right locations, at least that's, I think playing well -- playing out very well. We have very long-term relationships where we have very high-levels of local content and expanding some of that local content in some of those key countries. And again, it is really important to emphasize, a surface tree is not a surface tree. And you can have a surface tree in West Texas, you can have one in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and you can want to have one offshore on top of the platform. And they are very different, very different in terms of their technical content, in terms of who the qualified companies that are able to bid on those type of projects. And the fact that in the international business, for our Surface Technologies, we're almost entirely vertically integrated. Everything flows to our manufacturing facility in Singapore; we're not relying so much on third-party. And certainly we're out of the commoditized market that we face in a lot of North America.
So, consider Q4 an exceptional quarter. I don't think you can take Q4 times for unexpected, it could have expected us to deliver that versus the full-year of 2020. It's already a substantial step-up full-year versus full-year. We're real proud of the work that our team is doing in Surface Technologies, not only around the international market, but as I said, really beginning to imply digital solutions and transform the North American market at the same time. Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from ATB Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Good morning, and Doug, congrats on a successful spin-off. So, my first question is with respect to Brazil looks like in the Subsea side in new orders, Brazil is going to be a big part of the new orders. So as you look forward over the next 12 to 18 months, do you think that if you win some awards there, would that be dilutive to overall Subsea kind of margins, Brazil are neutral or additive? How do you think about that? Great question, Waqar. And let me just start by saying, yes, Brazil is a country, but it's really South America. And I've said this in prior calls for the next decade, it's really -- it's very much going for us and that this is unique to us, it's very much going to be about Brazil, Guyana and Suriname and other countries in South America. And why do I say unique to us? I think, you know, our position in Brazil; I think you know our position in Guyana which we're very proud of. And again, makes it a bit -- some of it differentially beneficial to our company.
We have a phenomenal capacity in Brazil, phenomenal capacity. We've installed manufacturing installed more Subsea equipment for Petrobras than the competition. We have an incredible services team that supports that. And we have manufacturing for Subsea equipment as well as for rigid and flexible flowlines that is best-in-class in the country.
So, we're well positioned, we understand the market, we understand the client. We have deep long-term relationships with Petrobras. Petrobras has been a leading adopter of our technology. I just -- I talked about Subsea compact robotic actuated all-electric manifolds earlier, they've done some really amazing things. We're working on a Subsea seabed CO2 separation reinjection, which will really be a key enabler for the future production. And we're working on our hybrid flexible pipe, which is advancing very well in terms of the qualification along with Petrobras to address the stress corrosion issues that the industry has faced.
So all that being said, I think they deeply respect us. They understand that we have a certain expectation that we need to deliver to our shareholders and it has not created an issue for us to be able to do that.
Now, beyond Petrobras, we also have two other tiers of customers in Brazil. We have the IOCs who have invested heavily, heavily into assets, sub-surface assets in Brazil. They're moving pretty aggressively towards plans to develop those. And I think you know this but I already might have stated this in the past but we've pretty much done all the IOC Subsea projects to-date. So we have a track record really across the board with all of them and experiences with all of them in Brazil. And they deep field that is obviously that beneficial when you move from the pre-sold to the post-sold now with those same clients.
And then finally, the third-tier is a group of -- a group at a fast growing group of independents, both Brazilian independents and non-Brazilian independents that are beginning to look at deepwater developments in Brazil. We're really the partner of choice for them. Some have extensive footprints in Brazil, some do not. Some have extensive experience in deepwater, some do not. So when they know they can come to TechnipFMC is the only company who can provide them a fully integrated end-to-end solution from concept to pre-FEED all the way through the life appealed and supported their assets, positions us very well. So I know a long answer to your question. So I'll stop there and I apologize. No, no, that was a great answer. Thank you. And then just like a follow-up, on the services side Subsea, how do you think of revenue opportunity in 2021 versus 2020, in terms of directionally what the magnitude of the change could be? So referring to Subsea services, correct Waqar? That is correct, yes. That is correct, yes. Yes, look we certainly expect that to grow in not only in 2021 but in 2022, that's being driven by let's just face it, our installed base is growing. If you just look at the market share that we have gained since the creation of TechnipFMC and the only company offering a true integrated offering. I mean, it's been substantial. As you know, back in 2019, it was 50% of our inbound or $4 billion of just integrated projects. And so all these projects come along with most I should say most, if not all of these projects come along with a very long-term service contract associated, we're installing more, and certainly we'll be installing more in 2022, 2023. So that goes up, we are servicing more of the installed base, because it's growing, our installed base is growing, plus it's aging.
And on top of that, we expect to see a lot more Subsea well intervention wellbore, I should say Subsea wellbore intervention. There's a lot of Subsea wells that are offline today, because something is failed in the wellbore. As you know, we don't do wellbores, that's not our scope, but something down there under the ground, something happened and the way that the customer accesses that is to, we go out with them either on the rig or on one of our vessels, to be able to retrieve the Subsea tree, put in place the controls so that they can enter into the wellbore, perform the remedy that's required, and then reinstall our equipment. And that's a very important part of our Subsea services.
So I kind of what I'm alluding to is a lot of OpEx growth, followed by CapEx growth, driving our Subsea Services growth. Our last caller comes from the line of Chris Voie from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to try a little bit on cash flow one more time. So excluding the separation costs of $70 million, I think guidance suggests about 20% to 40% of EBITDA conversion in 2021. If I think about lower interest expense, and probably an opportunity for cost efficiency, and maybe tax efficiency, should future years gravitate higher compared to that 20% to 40% or is there any kind of one-time benefits this year that maybe aren't visible that could be a headwind? So let me start and say, there aren't any material one-time benefits really to this year first of all. I think you're right about that we have certain costs that are detracting a little bit from our current ability to generate the capital that we would like. So if you look at things like interest expense, as you mentioned, if we can continue with our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, get the interest expense down, that's an important component. I think we have to work on optimizing our tax positions a little bit more. Those are a couple of items that our detractors at this point. But there's no reason that we could grow cash flow generation after considering those items as an example. And then of course, on the back of where we think the markets could be going in the long-term and generating further EBITDA would set us up for future cash flow generations. And Alf, you stated earlier but I know how pleased we are that we've received the $200 million payment from Bpifrance and the $80 million on the reversal or the benefit from the hedges will be coming as you said in early March. So, it's not something in the distance. It's right in front of us. It's happening today. It's exactly what we said. There was some near-term, short-term capacities due to the fact that we accelerated the spin schedule from 90 days to 40 days. But we're getting back to exactly the levels that we had discussed earlier, and I couldn't be more proud of the work that is being done. So thank you, Alf. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And maybe just specifically on corporate expense, I guess it's tracking about $90 million to $100 million ex-D&A this year. How do we think about the opportunity to streamline those costs as you normalize in 2022 plus? Yes, so first of all, of course, if you look at the corporate expense for 2021 and obviously, we have streamlined them a little bit already from the removal of incremental expenses associated with Technip Energies. We also further have had some cost reductions in spite of our programs in 2020. We also have some headwinds into 2021. Corporate expense that is not as visible maybe, but that includes some increase in pension liability expense, that actually is driving up the expense.
So when you kind of look at that, there are going to be continued opportunities to look at driving down this cost. I'm not going to give you an exact number, but clearly it's a number that we're looking at to make sure we continue to streamline as we run this business. At this time, I'll turn it over to Mr. Seinsheimer for any closing remarks. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt.
Our first quarter as a leading pure-play technology and services provider to both traditional and new energy industries began with solid financial results, with notable achievements that uniquely position us in the growing markets we serve. This was reflected through strong operational execution and improving market backdrop that is poised to be even stronger for longer and continued development of real and material opportunities for TechnipFMC in the energy transition.
Starting with the operational performance. We had an exceptional quarter in both operating segments. In Subsea, revenue grew sequentially in the period, driven by particularly strong execution of project backlog that offset the seasonal reduction in installation activity.
In Surface Technologies, our international operations represented nearly 70% of total segment revenue, and we remain focused on delivering profitable results, supported by strong execution, both in the international and U.S. markets. In the U.S., we experienced sequential revenue growth despite the severe winter weather.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations totaled $165 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations totaled $137 million. We ended the quarter with net debt of $1.8 billion. And earlier this week, we announced the partial sale of our stake in Technip Energies for approximately $360 million.
Inbound orders from continuing operations improved sequentially to $1.7 billion. Subsea inbound more than doubled sequentially to $1.5 billion, reflecting solid order momentum and a book-to-bill of 1.1.
Integrated projects comprise nearly 40% of our Subsea order inbound in the quarter with particular strength in iEPCI orders and increased adoption of 2.0 technologies. During the quarter, we announced two separate iEPCI projects with Energean, building upon our previous experience with the Karish development and leveraging our iFEED capabilities to further extend our collaborative relationship to additional opportunities.
We also received an iEPCI contract for the PETRONAS Limbayong project in Malaysia, their first deepwater development, awarded based on our Subsea 2.0 technology and integrated execution.
Other projects awards in the period included a contract for manifolds for the Petrobras Marlim and Voador fields offshore Brazil. The manifolds will utilize our next-generation all-electric robotic technology that replaces traditional subsea hydraulics, as well as thousands of mechanical parts, while providing real-time data and analysis on performance. The use of digital automation and control allows for a more compact unit that is smaller, less complex and less costly with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. And the robotic software can be remotely upgraded, increasing the overall reliability and availability of the subsea systems.
Turning to the market outlook. Client conversations remain constructive, suggesting a further increase in activity. Additionally, the external conditions that have driven oil and gas prices higher could provide greater price stability over the intermediate term. These include expansion in economic activity, driven by strong fiscal stimulus, COVID vaccinations and expanded reopenings of local economies, and more constrained supply, a function of disciplined capital spend, particularly for OPEC+, whose actions appear focused on realizing a price that supports economic growth and continued energy investment.
In Surface Technologies, international revenue continued to expand and represented nearly 70% of the segment in the quarter, driven by strength in the Middle East, North Sea and Asia Pacific.
These markets demand higher specification equipment, global services and local capabilities, areas where we continue to further differentiate our offering.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we are nearing completion and start-up of a new facility that will significantly increase our local manufacturing capabilities. And in the North Sea, our extensive experience and high-pressure, high-temperature technologies provide us significant opportunities in a region where activity remains robust and well-supported by government incentives. We believe our unique capabilities will allow us to extend our leadership positions in these more resilient geographies.
In Subsea, we are confident in our 2021 outlook of more than $4 billion in inbound orders. And we are well on our way to meeting this commitment just three months into the year. We expect continued benefit from our differentiated market strategy as well as favorable market fundamentals. More specifically, we believe that integrated project awards have the potential to more than double versus the prior year. And the combination of direct awards and our service-related orders could represent 50% of total inbound for the full year.
We also believe that we will see order growth again in 2022, supported in part by an expanding list of opportunities on our opportunities map, where total project revenue or value grew 10% sequentially at the midpoint, despite the award of three projects during the period.
In summary, we see potential for a recovery in global activity that is longer and more sustainable than what has been experienced in previous cycles, allowing for continued investment in traditional markets, while providing incremental capital for the development of new energy resources.
With regard to new energy resources, we believe that renewable energy will be increasingly sourced and stored offshore for both environmental and scalability reasons. The momentum has clearly shifted for offshore wind, in particular, which has attracted considerable attention in recent months. There was significant interest in the recent auction for seabed leases in the UK, with sites auctioned for more than 10 times prices paid in the previous auction.
Norway is also moving forward with North Sea wind power, awarding its first development licenses for both fixed and floating wind developments. And the United States has unveiled a growth -- a goal to expand offshore wind energy in the coming decade by opening new areas for development, accelerating permits and increasing public project financing.
We believe that an increasing share of this investment will be made in deeper waters, where winds are stronger and more consistent. It is estimated that nearly 80% of the world’s offshore wind resource potential is in waters deeper than 60 meters. This will require floating and seabed infrastructure for energy generation, storage and transmission, all of which can be enabled by our Deep Purple technology.
During the quarter, we announced two strategic partnerships, both of which are focused on generating renewable energy from novel wind and wave resources. First, we announced a partnership with Magnora to jointly pursue offshore wind project development opportunities. Magnora holds a strategic position within the renewable energy sector as an owner in wind project development. The partnership has already commenced operations and is focused on opportunities in Scotland and Norway, and will consider entering new markets in the coming months.
Additionally, we announced a strategic partnership with Bombora to bring together both wind and wave power, utilizing Bombora’s mWave technology, coupled with proprietary technologies from TechnipFMC to convert wave energy into electricity. By combining both wind and wave, we believe we can generate even higher yields from floating turbines when compared to fixed projects, further lowering project development costs.
Importantly, we will look to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by utilizing the very same playbook that led to the successful transformation of our subsea business and extended our technological differentiation, increased project economics and improved our market positioning.
And to be clear, we are playing the long game, built around our differentiated technologies and integration capabilities and focused on selecting the right partners and the right projects. Remember, the benefits of this path were not obvious at the time we initiated iEPCI. Integrated project execution was a fundamental change in the approach to subsea project delivery, and its tremendous success gives us absolute confidence that we are taking the right steps to create a sustainable and high-returns business to address the market demand for a renewable future.
I will now turn the call over to Alf Melin. Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $165 million. Inbound orders were $1.7 billion. Total Company backlog was largely unchanged sequentially and stood at $7.2 billion at the end of the period. Backlog for subsea was $6.9 billion, of which $3.9 billion is scheduled for execution beyond 2021. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $753 million and net debt of $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we recognized a gain of $470 million related to our equity ownership in Technip Energies. This relates primarily to the change in the fair market value of our remaining stake, which for this initial period reflects the difference between book value at the time of separation and the market value at quarter-end.
Income per share from continuing operations was $0.95 per diluted share in the quarter. When excluding the impact of the change in fair market value of Technip Energies and other charges that netted to an after-tax credit of $0.99, the adjusted loss from continuing operations per share was $0.03.
With the partial spin-off of Technip Energies completed during the quarter, financial results for Technip Energies are now reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the results of discontinued operations on the income statement include the historical results of Technip Energies prior to its spin-off on February 16, 2021, and all separation-related costs incurred for the transaction. Additionally, there were no assets or liabilities classified as discontinued operations on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our investment in Technip Energies is now reflected in current assets at market value as of March 31, 2021.
Now, let me turn to the segment results. I will focus on our sequential performance with the first quarter compared to our fourth quarter 2020 segment results. In subsea, inbound orders were $1.5 billion in the quarter, providing us with a very strong start to the year. Revenue of $1.4 billion increased approximately 4%, benefiting from strong project execution of backlog. The geographic mix of projects mitigated the seasonal decline in activity. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7% improved sequentially by 100 basis points as the increased manufacturing productivity more than offset the decline in services activity.
In Surface Technologies, first quarter revenue of $245 million decreased 6% sequentially, driven by the seasonal decline in customer activity and the timing of backlog conversion in international markets. Revenue in North America declined due in part to the Company’s exit from certain underperforming markets, partially offset by growth in the U.S., where we benefited from further adoption of the iComplete ecosystem.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% declined 80 basis points versus the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by continued improvement in operational performance and a lower cost structure.
Turning to cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $182 million in the period. Capital expenditures were $44 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $137 million. During the quarter, Bpifrance acquired $100 million in Technip Energies shares from our retained stake as part of the share purchase agreement related to the spin-off. Bpifrance had previously provided funding to us for up to 200 million of shares as a result of their revised level of investment, we refunded $100 million to Bpifrance earlier this month. Neither of these items impact our free cash flow as the activities related to disposition of Technip Energies shares are reported in the investment section of our cash flow statement.
Turning to corporate items. Our corporate expense was $29 million in the period. Excluding charges totaling $3 million, the expense was $26 million. During the quarter, we experienced a $28 million gain on foreign exchange. We also incurred a $24 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of our debt structure at the time of the spin. Tax expense for the quarter was $25 million.
Now, let me provide you with an update on our financial guidance for 2021. Our strong start to the year gives us further confidence in our outlook, and we reiterate our full year segment guidance. As a reminder, guidance is based on continuing operations and thus excludes the impact of Technip Energies, which is reported as discontinued operations.
Separation-related tax items and costs were also reported in discontinued operations during the first quarter. And as a result of this change in where these expenses are recorded, we have removed the anticipated impacts from our guidance.
Our full year guidance for the tax provision has been revised lower to a range of $70 million to $80 million, which now excludes separation-related tax items of approximately $40 million, while free cash flow guidance for the full year has been revised higher to a range of $120 million to $220 million, which now excludes the separation-related tax items and costs of approximately $70 million. The estimated separation-related expenses remain in line with our expectations, but are now included in discontinued operations. These expenses were incurred during the first quarter, and we do not anticipate calling out any further material separation-related items in our financial statements.
And finally, this week, we announced the sale of 26.8 million shares of our ownership stake in Technip Energies for proceeds of approximately $360 million to TechnipFMC. There is no tax liability associated with the sale of our shares. The share sale will reduce our ownership stake to 55.5 million shares or approximately 31% of Technip Energies’ outstanding shares. As we have previously stated, we do not intend to remain a long-term shareholder of Technip Energies, and this transaction clearly demonstrates our commitment to exit our holdings in a timely and orderly manner.
I will close by highlighting the key takeaways regarding our cash-related items. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $753 million and net debt of $1.8 billion. Free cash flow in the period was $137 million, and we expect that our performance over the remainder of the year will meet guidance. And lastly, after adjusting for the $100 million refund to Bpifrance, net debt in the second quarter will benefit from approximately $260 million in proceeds related to the announced block sale transaction. This leaves us with increased liquidity and greater financial flexibility, while demonstrating solid progress towards our commitment to return to investment-grade status.
I will now turn the call back over to Doug for his closing remarks. Thank you, Alf.
In closing, our first quarter results provide us with a very strong start to the year in support of our 2021 commitments. Our strong order inbound clearly demonstrates that we continue to solidify our leadership position in conventional energy.
Looking ahead, we expect robust and sustained activity across our businesses, supported by improving market fundamentals and our competitive differentiation. Our work to develop novel wind and wave energy and subsea hydrogen technologies through our Deep Purple project is progressing well. Strategic partnerships such as and Magnora and Bombora will further advance and accelerate our efforts.
We remain committed to delivering a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To help achieve this goal, we have converted an existing vessel, the Deep Arctic, into the world’s first hybrid dive support vessel. And we will continue to leverage our core strengths to create a unique position for TechnipFMC in the development of new energy sources, as we have done successfully in our conventional business.
We are also very excited to announce that we will host an Analyst Day scheduled for the 16th of November, where we will showcase our strategic priorities and initiatives that support them.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Let me start off with a kind of a big picture question for you. With the business lines you’re in, I think you probably have more insight into global offshore production trends than just about anybody. Sorry to relive this with you, but subsea trees peaked at 550 in 2014, floating rigs at 260, and we’ve been at less than half those levels for several years now. Yet the forecast I see, it’s right for instance show global offshore production staying flat after 2025, and only have decline rates of about 5% in their models, and a surprising 4 million barrels of incremental new capacity coming on by ‘25. I mean I get it, these are long-cycle projects that take years to complete. But, shouldn’t the huge drop in rigs and trees start manifesting in production soon? I’m really having trouble tying the two together, really like to get your opinion, how you’re thinking about kind of global offshore production over the next, let’s say, five years? Sure. And David, when you say manifest in -- you’re speaking of increased activity, you said production, but activity... Well, I’m just looking at the production. I’m just tying -- yes, I’m just tying together the two of kind of your activity and the production, and why they’re not really -- why we’re not seeing that kind of showing up in the numbers? And when you do start seeing it in the numbers, and when really kind of offshore really starts to come down? Sure. And I just emphasize that because of the point that you made in your question, which was these are long-cycle projects. So, there is a time lag between the activity and the actual increase in production. So, look, let’s just kind of break it down a little bit. Obviously, our Company has experienced not only the benefit of an increase in activity but a significant increase in our market position, if you will. That’s a result of bringing to the market something new, something innovative, both in terms of technology, Subsea 2.0 as well as in terms of a unique commercial model, iEPCI or the integrated project, where we’re the only single entity that can provide such a combination. This was manifested in the recent PETRONAS Limbayong award. This is PETRONAS’ first deepwater. They do a lot of offshore, but this was their first deepwater project, and they saw the benefit of both Subsea 2.0 and iEPCI, and if you will, combined into an iEPCI 2.0 award that went to our Company.
So, we’re seeing certain activity that, let’s say, the rest of the market is not experiencing. We’re very privileged and very grateful for that. In addition to that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do see an increased level -- well, we’ve been -- I mentioned back in 2019 that we were seeing an increased level of front-end engineering of work or iFEED studies as well as traditional feed studies, front and engineering and design. And then again, in last year, in 2020, I emphasized how we were seeing a further increase in iEPCI studies.
As mentioned at the time, they’re 9 to 18 months, depending upon the project and the customer at what time they can move forward to the FID phase. So, we’re kind of seeing that manifest itself right now, which is why back in October of 2019 -- 2020, excuse me, I was able to give guidance in terms of our potential inbound for this year, which at the time, let’s face it, was still -- there still wasn’t a lot of visibility into the market at the time, but it’s that proprietary set of opportunities that we have that just give us a completely different view of the market, and that’s why we were able to provide the guidance we gave around the indication around inbound orders for this year, and again, off to a very strong start.
So David, we’re seeing it happen. I don’t -- I think you have to look at TechnipFMC through a slightly different lens than, if you will, the rest of the market. And you have -- just understanding that we have access to a market that is quite significant. Again, I mentioned, this year could be 50% of our inbound could be direct awarded to our Company. So, yes, we’re seeing it, and it’s what gives us the confidence. And David, it’s been a long time, I think, since anybody in this industry has talked about 2022 inbound in first quarter of 2021, or if you will, that far ahead. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we definitely are looking at a 2022 inbound. Now, obviously, things can happen, but barring extension of the pandemic or some other global economic crisis, we see 2022 as a further inflection point in our inbound orders and activity. That will then translate to production as those projects come on line. Got you. And then -- so it was obviously impressive subsea orders this quarter. We’ve also heard some rather positive comments from some of the service guys. And as you’re starting to kind of ramp up, obviously, your iEPCI model seems just perfectly suited for this kind of market. I guess, if you’re looking out, I mean, -- I give you a lot of credit for having the confidence kind of looking out to ‘22. But kind of looking at the next several years, I guess the question is, do you think there is enough opportunities out there in this type of business? If we kind of stay on this level and maybe even ignoring some of the bigger projects, do you think that the subsea business overall can kind of get back to those double-digit year-on-year growth? And do you think that’s enough -- I’m talking in the next couple of years here, I’m not pushing it on near-term guidance, but do you think that’s enough to get subsea margins back into that kind of 13%ish range kind of where they were before that whole peak that we saw in the 13s, 14s? Yes. Well, we provided our guidance for this year, and we obviously started off with a very good first quarter in our subsea margins. Obviously, subsea revenue was very strong. So, we would expect, as we continue to move forward with the increased level of activity that we -- that you should expect, and we expect that we would deliver an increasing margin as well. So, if you look at our margin guidance right now, we’re not far from your target. So, I think that when you put that target out there for the next two or three years is I think how you framed it, I don’t think that that’s an unrealistic expectation at all. Your next question comes from Guillaume Delaby with Societe Generale. One question for Alf. Following the disposal of at least a partial spin-off, how should we think about your working capital? How should we model? Can you provide us maybe one, two or three, I would say, guideline, which would make sense for us? Yes. Thank you for the question. So, when we think about working capital, obviously, first of all, we acknowledge that we had some working capital inflow in this first quarter. And it’s not unusual that we’re going to have some quarters that have some inflow and some outflow that varies. Over the period of a year, we’d like to think that it nets out to some degree. But if we specifically look at the forecast for the rest of the year, we are confident in that we will be close to working capital neutral. So, I mean, I would always start with a starting point to working capital neutral. And then, from that point, we will advise and forecast if there are unusual items that impacts beyond that. So, when you look out for the full year this year, we expect to basically keep the working capital favorability we recognized so far in this first quarter, be more neutral for the rest of the year and end up with a free cash flow that is in line with our guidance. Your next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. So, Doug, you mentioned on the Subsea performance in the first quarter was strong, and it sounded like there was some manufacturing throughput that helped there. And certainly, as we progress from here, I would suspect that that stays at a similar level or improves, and then you get a seasonal recovery in services. So, just based on that understanding, I would think that your margins would be biased higher in the second and third quarter from where you were in the first, just curious if you have any commentary around that. Sure, Marc. As you know, we give annual guidance. We try to avoid getting into the quarterly guidance routine. But, I would not disagree with your thought in terms of there is certain efficiencies that we’re seeing is obviously recovery from everything that we went through and our supply chain went through in 2020. We obviously have some very good, solid backlog. I mentioned this last quarter, maybe even the quarter before, and we’ll reemphasize it because it’s really quite important and I think, unique to our Company. Our margins and backlog are improving. So, it’s quality, not quantity or quality and quantity in our case. So, that’s very, very important as well as we continue to look forward.
That being said, we did -- this is a projects type business. So, when you have increased performance and execution performance or cadence, that accelerates some milestones, but it doesn’t necessarily repeat every quarter because you achieve those milestones. Those milestones happen on an intermittent basis. So, I just want to caution that we just don’t draw a straight-line from south to north. But understand that the business is performing very, very well. I’m very proud of the work that the women and men are doing and have done throughout a very difficult 2021 and now really seeing the potential of this Company as we move forward as a standalone pure-play. The next question I had was a bit longer term and related to Deep Purple. You mentioned technology there. And my understanding of Deep Purple is it’s perhaps more of a concept at this stage than actual technology development. I suspect you’d disagree with that. And I’m curious on your on sort of what tangible technology you have that’s being developed towards that project? And then also, if you could comment on the agreement with Magnora, and sort of why Magnora versus perhaps some other offshore developers that could be out there? Sure. Two great questions. On the first, I’m going to -- it’s not that I disagree with you. Certainly, it’s a unique concept. And secondly, yes, we do have technology to support it. Bear in mind that we’re talking about a substance, if you will, that is very difficult to handle, both from a corrosive point of view, but also from a stability point of view. So, there’s a tremendous amount of technology development that has been going on for four years, Marc. We didn’t talk about this four years ago because we like to have something real that before we start talking about and, if you will, marketing things. And it was important for us to develop this. It’s been a long process.
Yes, it started as a concept over four years ago, but we’ve been well into the technology that’s called the TRL process, where you’re actually qualifying your products, where you’re qualifying their capabilities, ceiling surfaces, containment, et cetera, to be able to operate not only with a particularly challenging substance, hydrogen, but also to do it in a particularly challenging environment, which we know very, very well, which is subsea.
So, if you’ll allow me to kind of throw out a little marketing opportunity here, we hope that you’ll participate in November in our Analyst Day because that will give us the opportunity to really showcase the technology, and that’s -- will be a big portion of that Analyst Day. So, I’ll leave that where that is for now, but progressing quite well. And we’re well into multiple phases on the Deep Purple project.
Magnora, thank you for asking. Look, we’re very pleased to partner with Magnora. We felt it was -- for us, it’s finding the right relationship where we can work well together, collaborate well together. That’s what our Company does. We build deep, intimate client relationships. We work with clients for 20, 25 years on an exclusive basis in our traditional business, and we would expect to do the same as we move into the new energies. So, we spend a lot of time in building that relationship before just jumping into a partnership.
That being said, we are likely to have other partners in offshore wind as well. So, we felt Magnora was the right partner at this time with a good opportunity set that we’re very proud to be part of and to work with, but it doesn’t mean that there won’t be other partners, just like in our traditional business, where we have multiple partners and multiple relationships. Your next question comes from Amy Wong with UBS. A couple of questions from me. The first question is, I think one of the kind of notable data points for this quarter is in your subsea backlog. It seems to have had a pretty decent increase of inbound converting into 2021 execution. So, is that a fair observation? And if yes, is there any kind of trend to call out in terms of the types of projects your clients are moving forward with? Maybe there’s a bit of pent-up demand that seems to mean like the inbound is converting to revenue in a slightly shorter timeframe than usual? This is Alf here. I can take that one. Let’s say this, every quarter, there is some movement in the backlog scheduling. And in this case, you are absolutely right that there is some accelerated demand in our execution. So, we are able to capitalize on that. And that overall is driving us in terms of our look now at the full year guidance for our revenue to trend a little bit more towards the high end of the guidance range for revenue in Subsea. So, overall, that’s a positive picture. And Amy, good afternoon. I’ll add to that. In terms of -- you were asking, was there any change and, if you will, the client mix or the project mix? Clearly, as clients move to optimizing the utilization of their installed offshore infrastructure, in other words, doing more tiebacks or more brownfield opportunities, iEPCI and Subsea 2.0 is -- I mean, it’s just the right thing at the right time. So, we’ve already demonstrated now for years our ability to be able to take a 20-month project and deliver it in 14 months installed commission on the seabed. We were working all through 2020, during the pandemic, we were working very closely with almost all of our major -- all of the major subsea players, almost all of them, had programs underway to really study what additional resource could be tied back to their infrastructure, potentially their own or potentially that of another oil Company.
And we’ve been part of that discussion. We’ve been, in some ways, part of -- in working with multiple different oil companies to bring that to a reality because we have this unique solution where we can go out and deliver installed commission on the seabed in half the time as the conventional market or the competition. And that will drive, if you will, a quicker acceleration or conversion between the inbound and the revenue and the profitability as we see a greater mix of those type of projects in our backlog. Got you. Okay. My second question just relates to your announcement to host an Analyst Day in November. Now, quite a far -- put a long way away, but just wanted to understand is FTI kind of posted spinning off energy. Are you guys pursuing a bit more branch review of the strategy? And should we expect some big strategic update in November, or are you characterizing this slightly differently is only just -- or rather more focused on just looking at the technology? Well, Amy, let me start by saying we know you all are under a high demand and hugely popular, and that is a busy time of the year, both in terms of conferences as well as in terms of potentially other people having Capital Markets Days or Analyst Days. So, we just wanted to get on your calendar early, and we certainly hope that you’ll be able to join us.
In terms of the structure, sure, you should expect that we’ll be talking strategy as well as technology. We’re a company that drives change. We’re a company of innovation. I think we continue to surprise to the upside and not only surprise the upside but to deliver against what we state. So, we’re certainly excited for it.
We think it will be a time well spent, and we hope that you’ll be able to join us. Your next question comes from George O’Leary with TPH & Company. Free cash flow guidance increase was very nice to see. I was just wondering if you could frame the low end and the high end, what drives kind of the low end or the high end of that range. Sure. So, first of all, free cash flow guidance increased. And as we -- I was trying to be very clear in my prepared remarks, this is a direct result of the separation-related expenses that we had previously assumed would be in our continuing operations that are now in our -- were recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter. But overall, if you’re honest, we are -- if I’m honest, there is mostly the variations will be around working capital timing. So, for the most part, even though we are confident in that we can deliver around a neutral working capital for the remainder of the year, there is still some risk there.
Can we manage other pieces of the free cash flow, such as capital expenditures? Yes, possibly. So, there are some dynamics in that. We’re obviously demonstrating here some of our belief in that our guidance in terms of the revenue potential in Subsea and even to some degree, the margin potential in Surface so far can drive some favorability. So, overall, we’re looking favorably at our ability to deliver the full year free cash flow forecast as we have guided to. All right. Very helpful. And then, just a bigger picture question with respect to the renewables or energy transition side of the equation. Just curious if you could frame the pathway or glide path to that side of the business becoming a material portion of revenue? And then, maybe what’s the nearest-term opportunities are comprised of, whether it’s offshore wind, floating solar, tidal wave plus wind, all three? Just any color on the glide path and the composition? Yes. George, a very good question, one that we spend a lot of time on and one that we -- I alluded to or spoke to in the prepared remarks because I think it’s really, really critical. One, we’ll certainly be talking more about in November at our Analyst Day, but just to foreshadow it a little bit. First and foremost, our new energy strategy is around four pillars. That’s offshore wind, particularly floating wind. And again, we believe that will comprise 80% of the total offshore wind. So, we’re not really chasing the fixed wind. It’s very fragmented. There is no integration and there is very little technology other than the turbine -- provided by the turbine manufacturer. So, just to chase that to get short-term vessel utilization and to call that new energy or renewables revenue, I’m not really doing anything, right? I’m just using my boat for a different application. So, we’re not looking at it that way. We’re looking at it as what can we bring -- just like we do in the conventional energy, what can we bring to differentiate our Company from a technology and from an integrated offering.
So, we’ll approach this very differently. We believe it will allow us to generate the type of returns that would be acceptable to you and to our shareholders versus what is available in, if you will, just selling a vessel at a lower day rate in the renewables market -- fixed -- I’m sorry, fixed wind market today.
So, that’s what we mean about playing the long game. We did the same thing, if you remember, in our traditional business back in ‘17 -- or ‘18 and ‘19, we were very-disciplined, and we didn’t just chase activity. We said iEPCI, we believe, was going to work, and we were going to have our capacity of our floating assets available to us to deliver those iEPCI projects, and that’s what we’re seeing today. And that’s why we’re having the success and differentiating success today. So, we’re doing the same thing in wind.
In wave, it’s very clear, we’re going to focus on the technology and the integration of the technology with wind. We believe if you put wind -- we’ve demonstrated, if you put wind and wave together, we believe we can increase the output by as much as 30%. That’s significant. In addition to that, the ability to be able to store and/or convert offshore will be critical. That’s our Deep Purple project. So, we could be converting -- generating to hydrogen and storing hydrogen. We could be storing in other forms of energy storage, wind and wave power as well and then the ability to be able to potentially distribute that offshore versus having to do everything at a near-shore port, we could do this type of transfer offshore.
So, that covers kind of wind, wave, hydrogen. And then, in addition to that, would be carbon, transportation and storage. I find it difficult to believe that to get to the levels required which we all support that you will be sequestering that carbon -- I’m sorry, you will be storing that carbon on land. So, therefore, a lot of the sequestration will happen near the coast. We will -- we are and again, there’ll be more to come on this subject, we will be announcing very novel technology that will allow us to safely transport and store that carbon -- the CO2 that is sequestered subsea or offshore, if you will.
So, that’s kind of our mentality. That’s the way we go about it. There’s those three pillars. They’re not mutually exclusive. From our perspective, we will try to integrate as many of those together as possible. Bear in mind, 50% of the world subsea infrastructure is ours, sitting on the sea floor today. Our ability to be able to use that potentially as distribution hubs, storage hubs or injection hubs could be very unique application. It will require some very sophisticated technology, as we talked about earlier when I was answering the Deep Purple question to Marc that this isn’t just using the same equipment, it’s a very different type of equipment, and we’ll be talking about that as we announce some technology -- new technologies in the coming quarters. So, you put all of that together, and it’s a very exciting roadmap for us. Now, specifically to your question is, okay, when? When do we see it? And how big is the potential?
Well, the potential is obvious. I mean, I think the potential is as big as our conventional business. The question is, when and is there a crossover? For how long do they -- does this one grow while the other is growing? We just got done saying that the conventional business is growing, and we see growth now through 2022 and potentially beyond. I’m just not going to go past 2022 for right now.
So, with that, starting to see some growth in the renewables and maybe carbon happens and wind happens maybe before hydrogen, I don’t know. It’s kind of a combination. A lot of it has to do with local support. Legislation, other things will help drive, which one gets ahead of the other. We just want to be well-positioned to be the offshore company, the offshore company as we are today in subsea for conventional hydrocarbon for the renewables. And whatever one takes off first, we’ll be well positioned to benefit from that. But again, we’re going to track our renewable revenue as that sustainable revenue that can generate high returns versus just chasing utilization with our existing assets today. Your next question comes from Michael Alsford with Citigroup. I’ve got a couple, please. Firstly, if I could just lead off, you’ve done a great job driving greater efficiency through the business. But, I guess following separation, are there any significant areas, Doug, where you see the ability to reduce costs further across the organization? Well, Michael, as you know, this management team, there’s a relentless pursuit for operational improvement, and I can’t say enough about the leadership throughout our organization, of our engineering, manufacturing and supply chain as well as in the operating segments and just across the organization.
The word we use in this organization is simplicity. Let’s remove the complexity. Obviously, that -- we benefited from that now as a standalone pure play company to remove some of the complexity and really be focused. And we’re driving that through everything that we do.
So, Michael, I’m not going to announce a big massive cost reduction program or something like that. But, you should rest assured, every single day, we’re looking to make the organization more efficient, which creates, by the way, a better work environment for our employees by removing complexity and costs. And just a quick follow-up on the cash flow. I’m just wondering is there any specific inflows within the quarter such as unwinding provisions or so tax rebates that help drive the good free cash flow result, or is it simply just the flow of milestone payments on contracts during the quarter? Thanks. Yes. So, you’re talking about the first quarter impact here? Exactly, yes. I was just wondering whether there’s anything specific in that quarterly working capital inflow that helped drive free cash flow higher? Yes. So, thanks for the question. Yes. There was some items in the first quarter that were beneficial. We had a settlement that went into the first quarter. We did have some other negative items as well. But overall, that settlement benefited the free cash flow for the quarter. And just roughly how much was that? Yes. Michael, let me just add to that. This was -- there’s always -- there’s what’s contributed from operations, and there’s always other things that come in and out of the cash flow. But, these were all part of our forecasted cash flow. So nothing out of the ordinary or unexpected that created the positive momentum, just good, solid execution on the cash flow side. Your next question comes from Waqar Syed for ATB Capital Markets. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. First one, you’ve made a comment that you see a sustainable, long-term kind of growth activity offshore. And we’ve seen in the industry a lot of rationalization of employee base. And the average employee that you need for Subsea is a lot more sophisticated and trained. Do you have the right people and the right number of people to be able to efficiently manage that growth that could be a multiyear kind of up-cycle? Thank you, Waqar. Look, we all have biases. There’s unconscious and conscious biases. I’m going to be very clear, this is a conscious bias. I believe we have the best people. And I mean that from my heart. What they have demonstrated and what they have delivered on a consistent basis, particularly during the last year is just nothing short of inspiring. So, look, we -- as we’ve made adjustments and the adjustments we had to make were unfortunate, we have done everything we can to protect the talent in the organization, and not only to protect, but to continue to provide them opportunities for development and to further progress their career within our Company.
You raise a very valid point though. The further you go into the supply chain, you sometimes find smaller companies and you sometimes find companies that are more codependent on one or two customers. In this case, we would be a customer versus a contractor. And so, we also work very closely with our key suppliers. And we shifted work around just as our customers did for us. Some of our customers sat down and took work from the competition and gave it to us because they said they knew who they wanted to work with when it was all said and done, and they wanted to make sure that we had the volume that would help us through a difficult year last year. So, we did the same with our suppliers. That being said, as we -- any growth cycle does create pinch points. But we’re doing our best to go in eyes wide open, and we’ve done a lot of work to protect and not only protect, but to motivate and make sure that our workforce is well prepared to deliver.
I will put in a plug, if you will, for the way that we do our business. iEPCI is a much more efficient way to do business in terms of assets, particularly human assets as well as Subsea 2.0 in terms of the manufacturing roofline and the individuals required. So, it’s not just an upturn. We’re going into this upturn very different. We’re going in with the next-generation of subsea equipment that now represents, as I said, a significant portion of our total work now. So, it’s a very different recovery for us that we believe we are well prepared for, Waqar, but most definitely, eyes wide open and acknowledge that there will be pinch points as the growth continues. Thanks, Dough. And if I may squeeze in another question. Before you -- before the separation of Technip Energies happened, you had a set of assumptions about how the interaction with your customers and employees and with investors change following the separation, and not just interaction, but their behavior and how it would help FTI. Now, the separation has happened, how is the reality being compared to your set of assumptions going into the separation? In regard to customer relations, customer relationships? That’s -- yes, I was -- all three kind of customers, employees and investors starting with customers, you had a view that you could maybe get better. Maybe there will be some uptick in kind of revenue, either for Technip Energies or for you are following a separation, and if that kind of -- are you seeing some of that? Yes. What’s clear, Waqar, is -- and I kind of alluded to that just a minute ago, so I won’t go back through it. But our customers -- we have -- we’re honored to have the deep intimate relationships that we have with many of our customers. They work with us differently than they work with many of the others in their supply chain. That’s not a given, that’s earned over time, based upon performance and trust and transparency. And it’s obviously stronger as a pure play only because you -- the HoldCo had two very different models with very -- two very different contractual approaches. So, this, if you will, allows that increase in the intimacy. And I do believe that we are benefiting from that. And it’s not just what I believe, it’s -- we’ve announced new -- many -- several new relationships over the past year, and we’ll be announcing even new relationships this year, most of which are exclusive to our Company.
In terms of the employees, we obviously have an opportunity now to be more focused, spend more time, be more visible. Some of the bigger projects that we were doing in the past required an enormous amount of management bandwidth, focus and attention, and we now can spread that more equitably across the organization, which I think is the right thing to do. And in terms of shareholders, I hope we demonstrated in Q1, the value of an independent company. And our last question comes from Bertrand Hodee with Kepler Chevreaux. Yes. Thank you for taking my question. One on Mozambique. Back in 2019, you won a substantial contract, $1.1 billion, for the subsidies of Mozambique LNG. Can you give us an update obviously following the force majeure? Do you see any direct impact? And if you can share any color or especially what is left in the backlog from this contract? Sure, Bertrand. Thank you very much for the question, because I think it’s important. And I want to clarify some of the things that have been written that were incorrect. So, bear in mind that, yes, we announced this as a substantial award, meaning plus $1 billion. The recognition, a typical project of that size would -- the revenue would be recognized over plus or minus a five-year period. So, you can kind of do the math, if you will, assuming it was linear. It’s not linear, but you can get an idea of kind of the annual impact, plus or minus.
I will tell you right now, we are only beginning to have discussions with Total. Total is a very serious customer. Total is a serious partner of ours. We have the deepest respect for Total. And the fact that Total is making decisions based upon the health and wellbeing and security of their personnel and their contractors’ personnel, including us, we deeply respect.
Second point, this -- we are an offshore company. Our scope is offshore. We have no in-country exposure. All the work that we’re doing at this point is the manufacturing. We are well into the manufacturing of the subsea equipment. So, that will continue to go on for some time. We are progressing on plan, on schedule, and everything is going quite well. And it’s being done thousands of -- 100, well -- yes, tens of thousands -- thousand -- a long way from Mozambique, I haven’t done the calculation.
So, yes, just realize, we’re not doing any -- we’re not doing any onshore infrastructure, if you will. We’re an offshore company. And the work that we’re doing right now is in the manufacturing phase, which is being done far away, away. It’s progressing very, very well, and we continue to work on that. That being said, we deeply respect to Total’s position on this, and we’re going to work closely with Total as Total, I’m sure, wants to do the best for their people and for our contractors. And we’re confident that we’ll continue to move forward.
Let me make sure that I’m very clear on this next point. If something was to occur or impact our revenue or profit from that project this year, just to be very clear, it would not lead us to revise our guidance, both in terms of the guidance on the revenue or the EBITDA range.
What am I emphasizing by that? An important project, but we have many, many projects. We’re a large company, we’re a global company, and we’re very well diversified. So, there should be no concern that if, and I repeat if, because we are working very closely, and it’s in the very early discussions. And again, we’re not exposed to the issues that are -- the potential security issues about working in-country, we are doing this work outside. But, if, and repeating, if there is an impact, it would not lead us to revise our guidance for 2021. I think, I said 2020. I meant 2021, excuse me. Okay. Crystal clear, Doug. So to summarize, the only risk we can see is a delay in the offshore campaign installation in terms of schedule of the contract? Yes. That potential exists. But again, we’ve been given no -- there’s been no decision made at this time. We’re working closely with Total. I’ll squeeze another one, another region. Can you give us a feel of what you see in terms of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico after, I would say, the election of Joe Biden? Do you see less traction? Do you see -- and do you see into iFEED, I would say, package of project, do you still see a traction in this region? Yes. Like in many mature markets, the Gulf of Mexico being a very mature market for subsea. There’s a significant amount of infrastructure, operator-owned infrastructure that is not operating at capacity today. Kind of globally -- a rough figure globally is most offshore infrastructure on average is only operating at about 60% of nameplate capacity. So, therefore, there’s an opportunity to bring additional hydrocarbon into that facility to be processed without any significant increase in capital costs in terms of infrastructure. So, hence, brownfield tieback opportunities.
As I was talking to Amy, we’re uniquely positioned. We’ve been working with many operators in the Gulf Coast, same idea. Let’s look at your infrastructure, what assets you have around, what leases you have around your infrastructure, what other leases could potentially be tied back. We have new technologies out there included pipe and pipe electric trace heated a pipe that allows us to significantly increase the tieback radius by up to 4 times, 4 times greater. So, the circle that you would have drawn just two years ago around the infrastructure is the radius is now 4 times larger. And so, there’s a lot of things that we’re going to be able to do. It will drive our subsea processing business as well in terms of subsea boosting. So, it’s exciting opportunities for us. And yes, the Gulf of Mexico, there’s lots of activity going on. I would not be surprised to also see potentially a greenfield project, a new greenfield hub being announced in the Gulf of Mexico this year as well. Thank you.

Second quarter results reflect another strong quarter for our company. Total company revenue improved sequentially to $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, with both Subsea and Surface Technologies reporting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11%. Total company inbound orders were $1.6 billion. In Subsea, we demonstrated our ability to continue winning with inbound totaling $1.3 billion for the quarter. The strength in the first half of the year has been indicative of the continued market progression we outlined last year. This includes 10 announced awards, 50% of which will be executed as integrated or iEPCI projects.
The strong start to 2021 is clear evidence of our leadership position and is highlighted by significant milestones achieved in the second quarter. These include the addition of 2 new iEPCI clients, Karoon, where we will execute our first iEPCI in Brazil for the Patola field, and Tullow, where we utilized our Subsea Studio digital solution to optimize field layout for the Jubilee development in Ghana. Also in the quarter, we announced an award from Equinor for the Kristin Sør field, where we leveraged our early engagement capabilities and will utilize the Deep Arctic, which is equipped with a hybrid battery solution that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and an award from Petrobras for the supply of production equipment, installation services and intervention support for Field 6-9 of the Buzios project.
Importantly, the SURF opportunities for these fields remain on our Subsea opportunity list, each of which have been identified with values in the range of $500 million to $1 billion. Our long history of partnerships and collaboration continues to benefit our inbound orders. Direct awards in the quarter were nearly 60% of inbound orders, which came from iEPCI, direct awards and Subsea services.
In Surface Technologies, inbound orders were $268 million, up 32% from the first quarter. By region, international orders increased by more than 50% as well completion activity continued to recover from the prior year decline. Growth was led by the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar as well as the North Sea and China. Orders in the Americas increased by approximately 10%, reflecting continued momentum in drilling and completion activity and the success of our iComplete offering. Our 2021 revenue guidance for Surface Technologies anticipates further order growth in the second half of the year when compared to the first half fueled by increased market activity, new customer alliances, expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in Saudi Arabia, and the continued market penetration of new technologies.
In total, our second quarter results demonstrate that our businesses and end markets continue to improve. Subsea inbound orders of $2.8 billion in the first half of the year were very strong. We continue to see a healthy list of prospects and remain very confident in our full year guidance of more than $4 billion. Furthermore, growth in 2022 is supported by an increasing set of opportunities. When using the midpoint value of our Subsea opportunity list, the project award potential has increased by nearly 20% to $17 billion over the next 24 months.
Looking beyond the strengthening of the traditional market, we believe that offshore will play a meaningful role in the new energy mix. Last quarter, I introduced the four pillars underpinning our approach toward new and novel energies: wind, wave, hydrogen and carbon transportation and storage. As we look at them today, we are making steady progress in our partnerships focused on wind and wave opportunities. The market momentum for wind development continues to support increased investment in this abundant source of renewable energy. And when combined with wave technology, we can generate even greater energy output and reduced intermittency, utilizing the integrated offshore solutions.
Our Deep Purple solution is centered around technology development and integration capabilities that convert this renewable energy into hydrogen, enabling economies of scale that were previously unattainable by offshore renewables projects. Our client conversations are now centered on commercial projects utilizing Deep Purple technologies. Last week, we announced our partnership with Portuguese energy utility, EDP, as well as several notable research partners, in a concept study for the development of a new offshore system for green hydrogen production from offshore wind power. This project is called BEHYOND. Working with our consortium partners, we will leverage our extensive experience in Subsea engineering, technologies developed on Deep Purple, and essential integration capabilities, with a goal to develop a standardized solution that can be implemented worldwide, allowing for large scale hydrogen production from renewable wind resources.
Lastly, while the energy industry is devoting significant attention to carbon reduction, there is still much work to be done. Importantly, the carbon has to be stored somewhere. We believe one of the safest and most efficient locations for the storage can be found offshore, where it can be maintained in naturally occurring reservoirs that exist in many regions around the world. We are well positioned to be the leading provider in Subsea carbon transportation and storage. We have been investing in this space for some time and have also partnered with others in the development of new technologies. We look forward to further showcasing our progress, including several of the technologies and integration capabilities being utilized across the new energy space at our upcoming investor event scheduled for November 16.
With the development of new energy solutions, we are still – while the development of new energy solutions are still in their infancy, our fundamental belief is that clean energy will be increasingly sourced and stored offshore given the anticipated volume and scale required to meet future energy demand. As the Subsea architect, we are building partnerships in support of new energy, leveraging our differentiated technologies and capitalizing on Subsea expertise and integrated project execution. Our four pillars are not mutually exclusive and yet it is not clear, which single pillar or combination will prove to be the market’s preferred choice in the energy transition. Regardless, TechnipFMC is well-positioned to play a material and successful role in their development, driven by our core competencies, collaboration, innovation and integration.
I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results and to provide an update to our full year financial guidance. Thank you, Doug. We had another solid quarter as total company inbound orders were $1.6 billion. Revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $144 million. Total company backlog increased sequentially to $7.3 billion at the end of the period. Backlog for Subsea stands at $7 billion, of which close to $5 billion is scheduled for execution beyond 2021. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $855 million and net debt of $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we recognized a loss of $147 million related to our equity ownership in Technip Energies. This primarily relates to the change in market value during the period. Loss per share from continuing operations was $0.39 per diluted share in the quarter, when excluding the impact of the change in fair market value of our Technip Energies stake and other charges that netted to an after-tax charge of $0.33, the adjusted loss from continuing operations per share was $0.06. We also reported income from discontinued operations of $0.02 in the quarter. The income is due to a tax benefit related to the spin-off of Technip Energies.
Now, let me turn to the segment results. I will focus on our sequential performance comparing the second quarter to our first quarter results. In Subsea, revenue of $1.4 billion was essentially unchanged when compared to the first quarter, with a seasonal improvement in installation and services largely offset by lower project activity in the period. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.1% improved sequentially by 140 basis points, benefiting from higher margins in backlog and increased installation and services activity. Inbound orders were $1.3 billion in the period, demonstrating a second consecutive quarter of order strength.
In Surface Technologies, second quarter revenue of $275 million increased 12% from the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher activity in North America, increased international services and strong project execution. The segment also benefited from further adoption of the iComplete ecosystem. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was unchanged from the first quarter. Inbound orders for the quarter were $268 million, an increase of 32% sequentially, driven by strength in the Middle East, the North Sea and North America.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period, our corporate expense was $30 million. We incurred an $11 million loss on foreign exchange and tax expense totaled $35 million. Moving to cash flow, cash required by activities from continuing operations was $86 million in the period. Capital expenditures were $40 million. This resulted in a free cash flow consumption of $126 million in the second quarter. Importantly, the Q2 outflows were expected and we remain on track to meet our full year free cash flow guidance of $120 million to $220 million, with subsequent quarters to benefit from strong working capital inflows. More specifically, these Q2 outflows included the scheduled and concluding payment of $53 million related to our previous settlement with the DOJ and Brazilian authorities, primarily related to legacy activities where we no longer participate and that occurred over a decade ago as well as typical quarterly variation in working capital resulting from our predominantly projects based business.
CapEx for the second half of the year will include spending related to previously announced project awards and we do see potential for full year expenditures to come in below our guidance of approximately $250 million. Other items favorably impacting our net debt in the period included a net inflow of $258 million related to the sale transactions of a portion of our ownership stake in Technip Energies, proceeds from assets totaling $84 million, including a further rationalization of our fleet, with the sale of the G1200 vessel and the full repayment of the $200 million outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. Taken together, net debt was reduced by $155 million to $1.6 billion when compared to the first quarter.
Before I discuss the changes made to our expectations, let me first share with you how we intend to communicate our guidance and updates with you in the future. As most of you know, we do not give quarterly guidance. In keeping with historical practice, we will continue to give our initial guidance for the upcoming year with our fourth quarter earnings release. Moving forward, we will also provide a midyear update to this guidance with our second quarter financial results. We believe that this modified approach will provide you with greater transparency and clarity of our projected results as we progress through each calendar year.
Turning to the midyear updates to our 2021 financial guidance. As a reminder, guidance is based on continuing operations and thus excludes the impact of Technip Energies, which is reported as discontinued operations. Our full year guidance for Subsea revenue has been increased to a range of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion. Our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA for Surface Technologies has been increased to a range of 10% to 12%. Net interest expense has been increased to a range of $135 million to $140 million for the full year and our reported tax provision has been revised higher to a range of $85 million to $95 million.
I will close by highlighting a few key takeaways. Our updated guidance captures the strength of the first half and further refines our view of the second half. Free cash flow for the first half year was slightly positive and we remain on track to meet our full year commitment of $120 million to $220 million as working capital improves in the back half of the year. We ended the period with an improved balance sheet position with cash and cash equivalents of $855 million and net debt of $1.6 billion. And lastly, we will continue to monetize our remaining 31% stake in Technip Energies and utilized the proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt over the coming quarters.
I will now turn the call back over to Doug for his closing remarks. Thank you, Alf. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to close with a few remarks. Our solid first half results were driven by our unique positioning as an industry pure-play, levered to Subsea and international land markets. We see continued improvement in the broader market outlook as evidenced by the growing value of our Subsea opportunity list as well as proprietary iFEED and iEPCI opportunities. And these support our full year financial guidance, where we have increased our expectations for both operating segments. Our success is driven by our core competencies, having pioneered and delivered next-generation Subsea technologies and the industry’s only fully integrated commercial model. And we are demonstrating that these unique capabilities are 100% transferable to the renewables energy space, giving us confidence in our ability to extend our leadership in Subsea to the development of new and novel energy resources offshore. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning Doug. Good morning, David. So, a few contracts announced on Brazil. Brazil has been kind of one of the few areas where we are starting to see some signs of life there recently. I was just wondering if you could just kind of bring us up to speed on the contract situation now with Petrobras around Subsea trees. If I am not mistaken, there was – you were kind of working down a pretty big contract. Is that still the case? Are you expecting to see any tender soon? And I guess, also sort of the same question on the flexible pipe, would you be expected to see tenders announced with development, it looks like it’s starting to pick up down there? Yes. Thank you, David. It gives me a great opportunity to let you know that we had a celebration this past quarter in Brazil, where we delivered our 700th tree – 700 trees out of Brazil. So yes, we have been there a long time. And as you said, we have been the leading provider to Petrobras and involved in many of the very large and significant tree orders in the past. Those are largely behind us now, David, and we are really working on new orders. I had in the prepared remark about the Buzios project, which is very interesting, because it was for multiple phases and also provided where we will be doing installation services for quite some time, which is very important to us as well in our Subsea Services business. Going forward, the tree orders are more focused around projects, in some cases, multiple phases of projects like our recent announcement for the Buzios 6-9 fields, but not just the large lump-sum tree orders, if you will, that we had seen previously. So, we think they will be again more associated with specific projects or multiple phases of a project. Flexibles are a little bit deferred. We are still seeing more, let’s say, volume-based orders and the flexibles are being used in multiple different applications on different fields and different projects. And we certainly have seen and anticipate further large flexible awards in Brazil, where as you know a very important differentiated product line for us and a very strong position in Brazil. So, that’s a different contracting method on Petrobras, because I know they did use those big tenders perform. I am just kind of thinking about like why they made that change or is it just sort of just, I guess, their visibility? What do you think is behind that? I think a lot of it exactly has to do with the visibility. They have got a relatively long queue of projects. You can see that on the Subsea opportunity list. And I think their ability to be able to tie the awards to the specific projects is their preferred path at this time versus just ordering 100 trees or 200 trees, if you will, in a single tranche. Yes, that makes sense. A separate question on the surface business, Doug, if you could just remind us how much of that business is international, maybe it was in the release, I am sorry, I might have missed it. But also if you could just talk about how you see the next 6 months to 12 months playing out there? I think a big chunk of that is in the Middle East. So, kind of when do you start to see that inflect with the chatter we are hearing out of the NOCs over there? Yes, approximately 60% to 70% depending upon the quarter of the Surface business is Surface international as opposed to Surface Americas. And spot on, it’s the Middle East that’s really driving the activity. That’s important for us. The type of product or trees – production trees that we deliver in the Middle East are approximately 10x the value of which you would deliver in the U.S., much more sophisticated from a technology point of view. We have significant differentiation, both in the technology, but we also have differentiation as we are fully integrated, and we have the ability to be able to deliver the products more or less entirely in-house, not relying on third parties, which, again, allows us to capture more of the knowledge, the know-how and the differentiation. The activities picked up. We – in the prepared remarks, I mentioned that we had a 50% increase in inbound activity, and we expect another strong Q3 for Middle East awards that are materializing this quarter. Great. Thanks a lot, Doug. Next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yes. Good morning Doug and team. Half of your Subsea orders this year have been integrated in nature. And I was just trying to think about some of the margin implications on a go-forward basis given the mix? Because clearly, with the integrated awards, you will have more control over the project, ideally enabling some synergies and lower cost, I would suspect. Sure. Thank you, Arun. Let me just kind of go through like a typical integrated project. And why, yes, they tend to have preferable financial economics for our company. First and foremost, we don’t start at the project bidding stage, if you will. There is no bidding stage in most cases. We start at an integrated FEED study. So, we are sitting at the table with the client talking about an integrated full field Subsea development, which we are the only company that’s capable of providing such a service to our clients. At that point, we look at the project economics, and we are completely aligned in our objectives, which is to develop the most economical Subsea infrastructure or architecture that can maximize the value of the asset or of the reservoir that’s in place for our client. So, our objective again is around the project economics, not bidding a particular product or product line or a delineated kind of a bidding schedule. So, we work around those project economics once we achieve then those project economics, we then move into the integrated execution phase. And as you correctly pointed out, there is a lot of leverage for us in that phase because we are now responsible for the engineering, the manufacturing, the delivery, the installation and the commissioning of the Subsea field. We can do it all at once. We can do it in multiple phases. We can utilize the cadence of our manufacturing versus the availability of the fleet. As an example, we have a targeted date to achieve the final installation and commissioning. But the nature of how we actually go through the workflow and the process of doing so is within our control. That has worked well again for everyone involved because in most cases, by doing an iFEED direct award iEPCI, we have been able to reduce delivery times or accelerate time to first oil from a project economics perspective between 12 months and 14 months acceleration of first oil, which has a dramatic improvement in the overall project economics. So, the client – our partner, our client is winning, and we are winning and it’s most definitely our preferred model. As you pointed out, it’s an advantage because these are direct awards, also avoiding a competitive tendering situation. That’s helpful. My follow-up is you guys have delivered very, very solid margins and you raised your surface margin expectations for the year. So – but my broader question, I was wondering, Doug, if you could kind of comment on the state of your supply chain, given some of the COVID impacts and just kind of tightness in raw materials and just your confidence in dealing some of these, call it, headwinds without harming the margin profile kind of in the market where we are seeing shortages of things like chips and things like that when you think about the automakers, but just wanted to see if you could comment the supply chain? Sure. I will cover it at a high level, and then I am going to have Alf kind of walk through with is the – what is the typical contracting methodology that we use and therefore, what is the exposure or lack of exposure to some of the inflationary pressures. Look, first and foremost, from the beginning, we decided as a company that we were not only going to look out for the health and well-being of our employees throughout COVID, which, of course, everybody was dedicated to but also by working with our clients and with our suppliers. It was clear that what we were going through was going to have a dramatic impact, and we have seen that in terms of those companies that came out strong and several who did not come out at all. So, we have been working from the beginning being very open and transparent with our suppliers trying to understand what were their concerns. I am really proud of our supply chain and procurement team. They were ahead of it. We have a reputation in the industry of being very collaborative, being very transparent and being easy to work with. So, we sat with our suppliers just as we do with our clients. But in this case, understanding from them kind of what were their issues. In some cases, we concentrated our spend in order to help them. And in some cases, we had to actually spread out our spend because we knew that they were facing certain challenges, be it with the access to transportation and logistics or being able to get people into their facilities, whatever it may be. So, the lesson learned there was treat people like you want to be treated yourself. It’s the way our customers treated us because of our reputation and our relationship with our customers, we did the same with the supply chain. As a result of that, we feel we have a healthy supply chain. That being said, we still work with them as COVID and the impacts of COVID are different in different locations around the world. We are a global company. We have the ability to be able to shift activity where there are concerns. We are also addressing probably the bigger issue right now, which is around transportation and logistics, and we are doing some really creative things there, too. Using long rail as opposed to ocean freight and using shorter ocean freight, which has really been helpful. And our team has done a great job of really getting ahead of it and building up the – some of the more challenging materials that have become quite challenged in terms of access and availability we have been able to secure those in bulk ahead of time, which is a benefit of our Subsea 2.0 technology offering, where we are not building bespoke equipment and we are able to buy materials in bulk ahead of time. I am going to pass it to Alf and he will go through kind of the contracting model. Yes. Just thank you, Doug, to add a couple of comments around how we manage inflation in general in our contracts. First of all, already at the bidding stage we always make sure that we secure back-to-back agreements with our suppliers. So meaning, we know the pricing and we know the terms already for the vast majority of what we will undertake at the time of the bid. So, further for whatever portion that we do not necessarily lock in at the time of the bid, we really have a process to engage in early procurement to minimize the volatility in the pricing and delivery of any procurement undertaking that we have as part of the projects. Additionally, when you look at the client contracts, we do have inflation index clauses embedded in our contracts and those clauses, they allow us to escalate contract price as raw materials, labor or other factors put pressure on the inflation. So overall, we have had this contracting mechanism in place for several years, and it has worked very well for us, and it continues to work well for us. So from – so in a general view, we think we are pretty well protected in both backlog and new awards from inflationary pressures. Great. Thanks for the update. Next question comes from Nick Konstantakis from Exane. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I have got a couple. Doug, you guys are arguably in a unique position in the industry with the partnerships and the integrated, so I appreciate you are getting a lot more direct works. One of your competitors spoke yesterday about the mid in ten or just how to get to the 2019 level of trees, so it became an interesting number some of which is your view of the mid-cycle if you want to position after the next couple of years, hopefully, this a cyclical rebound. And then secondly, I just want to catch on Brazil and the article, there was on the industry press around the [indiscernible] issue and very few companies managed supply chain better in Brazil with the local contractors and you and your long presence there. So, can you just give us a bit of a color on what’s been happening with these risers at Mero and what are the mitigations and what you are doing basically to mitigate the issue there is an issue? Sure. So, I guess I will take them in the order that you asked the questions. Just if you could clarify, you said there was somebody provided guidance that in the near-term or mid-term… I think it’s a mid-term. Yes, it would be hard to say sustained I guess the level of the 2019 number of trees… Clearly, that’s not how we see the Subsea market, not sure of the analysis, but we talk a lot, as you mentioned earlier, that our success in creating alliances, which result in direct awards, the success of our iEPCI or integrated offering, the majority of which are direct awarded to our company. Perhaps it’s the difference of seeing the view of the total market, if you will, the available market plus our proprietary market. But I can assure you we do not share the view that we will not return in the near-term or mid-term to the 2019 levels of tree count. That’s – we don’t share that view. Moving on to your second question around the Mero project, yes, I am aware of the article. I guess at this time, it’s probably best if we provide the facts, which will allow everyone to understand what is happening on the Mero 1 project. So first and foremost, there is no impact to our forecast or to the guidance. And as stated by Petrobras, there is no impact to first oil. So, those are the facts. What is also true is that there is a very challenging pipeline system that includes what’s called mechanically line pipe or MLP being used on this project. That’s a result of the known industry phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking as a result of the high CO2 content of many of the pre-salt reservoirs in Brazil. So, much like we had experienced as an industry around flexible pipe, the exact same phenomenon happens with rigid pipe. Therefore, you run a liner inside of the carbon steel pipe to protect the carbon steel from the corrosive environment that is inherent in a high CO2 environment. That mechanically line pipe think of it as running a stent inside of your – an artery in your heart, it needs to be secured to be held in place. So, the way that it’s secured to be held in place not with a few sutures, but in this case, it’s through clad welding. So, it’s a technique to add a stainless steel welding material to take that stainless steel liner and make it adhere to the carbon steel pipe or the riser. The process of doing that weld is very sophisticated. It’s largely a manual process and it requires a very high level of quality control. What is true is that we had identified that in some cases, the quality or – and more so the depth of the weld that was the result in well did not meet our quality standards or the quality standard we had agreed with Petrobras. So, we are going through a process of rework on some of the welds to be able to ensure that we have the proper welding – the proper finer weld in place, which would therefore result in a very stable riser system for the project. This is not specific to the Mero 1 project. This is specific to all of the projects that are using rigid risers, which require mechanical line pipe and clad welding. So, this is not common to a specific project. We are well advanced. We understand it. We are the most experienced the mechanically lined pipe. We are experts in clad welding. In this case, we are using a subcontractor to do the work just due to the nature of the diameter of the pipe that’s being clad weld. And we are working with them to resolve the problem. And again, it’s just an issue of rework. No impact again, to our forecast or our guidance, no impact to first oil as stated by Petrobras. So, always good to have the facts, I guess, and those are the facts. I will point out that ultimately, let’s engineer out this potential quality concern. And the way that we are going to do that is by going with hybrid flexible pipe. Hybrid flexible pipe will not require welding, aligner to be welded. And it will be a permanent solution and a sustainable solution, and it also benefits Petrobras in the Brazilian market as we can then use the ecosystem of the vessels and technology and plants that are in place in Brazil to permanently remove this risk. So again, it’s known, it’s well under control. We are actually sharing our learning with others because others will or will be faced with the same challenge. But ultimately, this is about engineering out the problem, moving from rigid risers back to flexible risers, which will be done – which we will be able to do when we have our hybrid flexible pipe fully qualified and using it for these applications in Brazil, and it’s advancing quite well. Thank you. Next question is from Ian Macpherson of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning guys. Good morning. I was intrigued by the BEHYOND project that you announced with EDP last week. And I was curious if you could talk about the genesis of that project and really how you see it matriculating from concept study to a practical application or a pilot and how you see the timeframe of that type of technology coming into the market over the course of this decade? Thank you, Ian. We are pretty excited. We are very excited as well. Look, to partner with EDP is really a privilege and an honor. We have got a great group of other constituents that were also studying this with kind of where are we in the process. When we talk about a concept study, in this case, it’s not like a technical concept study meaning it’s not an academic concept study, I should say. This is a – this is not a project. So, it’s a project that starts at the concept phase, just like an oil and gas project. Then it moves to the front-end engineering phase, where you are really now starting to put in place material volumes and really starting to understand what would take – what would it take to complete a final project. And then it would go into the actual project sanctioning and execution phase. Our approach is to design one and build many. So, the idea would be to really study this and understand how we can put in place a very unique system that would leverage the knowledge and experience of us as a Subsea company and our development and technologies of deep purple along with EDP and their vast experience and knowledge of energy, energy infrastructure and energy transmission to really put in place an overall unique scope of activity that could be deployed again in many different applications. So, you asked about timing and that’s fair, and that’s always the question when we talk about new energies. And it’s hard to say specific timing at this point, although I would say there is a – all of the partners are very incentivized and very motivated and understand the opportunity, and we’re going to work through this in a collaborative way. When you do these things, you’ll some ideas will succeed and some ideas will fail, and then they’ll be filtered out and you’ll bring in new ideas until you come up with that final front-end engineering design. And we’re working through that process right now. But again, couldn’t be more pleased to partner up with EDP and the other research consortiums that are involved with us. Great. Thanks, Doug. Separate unrelated one, I’m surprised this hasn’t come up yet already. Your outlook for Subsea inbound this year greater than $4 billion, you’re way ahead of pace in the first half. Are there scenarios I imagine there are, but maybe you should back me off if I need to, scenarios in which the second half orders could be comparable to the first half at this point? Sure. Ian Look, there is all these scenarios, and there is no doubt we are extremely pleased with the cadence that we’ve started off the first half of the year and the strength of the first half of the year inbound. I think it speaks again volumes to the differentiated position that we have in the industry. Again, keeping in mind that our – we just announced our Q2 inbound but no Subsea opportunities were removed from the Subsea opportunity list. So basically, direct awards or proprietary work that came to our company, which is I guess, makes us really, really proud of what we’ve accomplished. At the same time, the Subsea opportunity list has grown by 20% and now has a value of $17 billion with the potential to be awarded over the next 24 months. There is no doubt. There is no doubt the cycle is setting up very well. We started talking about this 1 year ago, 1 year ago when it was not at all I guess, viewed by most that we would be entering into this type of an environment. That’s because of, again, the proprietary access, the information that we have, the relationships that we have with our clients they gave us that confidence to provide that outlook over a year ago.
When we look at what’s out there right now, the consensus number on inbound is more in that $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion range. We’re getting into that tricky part of the year, Ian, where our orders going to happen on December 31? Or are they going to happen on January 3. And I don’t mean that sarcastically, we actually see that quite often, where, in some cases, clients will want to accelerate spend into the current year, perhaps for budgetary reasons. And in other cases, they want to defer the investment decision until the beginning of the following year. I don’t have a clear line of sight on that. The team is working on that right now. We’re really trying to sit down and understand from our clients kind of what is the most likely outcome. But clearly, with the timing of some of those awards coming into the fourth quarter, we would anticipate our inbound to be trending much closer to the consensus number that’s out there than the greater than $4 billion we are today. Super. That’s helpful. Thanks, Doug. Next question is from Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks. Perhaps continuing with the scenario discussion. If I look at the Subsea opportunities going up 20%, I know those are awards that are going to backlog and take years to convert. But it is an indication that things are looking better, right? I would think that maybe services has some better momentum now and also maybe some of your book in turn. So I was a bit surprised that the revenue guide for Subsea didn’t really increase a lot. I think things if you hold things flat from the first half, if you kind of hit the high end of guidance and you’re down 13% to hit the low end of guidance. So that would seem like a pretty conservative outlook there. Maybe talk to us about how you built that guidance up, what scenario would need to happen to get to the low end and maybe thoughts on upside? Yes. Look, I don’t want to spend too much time on the subject, not that it’s not critically important. But no, we’re not trying to – there is no hidden message here. Keep in mind a couple of things. As you pointed out, there is very little book and turn in our Subsea business. That’s the advantage. I mean you can already start to look at how much backlog we have for next year and beyond as we provide the backlog scheduling, which gives a lot of confidence, and that’s the benefit of having this business – this business is our primary business in the portfolio. So there is not a lot of opportunity to really ramp. You can ramp inbound, but you don’t get a lot of that in the current year, you get some, but you don’t get very much of that converted in the current year. In addition to that, keep in mind, the Q4 seasonality, it occurs every year, and we would expect to have some Q4 seasonality this year as well. Okay. Okay. Thanks for that, Doug. The next question is a bit to part and it relates to CapEx. So in the prepared remarks talked about potential for maybe the full year to be below the $250 guide. I’m curious if you could help us with some more color around that? And then thinking about ‘22 and beyond. Previously, I think you said sort of that $250 million level is the right number. Is it possible that we could be tracking below that? And then as you start building out this new energy capability, how does the capital intensity change, if at all? Sure. So I’m going to pass it to Alf and he’ll share with you kind of where we are on CapEx and what we see happening in the second half of the year because it’s actually quite exciting and then he’ll talk about kind of the beyond. You were asking about also the capital intensity of the new energies. Did I hear that correctly? Was that the last question? That’s right. Yes. Okay. Why don’t I take that one upfront? Look, our approach as it is in traditional energy is to be a technology provider. And as long as we’re a technology provider, we feel we can do it without significant capital investment. Now that doesn’t mean there won’t be some capital investment. But are we going to build the mother of all vessels to go out and install structures, no, that’s not what we’re going to do. Are we going to engineer solutions that might not require the mother of all structures that could be really unique and not require a big capital-intensive asset base. That’s the way we approach everything we do. I’m going to pass it to Alf to talk about the specific question around CapEx. Yes. No, thank you for the question. And first of all, commenting on the first half. It is true that it’s light in the first half. We have definitely had some timing with relation to some of the typical drivers for our CapEx profile, which is the planning of around vessel dry docks as an example, drove some capital more towards the second half versus the first half. We also have the timing of when we need service tools and manufacturing tools into our various – to support our various project awards. And that’s really the key driver for the second half. You look at the project awards coming and the backlog that we have. We are investing for – in both offshore service tooling as well as manufacturing tooling, to support those backlogs, and that includes the higher activity that we’re seeing in Brazil, where we are also investing in service installation tooling that will drive our service business in Brazil. So definitely, there is a little bit of anomaly of first half to second half. I will still stand behind the comment I made in the initial remarks that we have an opportunity to come in below $250 million for the year. And maybe I also want to emphasize that this new – this run rate for the second half is not really a new normal that you should consider as we are going to be at a higher level. I think you can continue to use the $250 million as a good indicator for the moment as you look ahead. Great. Thanks so much, gentlemen. Next question is from Bertrand Hodee of Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have two, if I may. The first one relates to Brazil. When I see the list, I really see a very strong list of opportunities. We still get available probably some massive SURF contract do you believe those contracts on Buzios could be awarded, not all of them, obviously, but before year-end. And the second question also relates to Brazil. You’ve talked about your new hybrid flexible riser solution that will be fit for, I would say, heavy CO2 content fluid – when do you think this new solution will be fully qualified? Sure. Thank you very much for the questions. Regarding the SURF awards in Brazil, yes, on the opportunity list it’s projects that are likely to be sanctioned in the next 24 months. So no, not all of those would be awarded, but we would not be surprised to see a SURF award or potentially two SURF awards in Brazil between now and the end of the year. Obviously, that’s up to our client to decide the exact timing of the award, but just looking at where we are in the tendering phases of some of those projects, it would not be a surprise. Regarding HFP qualification, this is really an important and kind of confidential to Petrobras. So I don’t want to say anything out of context. Other than to say, we are very pleased with the progress that we are making around the HFP qualification and Petrobras working hand-in-hand with Petrobras every step of the way. And we are quite advanced and they are very pleased with where we are in the process. But I need to stop there because the rest is really Petrobras has asked us to maintain the confidentiality of the actual schedule. Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Next question is from Waqar Syed of ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi, I believe that was my name. Just Doug, a question on – The Surface inbound orders, you gave some year-over-year comparisons for North American International growth comparisons. Could you provide some context on sequential growth that you saw inbounds for Surface business in North America and international? Sure, Waqar. I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, but the – there was a rather material increase sequentially Q1 to Q2 and our international orders, and I would say, much less pronounced in the North America orders from Q1 to Q2. But clearly, Q2 was a strong order level for Subsea International. And also, just bear in mind, when we talk about inbound and when we talk about backlog, it’s almost exclusively in our international business. Almost everything we do in the North America business falls under book in turn. Okay. And then the momentum that you’ve seen in second quarter in terms of sequential growth, do you see the same kind of momentum carry on into the second half as well? For international, we expect continued progression into the third quarter. Most of the orders typically come in, in Q3 and Q4. There is a couple of geographies, particularly in North Africa that tend to do large year-end orders based upon inventory levels. Too early to comment on those but we would expect incremental Middle East orders in Q3 versus Q2. And again, in terms of North America, we see somewhat of a – we are forecasting at least somewhat of a steady progression. But – the North America market always remains the most cyclical and the most difficult to forecast and a very small portion of our business. Okay. Just one final question to the extent that you can – you’re able to answer. For next year, given your outlook of this revenue opportunity of about $17 billion opportunity set. Do you see the book to bill for next year in Subsea to be well above 1? So I’m excited to say the book-to-bill this year is 1 year-to-date. So that’s important to note. I probably should have emphasized that earlier on in the discussion, just to make sure that that’s recognized, and I think we’re in a unique position in that scenario. Do I see the book-to-bill improving in 2022 versus 2021? The answer would be yes. Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate that color. And our last question will come from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Maybe can you speak about how should we think about longer term free cash flow from business? Sure. I think Alf will take that question. You asked about the longer term cash flow? Yes. Yes. So obviously, let me just start. We obviously had a somewhat soft quarter this quarter. It’s not representative of what would typically happen in a quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we have some variability from quarter-to-quarter due to the Subsea projects business that we’re carrying. I also commented on a one on a specific item in Brazil. But if you take it to the longer term, clearly, I do not see 2021 as being reflective of the long-term free cash flow performance that we envisioned. I think there are a couple of things that we would definitely need to manage differently and its first interest expense is an obvious item where we are committed to debt reduction. That has been part of what we’ve been saying all along and we expect that to help reduce the interest expense as we go forward. I think we also have some room to significantly optimize our tax position and get a better ratio of tax expense relative to cash flow overall. And then lastly, of course, I mean we have been talking in this review here a lot about the prospects for Subsea in particular, and the upturn that we’re seeing. So we clearly are expecting to see a growing EBITDA profitability profile and continue to convert a larger portion of that into cash as we go forward. So I guess like maybe if there is a way you can help us think about longer term free cash flow margins. Can we go back to what we saw in 2013, 2014 levels or how should we think about that? I wouldn’t go back to 2013 and ‘14 we were a little bit different business also at that time. So overall, I wouldn’t comment on any specific ratios at this time. We will come back with more information on this also as we get into our Investor Day that happens in November. And we will definitely free cash flow and other relative to net debt structures, et cetera, will be a topic at that time. And maybe if I can squeeze in one last question, just when we think about $250 million of CapEx, can you help us think about like is it more driven by Subsea services? Because I am – maybe I am naive in thinking that the Subsea trees business wouldn’t require that much CapEx. Is it more driven by the Subsea services? Combination of Subsea services in the fleet. Okay. That’s really helpful. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thank you. This concludes our second quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. British Summer Time today.

Results in the quarter reflect continued strength in operational performance and further support our confidence in achieving full year financial guidance. Total company revenue in the period was $1.6 billion. Total company adjusted EBITDA was 141 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.9%.
Total company inbound orders in the quarter were $1.3 billion. Subsea inbound orders were 1.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date segment total to $3.9 billion. The strength of our inbound in the quarter was driven by direct awards, subsea services, alliance partners, and several long-term vessel charters.
Additionally, our Subsea Opportunity List expanded for the fourth consecutive quarter and now shows project opportunities totaling 19 billion for potential award over the next 24 months when assuming the midpoint of the project ranges.
Inbound orders for Surface Technologies were 250 million in the third quarter. It is important to note that we expect a significant increase in order activity in the fourth quarter, as we anticipate several multiyear awards will be made in the Middle East.
Subsea inbound growth in 2021 partly reflects the momentum we are seeing in Brazil. This has always been an important region for TechnipFMC. We have been present in the country for over five decades, with a well established supply chain and over 98% local content, contributing significantly to our success.
Additionally, an important part of our global research and development is carried out at our technology center in Rio de Janeiro. This year, our Brazil teams have achieved several impressive milestones.
We received two contract awards from Petrobrass, the first for the Marlim and Voador Fields, where we will provide Subsea manifolds, utilizing our second generation all-electric Robotic Valve Controller. And the second award to supply equipment and services for the Búzios 6-9 fields, extending our backlog well beyond the first scheduled delivery in 2023.
Karoon Energy awarded us with our first iEPCI project in Brazil, another significant step in the global adoption of our integrated model. And we delivered our 700th tree manufactured in country, reflecting a leadership position that has been built upon a long history of innovation and strong project execution.
During the quarter, we also signed three long-term vessel charter contracts with Petrobras. These awards will serve the Brazilian market for the next three plus years. The first two charters were for pipelay support vessels owned and operated through our joint venture with DOF Subsea.
The third was for a wholly owned vessel that provides us with the ability to install flexible pipe in any water depth up to 3,000 meters, and one that has consistently been awarded the clients' highest rating for operational performance, quality of work and health, safety and environment. These awards also serve as a leading indicator of the strong demand for the flexible pipe market in Brazil.
For decades, flexible pipe has been the preferred solution in Brazil. The pipes versatility has allowed the technology to evolve with the industry, adapting from shallow water to deep and ultra deep water. TechnipFMC has been a pioneer in flexible since the early 1970s. We are constantly improving quality and reliability in increasingly harsh environments, and our Acu facility is a showcase for advanced manufacturing automation.
More than 11,000 kilometers have been installed across the region. More than half of which was supplied by TechnipFMC, and we remain the market leader today. High concentrations of CO2 in pre-salt fields has posed industry challenges for some applications of flexible pipe, particularly pre-salt gas injection risers, leading to a reduction in flexible volumes since the market peak in 2017.
Outside of these limited applications, the low CO2 flexible’s market in Brazil remains robust, supported by recent industry awards and tendering activity, which we believe will result in annualized volumes over the next three years that are more than double the current levels.
In 2018, to address the high CO2 industry challenge, we created a strategic alliance and made a minority investment in Magma Global, a leader in advanced composite technologies. With the ongoing success of this technology alliance, we were pleased to announce we acquired the remaining interest in Magma, and we are excited to welcome them to the TechnipFMC family.
By combining their proprietary technology with our flexible pipe, we are advancing the development of a hybrid flexible pipe solution for use in the Brazilian pre-salt fields. Our long history in Brazil, our research capabilities, our investment in disruptive technologies, our leadership in flexible, our high performing fleet and most notably the women and men that continue to drive our success positions us well in what is expected to be the strongest Subsea market this decade.
We have previously outlined our focus areas of wind, wave, hydrogen and carbon transportation and storage. We are making real progress in all of these areas. Additionally, we believe that composite technologies from Magma will be a critical enabler to the new energy transportation system.
We were also pleased to announce a long-term strategic alliance with Talos Energy to develop and deliver solutions for carbon capture and storage, or CCS. This is an important step for both companies, combining Talos' offshore operational strength and subsurface experience with our long history in Subsea engineering, system integration and automation and control.
The alliance will initially focus on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is a major source of CO2 emissions with a heavy concentration of refineries, liquefied natural gas plants and emerging blue hydrogen facilities. The alliance provides a platform to address this growing market need, and we look forward to working with Talos in the conversion of these identified opportunities. This type of collaboration, innovation and integration will position TechnipFMC to be a leading provider in carbon transportation and storage.
I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results. Thank you, Doug. We had another solid quarter, led by total company inbound orders of 1.4 billion. Revenue in the quarter was 1.6 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of 141 million. Total company backlog was 7 billion at the end of the period. Backlog for Subsea stands at 6.7 billion, of which just over 5.7 billion is scheduled for execution beyond 2021. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 1 billion and net debt of 1.2 billion.
During the quarter, we recognized charges and credits that netted to an expense of 16 million and included the following items. Expenses totaling 44 million related to impairment, restructuring and other charges, primarily related to a 37 million non-cash impairment to our initial investment in Magma Global.
These items were partially offset by income of 29 million on our equity ownership in Technip Energies, which primarily relates to the favorable change in market value during the period. Loss from continuing operations was $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter.
When excluding the impact of charges and credits that netted to an after tax expense of $0.03 per share, the adjusted loss from continuing operations per share was $0.06. The adjusted loss from continuing operations also included the following items; a loss on an early extinguishment of debt of 16 million and a foreign exchange loss of 6 million.
Now, let me turn to the segment results. I will focus on our sequential performance comparing the third quarter to our second quarter results. In Subsea, revenue of 1.3 billion decreased 6% driven by lower activity in the North Sea and Asia. Adjusted EBITDA was 141 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2%, a sequential increase of 10 basis points despite the revenue decline.
Inbound orders were 1.1 billion in the period, demonstrating our continued commercial success. In Surface Technologies, third quarter revenue of 267 million decreased 3% from the second quarter. Revenue decreased primarily due to the timing of large multiyear international awards, partially offset by increased revenue in North America.
The continued growth in North America was driven by higher drilling and completion activity. Adjusted EBITDA was 28 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.6%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the second quarter driven largely by lower segment revenue. Inbound orders for the quarter were 250 million.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was 29 million. We incurred a 6 million loss in foreign exchange. Net interest expense was 39 million. And lastly, tax expense which came in at 12 million for the quarter.
Cash from continuing operations was 136 million, with capital expenditures totaling 47 million. This resulted in free cash flow of 89 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was 100 million, and we are on track to meet our full year free cash flow guidance of 120 million to 220 million.
Cash flow in the quarter benefited from solid working capital inflows, which was in line with the commentary we provided on our second quarter earnings call. Capital expenditures are anticipated to increase from the third quarter level, largely driven by previously announced project awards in Subsea. We continue to see the potential for full year expenditures to come in below our guidance of approximately 250 million.
In the third quarter, we made significant progress in the monetization of our remaining stake in Technip Energies, announcing sales totaling 34 million shares of Technip Energies in multiple transactions. We received proceeds of 326 million in the quarter from the portion of the sales, with the remaining sale transaction scheduled for settlement before the end of October for proceeds of approximately 115 million.
Upon completion of these sales, we will have reduced our ownership in Technip Energies by 75% and will retain a 12% stake, which is currently valued at more than 350 million. There is no lockup associated with our remaining position. During the quarter, we purchased 164 million of our 6.5% senior notes due 2026, the highest coupon debt within our capital structure through a tender offer.
With regard to investment activity, we acquired the remaining 49% of shares in TIOS, our joint venture with Island Offshore for 49 million during the quarter. This transaction brings to the company additional Subsea expertise that will enhance our life of field services capabilities and provide a complete range of wealth services to our clients globally.
And as Doug mentioned in his remarks, we also acquired the remaining shares of Magma Global in early October for 64 million. As a reminder, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Magma in 2018, which included the purchase of a 25% ownership stake. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded a non-cash impairment in the third quarter to our initial Magma investment, reflecting the purchase price paid for the remaining stake. The cash consideration will be paid to shareholders on Magma in three installments.
Let me close by highlighting a few takeaways from the quarter. We delivered solid operational performance in the period with total company adjusted EBITDA of 141 million and free cash flow from continuing operations of 89 million. Given these results, we are confident that we will meet our financial guidance for 2021.
Additionally, the free cash flow generation of our business and ongoing monetization of our ownership stake in Technip Energies are supporting several important objectives. First, that we improve our capital structure, which we demonstrated during the quarter with a 400 million reduction of net debt as well as 185 million reduction of short and long-term debt. And second, that we maintain the flexibility to invest in our future, which we have also demonstrated with strategic investments in TIOS and Magma.
I will now turn the call back over to Doug for his closing remarks. Thank you, Alf. Before we move to Q&A, I want to close with a few remarks. Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong operational performance that we demonstrated over the first half of the year, as Alf stated. We remain very confident in achieving our full year financial guidance.
Subsea orders have nearly matched the 4 billion inbound in all of 2020. And we remain on track to achieve solid double digit growth. And the acquisition of Magma and our strategic alliance with Talos service tangible progress and further demonstrate the impactful role we will play in the energy transition.
Finally, I would like to remind everyone that on Tuesday, November 16, we will host our Analyst Day. During the event, we will demonstrate how we are leveraging and extending our core competencies of innovation, integration and collaboration to develop both new and novel energy resources offshore.
We will provide updates on how we are using new commercial models and new technologies to further improve project economics and reduce carbon intensity in our conventional business, while also transforming the way we fundamentally operate today. We will also have real examples on display to show you how TechnipFMC continues to drive change in the energy industry. And we hope to see you all there.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Yes. Good morning. My first question is for Alf. I wanted to talk a little bit about the balance sheet improvement. You talked about 185 million of debt reduction. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on how your leading edge conversations are going with the rating agencies? And is it reasonable to assume that you can be in line for an upgrade to IG status in the next year or so? Sure. Thank you for the question. So first of all, it remains one of our primary objectives, of course, to continue our deleveraging, as we have stated in previous calls. We were successful in reducing our net debt by 400 million from 1.6 to 1.2 in the quarter. We have continued to realize our Technip Energies shares and we have started our debt reduction process with a tender offer this quarter, which netted about 164 million in debt reduction. In terms of looking ahead at the rating agency question that you just raised, a little bit more complicated to give you a straight answer on how fast we can move on that. We are first and foremost really dedicated to our debt production, and we're going to let that play out. And as these metrics, the leverage metrics improve, we clearly expect to get into a range where it's possible to get back to investment grade. Now exact timing of that, I'm not going to go and say that I have an exact timing, but it's not going to happen, let's say, in the short term, at least in the near term. So it will be something that is more on an intermediate term basis. Great. And then just my follow up. Doug, what type of visibility are you seeing in Subsea orders into 2023, just given the improvement in the outlook for just commodity prices? And then just maybe on the Analyst Day, it sounds like we're going to get to see a lot of -- it sounds like it's going to be a relatively media update. Can you maybe highlight on the financial side anything we can look forward to in terms of longer term outlook comments for you guys next month? Sure. Good morning, Arun. Let's start with the Analyst Day question first. Indeed, you're going to see some longer term projections that I think will be quite inspiring for many people. So we'll leave it at that. We'll have more to say here in just a few weeks at Analyst Day. But yes, you should expect some additional longer term outlook as we really begin to see the full leverage and potential of this pure-play company. Let me pivot to your second question, or the first question you had for me, which was around the outlook around inbound orders for Subsea. Let me break it down. You said to 2023, that's a bit further than we've provided any sort of guidance or any sort of commentary on. But in fairness, we are getting close to 2022. So let me give you kind of my best outlook as we see things stacking up. First and foremost, our frontend engineering activity continues to ramp up. We have exceeded the level that we anticipated for this year. And what's really interesting about what's going on is all of those proprietary projects that we're working on. Again, we had another solid quarter inbound in Q3, certainly when you compare it to the rest of the market. And the question is how can we do that? And again, it comes back to the direct awards that we receive by being the only company that has a fully integrated offering as well as the strength of our alliance partners. So just to give you an example of that, in those frontend engineering studies that we're currently performing, approximately two thirds of those are integrated projects, of which 75% will be direct awarded to our company. They'll never go out into the competitive marketplace. So it gives you an idea of kind of the pipeline that we're building up. If I try to translate that into some numbers that you might anticipate, looking to fourth quarter as we indicated, we expect to be in line with consensus. We commented on that last quarter. We don't change our view in any way on that. And that would deliver solid double digit growth 2021 versus 2020, again, a fairly substantial feat coming out of 2020. If you look a bit further beyond that, it gets a little more opaque, Arun, as you can expect at this time. But things are stacking up relatively nicely. We do have that proprietary pipeline that's unique to our company. So if you'll allow me to look at it from a five quarter perspective, meaning give me Q4 plus 2022, because some of the orders in Q4 may slide into 2022 or some orders that we anticipate currently early in the first quarter may be pulled into the fourth quarter. That just comes down to our clients budgetary considerations at the end of the year. So if I look at those five quarters, Arun, we could very well see our Subsea inbound orders approaching $7 billion. Great color. Thanks a lot. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with ATB Capital Markets. Thank you for taking my question. Could you maybe talk about some supply chain disruptions if they had any impact on the quarter or in the coming quarters, both on the Surface side and Subsea side? And then, Doug, you talked about some of the competitive landscape and how you’re positioned on the Subsea side. But could you talk about on the Surface side what the competitive landscape is, and what the pricing dynamics may be in that segment of the market? Sure. Thank you, Waqar. Again, I'll start with the second one first. So our surface business is very different, as we have pointed out many times between Surface International and Surface Americas. Surface International is a much larger business for us than Surface Americas. And it's a market in which we are the industry leader. It's driven by technology. It's driven by projects. And we have a very unique vertically integrated supply chain. And we're going to talk more about that at Analyst Day. As a matter of fact, we're going to show you a demonstration between a Surface International tree system versus a Surface Americas tree system. And I think it will help everybody understand what we've been talking about and how different they are. I've often said it's about a 10x difference. So that's our SI business, Surface International business. We have really strong positions, particularly in the Middle East as well as North Africa. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're anticipating a really strong fourth quarter in inbound orders for Surface International mainly being driven by the Middle East, two or three countries in the Middle East. And we couldn't be more excited about that. Surface Americas is very different. Surface Americas, there's lots and lots of competition. And we're not the market leader. We have a strong team and a strong reputation. And we have some very important clients, tends to be the larger clients that we work for. And we're real proud of the work that we perform. But it is more of a commoditized product market, which is not necessarily where we are -- we really differentiate as a technology company. In terms of pricing, in both markets, we continue to see additional volumes coming through. When additional volumes come through, that tends to translate into pricing. But let me transition from the pricing question into the supply chain question. So when you look at our business, we're mainly a mid-cycle to long-cycle type business. It's why we have such a substantial backlog, which is very favorable, particularly having gone through what the industry and our company went through in 2020. We benefited by the strength of that backlog and have now come out even stronger, and just got done talking about the potential inbound opportunities, which I think are quite eye opening hopefully for everybody on the call for our Subsea business. So when we think about the pricing and Surface in particular, or in terms of the cycle of the business, when you have a short-cycle business and there's inflationary pressures, and look, we're all experiencing inflationary pressures. We're experiencing it in our personal lives as well as our professional lives. So it's very real. Now, I'm very proud of the work that our supply chain team has done. We've done really unique things to be able to offset a significant amount of the impact from the inflation. It's why we don't call it out. We manage around it, if you will, but it's there. It's absolutely there, Waqar. So when you're in a short-cycle business where you don't have the ability to really lock-in predetermined amounts of materials, et cetera, and you're responding to the market, there is greater inflation. So there we would expect and we manage the business so that our pricing offsets that inflationary pressure. So in Surface Americas, certainly pricing is a major discussion with our clients and something that we will continue to do to offset the inflationary pressure in that short-cycle business. Again, in the longer cycle businesses, we have much better control of the inflation because of the uniqueness of our supply chain, the intimate partnerships that we not only have with our clients, but also with our suppliers. We've helped many of them go through the 2020 period. We’ve become stronger as a result of that in terms of the relationship between our companies, and they’re giving us the benefit of that as we move into an inflationary environment. So there's many different aspects involved that we have a much better chance and opportunity to manage that inflation in the longer cycle businesses than in the shorter cycle businesses where yes, you have to rely on pricing. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Hi. Good morning, guys. That $7 billion number on orders that you just put out there, was that a Subsea number or was that a total order number? Subsea. Wow. And then on that Subsea side, can you just talk a little bit about how much of that you think is Brazil as kind of the one area we're starting to see a lot out of you? You noted a couple of awards recently. Can you maybe just talk about that market and kind of how you see kind of Petrobras getting back to kind of maybe where they were before? Obviously, there were a big chunk of offshore rigs at one time and kind of how they're coming back. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that are going down there and how you see the order book there? I'm just kind of curious how much of that $7 billion could be a Brazilian number. Sure. So let me expand it just slightly, David, and say South America, right. So South America is by far the most important market for our Subsea business this decade. But it's not just Brazil. Don't forget Guyana. Guyana is hugely important to us. We are deeply grateful for the relationship that we have with ExxonMobil and Hess in the country and the ability that we've been able to supply all of the Subsea equipment in Brazil to date and continue to drive project performance and hopefully future awards in Guyana. So Guyana is very important. We know that Suriname and other areas are beginning to develop later in the decade. I would say, towards the end of the decade, we would anticipate Mexico as well as being potentially a very important country in South America in terms of Subsea of business. Now turning to Brazil, clearly the largest. As I’ve pointed out in my prepared remarks, we've been there for five decades. We have 98% local content. We have more capabilities in Brazil than we have in any other country in terms of manufacturing, the fleet, R&D, the people, so forth and so on, and just a long rich history. We manufactured -- we reached the manufacturing of our 700th tree in Brazil. I believe that's more or less than more of all the rest combined. So it's a very, very significant market for us. We're very, very proud. We feel very privileged. We have a great relationship and a very long relationship with Petrobras. We've done a lot of new technology development with Petrobras. We talked about a Robot Valve Controlled manifold. This is amazing technology. We're already on our second generation of this technology in Brazil, and it really feeds our all electric ambitions around the world. So a very important partnership or well established partnership. And yes, Brazil will play a major role both in the 2022 inbound, but I would expect it to play a major role beyond that as well. And, Doug, in your prepared remarks, you were talking about the Surface orders kind of coming up here. You said there's a couple of big tenders that are coming up or a couple of big contracts. So can you expand a little bit about that? I believe you're talking about the Surface side in the Middle East. Could -- a little more on there would be much appreciated. Thanks. Sure, David. And yes, thanks for clarifying. I want to be -- we were talking to the significant increase in Q4 orders was in reference to Surface Technologies, specifically in the Middle East and more specifically in Abu Dhabi from ADNOC and in Saudi Arabia from Saudi Aramco. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Thanks. Good morning, Doug. Good morning. Hi. I was curious if you -- we've seen that your pipeline slide has expanded over the past couple of quarters with a couple of major projects; well, two very large and one -- and several medium sized projects being added to the visible pipeline. Would we be crazy to extrapolate a trend from that and expect more accretion and that opportunity to come into your view as you update that over the next several quarters? Would that be as you expect or do you think that maybe we've seen some bottled up projects come back into focus, and maybe that's more of a one-off phenomenon? Ian, thank you. That's a very interesting question. First of all, four quarters does make a trend, although I would caution not just to extrapolate, and I'll explain why here in just a second. Prior to explaining that, I'll comment on the latter part of the question. I know when I look at this Opportunity List, look, there's a couple, let's be candid, that have been on this list for quite some time, that have not yet moved to project FID. But the vast majority that are on this list are relatively new, if you will, within the recent quarter. So I wouldn't think of it as a -- I don't know, I think you said as bottled up kind of projects coming through the pipeline. Certainly not when I think back to the comment I made and when we look at our frontend activity, which, again, is somewhat a reflection of the pre-opportunity, Subsea Opportunity List, right, things that may not yet be on the Subsea Opportunity List. And speaking of things that may not yet be on the Subsea Opportunity List, I think it's also important to remember for our company, all of that integrated direct awards never show up on the Subsea Opportunity List. Obviously, it would be a huge competitive disadvantage for me to give that information freely to the market. So again, like this quarter, when we have 1.1 billion in inbound and not really a name specific project in a press release, we had the vessel charters, but not necessarily a project. That's a strong foundation that we built. But again, that comes through this proprietary set of opportunities that isn't on the Subsea Opportunity List. Now all the way back to the beginning of your question, and the reason I said I’d just be a little bit cautious, you've seen press releases or you -- maybe not press releases, but you've seen news articles and there's certain market intelligence out there around a couple of the Búzios projects that are likely to be FID’ed in the coming quarters, potentially other projects that you may have heard about in the North Sea. So I could see quite a few of these, because once they're awarded, then we take them off of the Subsea Opportunity List. Are there other projects to backfill? Absolutely, as I indicated earlier, but I just wouldn't want to leave the impression that one could just extrapolate quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter of growth, even though we have experienced that for the past four quarters. I'm just being very conservative, and saying if in a particular quarter, two or three or four of these were awarded, that could be several billion coming off the list, and maybe being replaced by more than several billion but not necessarily in the same quarter. Great, very clear. Thank you. For a follow up, maybe I don't necessarily want to completely front run your content for next month. But I know you'll talk about positioning for new energy projects, Deep Purple and otherwise. But just curious what timeframe you think that type of work becomes material in your Subsea backlog? Is that -- are we going to start to see the beginnings of that in your orders in '22, or does maybe the reawakening, the quickening of conventional Subsea oil projects come in at the deferment or the expense of energy transition projects being accelerated? Sure. Thank you, Ian. For sure, you're going to hear much more about that here in a few weeks. But since you asked the question, I'll give you something to think about in anticipation of the Analyst Day. As we pointed out, we're very much focused on wind, wave, hydrogen and carbon transportation and storage. By the way, potentially some other offshore energy sources are not named in those four as well. But just sticking to those four, as we've said, we believe our role is to be the enabler. We want to advance and accelerate the energy transition. But as a system integrator, which is deep in the DNA of our company, that's what we do. We integrate various technologies, we create the -- we’re the architect who brings together all of those elements and creates a very unique system, where we're somewhat agnostic to which of those energy sources, if you will, generates revenue the quickest, or even which one generates the most revenue for our company. We just want to help the world and help the industry drive the energy transition by bringing 70% of the surface area of the globe and making it available to them, i.e. offshore. That's our domain. That's what we know. That's what we know very, very well. And because of that, more and more companies are coming to us, and you see us announcing one, two, three of these per quarter, announcing new investments that we've made, new relationships that we formed in this particular area. So let me just talk about one in particular, which is carbon capture and storage. So we couldn't be more proud of the announcement we made just within the last few days of an alliance that we formed with Talos Energy for doing carbon capture and storage in the Gulf of Mexico. As indicated in my prepared remarks, there's a significant amount of activity around the Gulf Coast region that would benefit from carbon capture and storage, and is a way to really advance the objectives that we share and much of the world shares in really driving down greenhouse gas emissions. So in that particular area, again, and having announced the alliance, it is possible that in 2022 already, we could begin to see potential award of projects moving forward in the area of carbon capture and storage. That's great. Thanks. I look forward to hearing more in a few weeks. Thanks for the perspectives this morning. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Vaibhav Vaishnav with Coker Palmer. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Doug, just to try to put in context of that 7 billion potential awards over the next 12 months, is that fair to think that could be around 1x book to bill, or am I at least in the ballpark when I say that? So let me clarify just one thing. It was over the next five quarters, so that would be over the next 15 months, right? What I was saying was it's hard to pinpoint exactly Q4 versus Q1, because some things will move back and forth. So I said based on five quarters or 15 months, we see a lot at this time. And look, it will change and we'll provide an update as we have more visibility. But we have a line of sight right now up to $7 billion of orders in the next five quarters or the next 15 months. Certainly, if you do the math behind that and make an assumption for Q4, you're looking at a book to bill above 1.0 for sure for 2022, which is exciting and certainly speaks volumes for where we are as a company and our position in this industry. Got it. And as we think about revenues improving next year and over next few years, how should we think about CapEx? Is like this 250 million CapEx good enough like a starting point, or do we need to think about if the revenues increase, does our CapEx also need to increase? Yes, let me just start by reiterating our philosophy, right. So our philosophy is to focus on through cycle returns. We've done some very unique things. I believe you've seen us really, let's say, do things differently from the past in terms of how we manage and operate the assets of our company. We have actually reduced the size of our fleet while growing the company. And we do that through forming very important relationships and being a company that works well with others. And we can do that through alliances, for example, like we have an alliance with Allseas, and we now work with them and look for opportunities together with them, benefiting both companies but also benefiting the broader industry. So a real discipline, if you will. And I'm going to turn it over to Alf to give a bit more insight into kind of what you should be thinking about in terms of the actual CapEx numbers. Yes, thank you, Doug. And with the background of what Doug said, clearly this number is not expected to grow relative to revenue. So if you look at the ratio that we're at right now, it will certainly not be expected to grow over that ratio for any extended periods of times. If you also further look at our business and what Doug was saying, more as we grow further in revenue and with the support of third party alliances, we believe that the incremental CapEx can actually be at the lower level for some of our core business. You also look at some of the other things we're doing in our business, we are investing in our Subsea 2.0 product technology, it’s driving more standardization and also allows us for actually investing in less incremental CapEx per manufacturing unit, if you will. So there are a couple of drivers that can be helpful for the long term. But right now, if you want to stay at a relative ratio, I think you should be fairly safe instead of staying at that relative ratio between revenue and CapEx as it is stated today. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our third quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our Web site, beginning at approximately 8 PM British summer time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you very much for joining us. Operator, you may now end the call. This concludes today's conference.

We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 1:54 I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer? 2:02 Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you all for participating in our fourth quarter earnings. 2021 was truly a breakout year for TechnipFMC. We are confident that we have entered a multi-year upcycle for energy demand with continued strength in inbound orders expected for our company through at least 2025. 2021 mark the inflection in order activity, with total company inbound awards growing an impressive 33% versus the prior year to $6.8 billion. Total company full-year adjusted EBITDA was $580 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.1%, a 300 basis point improvement on the prior year. 3:02 Free cash flow from continuing operations was $523 million, more than double the high-end of our guidance range. Beyond this much improved financial performance in 2021, or several notable accomplishments. We started the year with a partial spin-off of Technip Energies, successfully creating 2 industry leading companies. Since the time of the separation, we have sold the majority of our remaining stake, generating proceeds of more than $1 billion. When combined with our strong free cash flow, these sales have contributed to a significant reduction in net debt, which declined nearly 70% over the course of the year to $678 million at year end. 3:55 As an industry leading pure play company, we concluded the year by hosting our Analyst Day providing a comprehensive update on the path forward for TechnipFMC. During the event, we highlighted the tremendous success of iEPCI, the industry changing commercial model, we introduced just 5 years ago, which has strengthened our offering, expanded our alliances and positioned our company as the subsea partner of choice. We demonstrated how we're continuing to drive change with industrialized products suites, like Subsea 2.0, which are transforming how we operate our business, while also lowering the carbon footprint of conventional oil and gas developments. We introduce new energy ventures, which will position TechnipFMC as a key player for the development of novel sources of offshore energy as well as carbon, transportation and storage. 5:06 And lastly, we provided our longer-term view of the energy market, which serves as the basis for intermediate term financial outlook that extends to 2025 and illustrates the significant long-term potential, we see for TechnipFMC across both traditional and new energy markets. 5:28 Turning to segment inbound, the order momentum experienced in 2021 extended across the company with Surface Technologies full year inbound, increasing nearly 70% versus the prior year to $1.8 billion. Orders outside North America more than doubled when compared to 2020. This included a significant portion of the segments largest ever award, a multi-year contract from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to provide wellheads, trees and associated services. This contract is a resounding endorsement of our 40-plus year relationship with ADNOC. The Middle East represents one of our largest market opportunities this decade. 06:17 Under the frame agreement with ADNOC, TechnipFMC will further grow in country talent and expand existing manufacturing assembly and test capabilities in Abu Dhabi in order to deliver the company's complete portfolio of surface wellheads and trees locally. This follows the recently completed expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in Saudi Arabia, which supports our commitment to develop a diverse and capable local workforce as part of Saudi Aramco’s in Kingdom total value add program or IKTVA and Saudi vision 2030 07:00 In North America, our recently launched digital Solution emission is the next level of optimization for surface production facilities. Using process automation and data the system provides constant monitoring and adjustments in real time to minimize flaring by up to 50% while maximizing oil production. The technology is core to our eye production offering and can be applied in existing facilities globally. 07:35 Turning to Subsea, full year inbound orders of $5 billion increased 24% versus the prior year. We experienced further adoption of iEPCI in the year, including further geographic expansion. Operators using the integrated approach for the first time included Karoon whose Patola field will be our first iEPCI in Brazil. Tullow which utilized our subsea studio digital solution to optimize field layout for the Jubilee development in Ghana and Petronas (ph), which will utilize both iEPCI and our Subsea 2.0 platform for the Limbayong deep-water Development project offshore in Malaysia. 8:22 The improved inbound orders in the year also reflected continued strength in South America. In Guyana, we were awarded the subsea production system for ExxonMobil’s Yellowtail development, our fourth consecutive award within the State Brook development. In Brazil, we further strengthened our relationship with Petronas, announcing several awards in the year including 3 long-term vessel charters, which will serve the Brazilian market for multiple years, a contract to supply subsea manifolds utilizing our 2 generation all electric robotic valve controller for the Marlim and Voador fields, and award to supply equipment and services for the Búzios 6-9 fields, and 3 frame agreements for the manufacture of more than 500 kilometers of flexible pipe over the next 4 years. 9:23 For the full year, iEPCI direct awards, and subsea services represented more than 60% of our total inbound, a testament to our innovative leadership, intimate client relationships and strong track record of execution. Importantly, these orders often provide us with a unique opportunity set that goes beyond the publicly identified projects and speaks to both our market positioning and industry relationships, providing TechnipFMC with the most comprehensive view of the market. 10:01 Our subsea opportunity list as expanded to a record level of more than 20 billion, providing increased visibility into the middle of the decade. The continued growth in part reflects the very robust front end activity experienced throughout 2021. Given the extensive opportunity said in our strong visibility, we remain confident that we will see a multi-year subsea upcycle with the potential for inbound orders to reach $8 billion in 2025. 10:37 Looking more closely at 2022. Our early engagement and client partnerships supports our view that subsea tree awards for the total industry are likely to exceed 350, a level not experienced since 2013. We anticipate subsea inbound order growth of up to 30% in 2022, with iEPCI direct awards and subsea services approaching 75% of our inbound orders. 11:12 Our growth expectations also highlight continued expansion in Greenfield opportunities as well as increased high back activity with growth from the smaller projects coming from North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. All regions in which we have a strong presence and are well-positioned due to our extensive installed base. With this higher level of activity, we also anticipate and acceleration in the market adoption of Subsea 2.0. We estimate 50% of our subsea tree orders over the next 2 years will be Subsea 2.0. And this will provide us with the volume needed to leverage a Configure To Order or CTO operating model. 12:00 Well, not a new concept, CTO is revolutionary to our industry and allows us to leverage the efficiencies of standardization while still addressing the unique requirements of individual projects, all of which can be selected from a product catalogue that unlocks efficient manufacturing and servicing of our equipment. CTO has enabled us to create a value stream that delivers a more competitive offering to the market, resulting in a 25% reduction in cost, a 50% reduction in product delivery time and manufacturing throughput that is more than doubled within our existing footprint. 12:48 Looking beyond CTO, which is all about how we operate our business. We continue to pave the way forward with the introduction of new subsea technologies, including all electric systems. Electrification offers advantages to all subsea wells and is particularly well suited for the development of long tie backs, gas fields, water injection, and carbon transportation and storage. In subsea services, we expect revenue growth of approximately 35% by the end of 2025, this growth will be driven by market expansion, new technology introductions and other commercial initiatives. Our revolutionary [Indiscernible] remotely operated underwater vehicle is transforming the ROV industry through disruptive technology and delivering optimized performance. 13:49 Our first two [Indiscernible] systems were successfully deployed with Shell and based on this success, the client has awarded us contracts for 3 additional [Indiscernible] systems. We are now expanding this service across our customer base. Additionally, Our integrated life of field model is designed to unlock the full potential of subsea infrastructure by transforming the way services are delivered and proactively addressing the challenges faced over the life of a field. 14:24 Looking further ahead, We are confident that oil and gas will remain an important part of the energy mix for an extended period of time. While this view is supported by the outlook for higher global energy demand, we also recognize that we are in the early stages of the energy transition. To address the evolving markets, we recently announced the formation of new energy ventures or NEV where we are leveraging our core competencies, capabilities and investments made over the last several years, We have appointed a dedicated leadership team who has extensive industry knowledge and are focusing on our contribution to the energy transition through 3 main pillars. Greenhouse gas removal, offshore floating renewables including wind, wave and title energy and hydrogen. 15:21 In these target areas, we see a total addressable market of close to $80 billion dollars for TechnipFMC by the end of 2030. And we anticipate NEV inbound orders of $1 billion dollars through 2025. In order to accelerate our growth, we are leveraging our extensive experience and project integration to approach these opportunities with a new execution model. Integrated offshore novel energies or simply I1. 15:53 We have demonstrated our ability to successfully collaborate with key industry players over the last year. We have made announcements regarding several strategic agreements and partnerships, some of which have already resulted in real project opportunities. In Greenhouse gas removal, last year, we entered into a long term strategic alliance with total energy to develop and deliver technical and commercial solutions for carbon capture and storage projects along the United States Gulf Coast. 26 Where FEED activity has been initiated on multiple projects. In offshore renewables, we announced just last month that our partnership Magnora Offshore Wind was successful in the ScotWind leasing round application where the proposed development project will have a total capacity of approximately 500 megawatts, which could power more than 600,000 homes in the United Kingdom. 16:55 And today, we are announcing a hydrogen storage MOU with store NG, a subsidiary of, NG, which has the potential to accelerate the development of a ready to scale up solution for the underground storage and utilization of green hydrogen across Europe. We're making solid and tangible progress and are fully committed to playing a meaningful role in this challenging, yet exciting period of transition. 17:28 We believe we have the right competencies, resources and teams to make this a very successful journey and we are confident that as the energy transition accelerates so too will the opportunity set for technique FMC. 17:43 I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results. 17:49 Thank you, Doug. At our Analyst Day in November, I reiterated our increased focus on cash, both cash generation and capital discipline, which we believe are essential to increasing shareholder value. I am proud of the efforts made across the organization as we delivered strong free cash flow of $423 million in the quarter and a much improved balance sheet with net debt declining to $678 million at the end of the period. I will spend more time on these topics shortly. But let me first provide a broader recap of our results. 18:28 We finished the year strong. With total company inbound orders of $2.1 billion in the quarter, Subsea inbound was $1 billion, putting full year orders at $5 billion, an increase of close to 25% versus the prior year. Surface Technologies achieved inbound of $1.1 billion, which included the multi-year award from ADNOC, full year inbound was $1.8 billion, an increase of nearly 70% from last year. 18:58 Total company backlog was $7.7 billion at the end of the period. Fourth quarter total company revenue was $1.5 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $130 million. For the full year, we delivered on segment guidance for both subsea and Surface Technologies. Fourth quarter reported loss from continuing operations was $0.28 per diluted share, which included after tax charges and credits that netted to an expense of $71 million or $0.16 per share. These charges included the following expenses totaling $42 million related to impairment restructuring and other charges. The majority of these charges relate to the continued optimization of our global footprint and the loss of $30 million on our equity ownership in technique energies, which primarily relates to the unfavorable change in fair market value during the period. When excluding the impact of these charges and credits are adjusted loss from continuing operations was $0.12 per share. The adjusted loss included a loss on an early extinguishment of debt of $22 million and a foreign exchange gain of $5 million. 20:17 Turning to the segment results in subsea, the revenue was $1.2 billion, down 6% from the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $124 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10%, a sequential decline of 120 basis points. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by reduced productivity in Africa and Australia, and the seasonal decline in services activity, particularly in the North Sea. 20:47 In Surface Technologies, revenue of 287 million increased 7% from the third quarter results benefited from increased activity internationally, and the continued recovery in North America. Adjusted EBITDA was $29 million, a 2% increase sequentially. Results benefited from improved operating performance in North America, partially offset by investment in new international manufacturing capacity. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.1%. 21:22 Turning to corporate and other items in the period, corporate expense was $30 million, which included $2 million of restructuring and other charges. Net interest expense was $34 million and tax expense was $39 million. Cash from continuing operations was 484 million, which benefited from strong performance in customer collections in the period, capital expenditures were $61 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $423 million in the quarter and for the full year was $523 million. 21:58 We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion. We reduced cross debt by $251 million sequentially. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $678 million, a reduction of nearly 70% since year end 2020. During the year we sold approximately 75% of our stake and technique energies for proceeds of $901 million. In January of this year, we sold an additional 9 million shares for total proceeds of $135 million. So today we retain a direct stake of 12.9 million shares, or 7% of Technip energies issued an outstanding share capital. 22:43 Moving through full year 2022 outlook. In subsea, we are guiding for revenue to be in the range of $5.2 million to $5.6 million. Backlog scheduled for execution in the current year is $3.4 billion. Subsea services revenue is expected to grow to approximately $1.2 billion, the majority of which is not included in backlog today. Taken together, over 85% of revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is fully supported by scheduled backlog and services. 23:16 In 2021, we delivered a 200 basis point expansion in subsea adjusted EBITDA margin, and we are confident we will see an improvement again this year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 11% to 12%. A further 100 basis point increase at the midpoint of the range. Notably, we are expecting continued margin improvement, even when assuming the midpoint of our revenue guidance, which implies essentially flat revenue versus the prior year. This highlights that changes we have applied to our business model are translating into improved operational and financial performance. 24:00 For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $1.15 to $1.3 billion, an increase of 14% at the midpoint. We expect North America which represents just over 35% of revenue in the fourth quarter to grow at a faster rate than the overall segment. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to a range of 11% to 13%. This guidance considers that our investment in new international manufacturing capacity in support of the strong Middle East outlook will continue to be a headwind in the first quarter, with a reduction in EBITDA margin of approximately 100 basis points to 200 basis points versus the fourth quarter. 24:46 I will now highlight several of our other guidance items, we expect net interest expense of $105 million to $115 million and improvement of approximately $30 million versus 2021. Driven by further reduction in depth, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $230 million, or 3.5% of revenue at the midpoint of guidance. Free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, is expected to be between 100 million and 250 million for the full year. Similarly to 2021, we expect free cash flow to be weighted to the second half of the year, with the first quarter expected to see a net outflow due to the payment of annual incentives and timing of working capital consumption. 25:38 Full year free cash flow in 2022 assumes only a limited use of working capital, therefore sustaining the improvement we achieved in 2021. When all of these items are taken together, our 2022 guidance at the midpoint, implies adjusted EBITDA of approximately $670 million a year-over-year increase of 15%. 26:03 I will now turn the call back over to Doug for a few closing remarks. 26:09 Thank you Alf. Before moving to Q&A, I want to reiterate our view of the intermediate term outlook. The inflection for the energy markets is here. And we also believe this cycle is different in a way that will accelerate its impact on our company. Since 2015, offshore economics have materially improved, and subsea cycle times have become significantly shorter. This has resulted in new subsea investment coming much earlier in the cycle, and more in parallel with US land markets. We believe these changes are fundamental and sustainable as a result of new business models and technology pioneered by our company. 27:01 Importantly, TechnipFMC is well positioned for the anticipated activity growth, given our leadership in both subsea in the Middle East. And the acceleration across these markets has created a multi-year upcycle in our business. We are confident that this outlook combined with the changes we have made to our business model will translate into improved operational and financial performance. Subsea EBITDA margins of 10.5% in 2021 or 200 basis points above the prior year, with margin set to improve and additional 100 basis points to 11.5% at the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. 27:46 The timing of our subsea margin expansion is particularly noteworthy, occurring much earlier in the recovery than in previous cycles, further supporting our goal of achieving 15% margins in 2025. Our strong project execution and continued industrialization of our operations leaves us well positioned to see improved EBITDA across the entire portfolio, including the potential for subsea EBITDA to nearly double by 2025 with several of the key drivers firmly within our own control. This along with our emerging role, as the offshore architect for the energy transition will allow us to thrive in both present and future energy markets. 28:40 Operator, you may now open the line for questions. 28:46 [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ian MacPherson with Piper Sandler. 29:01 Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Doug. 29:06 Good morning, Ian. 29:09 So I was – I was curious about the, sorry I had some feedback on my phone. Curious about the outlook for orders if you're going to deliver, you expect to grow Subsea Orders roughly 30% this year that sounds like a modest upgrade to the prior guidance, which was $7 billion over the 5 quarters including this past quarter and the 2025 target of $8 billion would therefore imply a much lower growth rate from ’22 through ’25, which sounds like maybe just some conservatism, but wanted to get thoughts around that question. And I know also, you haven't removed it from your deck, but we do know that [Indiscernible] has slipped again, at least according to popular press and maybe that's less perspective now for 2022. But any thoughts on how the rest of your pipeline has seemingly warmed up or maybe become higher probable for this year excluding [Indiscernible]? 30:20 Okay, Ian. so let me start with the numerical part of the answer. So, it is when we gave the $7 billion of guidance over the next five quarters, that was Q4, plus the four quarters of 2022, realizing, we were coming off of a year, where we had $4 billion of inbound. And we were anticipating to be, in the range of at the time around 45 to 47 of inbound for 2021. You correctly point out, we delivered $5 billion in 2021, which again, was 24%, 25% increase over the prior year. And now we're looking at an additional 30% increase this year, taking us into the range of the $6.5 billion. So I guess the $7 over $5 became $6.5 over $4, which is, which is pretty impressive actually, given where we have been, and the growth rate is quite phenomenal. 31:16 Looking ahead, yes. At Analysts Day, we laid out $8 billion in 2025. Could that be pulled forward absolutely. Are we changing that view at this time? No? but we are very confident in delivering the $6.5 billion for 2022. Moving on a little bit to the – maybe some of the big puts and takes on the subsea opportunity list, which by the way, that list expanded to $20 billion up from the record $19 billion last quarter. You mentioned [Indiscernible] I would agree, it’s probably not a 2022 event. Where do we see things warming up clearly in South America? It's already very warm and it's getting warmer, and we see things being accelerated and pulled to the left. We'll see likewise, we'll see some increased activity, particularly in the North region sector of the North Sea. Also, we see things really warming up both in Asia Pacific, particularly in Malaysia as well as in Africa and we see things being we're being asked to accelerate bring things forward at a pace and cadence that I will tell you, we've not experienced for a very long time. 32:36 That's great. Thanks. And none of that sounds surprising at this point, given the state to play in the markets. On the surface side, congratulations, by the way on the big ADNOC ward. I don't know if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but have you described how much of that was reflected in the Q4 bookings? I don't think all of it was? 32:59 So as far as in the impact to Q4 was minimal, as far as the inbound and the way that we inbound that project, was we only inbound about 50% of the total project value, so there will be more to come in the future. 33:14 Perfect. That's what I was looking for. Thanks, Doug. 33:19 Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilson with Jefferies. 33:26 Hello. Thank you. Good morning. I've got 2 questions if I may. The first is on the guidance of 2022, could I ask how depreciation looks year-on-year? Do you think that will be lower than the past year? The second question is on market share of 350 wellhead estimate you talked about the total market would you be able to opine what you expect your market share to be for that? And how would – that would compare? With okay, almost 10 years ago but the 2013 you speak to as FMC Technology? Thanks. 34:04 Sure. For so let me I'll take the market share question. And then we'll cover the question about the 2022 depreciation. So, look, we don't talk about market share. First of all, we don't really talk about tree count. So let me start there. You did -- thank you for pointing it out. We haven't talked about it in a long time, actually, since we created TechnipFMC. As I say many times, you know, we do much more than just deliver trees these days. And because of that we like – that's why we like to talk about the subsea opportunity set. We give you total contract values, we tried to give much more visibility than the subsea tree number alone. Matter of fact, I don't recall, Matt, but I bet it's been about 4 years since I've talked about the Christmas tree count. So why did we, look, there's a level of misinformation out there that we felt needed to be, you know, rectified. And, as the market leader and it's kind of beholden upon us to do that. So that's why we came out with a 350 tree count, we know we're going to be well above – well above pre pandemic levels and, again, going back almost a decade since we've seen this level of activity. 35:16 A couple of interesting things have happened in that period of time as well, I would say approximately 30 to 40% of the total manufacturing capacity no longer exists. So we along with our competition have all removed of relevant a material portion of our total manufacturing capacity. So what that means is we're in a situation right now, where it's very favorable in terms of the economic value to our company, and more importantly, our ability to be able to continue to grow whilst removing manufacturing capacity. How is that possible? Well, that's the whole subsea 2.0 story, which began back in 2017 and that's the CTO are configured to order story, which started at our Analyst Day, this past November, where we really laid out how we're now able to double the capacity through a much smaller manufacturing footprint. So in other words, our demonstrated capacity has remained constant, or our bill – our throughput, our ability to be able to deliver has remained constant. That's obviously not the case for the others who have removed the capacity, which was the right move the capacity, which was the right thing to do, we did the same, but don't necessarily have the volume or the scale or the technology platform to be able to leverage in a CTO model. All that to say our market share is certainly going up. 36:43 Yes, hello, Mark, this is Alf here. Just coming back on your depreciation and amortization question. It's basically going to be very flat year-over-year. So no, no, no market difference in in what you saw in 2021. 36:58 Got it? Okay. Thanks for both those comments. And just to maybe expand on it. You spoke eloquently to that CTO model Doug and efficiencies in the manufacturing process and the whole system dynamic. I look at the guidance at ’22 and the immediate thing I look at is, can you produce a positive bottom line net profit out of this business in ’22? Given what you said on depreciation that Doug, it sounds like, if sorry, Alf if exceptionals will be at a low level, then is a good chance of that. Would you expect the business to return to profit bottom line in 22? 37:42 Yes, we are projecting a positive net income at the bottom line for next year. And yes, the amount of neutral charges would come down it overall from where we were in 2021. 37:56 Thank you for those comments. I'll hand it over. 37:59 Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. 38:05 Yeah, good morning. Doug, FTI generally perceived as a late cycle stock, you know, clearly the OFS playbook has to been to focus a little bit more on the short cycle. NAM names. one of the interesting things you mentioned is just the decline in subsea cycle times that are you're seeing perhaps things more consistent with US land. I was wondering if you could maybe offer some proof points to kind of corroborate this view? And how are maybe some of the differences that you're seeing this cycle in terms of subsidy orders versus in past cycles? 38:49 Arun, thank you very much for the question. And thank you for picking up on that in the prepared remarks. It obviously was one of the key messages we wanted to deliver today, I realized that there's a lot of people reflect on kinda the historical trends, etc. And in doing so, it is true that more of the NAM leveraged stocks tend to benefit first, before the offshore stocks really take off in a cycle. Obviously, the offshore stocks have a longer tail and benefit when things slow down. They're not nearly as abrupt as what happens in US land. But it is different this cycle, we hope that already the numbers that we're reporting and putting in front of you demonstrate that our growth rate is that of the growth rate that's being experienced in the Permian Basin. Number one, we're seeing margin expansion that we would typically have not seen till the second or third year of a cycle. We're seeing that margin expansion now, speaking of subsea 300 basis points total between last year and the midpoint of the guidance for this year, and more to come. 39:58 So it's happening, it's real time, internally, we -- our kind of images, there was always the, the US land train that left the station a bit earlier than our train left the station. But they've left at the same time and if there's a message we really want to pass is our trains left the station, the momentum is building and we hope that that is something that the investment community now, we've given all the data between the Analyst Day and what we've now given for the 2022 guidance. I think given a very clear trajectory of what's happening, and you can look at it by customer cap expand, you're asking for proof points, we've looked at that. If you look at the customers who have both, let's say exposure to the US land market in the offshore market, kind of where are they putting the majority of their CapEx growth? It's pretty clear. The offshore has a lot of very strong attributes, particularly in this part of the energy cycle. You've got a lower greenhouse gas footprint. These are the some of the lowest greenhouse gas barrels that you can produce some of the most prolific reservoirs that you can produce, and a relatively stable regulatory environment certainly compared to other areas. 41:15 Great my follow up, Doug, you guided to 2022 subsea revenue have caught $5.4 billion at the midpoint and then EBITDA margin called 11.5%. At the Analyst Day, you provided 2025 outlook of $7 billion in subsea revenue at a 15% margin. Since we tried to connect the dots between ’22 and 2025, do you expect the interim period ’23 and ’24 to be more linear or how do you think of the shape of your – of the profile revenue and subsea margin profile between the between the two areas? 2020 to 2025? 42:09 No, thanks. I'll pivot back to the answer that, the question that he asked and kind of the way I answered it, hopefully gave some visibility into how that shape could develop. Again, we're not giving you know, ’23, ’24, ’25 guidance. We've, obviously, we've just given ’22 guidance. Back in November, we gave ’25. So you have the two goalposts now. It's a fair question. But if you reflect on what I said to Ian, that we're seeing a level of intensity of our client conversations at a level that I've not experienced in a very long time, in terms of acceleration, acceleration, acceleration, so I'm not sure, I don't know if there's one thing it'll never be linear. But I think if you go linear, there's probably upside to that. 43:03 Great, thanks for answer. 43:05 Our next question comes from the line of Taylor [Indiscernible]. 43:12 Hey, Doug and team, thanks for taking my question. My first one's on a capital allocation. So big free cash flow number for Q4 and really for the full year of 2021. I imagine net debt is lower than what you're anticipating exiting the year, at least relative to your prior guidance. And at the Analyst Day. He talked about paying down gross debt to reducing gross debt to $1.3 billion and a shareholder return sort of catalyst coming in the back half of 2023, and I just wonder, I guess my question is, with a strong Q4 free cash flow performance, has anything changed there with respect to cap allocation around shareholder returns? Or is the plan still to reduce gross debt to $1.3 billion before doing anything or this net debt I get into – getting or nearing a position where you might accelerate that timeline? 44:04 Thank you, Taylor. I would agree with you that the ability to reduce the rate or the cadence of which we've been able to reduce the net debt is, we're extremely proud and 70% reduction, and a lot of positive momentum gives us a great reason for confidence. And I don't want to steal any of the any of the joy from Alf who is very happy these days. So I'll pass it over to Alf to complete the answer. 44:35 Yes. Thank you, Doug. So, clearly, we are very pleased with the Q4 free cash flow generation, it really exceeded our expectations and is putting us in a great position now with a net debt below $700 million. And as you point out, well, on path to this to the target capital structure that we indicated, the Analyst Day, which we said would be cash around 800 and debt of $1.3 billion. So really, really great progress for us here. In terms of capital education, in general, I would say, we remain committed to both debt reduction and shareholder distributions in line with what we said there. When you think about that reduction and more deleveraging, we still have $700 million to go to get to the $1.3 billion that we indicated. So obviously, this will still be a focus area for us, we will expect to do our debt servicing to schedule this year, that's about $200 million and then we will obviously review options to further tender for outstanding debt, where it's economically beneficial to do so. 45:37 And as a reminder also on our most expensive senior notes that we do have a coal provision for that in the first quarter of 2023. If I go further and just talk a little bit more about the shareholder distribution specifically and again, referencing back to Analyst Day, we did say that we are indicated to initiate a sustainable dividend, as you know – as part of targeted really for the second half of 2023. But we also said the opportunistically we would review share buyback as a supplement for bringing value further value to our shareholders. 46:15 So clearly as we have this improved cash flow, we will certainly evaluate options for initiating distributions slightly ahead of that timeline, the second half of 2023 and including entertaining share buybacks if it becomes an option. But the basic criteria is still that we have the the – providing that we have the metrics in place, to really – continue to have long-term favorable access to credit. So we don't want to lose sight of the leveraging that we need to do first, while also retaining some flexibility to reinvest in our business, as we, you know, continue to be on this growth cycle. So hopefully that helps you a little bit. 46:53 Yeah, does. Thanks for that. And just to follow up on related on supply chain, a lot of your peers are still struggling through a number of supply chain related issues. And I imagine you're dealing with a lot of the same issues today but not readily apparent in the numbers for the back half of 2021 or, and the guidance for margins in 2022. So just curious if you could give us an update on all things supply chain related, are things getting worse as we enter 2022? Or have some of the issues you've been dealing with kind of flattened out just curious and all sorts of topics there? 47:31 Taylor, thanks. As you said, that's a pretty broad topic and thanks for noting, our performance in the environment. Look, we're not immune to the environment. But we believe it's our responsibility to manage through the environment. And we were things were thrown at us in 2020 that nobody anticipated. And there's been ramifications directly associated with that, but also other challenges that supply chain challenges, logistic challenges, etc. So kind of just imagine for a moment, the momentum that we're demonstrating against those headwinds. If the winds just calm down, or we get a bit of a tailwind, just imagine the earnings potential of this company and, and that's why we're so proud. That's why we don't call it out every quarter. We just managed through it. But there's no doubt, guidance would be higher operating results would be better if we weren't, faced with the challenges, but it's our job. And we owe it to our shareholders to manage through that and deliver the progression that we've been able to deliver. And just maybe stop for a minute reflect on how much better it could potentially be if we weren't facing some of those headwinds. So, thanks Taylor, for pointing it out. 48:45 Okay. Thanks, Doug. 48:48 Your next question comes from online of Mark Bianchi with Cowen. 48:52 Thanks, I guess, Doug, you mentioned trees. So I'm gonna ask more about trees. This may be the last time we talked about it on a call for a while. The 2013, looking back, I think the industry awarded something like 550, or that was the estimate at the time. You mentioned that a bunch of capacities come out. But I think along that discussion, you also mentioned that your efficiency and your ability to kind of do more with less has also improved. And I would suspect that's the case for your peers. Can you just kind of walk us through how the competitive dynamic has evolved over the past couple years? And how that sits today? I mean, I know that a large portion of your business is maybe not exposed to that well, with iEPCI and such, but just how that looks and what the anticipation is for 2022? 49:48 Sure, Mark, so let me touch on maybe a couple things I wanted to comment on there. So look, there's no evidence. And there certainly not the volume of orders for anyone else in the industry to be able to move to a CTO model. So no, I don't necessarily agree that others have, I'm sure they've gotten better at what they do. But they're still building 1.0 trees. And they don't have unique volume to be able to go to a CTO model. And you can't go to a CTO model on volume alone, you need technology platform, which was subsea 2.0. So, it took us a long time. We started on subsea 2.0 well before 2017. We announced it in 2017 and now it's 50% of our projected orders going forward. 50:41 That's what allows us to be able to move to this. So if you say 4 or 5 years before 2017, this is a long journey, and it's not evident that others are on that journey or if they are, there obviously ways away from being able to get there and our market position right now is such that let you say it's not mathematically available to others to reach that type of volume to be able to get to CTO and so something we're real proud of and something our customer certainly recognize reward us for. The dynamic out there in the marketplace, you raised, which is a good question. I tried to emphasize in my prepared remarks, in 2022, we're now up to 70% of our business is either iEPCI direct awarded to our – mostly direct to word do our customer to our company. Other direct awards from our alliance partners and Subsea Services, which is direct award. 51:49 So – so just reflect on that for a moment. I mean, I've never been in this position in my entire professional life, in any business, to where you are in such a intimate position with your clients due to who you are, which you stand for, being a pure play being focused, putting all your time and effort and passion into the subject, and just being extremely, extremely good partners. And that's what gives us this ability, and that has huge benefits when it comes to things like managing the security of supply. We have deep intimate relationships with our suppliers as well and they know they can count on us for the volume and it's not so, cyclical as it used to be in the past where you'd have 2 good quarters, 2 down quarters, you're seeing a lot of consistency in our inbound trajectory as well. Not that it'll ever be linear, but it's just – it's just a very rewarding position to be in. We're privileged to be here. We're humbled to be here. It's because of the trust that our customers place in us, and we continue to do everything we can to earn that every single day. 53:03 Okay, thanks for that, I guess talking more – more near term on the – the guidance for surface talks about a decline in margin in the first quarter, any commentary on subsea as we go through ’22? I mean, my base case assumption would be, I don't know, you get based on historically, you get kind of like 65% of the business in the middle two quarters of the year, and then the first and the fourth, or the balance, but any further color on how it shapes up. 53:38 No, actually, thank you. That's a good clarifying question for everybody. And we don't see any real change to that pattern. Clearly to Q2, Q3 will be the strongest, Q1 will not be as strong. And that's Q1 Q4, mainly being driven down because of our – because of the weather conditions in certain parts of the world and also a reduction in our subsea service activity during those quarters. So if you will, Q1, step up and Q2, Q3, and then an adjustment back down and Q4, as is the typical pattern, nothing, nothing atypical that we see at this point. 54:15 Got it. Thanks so much. 54:18 Your next question comes from online of Nick Konstantakis with BNP Paribas. 54:26 Hi, and thank you for taking my questions. Doug, you spoke to a pretty large portion of supply taken out of the market in trees and 350, at least next year that really appreciate the color. Can you just give us an idea about pricing? I mean, it feels like strong rebound on smaller capacity should mean very good momentum in the pricing and your orders your inbounding. Just related to that. I think somebody mentioned earlier 2017 at that point, order intake pro forma for the combined company was closer to $50 billions. Appreciate there has been deflation. But is there any other comments like percentages of the stand or compared to the degree possible, the conditions on a like-for-like basis? 55:06 And then I'll secondly, can you just give us a bit more visibility of the movement of contract assets and liabilities within the working capital? If it's project specific? Fine. I just wouldn't – I wouldn't understand whether there was any consolidation effects there? Or what is the driver of those movements? Thank you. 55:24 Sure. So there was a lot there, I'm trying to narrow it down a little bit. So let's start with the kind of outlook. So we asked we clarified that, we're very confident that there'll be 350 trees, awarded in 2022. We have a very large market share of those awards, which allows us to do everything that we said we were set out to do because of the 2.0 and because of the CTO is why we can get the throughput through a smaller manufacturing footprint. We also reduced our manufacturing footprint, we took entire manufacturing facilities, they no longer are part of the are part of the company. So as others did as well. 55:24 The pricing effect of that, obviously when in simple basic economics supply and demand, obviously we're in a more favorable environment. We don't talk a lot about pricing and subsea only for one reason, go back to what I said earlier on Mark's question 70% of our business is direct awarded through, our alliance partners, iEPCI or subsea services. So we're not pricing against the competitors. We're working with our clients to ensure that we get a fair economic benefit from the project and they're obviously direct awarding to us for a reason. So it tends to be favorable, because they know we're going to deliver, we know we're going to help them deliver, to meet to meet their economic requirements, and for their projects to be successful as well. So we just don't talk a lot about it. But yes, clearly, it's all things are pointing in the right direction. 57:13 I will talk about pricing in the North America market for Surface Technologies. This is an area where we are experiencing inflation in just about everything. And it does require almost a very high cadence of pricing adjustments. That obviously has limitations at some point on the economic value of those projects. But it's what you have to do to if you will survive in a market, like what's happening in the US land market right now. Again, I'll point out, the vast majority of our revenue comes internationally, it is not tied to the US, US labor market. But it is important that we do know, the inflationary environment there. And in our subsea contracting model, we also have certain benefits to be able to offset defer or pass on those type of inflationary pressures. So pricing is good overall, most active, if you will, in the surface business, most active in the US land portion of that, which again, a very small percentage and an area that's also experiencing the inflation, so the pricing is there to offset that inflation. 58:28 Other than that, I will let Alf make some further comments. 58:32 Yes, just back to contract assets and liabilities just you asked about. So first of all, I want to point out that it's not as meaningful of a number as it used to be as we were pre-spin with the, with the EMC business Technip Energy is still in our company. So I think if I – I think our net contract liabilities may be something like $45 million at the end of this year, that was probably, a net positive position, in the prior quarter, but again, a slight movement, but it's kind of normal that we will have some movement, but it will not be a major driving necessarily all the time for working capital. 59:09 In terms of our working capital really for the fourth quarter, it was more about customer collection and converting our receivables and assets to cash and we also continued to reduce our inventory. So again not the major driver in our net as liability for contracts. 59:26 Got it. Thank you guys. 59:30 Maybe just one other comment I'll make back to kind of the original part about the geographical mix and stuff. I do think it's important that we note that, post the spin-off, if you look at the pro forma filings of TechnipFMC and certainly what we'll be following here, in the coming days in regards to 2020 to 2021. I just want to make sure that it's clear to everybody, that our exposure to Russia is far less than 1% of our revenue, less than 1% of our total revenue. I just wanted to make sure that we had made that point as well. 60:12 At this time, we have come to the end of the hour, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. 60:21 Thank you. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 pm Greenwich Mean Time today.

01:13 Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
01:50 I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. 01:57 Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. I would like to start off by addressing the war in Ukraine. What the world has witnessed has been truly heartbreaking. I am extremely proud of the compassion our teams worldwide are showing through their support for refugees. I want to personally recognize our employees in Poland, many of whom have been giving direct support to Ukrainian families by opening up their hearts and homes and providing much needed shelter and care.
02:39 As a company, we continue to support their efforts through our global humanitarian fund providing practical and financial health where it is needed most. The invasion is prompted energy security to become a global priority. We remain committed to helping our clients address the essential needs for hydrocarbons today to ensure the continuity of affordable energy prices, while also playing an essential role in the longer-term energy transition.
03:14 Now turning to the quarterly results. Total company revenue in the period was $1.6 billion, total company adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $154 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.9%. Total company inbound orders in the quarter were $2.2 billion, driving sequential growth in backlog to $8.9 billion. Surface Technologies inbound orders were $291 million, with a book-to-bill above one, driven by strength in the U.S. market.
03:58 North America sales and profitability grew sequentially driven by increased drilling and completion activity and an improved pricing environment. Outside of North America, we are investing in new manufacturing capacity to support the strong Middle East outlook. As previously highlighted, we are transitioning to a new facility in Saudi Arabia, which was expected to be a headwind to our financial results in the period.
04:30 The qualification of the facility is extensive and the process has taken us more time than previously anticipated. We are now undergoing final production testing and expect final certification of the facility by the end of the second quarter, at which time we anticipate an acceleration of orders in country. We remain confident in meeting our full year expectations as we have secured plans to accelerate recognition of these orders. Matt, will cover the near-term financial impacts during his prepared remarks.
05:06 Our results in the period also reflected our ability to effectively navigate the ongoing challenges facing the global supply chain. Inflationary pricing and logistical bottlenecks have resulted from a number of factors. The energy transition, the global pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have all play a role, disrupting access to key commodities and supply routes at a time when the global economy is quickly transitioned from a period of contraction to one of accelerating growth.
05:47 But we are not immune to all of the market dislocations, we have taken many strategic actions over the last several years that have mitigated the near-term effects. We are utilizing the lessons learned from previous growth cycles to drive simplification, standardizations and industrialization throughout the organization. We have increased supplier diversification to reduce dependencies on sole source supply or adding supply chain capacity to ensure proper balance with internal manufacturing capacity.
06:22 And we are developing stronger relationships with our supply chain, much like the alliance partnerships and frame agreements, we have developed over the years with our customers. We are working more closely with our supply chain partners to better integrate them into our planning processes. Strengthening these longstanding relationships, will keep us well positioned in times of market volatility.
06:51 Our Subsea 2.0 product platform is our most prominent example of industrialization, allowing for the successful implementation of a configure to order or CTO model. CTO has enabled us to create a value stream that delivers a more competitive offering to the market when compared to an equivalent engineered to order product, resulting in a 25% reduction in cost and a 50% reduction in product delivery time. Savings that are both real and sustainable. And we have paved the way for other products to adopt a similar operating muscle enabling an enterprise-wide approach.
07:38 This resulted in three CTO principles, that serve as the fundamental basis of how we operate in this environment. First, we are eliminating design engineering, second, we have redefined our sourcing strategy by utilizing pre-approved suppliers and standard configurations. And third, we are transforming manufacturing flow by leveraging configurable assemblies.
08:08 With CTO, the greater predictability of product manufacturing and high volumes are pre-engineered components has allowed us to completely redefine the supply chain. Removing significant inventory from our balance sheet and cutting up to eight months of lead time. Ultimately, our success is determined by our execution, our client relationships and our contractual arrangements. Project execution remains a core competency and oftentimes a point of competitive differentiation. But it is also dependent upon the partnerships we established with both our customers and our suppliers.
08:53 We are seeing strong support from our customers to ensure we can address their needs both today and throughout this evolving period of increased activity. An example of which is a new framework agreement with Total Energies, that we utilize Subsea 2.0 to address their future technology needs. And we are seeing improvements in contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth, be it through more favorable payment terms or supplier investment and risk sharing.
09:30 In Subsea, we had a very strong start to the year with inbound orders of $1.9 billion and a book-to-bill of $1.5 billion. This included two announced awards in the period. Petrobras is Buzios 6 greenfield development and Wintershall as Maria revitalization iEPCI project. This is our first iEPCI with Wintershall' DEA, an award built on our ability to leverage our iFEED model. Through early engagement we optimize the field layout to maximize the benefits of integrated project execution.
10:15 Our involvement help reduce the project's carbon footprint by modifying existing infrastructure, eliminating the need for an additional 4,000 meters of pipe. Which stands out most in the quarter is the breadth of the inbound, nearly 40% of which came from smaller unannounced project awards, much of which was direct awarded to our company. This is a very diverse source of inbound, these smaller awards in the quarter included projects for more than 30 operators, sourced from all major basins across the globe.
10:56 Beyond project activity, subsea services remained resilient in the quarter despite the impact of weather related seasonality. Activity trends remain favorable and consistent with our view that Subsea services revenue will grow to approximately $1.2 billion this year. With energy security now a clear global priority, both operators and suppliers are working more collaboratively in the current environment. Our conversations with clients today are focused on balancing the need for new and different sources of supply with the challenges of more scarce resources. Be it commodity inputs, skilled labor, supply chain logistics or physical capacity requirements. This increase in constructive dialog supports our view that we are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas.
11:57 Our Subsea opportunity list continues to highlight a very robust market outlook, representing an opportunity set of larger projects that totals more than $20 billion for the industry, led by Brazil, Guyana and West Africa. Looking ahead, we expect increased activity in other regions of the world in order to meet the growing global demand for feed gas used in LNG facilities, the majority of which is supplied by Subsea wells. We expect these volumes to be supplied by increased activity in major basins from Africa to Asia-Pacific.
12:43 We have a strong track record with large gas developments and are well positioned as an agnostic provider of integrated Subsea projects. The expanding LNG market gives us an even greater confidence in the intermediate term outlook. We continue to anticipate Subsea inbound order growth of up to 30% in 2022 with iEPCI, direct awards in Subsea services together approaching 75% of our inbound orders.
13:17 I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results. 13:24 Thank you Doug. Total company inbound orders were $2.2 billion in the quarter driven by strong Subsea inbound of $1.9 billion. Total company backlog grew sequentially to $8.9 billion at the end of the period. Revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, which included a foreign exchange gain of $28 million.
13:53 First quarter reported loss from continuing operations was $0.09 per diluted share, which included after tax charges and credits that netted to an expense of $29 million or $0.06 per share. These charges included the following, expenses, totaling $1 million related to impairment restructuring and other charges and a loss of$29 million, on our equity ownership in TechnipEnergy. When excluding the impact of charges and credits, our adjusted loss from continuing operations was $0.03 per share. The adjusted loss also included the foreign exchange gain.
14:36 Turning to segment results. In Subsea, revenue was $1.3 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $129 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% in line with the fourth quarter. Revenue increased sequentially, primarily due to higher project activity in Australia, North America and Asia, partially offset by reduced activity in Africa.
15:06 Subsea services revenue was largely unchanged from the fourth quarter due to a seasonal impact of weather in both period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was broadly in line with the sequential increase in revenue. In Surface Technologies, revenue was $267 million, down 7% from the fourth quarter. Revenue decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower international activity resulting from our transition to the new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. The decline in segment revenue was partially offset by growth in North America, which benefited from the continued increase in drilling and completion activity.
15:51 Adjusted EBITDA was $22 million at 24% decrease sequentially. Results were negatively impacted by lower international revenue and the impacts of the manufacturing transition, partially offset by higher activity and an improving pricing environment in North America. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.2%.
16:16 Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $30 million, which included $3 million of restructuring and other charges. Net interest expense was $34 million and is expected to decline during the year, as we achieve our stated objective are to reduce gross debt growth and tax expense was $26 million. Cash required by activities from continuing operations was $329 million. Capital expenditures were $27 million. This resulted in free cash flow consumption of $357 million in the first quarter.
16:56 The outflow which we expected and highlighted in February, was largely due to a working capital consumption related to the timing of project milestones and the payment of annual incentives. As discussed, when we provided full year guidance, we expect free cash flow to be weighted to the second half of [Technical Difficulty] major milestone collections throughout the second generation.
17:38 We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and net debt of $802 million. During the first quarter, we sold $17.8 million TechnipEnergies shares for total proceeds of $239 million. In April, we sold our remaining 4 million shares. Following the partial spin-off in February of last year, we retained ownership of 49.9% of TechnipEnergies outstanding shares. We have now fully exited our position for total proceeds of $1.2 billion.
18:19 Continuing with our focus on debt reduction, last week, we commenced a tender offer for $320 million of our outstanding 6.5% senior notes due in February 2026. When combined with the retirement of additional debt maturing in June, we expect to reduce gross debt by up to $400 million in the second quarter. This would imply gross debt of approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter and would represent nearly a $1 billion reduction in gross debt since the spin-off in the first quarter of 2021.
18:57 Lastly, let me provide some thoughts on the second quarter. For Subsea, we expect the second quarter to benefit from the typical seasonal uplift with sequential revenue growth of approximately 10%, driving margin expansion of up to 200 basis point. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue growth in the high-single digits with incremental EBITDA margins of up to 30%. I would also note that our second quarter results continue to be negatively impacted by the transition to our new Saudi facility.
19:33 I will now turn the call back over to Doug for his closing remarks. 19:37 Thank you, Alf. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to reiterate a few key points. First, we are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas investment. In Subsea, we are experiencing improvements in pricing and contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth. In Surface Technologies, we will continue to prioritize technology, integration and cash generation over growth due to the structural changes in this evolving market. And we are confident in a recovery in Surface international orders in the back half of the year.
20:25 Second, the separation of TechnipEnergies is now fully complete. With the final sale of our remaining ownership stake, just 14 months from the date of the partial spin. And lastly, our $1.2 billion cash position and our confidence in generating strong free cash flow in the second half of the year are allowing us to take aggressive steps to further reduce our gross debt, another important milestone on our path for district shareholder distributions.
20:59 Operator, you may now open the line for questions. 21:04 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ian MacPherson of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. 21:29 Thank you very much. Good morning. 21:32 Good morning, Ian. 21:35 Doug, you mentioned 40% or so of your $1.9 billion Subsea inbound coming from your smaller direct awards from 30 or so operators, that just seems certainly unprecedented in recent memory. Is that bucket of orders more reflective of the recent improvement in pricing that you're describing than say the larger orders are, or is your language around price improvement more representative of the entire pipeline of new orders. 22:17 Thanks Ian, interesting question. Let me start by agreeing with you that the breadth of clients both geographically and just the sheer number it was a very strong indication of the offshore outlook going forward and we still had contributions from all the big IOCs and from the NOCs. But what we saw was, just an ever expanding group of smaller independent operators and they're attracted -- they're attracted to the iEPCI model, because it allows them to move projects forward in a very short order. Improving the overall project economics significantly with a company that has a proven track record in delivering these iEPCI projects that we pioneered back in 2017.
23:25 So, in that response you could gather that there is a real value recognition by those clients in that off -- in the offering and the uniqueness of our position within the marketplace. That being said, the pricing is not solely dependent on any one of those groups. It is more general across the board, but we are really, really excited about this ever emerging client base offshore and our ability to capture that is actually quite remarkable. 24:06 Yeah, indeed. And so, so with the improved conditions with pricing in your Subsea business, does that impact your view on the 15% Subsea margins, mid-cycle margins that you described at the Capital Markets Day in November. Does that look like it could materialize sooner than you thought four or five months ago because of the increased volume coming into the market now. 24:37 Yes. 24:40 Okay. All right. Good. If I can ask one more Alf, you mentioned that with Surface 30% incremental margins in Q2, but still with some headwinds from the new facility ramp, would you care to quantify what that impact is, so we can roll forward our thoughts on the second half surface margins. 25:02 Sure, I'll give you some color to that. So, we clearly signaled in the fourth quarter call that we expected an impact from this facility transition. I would say that we signaled at the time that it would be up 200 basis points, I believe it's in that range. The impact that we're seeing in the quarter. And if you are kind of dialing ahead, you think about Q2 performance. I think you need to look at it. I think Surface segment as a function of North American progress where we are seeing the activity continuing to ramp up and continuing to be favorable as well as we mentioned also that we do see pricing and pricing is a focus definite focus for us in the North American market as well.
25:44 But admittedly, the Q2 will continue to be soft on the international side and the Saudi facility was still impact the second quarter. So, really, you will not see the major margin ramp up in Surface until the second half of 2022 and again based on those dynamics of North America, market continuing to do well and we expect to fully, we are taking actions today to be ready to handle all the Middle East orders that we are expecting that will come our way here at towards during the second quarter and onwards. And we are ready for that and we're going to be seeing significantly improving revenue and EBITDA performance in the second half of 2022. 26:30 That's perfect. Thanks very much. 26:36 Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. 26:46 Yeah. Good morning, good afternoon team. I wanted to -- Doug to zero in on some of your comments around pricing improvement and improving terms and contracts. You booked $1.9 billion of inbound awards in Subsea. I was wondering if that commentary was reflective of the order of your -- 1Q order book or is this more on the come and just thoughts on what the margin profile could look like relative to the 11% to 12% guide you have for this year. Would you expect the newer orders to be kind of accretive to that outlook as you work on the path towards 15% margins, as Ian mentioned in that 2025 timeframe. 27:38 Okay. Thank you, Arun. Let me take this opportunity to kind of break down the pricing environment for us between our businesses and globally if you don't mind, in doing so, I'll be able to answer your question. So let's start, two businesses Surface and Subsea. So, let's start with Surface. Two very different markets that we serve in the North American market, the international market. In the North American market, it's almost like a tennis match at this point. It's a constant ballilng, our pricing goes up, inflation goes up, pricing must go up again to maintain that pricing, it's that active. When you go into the international market, there tends to be longer term contracts, frame agreements. And in this scenario, we are actively looking those contracts have pricing mechanism in them, but we are also looking to supplement that with incremental pricing given the current market conditions. Those are ongoing and we would expect to see the impact of those more in the second half of the year.
28:52 Moving to Subsea, there's really two different approaches that are unique to our company. And let me explain those is the 75% in the 25%. So, the 75% is the percentage of our market that is direct awarded. This is through our unique iEPCI offering, our alliance partners, and our services. Here, our clients are truly looking for value creation and are very comfortable and acknowledge the value that we contribute and they want to make sure that we are economically rewarded. So, it is an ongoing discussion in a very comfortable and collaborative environment in which for us to continue to ensure that we are capturing an economic value that is appropriate in what we create, as well as in the environment in which we, the environment in which we exist. The 25% is the open competitive market three bids in a buy, if you will. I hear the returns are improving, but still not adequate. We are addressing this with, I would say an aggressive pricing position, as well as the terms and conditions that I've alluded to throughout my prepared remarks.
30:20 So when we think about how, what does that mean for us knowing that we have the 75% allows us to be very selective in the 25% and allows us to help the industry in general, but certainly ourselves by driving of the appropriate terms and conditions given the current market environment. And that can be an enhancement of the traditional indexes that are, that exist in new contracts today. But it also has to now be able to address supply scarcity. In some cases their supply rationing going on. We need to make sure that we're protected by that in our contracts or what I would call extraordinary inflation, when you have disruptions of the supply chain like for instance what happen to nickel in this last quarter. So, we're enhancing those features within the terms and conditions of our contracts, but it also allows us to simply no-bid contracts. So we have been no bidding billions of dollars of contracts and still recording a $1.9 billion inbound of high quality inbound.
31:31 And just one last comment on the $1.9 billion of high quality inbound. That is absolutely accretive to the margins in backlog, but it is just the beginning, we started and the inflection actually occurred four quarters ago, and I called at the time that our margin and backlogs have inflected and they did inflect over the past year. What we saw this quarter was a greater amplitude of that inflection in a positive direction. 32:06 Great, thank you for that, for that answer. My follow-up is, I wanted to explore a bit more in detail this path to shareholder distributions, your net debt is at just over $800 million, you plan to pay down about $400 million of gross debt in 2Q. But I was wondering, if you could frame how long the path would get, maybe could you give us some sense of minimum cash requirements to run the business and perhaps the timing and how you think about just in the excess free cash flow to shareholders. 32:48 Absolutely. So, first let me kind of reiterate where we -- what we said at our Analyst Day. So we clearly said that we are committed to shareholder distributions. We said at the time that we are looking for the timing of the second half of 2023. Like we said it was dependent upon reaching a certain target capital structure. That target capital structure consists of gross debt of $1.3 billion and cash of $800 million. So in that statement, kind of we think at this moment in time, we need about $800 million to run the business. Now a longer-term, we can get into whether we can optimize that number further, but at this moment in time, that's the target capital structure. So again that's the $0.5 billion of net debt being described here.
33:38 And if you look further out into this year, obviously, we are -- we had a fairly weak free cash flow generation this quarter, but we remain confident in our full year guidance and that implies that we're going to generate more than $500 million of free cash flow over the remainder of the year. And when you take all that including considering the debt reduction. We are going to get fairly close to reaching that target capital structure by the end of the year. Now the exact timing for whether we can accelerate any shareholder distributions from that point on, I'm not going to comment on the specific timing now. But clearly, we are pleased with the progress that we have made with the debt reductions, that were needed to get there and the ones the plans we have right now with the debt. And then we just launched here last week going after $400 million reduction as you said for this quarter. So, we think the path to get towards the target capital structure is to be there -- trying to be there by year-end is kind of where we're targeting. 34:43 Great. Thanks a lot. 34:47 Thank you. Your next question comes from Guillaume Delaby of Societe Generale. You're line is now open. 34:58 Yes. Good afternoon because I guess you are in the UK this afternoon. Two questions. Last clarification, if I may. First, Doug, regarding your comments, regarding the breadth of client behavior. Could you maybe give few color regarding IOCs, if you experience, if you see over the last few weeks -- last few months, a change of behavior from IOCs. And then another question will be for Alf maybe after that. 35:37 Sure, Gil. Indeed it's good afternoon sitting here in our manufacturing facility where we make umbilicals and it's actually a quite a beautiful day here in New Castle. So, thank you for that. In terms of the IOCs behavior, I don't really want to comment on their behavior, other than to say, we've seen -- we have maintained activity both in terms of front-end studies, both in terms of ongoing projects, both in terms of -- looking at greenfield opportunities and brownfield tiebacks to their existing infrastructure, most of which is producing below nameplate capacity and therefore can be the economics are very attractive to be able to do tie-ins and tie-backs and they're very excited about our all-electric offering and the attributes that it brings and our iEPCI offering because of the ability to be able to deliver nine to 12 months prior or earlier than you would if you split the packages and approach it in a more traditional or more conventional business, or contract. So it not necessarily a reaction over the last couple of weeks. Just an ongoing very constructive dialog and very attractive outlook and with our IOC clients who we -- we cherish very much. 37:21 Thank you very much, Doug. So my second question is for Alf. I would like to try to reconcile and sorry about that. So, the timing in terms of cash flow between Q2, where you want to reduce gross debt by $400 million and H2, where do you expect strong positive free cash flow, given your comments regarding Subsea and to a lesser extent Surface technologies in Q2. Should we assume that in Q2 you might already generate some net free cash flow. 38:10 So thank you very much for the question. So, maybe first to start off with, we are sitting at this point in time with about the $1.2 billion of cash flow. So clearly, some of the existing available cash will be the primary source for the debt reduction for the second quarter. In terms of free cash flow generation for this upcoming quarter versus the rest of the year. It's always, even sitting today, it's always a little bit unpredictable to say exactly how much we will get in the second quarter versus the rest of the year, but I would say that we are at least going to be neutral or trending towards neutral in the second quarter, but it remains as I said in the prepared remarks that the majority of the free cash flow generation is going to come in the second half of the year and to be frank, mostly also in the fourth quarter. So, overall, I mean, the main source is going to be our existing cash in terms of the debt reduction that we're doing. 39:17 Thank you very much. So Q2 is an inflection point. 39:26 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chase Mulvehill. Your line is now open. 39:53 Hey. Good afternoon, everyone over there. How is everyone doing? I guess, first question, Doug is when we think about inflation, we get a lot of questions from investors around your ability to kind of preserve margin in your current backlog just given raw material inflation. I mean it sounds like that you're trying to step up the terms of conditions on the projects that you're booking today, but maybe could you talk to your backlog, what kind of terms and conditions you have to be able to preserve margin because obviously inflation on the raw materials is increasing quite a bit. 40:41 Sure, Chase and good morning to you, and welcome to the call. We're very excited to have you on the call. I appreciate your interest in dialing-in. In terms of the existing -- well, let me back up. What I was explaining to the -- response to the earlier question which is given this new world order in terms of the supply chain and some of the very unique situation, situations that have occurred of recent, what are some of the extraordinary actions that we're taking to ensure that those contracts sufficiently address those scenarios if they should reoccur. And that's what I was, that's what my answer was focused on.
41:30 In terms of the existing contracts, I just want to be very clear, we have had a very disciplined approach in our contractual arrangements where we first and foremost at the time that we actually inbound the order, we typically have 80% to 90% plus of the cost committed. So, we have back to back with our suppliers to ensure that those costs are locked in if you will. We also with our clients have escalation clauses typically tied to indices that protect us in terms of an inflationary environment, so those exist today. I think you can see in the performance that we've had over the last 2.5 years now, which is hard to believe that the period that we've been through have been very resilient and I think it has been widely accepted that our ability to be able to manage the inflationary environment has been, I think, I am proud of the team and I think actually quite, quite remarkable.
42:49 But let me talk about a couple of things that are unique to our company because what I've described there, I believe would apply to the majority of the industry. Maybe why in the last couple of years have worked out better for us is this path that we started on many years ago, which was to develop a product platform, that would allow us to change and fundamentally change the way that we operate the company, and that's Subsea 2.0, which led to this configure to order operating model. Chase, in the past every product was unique every project was bespoke, there was no consistency and therefore we were going out to the supply chain on each and every project and asking for something that was just a little bit different than the project before. So, imagine the lack of ability or the strain that it put on the supply chain. Let me put it that way.
43:49 With this new Subsea 2.0 product platform and our configure to order model, we have a standard configurable design. We can take those configurable sub-components and we can align with what we now call our CTO supply chain partners where they have volume assurance and they can not only do they have the ability to be able to properly plan their business, but we then ask them to ensure that we have a consistency of supply. So, if you will, they stock the raw material, were those configurable subcomponents on consignment and then we are able to draw from that as we bring in these iEPCI 2.0 awards. And that's something that is really unique to our company. It was one that technology development, but it was two, you also have to have the volume and the scale, you can't do it if you don't have a significant market position, which we have secured again through the iEPCI our alliance partners which lead to these direct awards give us this, early view and early engagement and like this quarter allows us to book $1.9 billion of inbound, where we only had two announced awards.
45:09 And I just want to clarify, I want to make sure there's no lack of or that we clarify the Yellowtail project in Guyana with ExxonMobil, that we are very excited to have been awarded was not booked in Q1. It is in the final preparation for us to inbound and that will, we will be inbounding imminently most likely in this quarter’s in the Q2 not in Q1. So, it kind of -- it all has to work together Chase. I don't know how else to describe it, but it would be really, really difficult and I think it is very, very difficult for others who haven't made this transformation, this internal transformation, which then also applies to the supply chain. 45:57 Okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate all that color. The real quick follow-up is maybe for Alf. If we kind of, obviously free cash flow was proposed and like a big burn in the first quarter, driven by a big build in working capital, but it's been a few years since I've covered the stock, but I think historically what's happened is when you've gotten large orders you've gotten a lot of prepayments. Now, I guess a lot of the orders were may be smaller orders as opposed to these large orders that you get historically in the past. So I guess maybe when you talked about terms and conditions changing, is this more better more prepayments on some of the smaller orders or what's changing on the prepayment side if anything, as we go forward. 46:50 Yes, Mulvehill. Thanks for the question. So, maybe first just clarify to be really sure when we go backwards in time that obviously there is a big difference between when we had the TechnipEnergies as part of our business versus, versus now, to the size of these advances and prepayments on an individual order basis is going to be smaller in general, but they are still a significant part of what we do and it's correct that when we, when we target new awards, we are always targeting to have what we call it a working capital neutral or better position throughout the life of the project. Now, as you said, this is an area where it has been, maybe going in the wrong direction for us during these tougher times and certainly part of what Doug, described as tightening up the commercial terms and conditions. Looking at the payment structure of our contracts is certainly part of that.
47:40 When you just then look at the advanced payments or prepayments as is column themselves. I would kind of say, they are not necessarily always awarded totally concise -- to coincide with the signing of the contract. So, for some of them that could be dependent on an early activity, some sort of early mobilization, early engineering, early procurement, so you may sometimes see a lag between when the awards are coming and when you actually see some of the impact due to the working capital into the advances. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit, but it's true that this is a focus for us, we look for prepayments and we look for them to be early in the contract, but again dependent on some milestones. 48:29 Okay. All right, Makes sense. I'll turn it back over. Thanks everybody. 48:38 Thank you. Your next question comes from Bertrand Hodee of Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. 48:47 Yes. Hello, and thank you for taking my question. A question on the CTO model you rightly explained at the Capital Market Day last year that volumes is critical to which and delivers a full benefit of the CTO model. Given your outlook for Subsea order intake, when do you think you would be in a position to deliver the full benefits from the CTO model in the coming quarters or when do you think you will be able to do really fully deliver the benefits. 49:38 Thank you. A very intriguing question. So let me start by saying you have to go through the training -- if the -- develop the technology go for the transformation to be able to have the ability to be able to realize the benefit, then it really becomes a factor of two things. One is gross volume and two is, let's call it net volume or the volume associated with the most levered industrial, industrialized product platform that we have, which today is Subsea 2.0 and we started with trees and we moved to controls and we're moving to umbilicals and so it will eventually grow across the whole platform. So it's an ever evolving opportunity set for us and I think that's important that we expect Subsea 2.0 to represent 50% of our inbound, over the next couple of years. So, that's important.
50:45 Well, let me back up. Let's start with the gross inbound. So we've obviously seen the growth in the gross, in the gross inbound since 2019 and we obviously delivered a strong inbound last year of $5 billion. We indicated $6.5 billion this year, we booked $1.9 billion in the first quarter. We had a book to bill of $1.5 billion, something we haven't experienced sense, Q1, Q2 of 2019. So for the past three years. So the growth is stacking up very nicely. Then there is the net or there is the portion of that, that really benefits, mostly from the CTO model, so we're saying 50% of Subsea 2.0 over the next two years. Beyond that, we will continue to expand the Subsea 2.0 product platform across our entire product offering. So, you will continue to build upon that and that is this ever, never ending drive towards industrialization. So, we have a very specific focus on this in the company in everything that we do and we're seeing some real benefits today, but we'll see a cumulative and compounding benefit as we continue to move forward. 52:11 Yeah. Thank you very much, Doug. And a follow-up question on the frame agreement with Total Energies. Total Energies, especially in Angola in Block 17, has many, many tieback opportunity, but I'm not yet convinced by the iEPCI or am I misunderstood, it's a frame agreement Subsea 2.0, but they're are not going yet to the iEPCI concept. 52:53 I don't necessarily agree with you, but I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment. I think I'll leave that up to the customer and when we announce our awards. 53:04 Okay. I was just speculating. I have no view on total choice. I was just thinking that because of the squamous agreement, it was not an iEPCI approach, but I think you for answered my question, telling me I was wrong. Thanks. 53:30 Thank you. Your next question comes from Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Your line is now open. 53:38 Hey, thanks. Just a quick clarification first and I think, I think it's straightforward. But I just want to be sure. The guidance for the second quarter or the outlook for the second quarter was just at the segment level. And if there is any FX, up or down in the second quarter. That wouldn't be reflected in the segment so essentially the guidance you've provided excludes any changes in FX. Is that correct? 54:06 That is correct. 54:07 Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the orders, so 40% from these smaller customers and then in the second quarter you should get some benefit from a higher services inbound and recognition potentially Yellowtail being recorded in that quarter. It would seem that there is a chance you're may be flat sequentially on the order outlook or at least above what would be needed to kind of be on track for that 30%. So, I'm wondering if that, if that's the right way to think about it or if there were some other unusually positive benefits in the first quarter that would cause the second quarter to be dramatically lower. 54:54 We at this point from what we can -- our view of the second quarter will absolutely support the 30% improvement in our inbound orders. So again Q1 clearly does, Q1 times four. I'm not suggesting anything by saying that I'm just saying it clearly supports that. We expect Q2 to be above of 1.0 book-to-bill again. And when we look at the second half, we look at the second half in total to be above 1.0 book-to-bill. So we remain very confident in our inbound outlook. 55:36 Yes. Super. Thanks so much. Doug, I'll turn it back. 55:41 Thank you. Your last question comes from Jean-Luc Romain of CIC Market Solutions. Your line is now open. 55:52 Good afternoon. I was wondering how much of your inbound in the first quarter comes from carbon capture project, is there some or when do you expect your various collaborations for instance with Talos to bring about contracts for you. 56:17 Good afternoon, John-Luc. Thank you for the question. In the Q1 inbound, there was no carbon capture inbound recognized in that number that we provided. That was a pure Subsea number. The projects with Talos are advancing well. The opportunity set is actually expanding and we are well into the feed study on several projects and the level of collaboration and market impact, that -- our relationship with Talos is having we're just really, really glad to be partner with Talos and are looking forward to announcing awards in the future. 57:02 Thank you. 57:11 No more questions. Speakers, please continue. 57:21 This concludes our first quarter conference call. A replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 PM, British Summer Time today.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt, and congratulations on your recent promotion, and your expanded role. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call.
Before I comment on the strong operating results in the period, I want to first talk about yesterday's announcement regarding shareholder distributions. At our Analyst Day in November of 2021, we shared with you what we believe to be in an appropriate capital structure for our company. Since then, we have made substantial progress towards our goal.
In the second quarter, we successfully reduced gross debt by more than $500 million, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated target of $1.3 billion. This targeted capital structure will ensure that we can maintain strong access to credit and allow for continued investment in our business through the cycle.
Given our debt reduction to date, we now have the flexibility to begin shareholder distributions, as evidenced by the announcement of an authorization to repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock. This represents 14% of the company's outstanding shares at yesterday's closing price.
We firmly believe that, our shares are undervalued and that the share repurchase program underscores our confidence in the long-term outlook for our company. Simply put, buying our shares is one of the most compelling investments available to us today. In addition to this opportunistic approach to shareholder distributions, we have reaffirmed our intent to initiate a quarterly dividend in the second half of 2023. Our debt reduction, share repurchase announcement, and reaffirmation of a dividend distribution, are all important milestones in delivering greater shareholder value.
Turning to our financial results, I am very pleased with the solid performance demonstrated in the quarter, and the strong start to the year. Total company revenue in the period was $1.7 billion. Total company adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $187 million, exceeding the expectations we outlined on our first quarter call. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9%. Total company inbound orders were $2.2 billion driving another quarter of sequential backlog growth to $9 billion.
In Subsea, quarterly inbound was $1.9 billion. Inbound for the first half of the year was $3.8 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.4 with iEPCI direct awards and Subsea Services, representing approximately 70% of total orders.
Project awards inbound in the period included ExxonMobil's Yellowtail development in Guyana, where we were given full notice to proceed. The Subsea production system includes 51 enhanced vertical Deepwater trees, as well as 12 manifolds. We were also awarded a new flexibles contract from ExxonMobil for high-pressure, high-temperature risers for the Yellowtail development. And we received a contract from TotalEnergies to supply subsea production systems for the CLOV3 development offshore Angola. This is the first contract under the company's new framework agreement, covering Subsea 2.0 trees for brownfield developments in Block 17.
As previously highlighted, our high volume of feed activity and unique client partnerships, supports our view that the Subsea tree awards for the total industry will likely exceed 350, a level not seen since 2013. In the first half of this year, TechnipFMC has already been awarded 117 trees. This is nearly double the volume we sold in all of 2021 and serves as further indication that the industry is in full growth mode.
Earlier this month, we announced the award of an integrated FEED or iFEED by Equinor for the BM-C-33 project, offshore Brazil. The study includes an option to proceed with a direct award to our company for the iEPCI phase of the project. Upon FID, this would be one of the industry's largest integrated awards to date. This will also be the first time Equinor uses our configure-to-order production systems and further underscores our view that more than 50% of our tree orders will be Subsea 2.0 over the next two years.
And within our new Energy Ventures business, two title energy contracts were recently awarded in the UK. The multi-turbine projects will be capable of delivering 7.2 megawatts, a predictable title energy through our partnership with Orbital Marine Power. This award positions us as the leader in floating title energy.
The first half order trends, clearly demonstrate the strong momentum of the Subsea market. The underlying strength is also displayed in our Subsea opportunity list, which increased by 20% from the first quarter update and now represents an opportunity set of $24 billion for the industry based on the midpoint value of these offshore developments.
It is also important to note that the list does not fully reflect the underlying strength of the market. There are 12 distinct customers represented on this list, most of which have participated in subsea developments for many years. However, our first half inbound was composed of more than 40 operators across all basins, illustrating the growing diversity of our customer base.
Based on our strong first half results, the growing project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanding customer base, we expect full year Subsea orders will be up as much as 40% versus the prior year, above the previous forecast of 30% with orders now approaching $7 billion in 2022.
Moving to Surface Technologies. We are pleased with the sequential improvement in our results. We saw good growth in North America sales and profitability. And we continue to move pricing higher as needed to ensure we earn an acceptable return on our investments. As previously indicated, our results outside of North America were impacted by the startup of our new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. We have now completed the facility audit and most administrative milestones leading to our first in-country orders. This sets the stage for improved financial performance as we ramp production in the second half of the year. Alf will provide more detail on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Now let me close my remarks with a simple message. We are very focused on delivering on our commitments. First, we said we would restore the balance sheet to a more appropriate capital structure. And in the quarter, we reduced gross debt by an additional $530 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we said we would initiate shareholder distributions and we have now made sufficient progress towards our capital structure to do so.
This action has been accelerated a full 12 months ahead of schedule and reflects our view that a balanced approach to debt reduction and share repurchase is warranted, given the significant discount in our share price relative to peers and the long-term prospects of our company.
Finally, we remain focused on meeting our financial commitments in 2022 and beyond. We are very confident that we will deliver results within the full year guidance framework provided back in February. And looking further ahead, we remain confident that our internal initiatives coupled with a strong market backdrop provide us with a clear path in achieving Subsea EBITDA of more than $1 billion by 2025.
I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results. Thank you, Doug. Total company inbound orders were $2.2 billion in the quarter driven by strong Subsea inbound of $1.9 billion. Total company backlog increased 2% sequentially to $9 billion. Revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion adjusted EBITDA was $187 million.
Second quarter income from continuing operations was $2 million, which included after-tax charges and credits that netted to an expense of $6 million. When excluding the impact of charges and credits, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $8 million or $0.02 per share. These adjusted results also included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million.
Now turning to segment results. In Subsea revenue was $1.4 billion, up 10% from the first quarter. Revenue increased sequentially primarily due to higher project activity in Africa, the North Sea and Brazil. Subsea Services revenue increased versus the first quarter due to seasonal improvement, including higher installation activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $176 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%, up 240 basis points versus the first quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 36% sequentially, primarily driven by higher revenue and increased installation and service activity. In Surface Technologies revenue was $303 million, up 14% from the first quarter. Revenue increased sequentially primarily due to accelerated growth in North America which benefited from the continued increase in drilling and completion activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million a 47% increase sequentially. Results benefited from higher activity and improved pricing in North America. Outside of North America, adjusted EBITDA increased modestly due to the impacts of the transition to a new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.7% up 250 basis points versus the first quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $22 million net interest expense was $28 million and tax expense was $20 million. Cash required by activities from continuing operations was $97 million. Capital expenditures were $36 million. This resulted in free cash flow consumption of $133 million in the second quarter.
As discussed when we provided full year guidance, we expect free cash flow to be weighted to the second half of the year, very similar to 2021. Our subsea operations have seasonally higher activity levels in Q2 and Q3, which drive major milestone collections that occur throughout the second half of the year with Q4 being our strongest period of cash generation.
In April, we sold our remaining four million shares of Technip Energies. We have now fully exited our position realizing total proceeds of $1.2 billion since the separation. In May, we completed a tender offer for $430 million of our outstanding 6.5% senior notes due in February 2026.
Gross debt in the second quarter decreased by $530 million to $1.5 billion a reduction of more than $1 billion since the spin-off in the first quarter of 2021. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $685 million and net debt of $790 million.
Moving to guidance, we have reaffirmed our 2022 guidance as all items remain within the ranges previously provided to help you -- to help in your modeling for the remainder of the year, I will provide some additional color on the segment guidance.
For Subsea, we expect both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year to be at or near the midpoint of the guidance range. The third quarter should reflect strong results, similar to what we reported in Q2 for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin benefiting from the continued strong activity and improved margins in backlog.
For Surface Technologies, we expect full year revenue to be at or modestly above the midpoint of the guidance range. Third quarter revenue is expected to increase up to 10%. We also anticipate incremental EBITDA margins to approximate 30% for the remainder of the year.
While North America was the primary driver of growth in the first half, we expect the second half of the year to be led by international markets driven primarily by the Middle East. This will be supported by the ramp-up in production at our new Saudi Arabia facility, in addition to higher activity across the region.
In closing, I will share with you my major takeaways from the quarter. We delivered on our plan for a significant reduction in gross debt in the quarter, demonstrating our commitment to a strong balance sheet.
Importantly, this action has done more than just improve our capital structure. It has provided us the flexibility to pull forward the timing of shareholder distributions, a decision that is further supported by our confidence in the free cash flow generation we see going forward.
Finally, I am confident that the improved operating performance experienced across both segments is setting us up for a solid second half and further improvement in 2023.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Certainly [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Good morning. I guess, good afternoon over in Europe. So Doug, first question just kind of thinking about the macro here and obviously you gave us a good update on the Subsea opportunity list $24 billion.
But if we can look past that a little bit and just think about tieback opportunities, could you talk about tieback opportunities out there? And maybe how much you think that's still left out there? I mean obviously, we've been doing a lot of tiebacks over the past few years. So just trying to understand kind of how much of that opportunity kind of still sits out there. Sure. Good morning, Chase. Actually you raised a really good point. If you look at the Subsea opportunity list, which increased 43% since this time last year and now represents $24 billion, you are correct in pointing out that the majority of these are actually large greenfield projects. Behind that is a significant amount of tieback or brownfield activity that is still ongoing.
I don't know that I'd call it even middle innings. We're still fairly early and there's lots of opportunities. And you can see that in our inbound numbers in the first half, where a large portion of the inbound number is actually coming from unannounced awards, or if you will, some of the smaller awards that aren't always, but are often in that category of tiebacks or brownfield.
So simply stated, it remains extremely robust. There's a lot of activity. It is the shorter cycle part of Subsea and it's one that our integrated model, coupled with our Subsea 2.0 platform, makes us the partner of choice, because we can deliver those projects in 12 to 14 months, which has a huge impact on the tieback opportunities and a reason why we've been, if you will, doing so well in that market. Okay. All right. Perfect. A quick follow-up, I don't know how far I'm going to get with this, but I'm going to give it a shot. But you just said, for 2022, for Subsea margins, kind of, pointing us towards the midpoint for the full year. But obviously, you're booking, some strong backlog, presumably a better pricing, better margins.
So when we look out to 2023, I'm assuming that kind of points to better margins. But I don't know, if you -- if it's too early for you to give any color, I know, you won't be explicit, but just kind of directionally, how should we be thinking about margins in -- for Subsea for 2023? Chase, I would have been surprised if you didn't ask. So, certainly, worth asking. I think it is a bit early to give segment guidance, if you will. But no doubt, the market is setting up very nicely, particularly for us, because of the large portion of direct awards that are a result of the unique iEPCI offering are the large installed base in Subsea services, as well as our partners and the direct awards that we received from our partners.
So we remain very excited about the remainder of 2022 as well as 2023. But I'm going to turn it over to Alf to maybe give you a bit of color, more from a total company perspective than a segment perspective. Yes. Thank you, Doug. And certainly, it's a little bit early to give specific guidance here for 2023. But what we can say is that, we do expect continued revenue growth and that is in both segments. And when we look, maybe, at company EBITDA, we are on track to grow up to 20% based on the progress we've seen so far.
So, for instance, the second consecutive quarter of $1.9 billion of Subsea inbound and the total inbound approaching $7 billion and indeed the Subsea orders continue to be booked at average margins -- in average margins that are accretive to backlog.
And then, when you just quickly glance at Surface, we certainly continue to see continued progression in our Surface margins as well. So that's probably the color I can offer at this point in time. But the takeaway is that, the company EBITDA is expected to go up in 2023 and we are currently saying up to 20%. Okay. Perfect. Sounds good. I'll turn it over. And congrats Matt on the promotion. Thank you, Chase. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I'd like to ask about the profile of the free cash flow and cash generation from here. And specifically, what is different going forward versus, let's talk to the past 12 months, or since separation of Technip Energies. You had a net debt 1Q last year of just under $1.8 billion, is just under $0.8 billion now. So there's $1 billion of deleverage and you've sold $1.2 billion of energy shares. You spent about $250 million of CapEx.
So it suggests roughly cash breakeven over the last 12 to 18 months. And so, could you just take us through the moving parts that changed that profile going forward. Doug or Alf, in terms of your own self-help of your cost versus the market pricing and the pass on cost, one imagines. Everyone's talking about inflation, but, yes, these moving parts as we look forward to this cash generation. Thank you. Yes. No, certainly, thank you. So, first of all, admittedly, Q2 was a bit lighter than expected. We did have some net working capital outflow in the quarter. And if you look at the most specifically moving apart from quarter-to-quarter, it is truly the timing of achieving milestones getting the billings and the collections done in particular for the Subsea projects. This remains our biggest driver for quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.
And similar to last year, we do expect and we do see this in our Subsea profile. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really have the highest activity on Subsea driving through the progress that drives our contract assets and our receivables in Q2 and Q3 and they drive them towards collection in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So we very much expect the same pattern this year.
In terms of why we're confident, we obviously have visibility to all these milestones and the associated collections. So this gives us overall confidence in our guidance. And obviously, again, that's going to be the major driver for the annual cash flow. Now if you look at it more broadly, just talked about that the EBITDA, we expect that to continue to drive forward. We continue to expect to have a favorable ratio between call it the depreciation and amortization profile versus the CapEx. We continue to look at our CapEx to come in -- this CapEx for the year for $230 million, for instance, is probably we have a good chance to come in below that.
But we expect to continue to have that favorable ratio between depreciation, amortization and CapEx and adding new CapEx. So if you remember back to the Analyst Day, we actually said that we would have a range of 3.5% to 4.5% of our revenue to be in CapEx. We continue to see a trend that we are at the lower end of that range. And I really don't have anything that I expect that to drive it up significantly, as we look forward right now. So, those are some of the dynamics and I don't know if that helps you. But maybe Doug wants to add a few words. Sure. Why don't I add a little bit on the cost side Mark to your question. We talked a lot about this at the Analyst Day back in November. A lot of what we have been doing in the company to iEPCI changing the commercial model Subsea 2.0 enabling configure to order, or CTO as our new operating model, both give us significant cost leverage because we can get the benefits of scalability and we're seeing that.
And if you remember back in the guidance we gave and November of last year, which was Subsea margins would expand to 15% by 2025 along with revenue growth, doubling the EBITDA of Subsea that had very little pricing element involved. There was activity there was volume because our revenue was going from $5.5 billion to $7 billion, but we're in a very different environment today. And we're seeing the benefit of all the hard work and the innovation and now the saturation with Subsea 2.0, 50% of our orders over the next two years we expect to be Subsea 2.0 that creates that ability to really start to get that cost leverage. And then on top of that we are certainly in a very different pricing environment than we had envisioned just six months ago. So, net-net very favorable. That is great color. And yes there's a lot on this at the Analyst Day. So I appreciate the follow-on from that. Can I maybe follow up Doug and ask in terms of the Subsea 2.0, is it also a case that you're only just starting to roll out really that -- those types of equipment sets that you've manufactured. Just give us an idea of how many of those you've actually put in place out there in the market? Yes. So 2.0 orders started -- we commercialized at the end of 2017, 2018. Started to get some orders obviously in 2019, and 2020 was obviously a pretty tough year for all of us. And now we're -- the orders are ramping up as indicated. We expect up to 50%.
So if you just add kind of the normal delivery schedule to that, you're starting to see those installations go into place. I don't have an exact count. I actually don't track the exact number of Subsea 2.0 installations if you will, but they are there. They're going well. We've had repeat orders from all of the customers that we've delivered Subsea 2.0. And in some cases like you saw us announce last quarter and then this quarter announced the first call off, we have customers that are now going exclusively to Subsea 2.0 like TotalEnergies decision to do that for their brownfield activity in Angola. So yeah things are definitely moving very favorably and we're very pleased and humbled by the success of 2.0. Excellent. Thank you for the color. I’ll hand it out. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, Doug, how are you? Very well. Good morning, David. Good morning. So order has taken a big leg up here as you mentioned since 2013. So long time since we've seen us. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about your manufacturing footprint, your capacity and how it sits today compared to the last time we saw this. Last time the market really expanded, not necessarily just a number of trees but more where it is, what's changed and your expectations for operating leverage with particularly this configure-to-order model, which I would think would drive quite a bit of that. Well, David you're spot on. And it's actually an intriguing question because in this environment you think we'd be announcing big capital increases and adding more manufacturing capacity, adding more fixed assets. We said we were going to change the way business was done. We were going to develop our model, so that we could drive higher returns and sustainable returns and attractive through-cycle returns.
And David if it wasn't for 2.0 and the ability now to be able to leverage the configure-to-order model would be in a very different situation. So we have doubled the Subsea 2.0, CTO allows us to double the throughput capacity within the same footprint. So we've actually reduced manufacturing capacity roofline, but increased our throughput capacity. That's just exactly what we want to hear and we believe our investors want to hear. And it's what sets us up I believe to deliver a very different results than what is typical at this point in the cycle when companies are increasing their capital budgets to accommodate the growth.
In addition to that beyond the manufacturing you know we've changed the operating model in the industry by partnering with others and using their assets and providing them access if you will to our market, a much of which is proprietary because of the integrated model and the direct awards that we have, allowing them access to that market where we can utilize their floating assets to support our fleet without us having to add additional capacity to be able to service this growth. So this is our approach. We're going to remain very disciplined, but still grow the company, which I think is the best of all scenarios. Just a quick follow-up on the trees. You mentioned 50% were Subsea 2.0. Does that also mean 50% would be the CTO model? Is it kind of -- is that how it works, or… Yeah. That's a great… …will you do CTO on non-Subsea 2.0. Maybe I just got that confused a little bit. No. Thank you for clarifying. And yeah the best way to think about it is 2.0 enables CTO. So CTO equals 2.0. Okay. Thanks. So my other question was on your Surface business. Obviously a really good leverage to the Middle East rig count. You talked about this briefly. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on what's going on in the market right now. We've heard mixed things. It sounds like things are idling. But I would think with the rig counts picking up that you're already starting to see a pretty big pickup in demand on that Surface side and also does that new manufacturing facility in Saudi, does that cover all of your needs in country or do you still have to bring some stuff in? Sure Dave. So let's start with what we believe will be the most significant growth market for us in Surface, which is the Middle East. And it's not just Saudi. It's beyond Saudi. And be it Saudi, be it UAE, Oman, Kuwait, et cetera. There's a significant amount of investment going on in the Middle East today. The facility that we built in Saudi will cover 100% of our needs and Aramco's needs from us. So we will be doing that if you will be fully vertigrated within the country and a similar approach we have in the UAE.
So that's the most significant market for us. We are well positioned -- the -- as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we're on way now in accepting new orders and there'll be a ramp-up. It doesn't happen overnight, but there'll be a ramp-up through the end of the year in being a really strong run rate then for 2023.
North America remains robust as well, not necessarily the same growth potential in our view, but one where there's certainly a limitation of capacity as we've kind of reached -- kind of stretched beyond the resources that are available be it human resources or physical resources within the market. There it's very important to us that we generate returns that are acceptable. And we are -- as a result of that requiring a higher price point higher returns for the work that we're doing in the North American market. Pretty clear. Thanks Doug. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Good morning, Doug. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the pricing dynamic you're seeing within the industry. You mentioned the potential for 350 Subsea tree awards this year. And the one of the things we did note is going back to Schlumberger's call that they noted improving pricing dynamics and the fact that their backlog was growing. And that was going to be a key driver of their second half growth. So just wanted to get some thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of pricing? Sure. Good morning, Arun. So agree with the comments Schlumberger made. I guess the only difference is we're seeing it now. It's not a second half event. It's obviously showing up in our results as we speak. I'm always wanting to point out that -- we -- our objective is to capture a greater portion of the economic value that we deliver to our customers. So we have very long-term relationships many of which are exclusive to our company some of which are over 20 years -- that have been in place for over 20 years. So what we do is we continue to innovate, we continue to differentiate. And as a result of that, if we can create greater economic value for our customers, they are more than pleased to share with us a greater portion of that economic value that we create. So there is no doubt that we are seeing the benefit of that.
And the iEPCI model coupled with Subsea 2.0 unique combination that we offer into the marketplace is allowing us to get that benefit in terms of the share of the economic value. In addition to that, as I responded to an earlier question there's also cost leverage associated with that. So if you will we're capturing it on both ends, but at the same time making sure that we are creating greater economic value for our customers or better project returns we typically do that. Most -- the most direct way we can do that is delivering projects well ahead of what the rest of the industry is capable of doing, which we would not have been able to do without the creation of a single integrated company and the continued investment and innovation -- in technology and innovation as evidenced by Subsea 2.0. So that's what gives us the confidence as we continue to move forward. Great. And my follow-up Doug, is that we've seen a lot of fluctuations in the currency -- the US dollar is obviously appreciate pretty significantly versus the euro. You had a very small currency impact in the quarter, but how should we think about the impact to your business just from a stronger dollar? Sure. I'm going to have Alf comment. Yeah. So maybe just to take it a little bit from the financial statement impact that we actually do have in our company from this. So let's start with the fact that a good portion of our backlog is actually denominated -- coming out of business units that have functional currency different than the US dollar. So that does lead not to an economic loss but to a translation of foreign exchange that in this case drives down for instance our backlog by over $300 million in this quarter alone. So there's a translation impact to the backlog that you see that still is $9 billion in total, but you see that impact.
The other way that that comes through for the same reasons is as you -- if you continue to experience a higher US dollars those non-US dollar revenues and earnings will translate into slightly lower US dollars into their financial statement. So that's the most immediate financial statement impact you will have.
Otherwise, when it comes to our portfolio of hedging et cetera, we are continuing to manage our cash flows, and our balance sheet positions in such a way that we minimize the foreign exchange gains and losses. So you shouldn't see anything extraordinary there.
There is a third point I will make though. There are certain currencies that we cannot hedge, for instance, in Africa and as the African currencies either devalue or appreciate against the dollars you will see an impact in the foreign exchange line also which will create some variance, but those are probably the primary impacts from the dollar strengthening. Great. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit more about free cash flow. So you kept the guidance for the year and that would seem to imply, sort of, $600 million to $750 million of free cash generation in the back half of the year. First part of the question is just wondering if, sort of, the lower end of that range is more appropriate now just given how the first half developed. And then if you could put a finer point on what to expect in third quarter that would be helpful. Okay. Certainly. So first of all, we continue to target the midpoint of the free cash flow. So that's the -- at the point that we still have confidence in that we can be at.
Now what will cause the variation from the low to the high point is really what I kind of mentioned before, it's going to be the exact timing in the fourth quarter or how quickly we reach certain milestones and how quickly they convert to billings and collections by year end. That's going to be the primary driver for whether you end up in the high end or the low end of the range, but we continue to see ourselves having the visibility to reach the midpoint of the guidance, and that's where we continue to guide.
In terms of third quarter, it's -- because of the same dynamics I mentioned, it's always difficult to call the cash flow by quarter with precision, but I will say this we certainly expect to be positive in the third quarter. And -- but to be also be clear we do believe that the bulk of the cash generation is expected to be in the fourth quarter. So that's the profile we still expect for the year. Yes. That's helpful. And then on the buyback in the context of that cash flow progression. Should we be thinking about the buyback more likely to be occurring when you're having strong periods of free cash generation, or are they sort of independent from each other? Yes. So maybe to say it this way. So, first of all, I mean, we're very pleased with our share buyback program announcement now. I mean, it describes how much we're satisfied with the progress we've already had on the leverage and balance sheet. And we really believe this is a question of timing. Also we do believe that the current share price reflects an undervaluation of our company.
And with this in mind, we're certainly going to have a balanced approach going forward where we can take advantage of call it the undervaluation, while also being committed to having a strong balance sheet. So in that mix certainly free cash flow is going to make a difference. But it doesn't mean that we sit completely on the sidelines either as long as the valuation is through where we see favorable economics to do share buyback. Okay. Thank you very much. Our final question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with ATB Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thank you. Doug, just a broader question like we've seen this outlook for offshore improve considerably. Do you think it's -- it is -- the catalyst recently has been the energy security issues, or you think even absent that the trend was always towards increased offshore activity as the cycle unfolded? So -- thank you for the question. I think. it's really important that we are very clear in this response. This is a trend that has been underway and we are just seeing it unfold. So there is not a single catalyst, or a short-term effect. This is certainly, something that has been underway and the preferential investment in offshore for a variety of different reasons, we believe has been building and will continue going forward. Thank you very much. That's very helpful. And just one other question that -- like the supply chain inflation has been -- is a big issue, we're seeing all across. Now your margins have been held up pretty well from the guidance that you've given before. So first of all, how are you managing inflation in your backlog? And similarly, how are you managing your -- the supply chain issues on your throughput, seems to be that you've been relatively immune in your results with all these issues, going across the world. No. So, thank you for the question. And I appreciate the fact, that you recognize that we have managed. And to me, that's something that our shareholders expect us to do. Is it challenging? Of course, it's challenging. Is it real? Yes, it's real. But with a bit of forward planning and the development of relationships, both with our customers as well as with our suppliers, one can use that during these challenging times, to make sure that it's a win-win-win, if you will. And that's exactly been our approach.
We have always stood by our suppliers, even in difficult times that we all went through during the pandemic and our customers have stood beside us. We have lots of contractual and legal reasons, why we are able to do that. But I don't think you should underestimate that. If you don't treat people right, they'll remember that. And they'll take advantage when the opportunity is. But if you just look at where we are in the market today, I alluded to in my prepared remarks, we received 117 trees in the first half of the year. Now we said, 350 for the total year.
So one could ballpark, what is probably the total market and what was our position of the total market. So our suppliers understand that this is some -- this is our core business. This is a business, we're very focused on. This is a business, that if they align with us they know that they're aligning with the leader for today, as well as for tomorrow. And with that comes certain preferential treatment.
And I don't think that it's -- I don't think that it's -- appreciated and that has helped us tremendously and we will continue to operate that company that way both, with our customers as well as with our suppliers. So very proud of the work that our team has done, in building those relationships, sustaining those relationships. And we continue to be very supportive of our supply chain. And again, at the end of the day yes, there's contractual support, but it's really done -- it's just the way that we do business. It's a bit unique. But it has its benefits, as is being evidenced today. Thank you very much, Doug. Appreciate the colors. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call.
Total company revenue in the period was $1.7 billion. Revenue was in line with the second quarter and our outlook, a solid achievement given the foreign exchange headwind experienced during the period. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $200 million with a margin of 11.5%, which excludes a foreign exchange loss. Both Subsea and Surface Technologies achieved sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter.
Total company inbound orders were $1.9 billion. Subsea inbound was $1.4 billion with year-to-date orders now totaling $5.2 billion exceeding the level achieved in all of last year. Project awards inbound in the period included Total Energy's Lapa Northeast development offshore Brazil, where we will install umbilicals and flexible pipe in a new configuration to further secure the production of the field. This award highlights the diversity of work scope and customer opportunity in the region.
We also received a contract from Shell for the Jackdaw development. The project will use our pipe-in-pipe technology for the tieback from the new Jackdaw platform to Shell's existing Share Water Hub supplying much-needed gas to the region.
Additionally, we received an award for the ExxonMobil Gas to Energy Project in Guyana, which will be included in future inbound once the project receives FID and government approvals. This project will enable Guyana to shift a portion of its power generation to cleaner natural gas sourced from nearby offshore fields.
Beyond our announced awards, inbound orders in the quarter reflected strong tieback activity in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and West Africa. During the quarter, we also renewed our technology alliance with Halliburton, where we have demonstrated strong collaboration since the creation of TechnipFMC in 2017. The alliance accelerates the development and commercialization of new technologies that deliver integrated production solutions that span Subsea and Subsurface applications.
An example of this is a digital technology, Odassea Subsea Fiber Optic Solution, which we first introduced in 2020 and has already been deployed in key Subsea developments. The alliance continues to develop innovative and disruptive technologies that can be used in all electric Subsea field development, Subsea well intervention and carbon capture and storage.
Now looking ahead, we are confident that offshore will provide significant volumes of oil and gas with attractive returns that in many cases are amongst the most compelling opportunities available to our customers. Project economics have improved, driven by lower cost and accelerated time to first oil, providing solid support for continued development activity. This is supported by the fact that approximately 90% of estimated Subsea capital expenditures through 2025 are based on breakevens of less than $40 a barrel.
Our Subsea opportunity list remains at a record level. This strong project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanded customer base, give us continued confidence that our full year Subsea orders will be up as much as 40% versus the prior year, with orders approaching $7 billion in 2022. And if we extend the outlook into 2023, we believe orders over the next five quarters will be at least $9 billion.
Moving to Surface Technologies, inbound was strong at $449 million, representing a book-to-bill of 1.4. Importantly, inbound activity in the period benefited from the acceleration of orders from Aramco, a significant portion of which will result in revenue in future periods. The resulting growth in backlog also provides us with increased visibility for continued growth in our international revenue in 2023.
Investment in oil and gas resources will continue, and we are confident that offshore and Subsea will be critical enablers for the energy transition. Opportunities in greenhouse gas removal, hydrogen and floating offshore renewables, including wind, wave and title energy are accelerating. We have made several announcements regarding strategic agreements and partnerships, and we have already achieved notable commercial wins.
We have secured two title energy contracts in the U.K. through our partnership with Orbital Marine Power. The multi-turbine projects will be capable of delivering 7.2 megawatts of predictable title energy, positioning us as the leader in floating title energy, and we have signed the option to lease agreement for the ScottWind in three area through our partnership, Magnora Offshore Wind. The project scope would include the installation of 33 floating wind turbines, which when combined, can provide enough energy to power more than 600,000 homes in the United Kingdom.
Our growing presence in commercial wins in these particular offshore renewable markets are creating new opportunities across an expanding list of potential partners and geographies. We are confident that as the energy transition accelerates, so too will the opportunity set for our company.
In summary, we remain focused on meeting our commitments in 2022. And looking beyond the current year, we continue to see the potential for strong growth in EBITDA, cash flow and returns as evidenced by our stated objective to achieve more than $1 billion of Subsea EBITDA by 2025.
Further demonstrating our confidence in this outlook, we announced a new $400 million share buyback program in July, which we quickly put into action with the repurchase of $50 million of our shares in the quarter. We have also reaffirmed our commitment to a dividend, which we intend to initiate in the second half of 2023.
This outlook is enabled by the fundamental changes we have made to our company and the continued strength in the markets we serve. The next leg of growth in oil and gas will be fueled by offshore in the Middle East. The bold steps we took five-years ago to create TechnipFMC have resulted in a pure-play technology company that is uniquely levered to both of these markets.
Our portfolio of innovative products, solutions and disruptive commercial models has further strengthened our leadership position, and we are now taking full advantage of the market growth that lies ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Alf. Thanks, Doug.
Total company inbound orders were $1.9 billion in the quarter with Subsea inbound of $1.4 billion and Surface Technologies of $449 million. Total company backlog decreased 2% sequentially to $8.8 billion due to a foreign exchange impact of just over $300 million in the period. Revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $200 million when excluding a foreign exchange loss of $14.5 million. Third quarter income from continuing operations was $5 million, which included after-tax charges and credits that netted to an expense of $8 million. When excluding the impact of charges and credits, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $13 million or $0.03 per share.
Now turning to segment results. In Subsea, revenue of $1.4 billion benefited from higher project installation activity in Brazil and Guyana, which was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted EBITDA was $184 million, an increase of 4%, sequentially. Results benefited from improved margins in backlog and increased installation activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13%, up 60 basis points versus the second quarter.
In Surface Technologies, revenue was $318 million, up 5% from the second quarter. We experienced revenue growth globally with particular strength in the Middle East. Adjusted EBITDA was $41 million, a 26% increase sequentially. The increase was primarily due to higher international activity, including the progressive ramp-up in Middle East volume and timing of associated costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8% up 210 basis points versus the second quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $25 million, net interest expense was $31 million, and tax expense was $43 million. Cash flow from continuing operations was $212 million. Capital expenditures were $31 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $181 million in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $712 million. Net debt was $655 million, which was a reduction of $135 million from the second quarter.
In July, we announced our intention to begin shareholder distributions with an authorization to repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock, which at the time represented 14% of the company's outstanding shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million shares amounting to $50 million. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, and we believe that our shares represent attractive value.
Moving to our guidance. For full year 2022, we continue to expect Subsea revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be at the midpoint of the guidance range. In Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at the midpoint of the guidance range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the low end of the range.
Moving to corporate expense. We expect full year expense to be at the midpoint of the range. Taken together, 2022 full year EBITDA is expected to be between $650 million and $670 million. I want to reiterate that adjusted EBITDA guidance does not include the impact of foreign exchange.
Beyond our operating segments and corporate expense, all other guidance items remain within their respective ranges with the exception of capital expenditures. We have reduced our guidance for capital expenditures by $50 million to approximately $180 million for the full year, primarily driven by timing of vessel recertifications.
Now looking to 2023, we are increasing our view of total company EBITDA to around $825 million, and we will give our complete full year 2023 guidance in February. Additionally, we foresee a material improvement in free cash flow in 2023, with our current expectation that we will convert approximately 35% of EBITDA to free cash flow.
In closing, I will share with you my key takeaways from the quarter. First, free cash flow generation improved as expected in the period, totaling $181 million. Second, we repurchased $50 million of stock, taking advantage of the recent buyback authorization to repurchase our shares at an attractive valuation. And third, we remain focused on improving our financial returns. Based on the outlook we have provided today, we see the potential for a 25% increase in EBITDA in 2023 when compared to the midpoint of our updated guidance for the current year.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Dave Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, good morning, Doug. So at your Analyst Day last year, you laid out a number of medium-term targets, including margins for 2025. A lot has changed in the last year. So I guess my question is, have the assumptions around those targets also changed in terms of, say, expected volumes and price? Maybe this is already in those targets, but I'm just wondering if maybe we should now be thinking something higher than the 15% EBITDA margins in Subsea by 2025? Good morning, Dave. Thank you very much for the question. Indeed, the assumptions have evolved in a very favorable way since what is now almost one year ago at our Analyst Day in November of 2021. At that point, there were a few things. Obviously, the commodity price, but also the focus on energy security and the need to accelerate the development of energy sources, all energy sources, but in the immediate term. And that's what we're really seeing in the marketplace today.
With that, indeed, there is a pricing element that then evolves as a result of that. So our -- when we gave the 15% guidance at the time, we were at 10.5% margin for Subsea going to 15% margin. We had revenues growing to $7 billion. We had inbound coming in at $8 billion.
As you heard in my prepared remarks, the inbound has certainly accelerated. Inbound then translates into revenue, which translates into EBITDA. So it is reasonable to assume that the 15% guidance for 2025 could be achieved earlier. And I also emphasize it's reasonable to assume that the 15% margin it is no way an indication that, that is the upper end of our potential for our Subsea business. Right. You're obviously well above 15% kind of life cycle and even just a couple of years ago, so I would imagine you should definitely be able to get higher than that. Doug, kind of a different subject here, but maybe this is a simplification, but it seems like Subsea projects are sort of falling into two buckets these days. On the one hand, we have these kind of larger multibillion dollar projects, integrated projects with majors. On the other hand, we have these smaller [indiscernible] tree jobs that are often with an independent. My question is what's better for FTI. What would you prefer? Would you rather have one large integrated project? Or would you rather have several smaller ones that make up that same size? I was just wondering if you could maybe compare and contrast the two. And would you expect higher margins in the smaller projects? Dave, that's a very astute question and one we contemplate often is we're looking at what opportunities we're going to pursue or for that matter, what opportunities we do not pursue. We -- the size and the scale does matter and you always want to kind of have a balance of the two where you have some larger, longer-term projects, but obviously benefiting from supporting those with the smaller, shorter cycle projects as well.
If you look at really what's transpired over 2022, you can see that those smaller projects are really becoming a significant portion of our inbound. And historically, I would say it almost doubled the historical rates for that matter. And you saw it again this quarter. We only had two announced awards, neither of which were very large. They were not -- they were large but not very large. And we posted $1.4 billion of inbound, which tells you that, that underlying market for those smaller projects as well as our Subsea services business continues to grow and be very robust.
Now the kind of the prioritization that we look at when we're working through opportunities is, first of all, partner. We always treat our partners with making sure that we have the capacity to be able to serve their needs. And as you know, we have a significant number of partners from the largest IOCs in the world and many new operators that are emerging in the market today and making up that group of the smaller orders with 40-plus different operators that we're not working for.
The second one is iEPCI. Clearly, we believe the way that we can generate the greatest value for our customers is by improving their subsea project economics. The best way to do that is to use -- to do it through an integrated project or our iEPCI model, which typically can save nine to 15 months or - shorter time or accelerate oil, first oil by approximately one year, and that is a material implication obviously to the project economics.
The next is 2.0, 2.0 for us and for the industry for that matter is quickly becoming the standard. So 2.0 is what - when I say 2.0, I know you know, but for everyone on the call, that's the next generation of subsea architecture that is unique to our company that we introduced into the marketplace a few years ago. It's now the majority of our orders. It's certainly almost all of what we're doing in terms of our early engineering studies and the market is rapidly moving in the direction of 2.0.
That allows us to create leverage and move into a, configure to order or a CTO model versus an ETO model. This is very important for us in terms of ensuring that we're capturing a fair and representative portion of the value - economic value that we create. So it's really that combination. So when you see us announce an iEPCI 2.0 for a partner, well, let's put it this way. You shouldn't be surprised to hear us announcing a lot of iEPCI 2.0 for our partners because that opportunity pipeline is very rich for us right now. Sorry, Doug, if I could just sneak one more in here. You talked about 40 customers earlier this year. I guess the question is when you look out over those next quarters. Are those 40 customers ordering again? I guess that's what I'm kind of wondering about is, is it just a one - I guess there's a concern is it just one and done or do you need to keep backfilling this with smaller - are those going to be repeat customers I guess that's the question? Look, most of these have taken on either existing leases or developing new leases, and they all have multiyear, multi-project opportunity set. Okay, thanks Doug Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Yes, Doug, I wanted to start. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on perhaps some of the near-term and longer-term implications of the much-needed consolidation that looks to be taking place in the subsea space and thoughts around what this means for FTI? Sure, Arun good morning. Thank you for the question. We had a vision seven years ago of what the market needed to really make subsea projects, the most attractive economics in our customers' portfolios, which we believe we've achieved today. We put that into - initially studied it through a joint venture where we worked on the front end. And then we consummated the relationship five years ago, creating the only integrated subsea company.
So as far as we were - as far as we're concerned, that is behind us, and that's what we're benefiting from and the market is benefiting from and our customers are benefiting from, and that's what's most important. In terms of further consolidation in the subsea space, that's really not - that's not something we'll be participating in. But we don't need to because of what we've already created.
And we talked a minute ago about Subsea 2.0 and configure to order, that also allows us to double the throughput capacity through our facilities. And if we're able to double the capacity through our facilities, there's no need to consolidate or buy more of the same. There's just no advantage for us to do that. Instead, we invested in the technology and the development of the technology that allowed us to really optimize and double again our capacity.
And then, as you know, on the vessel side, we're developing very important relationships with companies like Allseas and companies like Saipem that we built a vessel ecosystem where they can benefit from participating in our integrated projects, and we can benefit from having access to their vessels. So as far as other consolidation, I think - it clearly is a validation that the Subsea market is both strong and very durable.
I think it's acknowledgment of the integrated commercial model, again, that we pioneered and introduced five years ago. And then finally, these things are what is driving potential market realignment around this new reality. Great. And just my follow-up, a few essentially blessed the street EBITDA number for 2023 at $825 million street, I think, just around that number. I did want to see if you could give us a little bit more color around the fourth quarter. Midpoint is slightly below - the Street, maybe that seasonality. I'm wondering if you could give us - just some thoughts on any impacts in terms of 4Q, even the 2023 looks to be bang on where the streets at? Sure. I'll do that. So first of all, you are right that we reiterated guidance for Subsea at the midpoint, and we did indicate that surface would be a little bit lighter on the full year guidance for the EBITDA. If you look at Subsea first, it was a strong quarter for us. We had high installation activity, and we also had some completion on several key projects that kind of took a little bit of an advantage for us in the quarter.
And when you take that into consideration, this timing of project completions as well as some of the seasonal slowdown that, is kind of more normal for the Subsea as we see a slowdown both in installation and services activity. That's kind of what is impacting the Subsea business. So that - in summary, that's why full year guidance is still intact, but you see a little bit of a shift between Q3 and Q4.
We have some similar dynamics going on in Surface where we had a good quarter with strong margin performance, but we do have some timing of certain expense that we expected to land in the third quarter, and that now is landing in the fourth quarter. So again, that's why full year guidance, not a lot of change, but there are some dislocations between Q3 and Q4, as you correctly point out. All right, thanks a lot. Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi good morning or afternoon if you are in Europe. I guess a quick follow-up on some of the discussion around kind of the unannounced orders. Obviously, it was pretty strong this quarter. It looks like it was kind of in the $1 billion range. And the last time you kind of hit that was kind of pre-COVID and you kind of did that in the back half of 2019. But I guess maybe kind of a couple of questions?
I guess, first, could you talk about the mix of that kind of $1 billion of orders this year between kind smaller SPS and vessel-based and some other stuff. I know that you announced the title energy stuff. So I'm not sure how material that was?
And then could you just talk to kind of how sustainable this $1 billion level is of unannounced orders and if that's kind of the new run rate. And if it's not, then like how should we think about the run rate of unannounced orders over the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks Chase. Always a little more difficult to forecast the unannounced awards because they are - sometimes they come at us and very short order timeframe versus obviously the larger awards that are going through a tender process and you have a bit more visibility. Many, many of these smaller awards are direct awarded to our company. And some of those are actually customers that we have that have moved to our Subsea 2.0 standard.
That are basically, if you will, building trees on specs so that they have those available so that they can benefit from very short cycle tiebacks in the period of 12 to 14 months, which is half the time it has taken historically to do that type of work, and they get a huge benefit. So what I would say is this quarter was probably a bit stronger than I would expect in future quarters, but we had a similar quarter back in Q2.
So it is definitely moving in that direction. And remember, it's a combination of these smaller awards, but also the strength of our underlying Subsea services business. So certainly, it's going to be stronger than in the past, but I would say that this level and maybe a bit elevated to what I would model going forward on a more average basis. Okay, perfect. Unrelated follow-up, I just want to kind of talk through some of the FX impacts. There's, obviously a few components here. I mean, obviously, you point to the FX in some of the cost here, but the $14.5 million is just balance sheet translation as I understand it, not cash. But there's, also a couple of other translation FX impacts that I just kind of want to ask. Backlog, it looks like there was some negative backlog translation?
And then obviously, you've got the EBITDA, which is a function of revenue and cost translation. So maybe could you just kind of talk to what the revenue and cost and ultimately EBITDA translation impact was if you have that in the quarter. And then what FX rates should we be focused on as we kind of look forward and think about revenue and cost translation? No, thank you for the question on this topic, so first of all, the $14.5 million, which you correctly characterized mostly that is unhedged positions on cash or asset positions that are denominated in a currency that we cannot really hedge. So that's where the majority of that is. There is also an element of some increase in cost of hedging as the volatility in the market and the higher interest rate environment we're in, it's impacting some of that and creating some fluctuation.
But then going to your second topic of backlog, that's clearly the biggest impact for the quarter and this is true for both revenue and backlog. When you think about Subsea, we do have a large portion of our revenue denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. And as the dollar moves in one direction or another, that does impact our top line as well as our earnings, as you point out. So the backlog impact was $300 million a little bit north of that.
And - but maybe to quantify the numbers that you might be looking for in the revenue and earnings, I would say that it's around 5% impact if you look at Q2 to Q3. And obviously, going forward, we are more balanced at the current level. But - so that's 5% on Subsea revenue and EBITDA, basically. Okay. Just could you close the loop on that and just as we look forward, what FX currency should we be focused on when we think about hopefully maybe positive translation over the next 12 months, but who knows? Well, I'll say this. First of all, we don't take a view on where the currency is going. So it's important. So basically, we recalibrate our forecast based on where we land with the rates at the quarter end, basically. So that's - you can kind of say that that's the jump-off point for looking forward, what are the rates at the end of this quarter. Okay. I was just trying to figure out which currencies you were mostly exposed to so we could track those? Okay. Well, so let me go back then to Subsea again. The major currencies that we're exposed to is real in Brazil because we have a large portfolio in Brazil and as well as Norwegian kroner and some pounds, a little bit of euro, but mostly Norwegian kroner and pounds. Okay perfect, thanks Alf, thanks Doug, I'll turn back over. [Operator Instructions] Guillaume Delaby with Societe Generale. Your line is open. Yes good morning Doug, good morning Alf. Just maybe a quick question regarding the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. do you see as a consequence of this new legislation, some intensification with your clients. And to what extent should we expect a positive move on your CO2 activities over the next quarters given this new piece of legislation? Good afternoon Guill, look, the real impact it has on our company is on the second portion, which is what you mentioned, which is the carbon capture sequestration opportunities. As you know, we've developed an integrated carbon transportation and storage system. We highlighted that back at our Analyst Day a year ago. It has been fully qualified.
And again, I want to emphasize the, believe that for carbon transportation and storage, we can just ""reverse the flow"" is simply not the case. It's going to require a very specific set of equipment and, in many cases, designed to a much different standard than we use in traditional oil and gas development. So we're there. We have it. As you know, we've developed the technology.
We built our partnerships, where we're working with Talos in the Gulf of Mexico and others in other places around the world. But in reference to the IRA, I'll highlight the relationship with Talos and the impact it has on the 45Q regulation, which we believe is very favorable and will certainly help accelerate the development of the various projects that we are working on at this time so. Okay, I'll turn it over. Mark Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open. Hi thanks. I wanted to first ask about the $9 billion of awards over the next five quarters. Can you tell us how much is subsea services? How much would be unannounced and how much would be large? Thanks, Mark. I appreciate the question. We don't really break that down. We have an idea that Subsea Services typically comes in that one, two range. We've indicated that we want to grow the inbound of subsea services to $1.5 billion by 2025. Going all the way back to Dave's original question as other metrics that we laid out at that time or mouse [ph] or objective, that too may be achieved earlier than 2025. But you kind of have a range there on the Subsea services.
And in terms of the unannounced awards, as we talked about earlier, I think you want to try to find kind of a midpoint between some of these peak quarters like Q2 and - yes, Q1 and Q3, Mark. And kind of versus where we have been historically, the historical average, I'd probably go to the midpoint kind of in between the two of those.
But look, let me be very clear the $9 billion, we have a clear line site. I'll repeat. We have a clear line of sight. The vast majority of that will be direct awarded to our company. This is the magic, and this is what makes us so proud of our company. Great, thanks for that Doug. And I guess maybe just related to that, as I think about the - that order rate was above what we had in our model. It seems to be above what is reflected in consensus however, the guide that you're giving for 2023 is essentially in line with consensus?
Is there - is that the FX that we were talking about before with Alf? Is there conservatism in there in terms of backlog conversion? I just would have thought that there'd be some upward bias to the outlook if you've got such strong orders? So Mark, I just want to make sure I'm following your questioning. I'm talking about the inbound orders. That doesn't really translate in the current year. That takes some time for it to translate into revenue and EBITDA. But what it shows is obviously, we've got the backlog coverage already pretty much for 2023. So when you think about it, it really sets up 2024 and beyond. Got it, super. And then just one more, if I could, for Alf on the CapEx here, any thoughts on what's embedded in that 35% conversion for 2023? And how we should be thinking about CapEx longer term? Sure, so CapEx, obviously, first it's - this year, we are - have experienced a little bit lower run rate than normal. So that's an important statement. You saw us take down the CapEx guidance by $50 million from $230 million to $180 million. But CapEx in fourth quarter is still going to be around $85 million. The vessel certifications that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are taking place in the fourth quarter rather than earlier in the year as we plan these activities around our operations.
But looking ahead, really, we remain very focused on managing our capital intensity. And when you look into 2023, we are really still committed to being at the low end of the range that we have expressed before, which is really 3.5% of revenue. So we feel very comfortable that we are - we have reached a place where the capital intensity is simply lower in our business than it has been historically. And I think that's really what's so unique about how we've changed our operating model where we wouldn't be able to do that. We'd see CapEx levels increasing quite dramatically. But with the vessel ecosystem that we've developed and with the benefit of the CTO, we can stay at that low end of the range. Yes, great thanks so much guys, I'll turn it back. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. Thank you, Jack. This concludes our third quarter conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to Matt Seinsheimer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Mr. Seinsheimer, please go ahead. Thank you, Jack. Good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to TechnipFMC’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued earlier today can be found on our website. I’d like to caution you with respect to any forward-looking statements made during this call. Although these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding future developments and business conditions, they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.
Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. It is clear that we are in the midst of a multiyear growth cycle as evidenced by the continued growth we experienced across our company in 2022. Inbound orders for the full year grew 20% to $8.1 billion, driven by Subsea inbound of $6.7 billion, which increased 36% versus the prior year. The strength of the inbound resulted in 24% growth in Subsea backlog to $8.1 billion at year-end. And as we will discuss in a moment, we anticipate further growth in 2023.
For the full year, total company revenue grew 5% to $6.7 billion, while adjusted EBITDA improved to $670 million when excluding the impact of foreign exchange, an increase of nearly 20% when compared to the same metric in the prior year. These results demonstrate continued improvement in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in both operating segments and reflect our strong commitment to deliver on our financial objectives. In 2022, we also materially improved our financial position. We generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $194 million for the year and gross debt was reduced by nearly one third.
At our Analyst Day in 2021, we announced our intention to begin shareholder distributions in the second half of 2023. Given the significant valuation opportunity we saw in our shares and the steady progress made in reducing our outstanding debt, we accelerated the time line by a full 12 months with the authorization of a $400 million share buyback program in July. We immediately put the plan in action and repurchased $100 million of our shares by year-end. We also remain committed to a quarterly dividend, which we intend to initiate in the second half of this year.
Looking beyond 2022, we remain confident in the strength of this up cycle and continue to believe that international markets will lead the next leg of expansion. International can largely be defined as offshore and the Middle East and TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of this growth. More than 90% of our revenue is generated outside the North America land market, and we have leading positions that are geographically levered to many of these important growth markets.
Focusing first on offshore. Our Subsea opportunities list, which highlights larger projects with the potential for award over the next 24 months, continues to represent a record level of potential project activity amongst an expanding customer base in all major offshore basins. The average project size on this list has grown to nearly $750 million, driven by momentum in large greenfield activity. In addition to these more visible opportunities, we continue to forecast strong tieback activity in major markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and West Africa, many of which are direct awarded to our company.
We have announced several projects totaling $1 billion for the first quarter, a solid start to the year. These include Aker BP’s very first iEPCI project, a direct award for the Utsira High Development in Norway. This award further highlights the growing list of clients, who are choosing the benefits of our integrated commercial model. We expect to see a material increase in the value of iEPCI awards in 2023, leading to a record year for integrated project awards. And as our installed base continues to grow, we are forecasting a further increase in Subsea services activity. When taken together, we expect direct awards, iEPCI and Subsea services to represent more than 70% of our total inbound in 2023.
While the strengthening offshore activity is likely to be our primary driver of revenue growth, we also expect significant investment to continue in land-based resources, particularly in the Middle East. Here we have a strong market position and we have expanded our footprint to further leverage our in-country talent in markets such as the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have commenced work on our ten-year framework agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to provide wellheads, trees and associated services. We also completed the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in Saudi Arabia, which will support our commitment to develop a diverse and capable local workforce as part of Aramco’s In-Kingdom Total Value Add program and Saudi Vision 2030. We continue to believe the Middle East represents one of the largest market opportunities this decade.
Let me now discuss how this market view impacts our company outlook for 2023 and beyond. Alf will provide more details in his remarks, but the headlines can best be summarized as follows using the midpoint of our guidance range. In 2023, we expect full year inbound orders for Subsea to exceed $8 billion, an increase of at least 20% versus the prior year. In addition to the strong project pipeline, we see Subsea services inbound increasing to $1.3 billion. Moving to revenue. We anticipate total company results of approximately $7.5 billion, an increase of 12% versus the prior year. We anticipate similar top line growth for both segments. However, we expect nearly all of the growth in Surface Technologies to come from international markets, which represented just over half of the segment total in 2022.
Before I turn the call over to Alf to discuss the specific changes, let me first provide context for these material revisions to our prior forecast. One of the primary topics at our Analyst Day in 2021 was the upside potential for Subsea margins. The key drivers we outlined at that time are still in place today, increased operating efficiency, including the transition to the configure-to-order operating model, an inflection in backlog margin, increased utilization of plants and vessels, and a stronger contribution from Subsea services. However, we find ourselves today in a very different market environment, one that reflects a clear focus on energy security. This new environment has also led to a more collaborative approach toward resource development. The strength of our customer relationships, particularly those of our alliance partners will prove to be of even greater value as the increased volume of work leads to greater project and partner selectivity.
We have also seen greater alignment in contract terms and conditions, where customers see the value in working with a technology provider that has demonstrated time and again the ability to deliver projects on time and on budget. The comprehensive capabilities of TechnipFMC are unmatched and well suited for this environment. iEPCI and Subsea 2.0 create differentiation, but more importantly, they create value and greater certainty of outcome. They are also supported by ongoing initiatives focused on industrialization within our company that will likely result in even greater efficiencies over time.
In summary, we closed 2022 having delivered on many notable achievements. We enter 2023 with a strong market outlook and a further step-up in our targeted financial performance. Our revised 2025 outlook encompasses our most current view. It reflects the improved environment, the value we can bring to the marketplace, and the operational momentum we see within our business. We now expect $25 billion of Subsea inbound through 2025 for our company. And with this, we expect 2025 will demonstrate significant progress on our path to much improved financial returns. Most importantly, 2025 does not mark the endpoint, but rather a major milestone on a more ambitious journey ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Alf. Thanks, Doug. Total company inbound orders were $1.8 billion in the quarter. Subsea inbound was $1.5 billion, putting full year orders at $6.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus the prior year. Surface Technologies inbound was $327 million in the period with full year inbound of $1.3 billion. Total company backlog increased 6% sequentially to $9.4 billion. Total company revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $158 million when excluding a foreign exchange loss of $37 million. The fourth quarter adjusted loss from continuing operations, which excluded after-tax charges of $6 million was $21 million, or $0.05 per share, and it included the foreign exchange loss.
For the quarter, we delivered results that exceeded our expectations for both segments, allowing us to achieve the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Cash flow from continuing operations was $566 million and capital expenditures were just over $63 million, resulting in free cash flow of $503 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $194 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. Net debt was $309 million, which was a reduction of $346 million from the third quarter.
Now let me turn to shareholder distributions. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased shares amounting to $50 million bringing the full year total to $100 million. This means that we have completed 25% of our share repurchase program in just five months. We repurchased shares at an average price that is 25% below last night’s close. And for the full year, we distributed just over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, while still improving our financial strength. As we have demonstrated in 2022, we are fully committed to returning cash to shareholders, and we continue to believe that our shares represent attractive value.
Let me now move to guidance. In his prepared remarks, Doug spoke to the breadth of the market strength and our outlook for further order growth. This is yet another tailwind that we will – that we expect will translate into stronger financial results for our company in 2023 and beyond. We have provided detailed guidance for the current fiscal year in our earnings release. I won’t speak to each item at this time. However, I will provide context around a few items, including our expectations for Q1 results.
Let me begin with Subsea. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate revenue of $6.1 billion at a margin of 13%, which results in adjusted EBITDA growth of 26% for the full year. This also assumes continued growth in Subsea services. As a reminder, in Subsea, the first and fourth quarters of each year typically experienced weather-related seasonality that negatively impacts installation and services activity. Conversely, the second and third quarters benefit from a seasonal uplift of vessel-based activity, which drives both revenue and margin higher. In the first quarter, Subsea results should continue to reflect this seasonality with both revenue and margin, essentially in line with our Q4 results.
For Surface Technologies, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate full year revenue of $1.375 billion at a margin of 13%, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 30% versus the prior year. We anticipate revenue growth will be driven almost entirely by international markets. Our continued ramp-up in activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the first half of the year should result in international revenue growth of approximately 20%. Our North American results will be impacted by actions taken to eliminate underperforming locations and product lines across the region, which we estimate will negatively impact total segment revenue growth by approximately 4 percentage points in 2023. More importantly, we expect these actions will have a favorable impact on profitability.
Looking at the first quarter, we expect total segment revenue to decline by approximately 10% sequentially, with decremental EBITDA margins of approximately 30% versus the fourth quarter. Beyond the segments, we anticipate full year capital expenditures of $250 million, just over 3% of revenue. And finally, we are guiding free cash flow for the year to a range of $225 million to $375 million, the midpoint of which is more than 50% above the prior year, reflecting the improved EBITDA as well as higher conversion of EBITDA to cash.
Now, I want to give an update on the intermediate-term financial outlook that we provided at our Analyst Day. Within Subsea, we now see the following for 2025. Inbound orders totaling approximately $25 billion from 2023 through 2025. This would include Subsea services inbound orders of approximately $1.65 billion in 2025.
Revenue of approximately $8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. Additionally, we expect to convert 50% of total company EBITDA into free cash flow in 2025. All other guidance items pertaining to our 2025 outlook and normalized framework previously provided remain unchanged. When comparing this revised subsea outlook to our 2022 adjusted results, this would be a 650 basis point expansion in Subsea EBITDA margin in just three years and result in Subsea EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion.
Our current view of financial performance in 2025 also reflects a project mix that will continue to evolve over the next few years. In our earnings call presentation, we have included a chart that outlines the revenue scheduled from our current backlog as a percentage of total expected revenue in both 2023 and 2025. For 2023, we anticipate 64% of revenue will come from our existing backlog. For 2025, that number is closer to 11%.
I would also point out that much of this backlog was inbound before the inflection of the current market environment. The key takeaway messages here is that our EBITDA margin in any one year reflects the layering of projects and services that are inbound over time. As implied by the chart, the 18% EBITDA margin we anticipate for 2025 will still be negatively impacted by legacy project backlog. And even more importantly, we are not suggesting that 18% is the highest margin we can achieve in Subsea. We remain confident that there is upside to this number beyond 2025.
In closing, I will share with you my key takeaways. First, we delivered on our most important financial commitments for the year, notably the profitability targets for Subsea and Surface Technologies as well as total company free cash flow. Second, we have initiated guidance for 2023 that at the midpoint of the range demonstrates a higher level of margin expansion and cash flow conversion than in prior year. Third, we have accelerated our plans to distribute cash to shareholders we repurchased $100 million of our shares in 2022, and we intend to continue the buyback program in 2023. We have also reaffirmed our intention to initiate a dividend in the second half of this year.
And finally, we have updated our intermediate term outlook for 2025 to reflect the impact of the current multiyear cycle that is more robust than we had envisioned back in 2021. Our leverage to the key drivers of this cycle, offshore and the Middle East markets and our ability to further improve the economic returns of our company.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. Hey good morning Doug. It must be nice to have three years of visibility in your back pocket now. A big change from the fall of 2021 when we put out those interim guides. You talked about it a little bit. I was wondering if you could kind of really dig in a little bit more into kind of what drove the expansion of the Subsea margin guide in 2025. Is this primarily kind of a function
of the higher throughput and the leverage of your modular configured-to-order model? You think – you’re saying about 70% of iEPCI awards today or I’m assuming that’s also in there.
And then secondarily, I think we just touched on it about the backlog that I think you said 11% of backlog in 2025 or 11% of revenue in 2025 is from backlog today. So is this factoring in pricing on these projects? Or maybe just kind of can you just help me understand kind of some of the components behind that, please? Thanks. Sure, Dave. Good morning. It’s – if we reflect back on how we got here, maybe to start, six years ago, we embarked on a journey to make offshore energy development, the investment of choice for our clients while fundamentally changing our operating model. We are now experiencing the results of that journey, and that’s a combination of a few things. First and foremost is the market adoption of Subsea 2.0. We had previously said that we expected Subsea 2.0 to be approximately 50% of our inbound in 2022 and 2023, and we now see that expanding even further in the coming years.
But keep in mind, not all of that inbound is flowing through the plant today. So if we look at our Subsea 2.0 deliveries, it’s a bit less than 25% of what we’re actually delivering today, which will obviously go towards 50% in the coming years, which gives us great confidence as a result of our ability to be able to shift to the modular build as you referred to or what we refer to as the configure-to-order operating model. This model continues to demonstrate significant benefits to our operating efficiency and to our profitability.
And then in addition, is the adoption of iEPCI, as you pointed out, which by the way, is not in many times, also include Subsea 2.0. The iEPCI awards continue to increase. We stated that this will be the record year for iEPCI. And we also, when I look at the FEED work, the front-end engineering and design work that we’re doing, which sets up the future years, the percent of FEED work that we’re doing on iEPCI, which we call iFEED, is at an all-time high. Those iFEED projects lead to a direct award to our company for iEPCI. That is a proprietary opportunity set that is not available to the rest of the market. And I emphasize that that’s at the highest level that it’s ever been.
So it’s a combination of these things, and clearly, the market focus on energy security, that gives us great confidence. But when we look at the 2025 guidance that we just updated today, a material increase from where we are currently of an additional 650 basis points of Subsea margin, it’s these factors that we’ve been working on for half a decade that we’re now seeing the benefits from that create sustainable change, and we are not beholding to further pricing improvement to achieve these – the updated 2025 guidance. So, I guess when we look at that visibility on the $25 billion in Subsea orders over the next three years, I was just trying to think about this as kind of the analogy of the last cycle. Maybe something like 2007 or 2008 when you had this much visibility on your business. I guess what I’m curious about is when you think about that order book for the next three years, how does that compare to the prior cycle in terms of, say, the customer type, the size of the projects, you just talked about this as IOC [ph] this didn’t exist in 2007, 2008. And obviously, there’s been a huge industry kind of structure has really changed with Aker coming out of the market and whatnot. Can you just kind of talk about kind of how different that is, what it looks like in the next three years? Dave, this – we talk about this all the time. As a matter of fact, I was talking to our gentleman who runs our research, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain organization just this morning about this. The fundamental change – and by the way, we’ve never experienced this before. when you point to the prior cycles, both in terms of the volume, the $25 billion, but the visibility, which is to your question.
We have always had a very robust planning cycle, as you would expect us to, to ensure that the projects that we take on are the right projects, we have the right resources so that we can continue to deliver to our clients projects on time and on budget. And I’ll point out, even with this significant growth that we’ve experienced, we’ve not seen a deterioration in our on-time delivery performance. And that’s what makes our customers comfortable to continue to direct award us even more work. But we’ve taken that planning horizon, which was always 24 months, it’s actually 48 months now, Dave. And that what’s really fundamentally changed, and I’ve never seen this in my career.
Our customers are booking not just the current greenfield project, but the future greenfield project. They want our capacity. They want our 2.0. They want our iEPCI and they trust us to deliver. And in this period of not only focusing on energy security, but also supply and capacity security, they’re now booking well in advance greenfield projects, and that’s visibility we have not had previously. Are these smaller companies than you think last cycle? We think about the last cycle is all dominated by the IOCs. Is that starting to shift? Are you seeing – I think you said before that you had something like 40 different customers in the first half of last year’s orders? Are you continuing to see that kind of broadening of that customer base? Sorry for squeeze in one more question here. Sorry, and I’ll be brief. Indeed, we’ve actually seen that unique customer now to expand to over 50, but it’s – the discussion I was having earlier actually applies both to some of the new clients, but also some of the most established largest clients who are also focused on ensuring that they have the capacity – secure our capacity for their future projects. Thanks a lot, Doug. Appreciated. Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Yes, good morning. Doug, I wanted to maybe follow up on David’s line of questioning and really just talk about the longer-term outlook in 2025. Doug, as you know, energy investors have been somewhat skeptical of long-term guidance, but I know you guys have been thoughtful over the years. But I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how the sausage was made in terms of the forecast, just to give us confidence that you can achieve what looks to be a pretty significant upgrade in what you told us versus November of 2021? Sure, Arun. Good morning. We’re – I think have a reputation of being extremely conservative. We also have a reputation of achieving our guidance or exceeding our guidance, particularly when we talk about our view of the market, be it in whatever capacity, our inbound or tree forecast or whatever it may be. And we took the same approach. I mean, the approach clearly hasn’t changed. What has changed is the visibility to the earlier – to my response to the earlier question. And it’s quite unique, Arun.
And so there’s not like a big, what we would call a to-be-found when you’re doing a forecast, you have named projects, you have your Subsea services, you have your call-offs from your alliance partners that you know they’re going to do a certain amount of field rejuvenation, which, by the way, is increasing significantly and/or brownfield tiebacks. And then you have a kind of a to-be-found bucket, if you will, we’re not relying on that when we’re giving this guidance. This is projects that you see on the Subsea opportunity list or kind of more importantly, for our company, projects you do not see on the Subsea opportunity list which is a set of proprietary projects where we’re doing those integrated FEED studies, which will result in a direct award to our company when they achieve project FID. That’s super helpful. My follow-up is just on the cash conversion update where you expect it to increase to call 50%, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about what is driving that? And just future plans for the free cash flow, I mean you’ve guided or provided an outlook for $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2025 that would push you towards about $700 million of free cash flow. You guys will have a, call it, a net debt – no net debt at the end of this year. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on just the future uses of that free cash flow and the drivers of that
stronger free cash flow conversion rate. No, thanks for the question. And maybe let’s start with it in a very simple way for 2025. We are clearly going to grow profitability and EBITDA at a higher pace than some of the other factors that goes into the free cash flow statement. And what factors do I talk about? I talk about things like corporate expense, interest expense and even CapEx. All those items are not going to grow at the same pace as our earnings growth. So – and if you combine that with, call it, a neutral type of working capital outlook in that number, that’s kind of how you get to 50% roughly for 2025. Great. Then if you look ahead at where we are in terms of – we obviously like our position a lot, as you’ve heard from the first couple of comments here in the call. But we’re, first and foremost, happy with what we have achieved in the past year. We have achieved largely achieved what we set out at Analyst Day to be our target capital structure, which we said was $800 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We reduced debt by over $600 million here in the past year. And this really position us for the shareholder distribution acceleration that really we could accomplish through the share buyback program in July.
And as Doug already said, we are committed for the dividend in the second half. Now when you look at our cash position, it’s obviously going to continue to be a favorable outlook in the light of this – in this forecast, but we will also remain committed to maintaining, first of all, a strong balance sheet but at the same time, delivering strong shareholder contribution. That’s going to continue to be our focus. And in the short term, we would say that we’re retaining the flexibility here with our share buyback program, where we really think we have the best opportunity to return value to our shareholders. Great. Thanks a lot. Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Yes. Good morning. Good morning, Scott. Doug, I wanted to stay on the 2025 guidance. And if I just look at what that implies for return on capital looks to be in the mid-teens, which is certainly solid. But just given the evolution of the industry, the appetite for your integrated model, you should be less of a price taker going forward. I’m just curious, as you step back, and think about the next few years. I’m curious how you think about what a normal return on your portfolio should be just kind of given the evolution of the business? It’s a great question, Scott, and welcome to the call. Indeed, mid-teens is in line with what we are looking at, a substantial improvement from where we are today. And again, I really want to emphasize the actions that we’re taking in this long journey that we embarked on six years ago was to improve our customers’ offshore Subsea project returns while at the same time, creating a unique and different operating model for our company that would drive a much improved through-cycle return as well, not just a peak cycle return.
And so what are some of the things that we’re doing, we talked about Subsea 2.0 and integrated projects. But if you also look at the level of capital expenditures that we’re deploying today in our company are far less than what we would have done on a historical average. That’s because of the additional efficiency of Subsea 2.0 as it flows through our plans.
But it’s also – we’re really good at partnering. We work well with others. That’s in the DNA of us as individuals as well as us as a company, be it our clients, be it our suppliers or even being people at time we might compete against and at other times cooperate with. And that’s the development of our ecosystem for our fleet.
So it allows us to be able to have access to world-class vessels, many of which are within our own fleet, but those also that are outside of our fleet and have unique capabilities and enhance the overall capabilities of our combined fleet by working with companies like Allseas and Saipem and we couldn’t be more proud of that. We see ourselves as we continue to have the market success we are we are willing and ready to partner with others as well as we continue to grow this market together.
So being able to grow it with a much different mentality, which is one around really focusing on the returns and really focusing on sustainable returns through cycle by being disciplined in the investments that we make create the opportunities that Alf just talked about, which is greater shareholder distributions. Got it. Would it be fair to say you’re not satisfied with a mid-teens return. Is that fair? I would just throw that under the same bucket as my closing remarks in my script, which was along the line of, this is only a midpoint on our journey. We have a much more ambitious journey ahead. Got it. Appreciate the color, Doug. Thank you. Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Your line is open. Hey Doug, how are you? Great, Kurt. Good to hear you voice. Yes. Good to be on again. So Doug, you really raised the bar again and putting out data points for 2025 and before you know some people are going to be asking you for your views on 2030. So just get ready for that, okay? All right. No, so First foremost, like I’m kind of curious here when you kind of talk through what kind of drives, driving your customer decision-making process, you kind of referenced your delivery and performance as a key element.
You mentioned energy security. But when you look at those factors and maybe even drive in the cost element, how have those conversations with the customer evolved? And how do you – which one of those three, how would you rank how your customers are valuing those three components, right, between delivery, energy security and kind of continuing to kind of take down the cost of developing these offshore fields. And how has that changed, I think, over the last couple of years? I would say the first two are obviously dependent upon each other. But if I had to put them in an order, I would say energy security and then supplier security or capacity supply securing capacity, they’re somewhat interchangeable in some conversations, it actually starts with securing our capacity, but it’s obviously it’s fundamentally underscored by energy security.
And then it really comes down to certainty and execution and confidence because our customers are putting great trust in our company, a significant amount of their capital spend. with arguably some of the most complex and complicated work that they do to ensure that the world has a reliable and affordable energy supply. So we start by just being really humbled by that. And it’s phenomenal to be in this position.
And then when you go into a direct award discussion, which is not the normal a mode of operation for many of our customers. And in some cases, we’ve been in that situation for now almost approaching three decades with individual companies, it’s just an honor and we remain humble. Our success is our client success. Our success is the project’s success, and that’s what we stay focused on.
And I think as long as we do that and we can continue to deliver simplification, standardization and industrialization around what we do. You have to be the leading technology provider. You have to have the proven track record in terms of delivery, and you have to have trust built upon deep intimate relationships. And that’s what we do, and it’s unique to our company, and I couldn’t be more proud to be part of it. Okay. Great. Appreciate that color. So obviously, a lot of attention well spent on the Subsea part of the business. So I’m kind of curious on the Surface, right? You mentioned international be about 50% or what’s 50% of your revenue in 2022. And you’re going to see the bulk year growth coming from Middle East going forward. So maybe extrapolate that. These are long-term projects with all these customers who have had long-term investment horizons. Where do you think the international mix could be come 2025? Kurt, you’re asking the international mix as a portion of the total Surface Technologies? Yes. Yes. Okay. Look, it’s going to grow, and it could grow materially. We don’t see the North America market growing much over that period, certainly not in the short term. It’s hard to have a long-term view of the North America market. But clearly, in the short term, our view is with the consensus, which is rig activity is likely to decline, completions activity maybe grow but grow modestly. So we’re not expecting much growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, although we expect Surface to grow in line with Subsea in terms of revenue growth year-over-year, all of that growth will come from the international part of the business, not from the North America land part of the business for our Surface Technologies group.
Kurt, to maybe personalize it a little bit and demonstrate where our focus is. I spent last week in the Middle East. I had the pleasure meeting with our key customer, Aramco, and spending time in the Kingdom. And observing the investment and the results of the investment that we’ve made in our – increasing our manufacturing capabilities in local content in country. This is the path forward. We fully support that. And we’re very, very excited about the opportunities for our business in the Middle East. Great. I appreciate that color. Maybe if I could sneak in one more on the shareholder return. How do you guys think about the split between, say, dividends and share repurchase as you’re kind of setting that strategy for the second half of this year? No. Kind of maybe as I alluded to, really near term, we are seeing still the opportunity, as we said in our prepared remarks, we think our shares are still in a valuable capital allocation to pursue. So definitely, the share buyback program is giving us the most near-term flexibility to really execute on. And at the same time, we remain committed to the second half dividend as we talked about, but I don’t see us accelerating that, but rather staying with the current setup with the share buyback program. Okay. I guess – thanks for that. I think my question was like, are you going to think 50% of your free cash of that where you’re going to allocate to the share return is going to go to dividend, the other $50 million share repo? Or I was just kind of curious about how you’re thinking about the mix. I think we don’t have a specific decision for the year on that yet. But clearly, this is a priority for us to get this right, and we are continuing to manage our the balancing between maintaining our strong balance sheet, but yet being very focused on generating or driving shareholder returns. That’s great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open. Hi, thank you. I guess one thing that some people have asked is around this order outlook that you have. Certainly, you have a lot of visibility into what customers are asking you for. But are there other bottlenecks in the industry that are worth monitoring, for instance, maybe topside assets availability on things like that, that would need to happen in coincidence with what you’re providing? Hey Marc, thanks for the question. Absolutely, it’s something we focus on constantly. As I mentioned, I was in a conversation with our manufacturing head this morning. Look, it would be naive to say that there aren’t supply chain risk, there aren’t execution risks. But this is what we do. We do it really well. But we do it differently than we have done it historically.
And in the past, when you sold the industry, and I’m going to speak broadly on the industry, and I’m going to say we were absolutely part of that, when you saw projects being delivered 12 months late, projects being delivered 100% over the budgetary cost. It was a result of the bespoke manufacturing mode that we were in. We are the only company that for seven years ago, started developing a new product architecture that we now call Subsea 2.0 and is now, as I said, up to 50% of our orders.
This allows us to go to this configure-to-order model. It also allows us to be much more synchronized with our supply chain. So much like our customers that I talked about earlier, we treat our suppliers the exact same way. They treat us as partners. In many cases, direct award partners, in many cases, exclusive partners. We do the same with our supply chain. So we have that same intimacy with our – with the supply chain and with the configure to order, they don’t have to wait on an engineering drawing.
In the past, every single part and if you’re not – if you don’t have Subsea 2.0, it’s still that way today. Every single part comes with a set of engineering drawings. Can you just imagine the disruption that, that causes not only for your own manufacturing but for the supply of parts and machine – part of your raw materials and/or parts rough machine parts to your manufacturing. So it’s a trickle-down effect. It works extremely well where we now have suppliers who know they can trust us. They know we’re the market leader. They know we have the capacity.
We have the forward planning now, as I said, we extended it from 24 months to 48 months with orders that we can actually give them that visibility, and they don’t have to wait on an engineering drawing. In some cases, they on their own are now machining and stocking parts on our behalf because it’s beneficial to them from a flow and a cadence, and it’s obviously hugely beneficial to us from a working capital and from an accelerated on-time delivery.
So this configure-to-order model has fundamentally changed our company. We couldn’t have done it without the foresight and the tenacity to develop the 2.0 product architecture but we’re just beginning to see to really reap the benefits of it today. As I said, the majority of our tree deliveries are not Subsea 2.0 flowing through the plant today, but that will ramp up over the coming years. Okay. Great. Thanks Doug. I guess the second one I had is more for Alf but on the – just on first quarter, if you could help us a little bit with free cash. And then as we think about the progression of results for the balance of the year, just so that maybe we don’t get over our SKUs on the rate of improvement in second quarter. It’d be great to just hear whatever steer you’re able to share about how things play out beyond first quarter? Sure. Absolutely, we’ll do so. So if you start with the – just start with the fourth quarter, we obviously had a very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter as we had advertising as we had planned, but it’s still over $0.5 billion is a big cash flow quarter for us. Now having said that, as you may know, and if you have followed us, we’re going to follow a very similar pattern to our cash flow generation as we did in both 2021 and 2022, but in particular, in 2022, where we start the year with the first quarter of being a very weak – very weak start to the free cash flow generation.
And just to penciling something you can probably look at last year’s results and say that it’s going to be in that neighborhood probably. So we – that’s just the normal seasonal profile that we have, and it’s largely tied into the achievement of milestones and customer billings and collections associated with our Subsea business and some of the seasonality that we mentioned around the Subsea business, which then brings me to maybe the revenue and the EBITDA evolution for the quarters.
Subsea very much will be, as we said, and in line with fourth quarter type of quarter because we are in a seasonal low season right now as we sit here today. While we will definitely see a margin pickup any revenue pickup in the second quarter and the third quarter should also be very strong, a little bit of a tail off in the fourth quarter, but maybe not going all the way back to first quarter levels, but – so that’s really what I see in the Subsea.
I think Surface is a little bit of a different story where we have a little bit of a lower activity this quarter after a very strong revenue quarter here in the fourth quarter. But we will see an uptick both in revenue and EBITDA. The margin contribution will improve as we go forward in the quarters. And it will, as Doug kind of said about it overall, it will be driven by Middle East and our ability to convert more and more orders, both with Aramco in Saudi Arabia and with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi.
And – but overall, call it, a more gradual approach to how it works for Surface rather than to say that there will be a huge step up in Q2 and then keep stepping up from there, but rather a little bit more gradual. Super. Thanks so much. I’ll turn it back. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Seinsheimer for closing remarks. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call.

Good morning and good afternoon and thank you for participating in today’s earnings call. Our second quarter results reflect both strong operational performance and the achievement of several financial commitments.
Subsea inbound orders were 4.1 billion in the period representing a book-to-bill of 2.5. We delivered strong sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for both Subsea and Surface technologies, including a 420 basis point increase in Subsea to 14.4%, the highest quarterly margin since 2018.
Free cash flow was 103 million in the quarter and just yesterday we provided two updates to our plans for shareholder distributions. With the first being the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the second announcing the doubling of our previous share buyback authorization to $800 million. Alf will cover these updates in more detail. When taken together, these successes demonstrate that we are clearly focused on what we believe to be the most important drivers of shareholder value.
Continuing with total company financial highlights in the quarter revenue was 2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was 254 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9%, when excluding foreign exchange impacts.
Total company inbound for the period was 4.4 billion. Total company backlog ended the period at 13.3 billion. Subsea backlog grew 29% sequentially to 12.1 billion, of which 81% will be converted into revenue beyond the current year.
I would like to take a moment to highlight the quality of the inbound secured in the period. Subsea orders included six integrated projects, including the direct award of our largest iEPCI to date a contract from Equinor for the BM-C-33 development in Brazil year.
Year-to-date, iEPCI has accounted for more than 50% of our order intake. We continue to expect iEPCI to achieve its highest ever inbound in 2023, enabled by a record level of iFEED activity that often converts to a direct award. Importantly, 70% of our orders are expected to come from a combination of iEPCI Subsea services and all other direct awards in the current year.
In the second quarter, we continued to drive further adoption of our Subsea 2.0 configurable product platform. Equinor was the first to adopt the integrated project model and on the BM-C-33 project, they will be utilizing both iEPCI and Subsea 2.0.
Also in the quarter, we were awarded our fifth consecutive contract by ExxonMobil in Guyana this time for the URO development, which will also utilize Subsea 2.0. And finally, last month we signed a 20-year framework agreement with Chevron, under which TechnipFMC plc will provide Subsea 2.0 production systems for gas field developments off Australia's Northwest Coast.
As evidenced by the addition of three new adopters in the second quarter more and more clients are recognizing the benefits of our configured to order product portfolio which reduces engineering complexity, shortens lead times, and improves certainty and project execution.
With a strong inbound success in the period, Subsea orders for the first half of the year totaled 6.7 billion, and today we are increasing our full-year outlook for 2023 Subsea orders to reach nine billion.
The backdrop remains very strong. The feed pipeline continues to expand with more projects in advanced stages moving towards FID. Our Subsea opportunity list, which only extends out 24-months, remains robust with an opportunity set of more than 23 billion based on the midpoint value of these Subsea developments.
And while these projects are typically available to the broader market, the strength of our outlook is predicated on our unique view into the offshore market. This is evidenced by the fact that over the last 10 quarters, only one-third of our inbound orders came from the opportunity list with the other two-thirds being the result of a proprietary set of project and service opportunities that are unique to our Company.
And as anticipated, we have seen increased activity in Subsea services. In the quarter, we announced an award from Equinor Riserless Light Well Intervention services. This contract provides us with scope that extends out to 2025. It is also important to note that our order outlook assumes little to no benefit from new offshore frontiers.
And even without this optionality longer term visibility is improving. Our clients are securing capacity today for project inbound that extends execution all the way out to 2030. These are among the many tangible signs we see that support our view that this will likely prove to be a very extended market cycle. And even more importantly, it speaks to the level of confidence, our customers have in our ability to safely deliver their projects on time and on budget.
In closing, we have strategically placed ourselves in a very differentiated position. More than 90% of our total company orders and revenue are generated outside the North America land market. We are fundamentally changing the way we operate our business to ensure that we create greater value for all stakeholders, and this is clearly being recognized by the market, given the continued adoption of iEPCI and Subsea 2.0.
In fact, the quarter represented the highest level of inbound activity for both iEPCI and Subsea 2.0 in our Company's history. We look forward to sharing future milestones with you as we continue on our more ambitious journey ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Alf discuss our financial results. Thanks Doug. Revenue in the quarter was 2 billion. EBITDA was 254 million when excluding, foreign exchange loss. The impact of the previously disclosed legal settlement and restructuring and other charges.
Operationally, we delivered strong sequential results. In Subsea revenue was 1.6 billion, up 17% from the first quarter. The increase was largely due to higher project activity in South America, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
Services revenue also increased when compared to the first quarter due to seasonal improvement, including higher installation and intervention activity. Adjusted EBITDA was 234 million with a margin of 14.4%, up 420 basis points from the first quarter.
Results benefited from the higher revenue, improved margins in backlog and increased installation in services activity. In Surface Technologies revenue was 354 million, up 7% from the first quarter. Revenue increased primarily due to higher activity in the Middle East and North America.
Adjusted EBITDA was 47 million a 16% sequential increase. Results benefited from higher revenue and improved operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.3%, up 110 basis points versus the first quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was 154 million excluding a non-recurring legal settlement charge, totaling 127 million corporate expense was 27 million. The non-recurring legal settlement charge in the period was related to the resolution of all outstanding matters with a French National Prosecutor's Office.
As previously disclosed technique, TechnipFMC is responsible for 195 million of the legal settlement. The charge represented an increase to the existing provision to now reflect the value of the total liability. Net interest expense was 30 million and lastly, tax expense in the quarter was 43 million.
Cashflow from operating activities was 156 million. Capital expenditures were 53 million. This resulted in free cash flow of 103 million in the quarter supported by solid customer collections. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalence of 585 million. Net debt was 844 million.
During the quarter we repurchased 3.6 million shares for $50 million. Under the buyback program put in place one year ago we have repurchased a total of $200 million of stock at an average price of just below $12 per share.
Moving to our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect Subsea revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in line with the second quarter. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue to be in line with the second quarter with the potential for modest improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. For full-year 2023 we expect Subsea revenue to be modestly above the midpoint of the guidance range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint.
For Surface Technologies, we now expect full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly above the midpoint of the guidance range. For corporate expense we still expect to land at the midpoint of the range. When considering our revised outlook, we now anticipate the range of outcomes for full-year adjusted EBITDA to approximate 880 million when excluding foreign exchange.
Lastly, there is no change to our free cash flow guidance of 225 million to 375 million for the current year. This includes a 27 million cash payment that was made in the third quarter as part of the legal settlement. The remaining portion owed will be paid in roughly equal installments over the first three quarters of 2024.
Looking further ahead, our 2025 outlook calls for significant growth in EBITDA from current levels, which we expect will translate into strong growth in operating cash flow. Let me take a moment to discuss how we think about the allocation of that capital.
First, there is the investment in our business. As we have stated before, we will maintain a disciplined approach to new investment. We have demonstrated for some time now that the strategic assets we own today can be managed and maintained in a capital efficient manner.
We have established a long-term target for capital expenditures of 3.5% to 4.5% of revenue, and we continue to believe that the changes we have made to our operating model will allow us to remain at the low end of this range, even in the current period of growth.
Now, I will focus on shareholder distributions. We believe that returning capital to our shareholders should be viewed as fundamental to any investment thesis for TechnipFMC. In 2022, we initiated a $400 million share repurchase authorization, and yesterday we added an additional 400 million doubling the authorization to a total of 800 million.
As I stated earlier, we have completed $200 million of share repurchases under the authorization to date. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment to a dividend announcing a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, which equates to a 1.1% annualized yield based on yesterday's close.
When the dividend and buyback are taken together, we are committing to distributions that will exceed 60% of our annual free cash flow generation through at least 2025. We also expect shareholder distributions to grow in line with or better than the growth in total company EBITDA in 2024.
While there is potential for the dividend to grow over time, our current expectation is that the majority of distributions will come from share buyback as evidenced by the significant expansion in the repurchase authorization.
The final component of capital allocation relates to the balance sheet. We remain committed to achieving investment grade metrics and we are confident that our current financial plan can achieve that.
The strength of our balance sheet today allows us to be more focused on capital investment and shareholder distributions. At the same time, we will retain the flexibility to reduce net debt. Importantly, this capital allocation framework is not aspirational, it is a commitment one that is supported by changes to our business and execution models, both of which are driving sustainable improvement in our financial performance.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. So the massive Subsea order intake this quarter sort of speaks for itself in the wake of all the offshore FIDs we saw this quarter. So just curious in your view that incremental billion dollars that you are looking on the order outlook this year. Are these orders being pulled forward, kind of compared to what you were expecting or are these on top of what you internally forecast as it relates to that three-year order outlook that you provided earlier this year? Thanks. Thanks Dave. I appreciate it. I think that is an important that we clarify. The strength of the first half is obviously exceptional including this quarter, which was truly exceptional. Not just in quantity but in quality. And that is why I really tried to emphasize that in my script. We continue to be very selective. We are humbled and honored to be in a position to do so. And we clearly demonstrated in the prepared remarks the quality of that inbound in the quarter.
As we look forward, we remain deeply committed to the 25 billion by 2025. There's no concern, if you will, about things being pulled forward. We are very confident, even more so obviously, but remain extremely confident in the 2025 outlook for 25 billion by 2025.
What's kind of unique about the strength of the first half of the year is it is actually enabled us to take a view of 2024, which is a, I know a bit earlier than we normally would, but I'm actually going to let Alf share the good news. Well, thank you Doug. Yes, clearly the strong Q3 inbound, which primarily really will impact revenue in 2024 and beyond is going to be very beneficial for us to move forward with an outlook here. So this is an early look.
So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our updated company guidance for full-year 2023 is approximately 880 million of adjusted EBITDA excluding the foreign exchange component. And that implies roughly a 30% growth versus 2022.
So now if you take that and look into next year, and given the strength of the first half of inbound and given, how much of that will actually impact 2024 and given how much, how the quality of that inbound and how much that helps the margin embedded in the backlog, my confidence in our ability to successfully meet our commitments. On top of that, I believe we can deliver growth in adjusted EBITDA of 35% in 2024. So that was actually where I was going. My follow-up question I guess is sort of related to this. I'm just curious about manufacturing utilization and, and how that might change in the next coming 12 to 24-months. And maybe you just answered part of that just with the surge of orders in the first half of the year.
Doug, I think you said 70% of the inbound this year is Subsea 2.0 or somewhere thereabouts. Even if the orders - even if the peso orders were to slow a bit in the second half, I'm just wondering, would you expect to be kind of close to full utilization or at least what you would consider optimal manufacturing utilization. How about the back part of 2024? Just sort of thinking about Subsea margin progression lighter the higher than expected throughput next year and into 2025? Sure, Dave. So, we laid out already our ambition for 2025 to take Subsea margins all the way to 18%. We updated that I think just a couple of quarters ago. Obviously having these high quality orders and one way that we define that is, as you just described, which is Subsea 2.0, gives us that greater confidence.
And it is not only the confidence to be able to achieve the margins, but also to be able to take the volume and give our customers the confidence to be able to give us the orders because they have seen the profound change that Subsea 2.0 or the configure-to-order operating model has had on our company.
And they have all been on this journey with us. The vast majority of them have spent considerable time within our facilities. They see what it does to the pace and the cadence and the throughput, which is what really allows us to be able to continue to enjoy the success and have confidence in the road that we are on. And I will always repeat what we said here a few quarters ago, which are these are major milestones, but they are just major milestones and a more ambitious journey. Understood thanks dough. I appreciate it. Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open. Doug, I wanted to get your thoughts on just the quality or mix of orders that you are seeing this year, you now expect 70% of your orders to be integrated services, direct awards or subsea services. And I just wonder if you could talk about how the market is evolving for Subsea 2.0? And how does the favorable mix - how does that impact your thoughts on your 2025 margin guide of 18% in Subsea? Thank you, Arun. Clearly, the market has spoken both in terms of Subsea 2.0 and in terms of iEPCI, both setting a record this quarter iEPCI now achieving 50%. It is quite remarkable. And again, we remain very humbled with the level of confidence and trust that our clients put into our company.
These are major projects, but they do so because of the company that has been created and because of the operating model that exists. Their greatest focus is on ensuring quality capacity within the industry.
And we have demonstrated time and time again to them through - this isn't the first quarter or first year that we have been doing this. We have been doing this for a few years now, to where they really have all enjoyed the benefits associated with our new operating model and our ability to be able to give them the confidence that we will be able to deliver a project safely, on time and on budget, and that really remains the primary focus for them.
So look, I think the 70% is a phenomenal metric. And it is one that is unique to our company, but it is one that we cherish, and it is one that we don't see any reason that it is going to vary in any great degree from that 70% because, again, our journey is not done.
And everything that we are talking about today, we are well into the next generations of the way of the operating model as well as the innovation and the technology that we are bringing into the market, both for the traditional energy, but as well for the new energy market.
So high level of confidence, Arun, it just gives you that much more certainty because you know what you are putting through your facilities, you know the work that you are performing. And it is not just us, it is our supply chain which we depend upon their performance and they get the same benefits as we do from this high-quality inbound. Great. My follow-up, Doug, I was wondering if you could describe what you are seeing in some of the emerging offshore basins more exploration-driven Patrick at Total had some positive comments on Suriname, and we did note that you raised in your subsidy opportunity list the potential project size to over $1 billion in Block 58. So wondering if you could give us a sense of what you are seeing in some of these emerging deepwater basins. Suriname, Namibia, et cetera? Sure. I mean that is - we can add South Africa, Tanzania, Colombia, the Eastern Med resurgence in Mexico and Mozambique, all, if you will, to that list. The first two being ones that there's a lot of eyes upon being both Suriname and Namibia important to note that in our $25 billion inbound objective, it is really not depending upon these emerging basins, which give the strength to the what happens in the latter part and into the next decade, which is when these projects will continue to add it to a significant level of subsea opportunities going forward.
Look, I don't have any unique and I certainly wouldn't share - be respectful of our customers who speak often about their exploration and their focus area. I think if you just follow kind of the exploration activity and the rig contracts that are being taken on I would consider that to be a level of enthusiasm and is certainly attractive enough to draw the capital into those basins.
We remain very focused. Our intent is certainly to treat those basins and to create early success as we have done in Guyana and Mozambique. And that is by working very closely with our partners, building upon our long-term relationship and bringing them something that is unique and different from the rest of the market, and that is the iEPCI 2.0. Great, I will handle it back. Thanks Dough. Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. You just had a monster quarter in orders and raised your guide for the year, but this doesn't include any 2.0, which you have talked about could be I believe, over $8 billion in orders through 2030. Can you talk more about this product? When do you think an order can be received and maybe how conversations are going with customers? Sure, Luke. Thanks. Actually, it was a pretty big quarter for us in terms of our milestone on the journey. We have been working through a joint industry program with all of the major players that you would expect and they are actually working with us on a standard all electric system that will provide them the - will fulfill the opportunity set that they need.
At the same time, and I talked about this maybe a quarter - this - maybe last quarter or the quarter before, but what's really drawing our attention is the CC U.S. or, in particular, what we call the integrated carbon transportation system, where we will be taking from the emitter and taking the CO2 offshore and injecting it Subsea, which would certainly be the most favorable way to do it, both from an ESG point of view and from a social point of view as well.
So the CO2 market is really looking like it is going to benefit from our configurable [eCO2.0] (Ph), as we call it. It is a tree that is designed to be unique for that application, and we are seeing several opportunities for that at this time as well.
The benefit we have is we have over 600 systems installed using our all electric technology, mainly around the valve actuation. So they have been in the water a long time. They have been tested for a long time. They are the industry standard. So we will be able to build upon that as we build out the complete subsea all electric architecture.
And I do want to include our relationship we have with Halliburton in that as well because it is also about providing electric controls in the wellbore as well that don't rely on electric hydraulic, which then we can go to an all-electric system.
So I think what we have put together between our own technology and that with our partners is quite unique. And we continue to be excited, not only again for the traditional energy, but also for the CO2 market when it comes to all electric systems. Alright, great. Thanks Dough. Kurt Hallead with the Benchmark Company. Your line is open. So Doug, yes, I wanted to maybe get a little bit more insight around this competitive moat that FTI has been able to develop with the Subsea 2.0 as well as the iEPCI, et cetera. And you kind of heavily emphasize the amount of business that is coming in because of that dynamic. So how much of a competitive moat is that how long can you sustain it?
And what are the key factors for an oil company when they are deciding to kind of go with what you are doing? Is it economics related? Is it execution related? Just wanted to give a little bit more color because I know the real - you got a lot of opportunities here extending out into the end of the decade. And clearly, the oil companies find a lot of value in what you are doing. So just looking for more and more color on that. Sure, Kurt. So first and foremost, we are extremely respectful of our competition and respect what they do. We have chosen to take a different path. We started that an earn back in 2014 - or 2015, you could argue as early as 2014 in terms of the Subsea 2.0 engineering work that went into the development of the configurable system. But that led to a joint venture, which led to the creation of TechnipFMC back on the 17th of January 2017.
It is really a combination. I mean, we are doing things differently. We believe it is better, but again, be respectful of what they are doing. And on top of that, we have built deep relationships with our customers where they know they can trust us and they know that we are focused on this business. We are a pure play, this is what we do. We believe we do it very well, but we enjoy doing it, and this is what we want to do.
And our challenge that we put in front of ourselves every day is to ensure that we create success for our customers and to make sure that the offshore market continues to economically be robust for them.
And how do we do that? And this factors into maybe the second part of your question, is we do that by a relentless focus on certainty because what they are looking at right now is an economic view that yes, there is a capital cost to do the project, ,but it is the certainty in the delivery of the project and when the economics start to get negatively affected, it is when projects are delivered late.
And we are out there giving our customers a value proposition with iEPCI 2.0 that is unique to our company, where we can give them first oil or first gas, up to a year earlier than the competition. So not only does that have a significant impact on their project returns upfront, but then they trust that we will actually deliver it.
And that is what we have built. We have done it consistently, and we will continue to do it consistently. And they have grown to acknowledge that. They see that we have done things differently.
We are a very different company than we had been, like others, traditionally. We use that period of time of five to eight years to really redesign, reshape, reengineer the entire company to where we are today.
That being said, I will close by saying, again, we are respectful of our competition. We are humbled by the trust that our customers place in us, and we have a relentless focus to continue to drive further differentiation or maybe using your analogy to deepen and widen the moat every single day. Great, that is awesome color. So one other thing that you flagged here today was this 20-year frame agreement with Chevron, I know that FTI has had frame agreements with major oil companies for periods of time. But clearly, you felt it was extremely important to highlight this one in particular. So is this - I guess, in your mind, do you think that this is a start of a trend where you are going to see more opportunities to have these extended frame agreements. Just to add a little more insight if you can on that, that would be great. Sure. As you pointed out, we have a long history of deep and long relationships, many of which are exclusive with our company and have really built differentiation for us. We earn those every single day. But the reason specifically for calling out the Chevron frame agreement was because of the adoption of Subsea 2.0. So this is the first frame agreement with Chevron where they are going to the Subsea 2.0 configurable product family, which was a real highlight for us. Okay, sounds great. Thanks Dough. [Operator Instruction] Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Your line I open. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the orders for this year. Now you have got this upgraded guidance of $9 billion. That leaves about $2.3 billion in the second half. How are you thinking about the unannounced and announced portions of this? By my math, it would seem to assume maybe a slightly lower unannounced piece and almost zero large awards. Is that the right way to be thinking about the outlook here? Marc, I don't know that I would draw any - might be early to draw any strong determination of the mix. There will be more announced awards. I will certainly confirm that. Obviously the strong base from our subsea services and as you know, the continued level of unannounced awards.
So I think what you saw in the second quarter was just a phenomenal and a phenomenal mix of announced awards in the second quarter, probably a bit higher in that mix, if you will, that you rightfully laid out. So if you kind of look at that recipe going forward, there will be more announced awards, but probably not to the same level as we saw in the second quarter, which was quite exceptional.
Again, I think I just want to make sure the focus remains on the $25 billion. That is where our focus is. And our level of confidence has increased significantly in our ability to be able to achieve the $25 billion over, I guess, it would be what now the next 10 quarters or so. And that was the final question. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer for final remarks. This concludes our second quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. British Summer Time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thanks so much for joining us. Jack, you may end the call. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Thank you for participating in today's earnings call.
We delivered solid results in the third quarter. Subsea inbound orders came in strong at $1.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially for both Subsea and Surface Technologies exceeding the guidance we provided on our second quarter call. This momentum is also driving our expectations for full year results higher.
Continuing with total company financial highlights in the quarter. Revenue was $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $284 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.8% when excluding foreign exchange impacts.
Total company inbound was $2.1 billion. Total company backlog ended the period at $13.2 billion. In Subsea, we received significant orders for flexible pipe in the period. These included an award from Petrobras for the pre-salt fields in Brazil and our largest ever flexibles contract in the Gulf of Mexico for Woodside's Trion project.
As both pioneer and market leader of this technology, flexible pipe provides us with a unique capability to design fully integrated end-to-end Subsea systems for our clients. We have the unique ability to integrate flexible technology into our iEPCI offering which greatly simplifies field architecture. This enables a further reduction in project cycle time, improving economics and driving greater differentiation in our integrated offering.
Beyond flexibles' activity, we also experienced an exceptionally high level of unannounced project awards in the quarter, which speaks to the ongoing strength of the market.
In Subsea services, inbound was robust, driven by installation and life of field activities. Given the continued strength in our inbound, we are confident that Subsea orders will exceed $9 billion for the full year. And if we extend the view to include our current expectations for 2024, we now believe the next 5 quarters will approach $11 billion.
With this near-term update, we now expect to exceed the guidance for $25 billion of Subsea inbound through 2025, and we will provide an update on this extended outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. The durability of this cycle is driven by both an expansion in the number of active basins, which has nearly doubled versus the prior cycle as well as a growing and more diverse customer base.
Additionally, this cycle was supported by a robust and strengthening pipeline of FEED activity. In the third quarter, FEED studies increased nearly 40% when compared to the number of awards in the first half of the year. Importantly, more than half of the studies awarded to our company in 2023 have the potential to be direct awarded upon project FID.
This provides us with extended visibility and confidence that Subsea opportunities will remain resilient beyond 2025, even before we consider new frontiers that are likely to present themselves in the second half of the decade.
Subsea backlog ended the period of $12.1 billion, a nearly 60% increase year-over-year. An increasing proportion of this backlog is coming from iEPCI, Subsea 2.0 and other direct awards, reflecting the high quality of our order book. Year-to-date, we have been awarded the industry's 3 largest integrated contracts, Equinor's BM-C-33 project in Brazil, the Rosebank project in the U.K. and Aker BP's Ocera High project in the North Sea.
While integrated execution will certainly shorten cycle times, the size and scope of these awards provide us with multiyear visibility as a significant portion of the project revenues extend beyond 2025.
In Surface Technologies, international activity increased sequentially. We continue to ramp up production in our Saudi Arabia facility, as well as successfully execute on our multiyear framework agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Activity in North America was moderately lower in the period. However, operating margin improved sequentially, benefiting from the strategic actions previously taken to reduce our cost structure.
In closing, our commercial and operational success continues to drive improved financial results, and Alf will discuss how the strength in the second half should drive our full year results higher. Additionally, the upward revisions to our Subsea order outlook are fueled by high-quality inbound, driven by iEPCI, Subsea services and other direct awards and which are now expected to represent more than 70% of segment orders in the current year.
And more importantly, these results are further strengthening the foundation for higher and more sustainable performance in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $2.1 billion, of which $1.8 billion came from Subsea. Revenue in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion. EBITDA was $284 million when excluding foreign exchange loss of $46 million and impairment restructuring and other charges totaling $4 million.
Operationally, we delivered solid results. In Subsea, revenue was $1.7 billion, up 6% from the second quarter. The increase was driven by mid-single digit revenue growth in both projects and services. The largest drivers of the improvement were in Norway and Brazil.
Adjusted EBITDA was $258 million, with a margin of 15.1%, up 70 basis points from the second quarter. Results benefited primarily from higher volume and favorable activity mix.
In Surface Technologies, revenue was $349 million. This was a modest decline versus the second quarter, primarily driven by lower revenue in North America, which decreased 8% sequentially, partially offset by higher international activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $50 million, a 6% sequential increase. International results benefited from improved operational performance in the Middle East. North America results were largely unchanged versus the prior quarter despite the revenue decline, benefiting in part from strategic actions taken in prior quarters. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points versus the second quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $24 million when excluding less than $1 million of charges. Net interest expense was $27 million and tax expense was $19 million. And lastly, we incurred a foreign exchange loss of $46 million in the quarter. Approximately 50% of the loss was directly related to actions taken that we believe will reduce the volatility in our foreign exchange exposure going forward.
Importantly, we believe these were onetime elements of our results in the period. Approximately 30% of the FX loss was related to the current cost of hedging our euro-denominated debt and liability positions with the remaining portion due to unfavorable movements in currencies that we are unable to economically hedge with the Argentine peso having the biggest impact in the period.
Cash flow from operating activities was $222 million and included a $27 million payment related to the previous legal settlement with the French national prosecutor's office. Capital expenditures were $44 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $178 million in the quarter.
In August, we completed the sale of the Apache 2 pipelay vessel for net cash proceeds of $54 million. The sale marks another tangible strategic step forward in our commitment to higher and more sustainable financial returns. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $691 million. Net debt fell almost $200 million to $650 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $50 million and paid $22 million in dividends. Total shareholder distributions for the period were $72 million.
Moving to our guidance. I will first provide an update to our segment expectations for the fourth quarter. For Subsea, we expect the typical seasonal impacts with revenue declining approximately 10% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA margin coming in at approximately 13%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue to increase about 5% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 14%.
Turning to the full year. We anticipate corporate expense to come in at the high end of the range of $100 million to $110 million. With these updates, we now anticipate the range of outcomes for a total company adjusted EBITDA to approximate $915 million for the full year when excluding foreign exchange. This represents a $35 million improvement versus the guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings call. Lastly, we reiterate our free cash flow guidance of $225 million to $375 million for the current year.
In closing, I will share with you my 3 key takeaways from the quarter. First, given the strong Q3 results and improved outlook for Q4, we are increasing our guidance for full year company EBITDA to approximately $915 million when excluding foreign exchange. Second, free cash flow generation improved in the period as expected, keeping us on track to achieve our full year guidance. And third, with the initiation of a dividend in the quarter, and ongoing share repurchase activity. We distributed over $70 million, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] David Anderson at Barclays. So a question on -- maybe just to start on the order outlook. So over the next 5 quarters, you see $11 billion. What looks different about that $11 billion going forward? Or does anything look different in terms of -- is the customer mix shifting one way or another? I think you said 70%, you're expecting to be Subsea 2.0. With market capacity tightening, I think pricing should also be firming up as well. Could you maybe just kind of talk about the difference going forward with what you've kind of pulled in over the last year or so? Sure, David. I guess at the highest level, the way I would describe it is just a much higher quality inbound and there are several aspects to that. But most importantly, for our company is the direct awards, which is now over 70% of our business being direct awarded to us in Subsea. That's being driven by our unique iEPCI or integrated offering. Our unique subsea architecture, the Subsea 2.0. And again, our very long, strong client relationships.
There's also a bit of a mix shift in terms of the customer base. I talked about that for a few quarters now. We continue to see the customer base expanding and more people moving into the offshore arena because of the high-quality reserves and quite frankly, the access to those reserves. And we have, again, that combination of iEPCI and 2.0. And just the open and collaborative way we work with our clients are really fits those clients, our existing clients, but also the new clients in a very favorable way.
So I guess, I really -- Dave, what gets us excited is it's the quality. And we obviously have the opportunity to be selective given the market position that we have. So we can really focus on that -- those high-end, high-quality inbound that will create the success for the years to come. So another subject we're starting to hear something about is kind of rising breakeven costs for offshore. We know rig rates have more than doubled over the past few years. Service costs are moving higher. Just wondering in your conversations with customers, do you get any sense from customers that they're concerned about that? Is that potentially driving a case of urgency for your customers to get a project locked up before costs move higher?
And just kind of related to that question, kind of roughly percentage of an overall project, what percentage do you guys typically comprise? I know they're all different, but just maybe just a range would be helpful. I'm sorry, the second part, what percentage of? Yes, your business sort of comprises one of these offshore projects. Just curious, is it 20%? Is it 30%? Just trying to get a better handle on kind of where you fit in the scheme of things. Sure. Thank you, Dave. So let me start on -- let me do the second part first because I think it will help FEED into the first part.
In a brownfield development, so that's into development where there's an existing host facility, and you're tying back maybe an extended part of the reservoir or a new reservoir back to that host facility. We now, because being the only fully integrated company we now can represent up to 70% of the cost, Dave, of a Broadfield development normally between 60% and 70%. So we, if you will, we are the cost driver. Now I'm going to get off of this cost part here in a second, but we do comprise a large portion of the value of that project.
In terms of the greenfield development, the rule of thumb is about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. That's where the driller has a 1/3. We would have a 1/3 and then whoever is building the floating facility would do the other 1/3. So a little less influence over the overall project economics in a greenfield development, but it still can be quite material. And here's why. And this now falls in bridges to the first part of your question, it's all about time. It's simply all about time.
So yes, I understand rig companies like to talk about day rates, but the reality of the project economics is the best way to influence the overall project returns is to accelerate the time to first oil. And most importantly, deliver the project on time.
And this is what's driving our customers' behavior, Dave, because they're sitting there and they want to align with the very best companies that give them the highest probability of delivering the project on schedule. And oh, by the way, with TechnipFMC, we can typically deliver it 1 year ahead of -- if we don't use TechnipFMC. Again, iEPCI and 2.0 driving that cost or that cycle time to be much shorter.
So that's really what we're seeing. We're seeing a flight to quality. Sure, they're always focused on economics and always have been and so are we. Again, as a pure play, we truly understand the value of the offshore, and we truly understand how to drive offshore project economics to an ever higher level, and we do that through our iEPCI, the 2.0 unique offerings to our company which gives us our customers the confidence in our ability to be able to continue to deliver these projects on time. That's really the secret sauce of our company there. Luke Lemoine at Piper Sandler. When you laid out that initial Subsea margin target of 15% for '25 in late '21, which you actually just hit this quarter. I don't believe there's much '25 backlog visibility at the time. Just kind of guessing this is somewhat predicated on what you saw coming in the pipeline from 2.0 iEPCI direct awards, which you've talked about. Since then, you've raised that margin target earlier this year. But my question is, even though you have some backlog visibility past '25, which you show in your slide deck, how comfortable are you with where margins get ahead for maybe the next 3 to 4 years? And just to clarify, I'm not looking for a specific margin target, just kind of your confidence and visibility in that 3- to 4-year time frame. No problem, Luke. You're spot on. If you go back to November of 2021, it was a very different world. And when you look at what was happening offshore, it was very different, indeed. So we were talking about at that point, increasing our margins up to 15%, but largely through the internal initiatives. And that's really Subsea 2.0 has allowed us to change our operating model from an engineered order to a configure-to-order operating model. That has had profound impact on our business.
And you can't just do -- you can't -- first, you have to develop the architecture, but then you have to gain enough scale to be able to really see the benefits of the configured to order. So if you will, it's a unique opportunity for our company. So when we gave the 15%, largely predicated on internal initiatives.
Clearly, the market conditions have improved since 2021, hence, raising the 15% to 18%. Thank you for pointing out, we tripped the 15% already this quarter and we continue to be extremely confident in the progression of our ability to continue to extend the margins not only because we're getting ever more benefit from the configure-to-order model as the iEPCI and 2.0 direct awards continues to increase for our company, and we get the volume and the scale benefit as well and obviously, the underlying market conditions are improving for us gives us the confidence to be -- and it's why we've repeatedly said the 18% is a major milestone on a more ambitious journey. So we remain extremely positive of the future. Marc Bianchi at TD Cowen. Maybe just quickly, Alf, to confirm on the EBITDA for this year, you said 9-1-5, not 9-5-0, correct? Yes, Mark. Confirm. 9-1-5 is what I said. It's $35 million up from the prior guide that we had from the prior quarter. Yes. Okay, super. And maybe, Mark, if I -- can I add something, Mark, just to clarify also. You may wonder, in the prior quarter, if you remember, we mentioned also that we think we will be doing EBITDA -- having a 35% growth of EBITDA into 2024. So now that you take this new number of $915 million, you can still apply this 35%. So just to be very clear, we haven't backed off on the 35% going into 2024. But I'm happy that you clarify $950 million versus $915 million, but still the same dynamics are in place. Okay. That's great. That was actually going to be my next question. Doug, if I remember correctly, you came to FTI in early 2010s, which was a period when I think everybody thought that Subsea was kind of going to grow as far as the eye can see. And it seems like maybe that's where we are shaping up today, but the market is quite a bit different. Your offering is obviously very different. But from a customer perspective, I'd be curious to hear any reflections on how things compare today versus that early 2010 period. Interesting question. And actually, I think a lot about this just in my spare time. So look, a lot has changed. And when we talk about the customers, I would say our customers are much more collaborative, much more open to partner-led solutions, much more open to new technologies. And it's really what enabled us to be able to achieve the success we've achieved with Subsea 2.0.
The idea of standardization has been around since before 2010, and the ability to be able to go from engineer to order to configure to order, which is much more than just standardization was really the key. When we unlock that and we're able to convince our customers that they could still have, if you will, optionality, but the building blocks were going to be standardized, not the final product, but the input to the final product was going to be standardized. That really changed the way of thinking.
So look, a lot of the credit goes to our customers and their behaviors, which have certainly changed and improved over the period of time. Our customer base has also expanded quite significantly over that period of time. Did I mentioned in the script, we're operating in twice the number of basins that we have historically operated in. So people don't really think about it that much, but just the offshore market, when we think about offshore -- as offshore, but it was fairly limited in the areas of offshore that were really being developed. And that has doubled.
And then when you start to look in the -- what keeps this momentum going, you start to look at all these frontier basins that we're hearing about. They're not onshore. They're offshore and they're offshore around the world. They're not in any one particular continent or one particular area. They're spread around the world.
And those are the -- those areas are the ones that are going to contribute well beyond the numbers that we're talking about today. So it is very, very different. And thank you for pointing out. I do want to close on. We're a different company. We were a great company in 2010. I believe we're an even greater company today. And again, that's driven by the change in our operating model and our ability to be able to demonstrate to our clients and give them the confidence to direct award us the work that they do because of who we are. Mark Wilson at Jefferies. Yes, excellent set of results and outlook there. Doug, just a few outside points. The sale of the Apache vessel, I just wondered if there's any more of those planned. And then the other question, do you see on the horizon a first offshore CCS award coming at all by 2 points? Thanks, Mark. Regarding the fleet, as we have said since we formed the company on the 17th of January 2017, we were going to focus on a company that really had exemplary through-cycle returns. And part of that was we were going to do things differently in regards to the fleet. We do not need to own and operate all of the vessels that we use in our business.
The only way to do that is to be a company that others trust, and others are willing to work with, and that's our reputation. And that's how we've been able to develop our vessel ecosystem and bring in world-class partners like Allseas and Saipem and more in the future. And that's really what enables us to continue to look at our fleet and determine if those assets are strategic to our company or not. And if they're not, then we're able to continue to streamline our -- improve our returns by streamlining our fixed cost base.
I'm sorry, Mark, and I just was reminded of your second question. I got excited about the first, thank you. On the second question, I would answer that by saying indeed. Kurt Hallead at The Benchmark Company. Making sure I didn't lose you. Doug, with the expanding inbound and backlog you have on Subsea and obviously, the increased visibility out toward the end of the decade. I was wondering if you could give us some insights on what -- how you're managing execution risk internally and what you are able to provide to your client base that assures them that when they do throw this stuff your way, you're going to be in a very strong position to handle it. And as you said, deliver it on time. Kurt, that's the million-dollar question. And I will tell you when I'm speaking to clients, that is typically -- when they call me -- that is typically the call. It's -- we have this new opportunity. We're looking at this new emerging basin. We want to be securing assets well into the future. We want to work with TechnipFMC. Give me or give us the confidence that you're going to be able to deliver this. That is absolutely the discussion that's going on today.
First and foremost, do what you say you're going to do, and we've demonstrated that. We continue to shorten the cycle times. We continue to deliver the innovation into the industry. And we continue to be the company that our clients want to partner with if they want to work with because of our behaviors and who we are as a company.
More importantly, is -- to give them the additional confidence, I should say, is really helping them understand how this shift from engineer to order to configure to order has fundamentally changed the operating model of our company. And we actually had an opportunity earlier this week with our Board of Directors to kind of walk them through how we're operating the company today at a -- on a daily basis at an operating level. And it's a profound change.
And the visibility and the -- our ability to be able to see though and understand what are those key success factors that will ultimately deliver the KPIs or, if you will, the project on time and tracking those key success factors is really quite a fundamental change. And I know it sounds basic, but when you're doing configure to order, the only really metric you have -- I'm sorry, when you're doing engineered to order, excuse me, the only real metric you have is the output, did you or did you not deliver on time. And that's too late to fix anything. What they now see is that we have the ability in the configure to order to be well ahead.
There are so many things we can do that we could not do in the past because remember, when we got a Subsea order, we spent 9 months of detailed engineering before we could place a single order with the supply chain, internal or external. The situation our competitors are in today. Whereas we're able to work with our clients and we can look at 5 years ahead of time. We can look at 1 year ahead of time, and we can start putting in place those building blocks that are going to enable the success by ensuring that the schedule -- by having scheduled certainty and schedule assurance for our customers. So it really is a different way of operating. And we'll walk our clients through that, and they see it in all of our operating locations. They're able to experience that in our operating locations and just continue to deliver at a very, very high level. That's great color. And a follow-up kind of curious, right? We've seen some recent kind of tying everything together here, right? With respect to the order book, the upcoming, the insights as to the projects that are slated for even later this decade in the incremental oil that's going to bring to the market, right? You had the OPEC come out and suggest continued oil demand growth out beyond 2030. Obviously, you had the IEA, kind of pitch a different tone.
But through all your experience in dealing with different cycles, right? At the end of the day, I can't imagine a customer moving forward with a project that's going to deliver first oil in the latter part of the decade if their data is telling them that the market is not going to be there for the product. But I'm just kind of curious as to when you try to piece all this stuff together, how you sort through the noise? Kurt, I think you look for the high-quality data, you look for -- you listen to your clients, and you look for the most realistic outcome that's not influenced by external factors. And I think it's very, very clear that there's going to be a continued demand and a continued high level of demand. And just using the references that you used at the beginning, we certainly believe in the data in the commentary that's being provided by OPEC. Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan. I wanted to get some thoughts on the flexibles business at FTI. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your kind of current contribution is from flexibles. And as we think about a couple of the large project awards that you announced this quarter with Petrobras and with Woodside in Gulf of Mexico, how that mix could change and maybe the margin profile as well? As well as maybe just the technology that you think you bring to the table versus 2 of your other peers that are in that segment. Sure, Arun. As you pointed out, there's a very few of us who work in this domain. We're the pioneer, we're the market leader. I would say, we focus more on the higher end range of the flexibles. We've always gone -- we're the ones who have driven diameter, we're the ones who have driven pressure rating, we're the ones who have driven potential strength, et cetera.
And as far as percentage of the business, it's important. But more so than the percentage of the business that it represents. And it depends if you prefer [ Boy-base ] or Gumbo, but anybody who has a [ Boy-base ] or Gumbo recipe has a secret ingredient. This is our secret ingredient. This is what makes iEPCI tasteful.
And the reality of the situation is without this you can only do limited -- there's only limited benefit to an integrated offering. This is why is the first mover. We chose to go with Technip at the time. The flexible offering from Coflex Eve was absolutely critical to our vision of an optimized Subsea architecture. So it's not only the value it brings as a product line, but we're the only ones who have the product within an integrated company. The real benefit we get is the influence it has on our iEPCI awards and also on our iEPCI margins. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up for Alf is you mentioned how the soft guide on 2024 is 35% EBITDA growth from the $915 million. I wanted to maybe ask for a little bit of a clarification on the cash return. I believe the stated policy is to return 60% of your free cash flow back. And one of the questions from investors is how does the PNF settlement, how does that impact the free cash flow calculation and cash return? No, thank you for the question. So first of all, very clear, we do have a commitment out there that we will return at least 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders and we're going to stay true to that over the next 3 years. So what we further are saying is that really also the growth rate of 35% that you see in EBITDA from '23 to '24, we expect to apply that to distributions as well for 2024. .
So in short, answering your question, yes, there is an impact of roughly $170 million of payments outflow next year in terms of the free cash flow. But overall, we still expect to drive to increase shareholder distributions by 35%, in line with our EBITDA guidance. So that also tells you something about the underlying strong fundamental cash flow that you're going to see year-over-year if you exclude the impact of this $170 million of payments. Scott Gruber at Citigroup. Doug, in your prepared remarks, I believe you mentioned upside to service revenue in addition to the upside to the order intake. You guys have been targeting $1.5 billion of service inbound in '25. I'm just curious whether you guys are contemplating upside to that number as well. Thanks, Scott. Obviously, we'll be giving a bit more detail with our Q4 -- on our Q4 call. But I would tell you, as you were kind enough to ask the question, we are very proud of our Subsea services business. We have high expectations of our Subsea business.
So you should expect to see our Subsea services business continue to benefit not only from the higher level of project awards, which means a higher level of installation activity, but we're also seeing customers focus more on inspection, maintenance and repair. Really wanting to ensure optimized uptime of their producing assets as well as our Subsea well intervention services.
And that's really about ensuring the production because there may be some downhole issue that has occurred and our ability then to go out and help them intervene into the well in the most cost-effective way. So there's multiple drivers and a significant amount of optimism around our Subsea services business. Got it. And the margins for that business have typically been better, what's the outlook for pricing and margins going forward then? I just imagine that there's more competition with -- between installation and the maintenance and inspection just given that the equipment award volume is going up, and therefore, the installation outlook is going up. Does that create competition for those resources to do the inspection maintenance repair such that you can get incremental pricing and margin? Well, first of all, Scott, remember, this is an OEM model. So we service and maintain everything that we install. We have the world's largest installed base, and we benefit from that with these businesses. It's only growing. As you know, based upon the award activity over the last couple of years where we've had a substantial growth relative to the market. That has been reflected in subsequent years into our Subsea Services business. But it's all an OEM business.
Look, I don't talk a lot about pricing. We work very closely with our clients. They want to ensure that we're getting -- that we are very satisfied with -- that we feel we're being treated appropriately and fairly on an economic basis, and we're very comfortable with that, yes. Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Doug, a quick follow-up on the flexible question earlier on. It's really good to see the traction third quarter. Can you talk to a little bit about the demand outlook for flexibles and maybe talk to your capacity, the industry's capacity to deliver on that demand. And the reason I'm asking that Doug, just on context is because one of your large competitors has talked about being sold out to 2025. So I'm just trying to think how the demand looking, how the capacity looking particularly at FTI. Yes. The -- just like in every part of our business, we don't focus so much on being sold out. We focus on developing technology that we can ensure a shorter delivery time or faster deliveries or higher throughput, if you will. So if we look at Subsea 2.0 broadly, Subsea 2.0 reduces the time through our facility by 50%. Or in other words, we can put twice the capacity through our existing facility without spending additional capital.
When you're still doing engineer-to-order or 1.0, which as you point out, the rest of the industry is doing, including in flexibles, you're kind of constrained by the size of your facility and hence being sold out or percent utilized. What we're doing now is expanding the 2.0, offering -- the 2.0 methodology across our entire offering, including flexibles. So our approach is how can we have a better product that's configured to order versus engineer to order that we can have a higher cadence through our manufacturing facilities, thus addressing the market's needs.
The other aspect I would point out is, clearly, we're focusing on our partners, our direct awards, our iEPCI projects because, again, as I pointed out earlier, that's really the secret ingredient to success of an iEPCI or an integrated project. So we do some prioritization, which is why when I was answering one of your colleagues earlier, I said we do some prioritization, and we do tend to work on the high end, high quality, if you will, portion of the flexibles market.
There is some -- there is a lower end portion of the flexibles market as well, which we certainly can participate in, but that's not where we focus. That's more of the commoditized end of the flexibles market. Okay. Awesome, Doug. And just a quick follow-up because we get this question a lot from investors. So let me just ask you the way I get asked. Two of your competitors recently formed a joint venture. How should we think about the potential impact of that joint venture on the overall market, the industry's capability to respond to what's going on. And how does it impact FTI in particular? How should investors think about that? So just to clarify, you're talking about the 3 Subsea? Yes. I'm talking about the one of the joint venture. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant the 3 Subsea companies that are coming together. Yes, yes. Absolutely. Yes, yes. Well look, I think first and foremost, it's clear validation of the strength of the market. You would -- 3 Subsea companies wouldn't be coming together if they didn't see the strength in the market going forward. So it's just a point of validation. But it's also a reshaping of the market, right? So we see both of these things is quite favorable to our company. We've talked a lot about bringing companies together. Consolidation is one thing. Creating an integrated offering, we feel is the better way to go about it. Investing in technology, doing things that are going to improve our clients' project returns, that's where they see the value, and that's, quite frankly, why we've seen and continue to see the level of direct awards to our company, which is actually a quite unprecedented in our industry or I believe, any industry.
So look, from our point of view, we did our heavy lifting back in 2015. I believe it or not that long ago is when we started the journey. We completed the merger in the 17th of January 2017. And look, I'll be very candid. It took years. It took years to get everything operating at the level it's operating at today, bringing together 2 companies, let alone 3 companies, it's not easy to do. So we're really glad we did ours 8 years ago. I can tell you that. And today, we're singularly focused on our clients and singularly focused on their success by delivering the world's very best Subsea projects. Our last question will come from the line of Waqar Syed at ATB Capital Markets. First one, Doug, you've given guidance that over the next 5 quarters, inbound orders in Subsea could be around $11 billion. If you look back over the last 3 to 4 months, has that view been upgraded? Or has that view relatively remain unchanged, but the confidence in that outlook has increased. A fair question. I would say it's been upgraded and the confidence has increased. Okay. Now does that have any impact then on your 2025 outlook for revenues and EBITDA? Absolutely not. Let me clarify. Maybe that was too quick of an answer. When you talk about the $25 billion target for 2025, clearly, as indicated in my script, we expect that will be -- we will be giving you an update on that on the Q4 guide. So if you were staying on inbound, as you mentioned, EBITDA,  again, as I said earlier, we're going to be giving -- we just gave a view for total company EBITDA for 2024, which is an increase again this quarter, the second consecutive quarter that we're increasing our 2024 number, which obviously shows a very strong pattern. We'll be segmenting that out on the fourth quarter call, and we may take the opportunity to revisit 2025 as well. But clearly, it's trending in the right direction. Okay. And then in terms of your capital spending, $250 million so far for this year, is that number likely to change? I know it's still early for next year. Or is that kind of a base level 250 that's likely to stay year-over-year? The truth is we don't know. And I know it's an important number because I know it's a visible number for investors to use in their decision-making. What I would encourage people to realize is it's really the prioritization of that spend. And it's clearly being prioritized to upstream, and it's clearly being prioritized to offshore. So from our perspective, we are very confident in the continued growth of the capital expenditure. And I'm going to ask Alf to add some additional comments. I just want to add the reminder that -- so when we look at our capital expenditure, we have given the long range -- long-term guidance that we are going to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, over the past 12 months and more, we have really seen that we can operate at that 3.5%, the lower end of that range, and that continues to be the guidance, meaning 3.5% of revenue level. It's true for this year. It's probably going to be true for next year and just keep that number for right now as a guide for the intermediate term. No. Thank you, Alf. I was answering it just to be clear. I was answering it from our customers' capital expenditure and thank you for clarifying the internal wealth. I appreciate it. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Seinsheimer for parting remarks. Thank you. This concludes our third quarter conference call. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. British Summer Time today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining us. Jack, you may now end the call. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

I will now turn the conference over to Matt Seinsheimer. Please go ahead. Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to TechnipFMC's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Our news release and financial statements issued earlier today can be found on our website. I'd like to caution you with respect to any forward-looking statements made during this call. Although these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding future developments and business conditions, they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.
Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. I am proud to report our strong quarterly and full year results, which really speak to the growth and operational momentum we are achieving. Total company inbound for the year grew to $11 billion. This included Subsea orders of $9.7 billion, which was an increase of 45% versus the prior year and a book-to-bill of 1.5. These strong results benefited from a record level of iEPCI awards in the period. Total company revenue for the year grew 17% to $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $939 million when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
This was an increase of 40% when compared to the prior year. We generated free cash flow of $468 million for the year, and we returned nearly $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While these are all solid improvements, I am particularly pleased with the quality of the inbound received in 2023. With direct awards, iEPCI and Subsea services together exceeding 70% of Subsea inbound. We are also seeing tangible improvements in Surface Technologies. This has resulted in improved financial performance, higher cash generation and greater consistency in delivering on our annual commitments. Any way you look at it, 2023 was a period of strong growth for our company. And we see continued strength ahead driven by the resiliency and durability of this cycle. The demand for energy will continue to grow. And for more than a decade, unconventional resources in North America have provided a significant portion of the world's hydrocarbon growth.
The growth from the region will be more limited in the years ahead driven by capital frameworks that reward higher economic returns and increased shareholder distributions. This means that the incremental production needed to support global growth will come primarily from international markets, driven by the Middle East and offshore. Looking ahead, the market for conventional energy resources will evolve differently than what we have experienced in the past, driven by 3 major trends: a shift in capital flows an increased role for new technologies and an expanded role for Subsea services, all of which will allow TechnipFMC to leverage the full capabilities our integrated solutions, differentiated technologies and the industry's most comprehensive Subsea service capabilities.
Looking more closely at these major trends, let's start with the shift in capital flows. We expect to see continued strength in spending both in land and offshore markets. However, the dynamics will differ across the major markets as capital flows are typically a function of returns and access. In North America, the history has access to resources, but economic returns will continue to be challenged outside the most prolific basins. We believe this will result in more modest growth in the region. Opportunities in the Middle East benefit from strong economic returns that will drive continued growth. That said, the number of operators that have access to these attractive resources is far more limited, which brings us to the offshore markets. Here, we believe much improved economic returns and broad operator access to deepwater resources will attract a growing share of global capital flows.
And with more than 90% of our total revenue generated outside the North America land market, FTI standout as the pure-play equity to address this opportunity. While the strength of these trends is partly reflected in our current backlog and revenue guidance, we have high confidence in the durability of the market over the intermediate term. In 2024, we remain on track to meet our prior guidance for Subsea inbound with current year order expectations approaching $10 billion. Today, we are also increasing our expectations for Subsea inbound over the 3-year period ending 2025 to reach $30 billion, a 20% increase versus our prior view. Looking beyond capital flows, we expect that technology will also play a bigger role in spending behavior. Here, TechnipFMC is focused on developing technologies for both inventional and new energies to drive market expansion. More specifically, we are using technology to drive further innovation in the offshore market creating new growth opportunities.
A clear example of innovation is the [indiscernible] contract, which we were awarded just last month. The significance of this project for the Subsea industry cannot be overstated. It will be the first to use Subsea processing to capture [ CO2 Dolly ] from the well stream for injection into the reservoir. Importantly, this will all take place on the seafloor. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity, [ high set ] technologies will increase production capacity by debottlenecking the gas processing plant that currently resides on the FPSO. By moving the gas processing entirely to the sea floor, future FPSO topside designs can be further simplified driving significant improvement in project economics. [indiscernible] is a major milestone for the Subsea industry and for TechnipFMC. This project plays to our strengths. [indiscernible] allow us to demonstrate how technology innovation, project integration and partner collaboration enable our meaningful participation in the energy transition while remaining aligned with our strategic priorities.
It is the first iEPCI project ever awarded by Petrobras. And it builds upon our strong order momentum, starting the year with an iEPCI award that exceeded $1 billion. And finally, the third major trend driving Subsea market growth opportunities can be found in services. Today, subsea fields host more than 7,000 Subsea trees and associated infrastructure, including manifolds, control systems, umbilicals and flexible pipe. This list is certainly not inclusive of all major components of the Subsea production system. However, it does highlight the size and scale of the industry's large and more importantly, growing installed base. TechnipFMC's global services organization plays a critical role throughout the entire life of the field from system installation to maintenance, intervention and production optimization and all the way through life of field.
Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate that our strategy to enhance this resilient, growing and high-return business is delivering real value with our services revenue having achieved over $1.5 billion for the year. In summary, we closed out a solid year, having delivered many notable achievements. Subsea orders increased 45% versus the prior year and included a new record for iEPCI awards. This growth in orders also drove a 50% increase in Subsea backlog to over $12 billion with high-quality inbound supportive of further improvement in our financial returns. And our growth in full year operational results reflect strong momentum that continues into 2024. We have entered an unprecedented time for the development of conventional energy resources driven by 3 major trends. A shift in capital flows, which we believe will largely be directed to the offshore and Middle East markets, an increased role for new technologies, as shown by the [indiscernible] and an expanded role for Subsea Services, driven by the needs of growing and aging infrastructure.
Importantly, these trends underpin the 20% increase in our expectation for Subsea inbound over the 3-year period ending 2025, which at $30 billion will provide additional growth in backlog and further extend the execution of our project portfolio through the end of the decade. I will now turn the call over to Alf. Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $1.5 billion, driven by $1.3 billion of Subsea orders. Revenue in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion. EBITDA was $245 million when excluding foreign exchange loss of $26 million and restructuring, impairment and other charges totaling $10 million.
Turning to segment results. Subsea revenue of $1.7 billion increased modestly versus the third quarter. The increase in revenue was due to higher project activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Asia Pacific and Africa driven part by accelerated conversion of several projects from backlog. The increased activity was largely offset by seasonal factors that impacted vessel utilization. Revenue for Subsea Services modestly increased due to strength in asset maintenance and ROE services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico. Services revenue was also less impacted in the quarter by typical offshore seasonality, particularly in the North Sea. EBITDA was $225 million, with [ a main ] of 13.1%, down 200 basis points from the third quarter due to lower vessel-based activity and a mix of projects executed from backlog in the period.
For the full year, Subsea revenue grew 18% versus the prior year, with adjusted margin up 180 basis points to 13.3%. In Surface Technologies, revenue was $357 million in the quarter, an increase sequentially. The increase in revenue was driven by higher activity in international [ Clarica ] markets both benefiting from higher wellhead equipment sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $52 million, a 5% sequential increase benefiting from increased contribution from international services and higher wellhead sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.7%, up 40 basis points versus the third quarter. For the full year, Surface Technologies revenue was up 12% versus the prior year, with adjusted EBITDA margin up 230 basis points to 13.6%.
Turning to corporate and other items in the quarter. Corporate expense was $33 million when excluding $5 million of charges. Net interest expense was $13 million and benefited from increased interest income in the period, driven in part by strong cash generation. Tax expense was $54 million. And lastly, foreign exchange loss was $26 million, the majority of which was related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. Cash flow from operating activities was $701 million. Capital expenditures were $72 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $630 million in the quarter. Free cash flow for the full year was $468 million, above the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we converted 50% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow, achieving the cash conversion rate we had previously targeted for 2025.
Total shareholder distributions were $77 million in the quarter and $249 million for the full year. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $952 million. Net debt declined more than $500 million to $116 million. In November, we announced an agreement to sell our Measurement Solutions business for $205 million in cash. We now expect to conclude the transaction by the end of the first quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.
Moving to our financial outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for the current fiscal year in our earnings release. I won't speak to all the details but will provide some context for certain items for the full year and first quarter. I will begin with Subsea. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of $7.4 billion with an EBITDA margin of 16%. This represents a 270  basis point margin improvement from the prior year. Our outlook also anticipates continued growth in Subsea Services revenue to approximately $1.65 billion achieving this level 1 year ahead of our previous target. For the first quarter, we anticipate Subsea revenue to decline low to mid-single digits due to more typical seasonal activity patterns and EBITDA margin to be in line with fourth quarter results.
Turning to Surface Technologies. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of approximately $1.275 billion with an EBITDA margin of 14%. This guidance assumes we complete the sale of our Measurement Solutions business by the end of the first quarter. When excluding the impact of the sale as well as the exit of certain geographies and portfolio rationalization in the Americas. Our Surface Technologies revenue is anticipated to grow approximately 5% year-over-year. For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue to decline approximately 10% when compared to fourth quarter results, with an EBITDA margin of approximately 13%. We anticipate full year corporate expense of $115 million to $125 million.
In 2023, the company initiated an ERP system upgrade. Our corporate expense now includes approximately $10 million in annual costs related to the implementation of the upgraded system. We expect to incur a similar cost each year until completion of the project in 2027. We anticipate capital expenditures of $275 million which is just over 3% of revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range. Finally, we are guiding free cash flow for the full year to a range of $350 million to $500 million. This includes approximately $170 million for the remaining payments related to the resolution of all outstanding matters with the PNF. Excluding these payments, the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance with approximate $600 million. In closing, when our guidance items are taken at the midpoint of the range, we anticipate total company EBITDA of $1.25 billion for the full year. This represents EBITDA growth of 33% versus the prior year when excluding foreign exchange.
I also want to stress that we expect to achieve this significant growth despite the impact of the strategic actions taken in Surface Technologies and the incremental spend related to the ERP system upgrade. This also infers a second consecutive year for free cash flow conversion of nearly 3% when excluding the settlement payments. And we expect this to drive growth in shareholder distribution of at least 35% and a further reduction in net debt. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Doug, I wanted to first start with the increase in your long-term or 3-year order guide. You raised that from $25 billion to $30 billion. I was wondering if you could comment on what drove the increase and perhaps give us a sense of how much of this is your expectations for more market share versus just the growing TAM in terms of Subsea and offshore FIDs. Sure. Arun. It's really a combination of both. Clearly, both the total market size is increasing. And as you know, our -- the share of the market, we continue to enjoy an increasing share due to the unique offering that we provide. Look, what we are seeing is just giving us much greater visibility into the durability of the cycle and much greater confidence when we kind of risk weight opportunities. When you're in a direct negotiation, there is no competitive tender, as stated in my prepared remarks, which represents over 70% of our Subsea business, you just obviously have a much higher ability to be able to properly risk weight those opportunities. You see the outlook slides that we provide and the markets there, the size of the market is there. It's solid. It's growing. It's just really we're in a privileged position, which -- we are humble about it. We are honored to have this position, and we offer our customers a clear line of sight to improve Subsea project economics that -- these are unique to our offering, both in terms of our Subsea 2.0 architecture and our iEPCI offering that reduces their cycle time by 12 to 14 months on the deepwater project, best vastly improving their economics.
So it's a privileged position to be in. One, we don't take lightly, and we continue to work really, really hard to deliver for our customers every day. Great. My follow-up, Doug, we're intrigued by the Mero 3 project [ word ]. I know you announced this a bit earlier in the quarter. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about some of the unique technology that you're bringing to table for this? And it seems like an application that could open a world of new opportunities just by taking some of the processing and separation to the [ C for ], as you mentioned, it would perhaps reduce some of the needs at the surface in terms of the design of the facility to top sides. So I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the technology and perhaps the scope here of future opportunities and what this could open up for FTI. Sure. And thank you for the question. Because although it was announced earlier, we haven't had a chance to talk about it here in this forum. This was the first opportunity. So very excited, as I pointed out, I think it -- we said it's really really unique both for the industry as well as for our company. And I think understanding, as you said, what are some of the -- there's the actual award and then there's with us what is enabled by that. So let's start with just some of the highlights. Yes, one of the bottlenecks that we see in greenfield developments, as the offshore market continues to grow, will be the delivery of the FPSO. The FPSOs are complicated. And there are a certain number of providers of those FPSOs. And clearly, they are becoming, if you will, the long pole in the tent in terms of the project cycle time.
Our approach to ensuring that deepwater economics remain privileged, i.e., our customers' global capital spend is by really doing everything we can to in every way, address the cycle time as well as reducing the risk of delivering the projects and ensuring that they're delivered on time. So an example of that would be the FPSO itself is an intriguing unit, but let's say the complexity is really in the top side configuration that you put on top and you do that because you either have to separate water from oil or you have to treat the gas or you have to separate in this case, [ ICO2-rich-dense ] gas from the flow stream. If you can do that on the C-band, it has many advantages. One, simplifying the FPSO, therefore, reducing that risk about becoming a bottleneck in terms of driving even further improvements in cycle time.
Secondly, there's obviously more real estate on the sea floor. We can do things, if you will, horizontally, whereas if you're on a ship, you are pretty much constrained to doing things vertically. Any sort of vertical construction costs more than horizontal construction. So in the simplest terms, we just have more real estate to play with. And more -- and just as importantly than the economics, is this is a CCS project. This is about reducing greenhouse gas intensity. This is about separating the CO2 on the sea floor and reinjecting it into the subsurface. It never sees the atmosphere. It is at the bottom of the ocean on the sea floor in a closed-loop system where we can separate [ LTA-C02 ] and again, reinject the CO2 hence delivering a much lower greenhouse gas intensity for the project.
And then I also mentioned, and I think it's important to point out, this is the first ever iEPCI which is our unique commercial model, the integrated commercial model, the first time Petrobras is using this model. So you're absolutely right. We've done separation projects in the past. We've done boosting. This is a unique combination of advanced separation, the first time for CO2 specifically as well as boosting and reinjection and putting this all together into integrated system architecture is something that we are extremely proud and excited to be working on Petrobras to deliver this. And this is being done under the premise of design one, build many. So as you point out, this can start to open up all sorts of other opportunities as we move forward. Your next question comes from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Just follow up on that on Arun's question on the Subsea processing. So Subsea processing, we've been talking about for a long time. I want to go -- if I go back to probably more than 10 years ago, you guys started introducing this the cycle kind of ended -- if my memory serves, I think the cycle kind of ended before this really became before this really kind of took off. So maybe can you just talk about kind of what's different today about Subsea processing versus 10 years ago? Maybe this is the CCS part. And how effective was it before and kind of what's changing? I'm just kind of curious why the adoption today. You've talked about the FPSO, but I seem to recall that was kind of the whole kind of [ point ] of this in the first place. So why didn't that couch on before or maybe it did and why does it catch on now? Dave, I wouldn't disagree. I would say the Subsea processing market has maybe underdelivered in the past to [ very blood ]. What we're looking at here is a completely different application. And as you know, the greenhouse gas intensity, CCS opens up a completely different dynamic in terms of the thinking around sanctioning a project, okay? So let's just say it adds an additional dimension, which is one reason why we believe that this is a -- I would call it almost a new market. I wouldn't put it under the bucket of Subsea processing. Even though it's using many of the same technologies, there's multiphase pumps and separation, et cetera, but it is a unique application.
Secondly, there is unique technology in [ Bulger ], and we've been working with Petrobras since 2016. We have an R&D center for Subsea in Brazil which gives us the unique ability to work closely with Petrobras and developing and bringing this technology to light. And then just our experience in terms of system integration and putting together the entire package gives us a reason to believe, Dave, that this application, again, and I'm going to go back to point one, when you add this other dimension into the project, if you're sanctioning criteria, I believe it makes the decision -- leaves the decision more towards the Subsea. And as you're saying -- and it takes cost off the FPSO as well. Is that sort of the idea to help kind of lower the overall development cost of the project? Is that sort of the intent here? Well, cost, but more importantly, it just is going to -- you can build an FPSO with a basic top side and a fraction of the -- that it takes to build one with a full gas processing plant on top. It doesn't -- the time isn't in building the hall and building the storage and the unloading and offloading system, the time element is in the topside configuration, which, as you know, is often done at a different yard than the hole is made or at multiple different yards, then has to be all brought together, configured, assembled. You're building a floating, if you will, gas processing unit or refinery in a broad sense, just much more complex. So as you know, our whole focus, and it's why our customers, I think, are proud of what we're doing is we're going to help them improve their economics by focusing on shortening the cycle time. That's the real focus today. Okay. And if I go back to the awards, your kind of 2-year outlook on Subsea awards out there -- was essentially kind of added about $5 billion in orders to your kind of next 2-year view. I'm just curious, in terms of your iEPCI awards, you're saying 70% today, does that number go up over the next 2 years? And I'm assuming -- are you already working on these projects? I mean, is that kind of where your confidence comes from because I know the [indiscernible] or would start at a very early stage. Is that kind of where this is all coming from? And if I could just pile on one more question in there. How is pricing evolving here? We're in a consolidated market now? Are we starting to show up -- is that starting to show up in the bids? Sorry, I packed a lot in there. No problem, Dave. I'll try to address it as well as I can. So the 70% -- over 70% that we refer to as you know is the direct awards which is a combination of those iEPCIs that are direct awarded the most of ours are direct awarded. Very few go out to a competitive tender as well as our Subsea services and other direct awards from our alliance partners. The iEPCI portion for us is at 50% of our total. Do I see that increasing? Yes. what gives me the confidence and visibility is remember, they typically almost always in our case, start with an integrated FEED study, the integrated front-end engineering and design, which is 2 to 3 years out. So what gives us the unique visibility is, one, we can see because we're -- when we're at the table much earlier, we are, in many cases, doing an integrated FEED study, and iFEED. Contractually, we don't do iFEED unless it will be direct awarded to us because it would not make sense for us to do it integrated FEED study, demonstrating the value of integration if we weren't going to execute the project.
So in the front-end engineering studies, which are at a very robust level right now, the percentage of integrated FEEDs, which will convert into integrated studies continues to grow which, again, gives us that confidence. So we know the client, we know the basin. We know that working together, if we can achieve the economic -- the right economics for the project then that will turn around and be direct awarded to our company. So I would say we have great confidence, as you know, when we give our inbound outlook. It's by project by name, there's a great degree of confidence in the numbers that we put out there and our ability and consistent track record of delivering against them. So we have the visibility from the FEED studies. It gives us the confidence. We continue to see the direct awards going up. And I'll make one other kind of comment here for you, Dave. It wasn't part of your question, but I think it's interesting. Just this year, right? I mean we're not that far into the new year.
I will tell you the number of very large greenfield projects that we are already in the front-end engineering and/or commercial tendering stage or, let's say, commercial negotiation stage because, again, if they're a direct award, there is no tender, I've never seen anything like it. And it's -- the cadence and the size of the projects are really quite -- they'll be record. It will be one record after the next record. And by the way, I'm not counting the emerging countries in here, maybe a [ Tanzania ], Colombia, et cetera. I'm not counting those. I'm saying this is within the traditional or known basins that we're operating in today. There's a lot of big projects coming, and we think we're working very closely with our customers to bring those late. And Doug, is that incremental to the orders that you're highlighting for the -- out to '25? Well, no, not necessarily. If we're -- obviously, if we're in direct negotiations today, it's probably going to happen before then. But you raised another good point, and I don't want to be too [ verbose ] here. But we are -- and I've mentioned this on past calls, this started about 9 months ago. Our clients want to secure our capacity. They understand what we have as a unique offering. So they're not only talking to us about the current award, but in most cases, they're talking to us about the future phase or the future times or whatever it may be. So yes, part of it is in but yes, we are also looking and working on awards that will be coming beyond 2025. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilson with Jefferies. My first question, Doug, is on the subject of the additional awards and the $30 billion out to 2025, you've talked a lot in the past about the manufacturing process you've put in place as well to be able to deliver all the services you built. So can we talk about the -- if there's any impact to the expected margin from this additional and larger market outlook? That's my first question. Sure. Mark. So I believe you're going the angle of CapEx, and I'm going to go there even -- I hope that's where you wanted me to go. But look, because of the 2.0 in the configure-to-order, some of which I believe you've had an opportunity to witness yourself, it allows us to actually achieve these higher rates of throughput, the existing facilities without having to spend additional capital. So as always, there'll be capital spend on replacing certain machine tools, et cetera. But in terms of roof flying capacity or major expansion or major capital embedded to be able to deliver this growth, that is not the case. It will be within our normal CapEx expenditures. And actually, what I was really looking is on the EBITDA margin, you'd be expected to generate if we're not having to put in more investment, are the economies of scale, frankly, from a higher throughput coming through within your margin expectations? I would agree with that statement, fully agree with that statement. Okay. And then lastly, looking further ahead. And obviously, you've spoken to a lot of technology coming through the gas processing, Subsea separation, CO2 injection. There are new basins emerging. You're clearly bringing through things in Brazil, which has now been out there for a few decades now but there are new basins coming through with new technologies, new levels have to go to certainly in terms of depth and with gas processing. Where would you suggest that the industry is looking in terms of the next technological step? Is it in terms of going deeper, doing more with gas or indeed electrification, just generally? So Mark, I'm laughing because you're spot on. It's as if you were in our technology review with our Chief Technology Officer, the other day. And the only thing I would add to what you said is one actually enables the other. So deeper and electrified are actually complementary. And electrification will allow us to go deeper. We've talked about electrication in the past in terms of allowing us to have longer step-outs but it's just the ability to be able to transmit hydraulic fluid and the response time because the further you push it, the more friction pressure, the more delays, if you will, and to be able to get a response from a hydraulic actuation versus an electric actuation, which can be done very, very quickly. So I would so certainly deeper. Now it is only electrification, but electrification will enable deeper but there's also other aspects to going deeper, particularly when you think about things like flexible pipe design.
We have the only flexible pipe that will be able to work at the depths that these emerging basins are being developed. It takes a very, very unique design. So there's other technologies that we're working on that will also be very beneficial as we move into some of the new basins, which indeed will be at greater depths than we've routinely operated at today. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Thomson with BNP Paribas. Maybe continuing on the sort of technology front. Just looking at West Africa, there are a few prospects in your list like Angola, Nigeria, that have been sat there for quite some time. I mean we know the operators have been really strict on getting those to a point where project economics are acceptable. So I was kind of wondering how many of those projects you've refreshed offers on recently or will in the near future? And if you found ways within your work scope through technology or something else to bring those costs down to enable sanction while still maintaining the attractiveness to yourselves? No, a very fair question. When we look at often and I'm actually looking at the Subsea opportunity list as I answer your question. So first of all, as you know, to be on the list, there's an expectation that it would reach FID within the next 24 months. That expectation is aligned with the customer and in some cases, projects aren't on here because they're confidential or order projects that are going to be direct awarded to our company. So they're not on the list. I will tell you, looking at the list right here in front of me, the same one you are I can confidently say all but one, as you said, are either going through a refreshed FEED study and/or are in at some level of a commercial negotiation. So actually, the vast majority of them. And I know -- I understand the point, and I know there's been -- some of these have been here a while and some of these have been discussed many times over. But just to be very blunt, that was before iEPCI. That was before Subsea 2.0.
So when you can deliver a project 12 to 14 months shorter cycle time, it has a big impact on the economics. Now there's other reasons that's specific to the client that they may be wanting to move a project board, which is not anything I would comment on, that's the -- up to them to comment. But that's what we're providing to them to help bring these projects at least bring them to the stage that the customer could if they chose to FID the project. Yes. Makes sense. Maybe one follow-up on Brazil. I wondered if you had any comments on how your bidding strategy in Brazil may have changed just in light of one of your competitors being barred from contracting with Petrobras for the next few years. I mean do you feel you guys might be going for more work there or opportunities sufficient elsewhere? Look, we are a company that has very close relationships with our clients. We [indiscernible] just at the present opportunity and treat our clients with respect as we expect them to treat us with respect. And we have a very strong relationship with Petrobras and very proud of the work we're doing, including the award of their first-ever iEPCI and the first-ever application of [indiscernible]. So I will just say that we continue to treat our clients the way that we appreciate them treating us, and we believe that is the right way to do business. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. So kind of a bigger picture question for you, potentially right. So last June, you had referenced, you have increased visibility on potential projects that extend out towards the end of the decade, you continue to reiterate that in each and every conference call yet there seems to be a significant disconnect between what investors want to believe and what you are actually seeing predicated on the discussions, the game plan that your customers have and it's probably the biggest disconnect I've ever seen in my 35 years in this business. So you've given a lot of input in commentary and data points around what you're seeing and what -- but what's driving the conviction of -- what do you think is driving the conviction of your customer base to pursue these projects for oil production that's going to come online in 3 to 5 years when everybody is freaking out about what [indiscernible] is going to do. So what are the oil companies seeing that the investor base may not in your personal opinion. Well, look, I don't -- Kurt, learned a long time ago as a service and not to speak on behalf of my clients. And so I'll just give you my perspective, not speaking on behalf of my clients and they may agree or disagree with me. But look, I think everybody has their long-term energy outlook. People understand the rate of change. Both in terms of the demand is going to go up and the rate of change of the energy mix. I think when you look at those 2 through a realistic lens, you come to a conclusion that these are probably the right investments to be making to ensure that the world has access to reliable and dependable energy as we continue our journey forward. These are solid projects with solid economics and are created now with the confidence they have because of what we have done as a company and by the creation of TechnipFMC and our ability to deliver these projects consistently on schedule or ahead of schedule, which, again, is 12-plus months faster than anyone else can do it because they're doing it the old-fashioned way.
It's just a very unique scenario to be in, and they have a much higher level of confidence, I would tell you, in our company. It's hard for me to say that. I wish -- they always did. But when we were all doing bespoke work like the rest of the market is doing today, you have confidence until something goes wrong because you've never done it before. We're not doing bespoke anymore. We're doing configure to order versus [ Gener ] to order. So the level of confidence is there. We're giving our customers that level of confidence with their deciding in their investment decisions. I don't want to weigh in on. But I -- again, we'll just reiterate. We know the demand is going to be there. And as we move towards just the simple impact of artificial intelligence and the electricity demand that that's going to require, there's demand coming from all facets on the energy complex. And then you just have to make a decision based upon what is the realistic energy mix to be able to deliver that demand.
Our customers, I can tell you -- and I don't know that it's a disconnect. I'll maybe be a little less -- I probably appreciate your viewpoint, and I don't disagree with what you said, but look, I think people are quickly recognizing that this is the new reality, and we will just keep our head down, execute -- inbound execute, we need to grow, continue to innovate, bring in other applications that will allow our business to continue to grow both in terms of top line and profitability. And we've been extremely disciplined and good stewards of returning to our shareholders, and we'll continue to do so. So I think we'll just continue doing what is the right thing to do and confident that we'll be rewarded or continue to be rewarded for doing that, Kurt. I appreciate that insight, Doug, to the [ follow up ] right. So you've indicated that your iEPCI process and integrated processes reduce cycle time by 12 to 14 months and you do it faster than some of your competitors in similar time frame. So is that maxed out? Or how much more can you reduce that cycle time -- how do we think about that? No. So it's a continuous innovation growth look, this isn't new. We saw this. This is what happened in conventionals. And when I was back in the day when I was fracking, it was single stage, single well and at most, you did 2 a day because you had a rig down, move to the next well. And we know then we went to 24 hours, then we went to simufracking, now trimolfracking, so look, there will continue to be -- we're in the very early stages versus -- well, let me say it a different way. We saw that productivity curve, which was dramatic and very impressive, what was able to be accomplished in the unconventionals. Think about it and Subsea is going to be no different. It's just we're in the very early stages of it. So yes, there will be more to come. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. So I wanted to circle back on margins. So you're forecasting a robust 16% this year and then climbing to your 18% forecast in Subsea of '25. And Doug, you talked about 18% being closer to normal versus closer to peak. So now with this raised order intake outlook, how should we be thinking about the margin expansion potential to '26? Can we extrapolate that trend literally and then something close to 20% in '26? And would recent awards support that level of margins in a few years? Scott, I had a look at my watch for a minute and just remind -- I had to remind myself what year we're in. Look, Scott, I shake the question. Clearly, kind of based upon the whole discussion we've had thus far on the call, the markets there, our position in the market is there. Our unique offering is there, the direct awards are there. We've just talked about that there is more leverage to come both in terms of cycle time, which will improve project economics and improve the total available market but also in terms of our own internal cycle time and benefit and leverage, if you will, as we go more so conversion to 2.0 in iEPCI, neither of which are at 100% today and may never be exactly 100%, but will certainly be more than they are today. So look, let's just say, we remain very confident that we will continue on the path that we're on and have certainly, as we've said before, we've made comments like a major milestone on a more ambitious journey. And I really -- I just think it's fair if I stick with that kind of terminology today, but certainly no less confidence, if anything, even more conviction. I appreciate it. I know the few years out, but I had to ask. I also want to come back to the Subsea separation. It's exciting to talk about again. Can you help us think about the content uplift for FTI by putting the separation and reinjection on the sea floor? I imagine there's a range based upon what is actually done on the sea floor and content of the production stream. But just kind of what's the reasonable range for us to think about in terms of content uplift? Well, the way I would view it is we know that it's a $1 billion-plus award because that's how we classified it, right? So that was being done somewhere else, and if you will, on the top side today. So from an FTI, we don't do top sides or we do no engineering construction work whatsoever. So you just think of it at a minimum, you're taking a functionality that was being under the scope of someone else and putting it under the scope of FTI and then we're putting it on the sea floor. So that's kind of one aspect that I would kind of think about in terms of margin expansion. And again, if you say, well, what is the scale of that? Well, this is actually a brownfield project. It's not a greenfield project. So this is a brownfield project where you're seeing an incremental $1 billion scope coming to our company as a result of this unique offering and capability.
So that's -- you can't multiply that by very brownfield. But if you multiply it by just a few, that's a pretty dramatic uplift right there, Scott. And then the other kind of interesting thing and I alluded to when I said it was a brownfield versus a greenfield, but this is a $1 billion award that doesn't include a single Christmas tree. So we've often in the past, always thought about trees, and the trees -- tree count, there's a $1 billion award without a single tree. It really shows how this market is expanding in a very favorable way for the industry but also for our company. Your next question comes from the line of Bertrand Hodee with Kepler Cheuvreux. Doug. Two questions, if I may. So how should we think of your 2025 Subsea intermediate guidance when it comes to revenues? You had in mind, $8 billion ready to give us an uplift to that? And then the second question is on the free cash flow for Q4 was extremely strong. But you may have received a lot of down payment as now when I look at the balance sheet, your net contract liabilities are now close to $500 million as it was close to 0 in previous quarters. So how should we think of this item going forward? Sure. I'll touch on the 2025 question, and then I'll turn it over to Alf if he wants to add any color and then he can touch on the free cash flow as well. So on the 2025, look, we updated our inbound target through the end of 2025. That obviously gives greater conviction in the numbers that had previously been shared around 2025. And I'll let Alf maybe give you a little better view of kind of at a total company level, what one could expect but there are some things happening in our surface business as an example. And -- but there's also meaning the sale of the business and the implications but there's also some positive things happening on the Subsea side. But without giving any specific commenting specifically to the revenue target, I think we can give you directionally something very compelling. I'll pass it over to Alf. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Maybe just putting in context the subsea situation, really, we're coming off a strong growth in earnings this past year. We're looking forward to another strong year in 2024. We saw our backlog grow 50% and not only did the backlog growth, the quality of that backlog grew. We are building strong average margins in the backlog. And then on top of that, you are -- we are upgrading the $25 million previous target to $30 billion. And lastly, couple that with the positive momentum in our Subsea services business, all that adds up really to having just greater confidence overall in the Subsea outlook. And what Doug was talking about, I may call it a little bit similar to 2024, we do expect the lower service revenue due to the measurement solutions sale as well as some of the business rationalization we've done over the last 12 to 18 months. And clearly, we will [ to ] offset that by a higher relative earnings mix coming from Subsea in 2025.
And maybe I skip the free cash flow question. So let me get back to that. So first of all, you probably noted that part of the Q4 inflow they indeed come from advanced -- not necessarily advances, but us achieving milestone and progress payments on our Subsea business. And I don't necessarily consider it as a negative to build the contract liabilities activity that's a positive that we actually can run our business on a very neutral working capital basis for the whole company. So when you look forward, I certainly don't expect same kind of, call it, build in contract liabilities, but I do expect us to continue to be flow to positive, slightly positive in the working capital for the next year. Your last question comes from the line of up Saurabh Pant of Bank of America. Doug, if you don't mind, I think I don't remember if you said this or Alf said this in the prepared remarks, but Subsea revenues were really strong in the fourth quarter, and I think you noted the accelerated conversion of backlog in 4Q but can you comment on if that's project-specific one-off timing specific thing in the fourth quarter? Or is that a trend that we should be mindful of in terms of the timing of converting backlog into revenue going forward in Subsea? Sure. Obviously, a good story, and I'm going to Alf tell the story. So first of all, you're absolutely right. We did have, indeed, a very strong revenue quarter in Subsea basically a flat to the prior quarter. And partly that is due to actually experiencing less of the typical seasonal factors that we do have as headwinds going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But we also did have some projects that accelerated revenue more than it did. And I would -- that includes a mix of what I want to term legacy projects that are executed out of the backlog. And hence, maybe you also saw that the margin mix was not necessarily positive for the quarter. But it really was nothing that will affect the guidance that we have given forward looking, including anything we have talked about how our backlog will evolve over the next 2 years. Okay. Awesome. And then just one more. I know we spent a lot of time on Subsea processing today, but -- maybe an unrelated technology question. You also won the [ Sparta ] project recently. And I think if I'm not wrong, it's only the third 20 [ KPI ] project in the Gulf. I think [indiscernible] were the other ones, [indiscernible] how should we look at the opportunity? Because there is a good pipeline of these high-pressure projects in the Gulf. How should we look at that opportunity going forward, Doug? And how can FDI benefit from that? Excellent question. Spot on. Lower tertiary Gulf of Mexico, high pressure clearly is starting to move forward. We were excited to get the first award, which was the [ Shenandoah ] award, as you pointed out. So Sparta for Shell will not be our first delivery of 20,000 but it will be the first 20,000 iEPCI project. So super excited to have that as well and set that new milestone. Look, going forward, as you know, Chevron has assets -- shows assets, BP as assets, [ Beacon, LLOG ], both have assets, most of which are, we think, [indiscernible] of additional projects going forward. So yes, we don't speak to it as a new frontier, but it certainly is a new horizon within an existing frontier. And with that, I will turn the call to Matt Seinsheimer for closing remarks. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. I am very pleased with the strong performance in the quarter. which further highlights our continuing success in delivering on our commitments. Total company revenue for the first quarter was $2 billion. Total company adjusted EBITDA was $257 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.6% when excluding foreign exchange impacts. Total company inbound orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. In Subsea, we had a solid start to the year with first quarter orders of $2.4 billion representing a book-to-bill of 1.4. Importantly, a significant portion of our inbound was driven by new technologies, several of which were industry first for subsea that will help unlock opportunities in both new and mature offshore basins.
In January, we announced our first iEPCI for Petrobras. This 1 utilizing subsea processing for the MIDOR 3 HISEP development. The project represents a major industry milestone as it will be the first to use subsea separation to capture CO2 directly from the well stream for injection back into the reservoir, all of which will occur on the sea floor. During the quarter, we were also awarded the first iEPCI to utilize a 20,000 production system. This being for Shell's Sparta project in the Paleogene play in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The 20,000 PSI production system includes new technologies required to meet the demands of high-pressure, high-temperature reservoir conditions.
This marks our third award for 20,000 production equipment as clients look to produce from deeper waters and reservoirs in the maturing basin. The Paleogene formation spans the central and western regions of the Gulf of Mexico with reservoirs located in water depths that exceed 1,500 meters and generally exhibit higher pressures. The Paleogene has become 1 of the most productive and fastest-growing sources of supply in the Gulf. And it is estimated that 1 billion barrels of discovered reserves will require the use of 20,000 technology for development. We expect additional projects to successfully move forward over the next 24 months, representing yet another opportunity set for our company.
And finally, we announced an award from the Northern Endurance partnership to deliver the first all-electric subsea iEPCI, which is anticipated to be inbound in the second half of this year. The partnership, which is a joint venture between BP, Equinor and Total Energies, is building CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure for carbon capture projects in the U.K.'s East Coast cluster. Our all-electric solution will collect and feed the pressurized gas into an offer for permanent storage. All-electric systems drive simplification of the field design, enabling the reduction of infrastructure and installation time. through the removal of hydraulic components and simplified umbilicals.
The technology also enables the development of projects over long distances. With Northern Endurance, the power and controls to the subsea equipment will extend 145 kilometers from the onshore host facility. The award of an entirely all-electric subsea system is a significant achievement for both our company and the industry. Mero 3 HISEP, Sparta and Northern Endurance are all strong examples of our differentiated technology portfolio. Each of these projects provides a unique solution to an industry challenge. And it is this unique combination of innovative technologies and integrated execution that is creating new market opportunities for our company.
While project selectivity remains a critical objective, it is even more important that we successfully deliver on time and on budget as promised. As demonstrated by our financial performance in the quarter, Operational execution across the portfolio continues at a high level, driven in part, by this focus on project selectivity and the favorable impact it is having on the quality of orders in our backlog. Having both the right backlog and strong execution gives us confidence that we can capitalize on the strong market and achieve our financial targets.
Finally, we completed the sale of our measurement solutions business in March. In keeping with our commitment to shareholder distributions, a significant portion of the proceeds were allocated to repurchasing $150 million of shares in the first quarter. This brings our total shareholder distributions to $520 million in less than 2 years. And given this acceleration in share repurchases, we now expect total shareholder distributions in the current year to grow at least 70% when compared to the levels achieved in 2023.
I will now turn the call over to Alf. Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $2.8 billion, driven by $2.4 billion of subsea orders. Total company backlog increased sequentially to $13.5 billion. Revenue in the quarter was $2 billion. EBITDA was $257 million, when excluding a gain on the sale of our Measurement Solutions business of $75 million; restructuring, impairment and other charges totaling $5 million and a foreign exchange loss of $4 million. .
Turning to the segment results. In Subsea, revenue of $1.7 billion was largely flat versus the fourth quarter. Higher project activity in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico was largely offset by lower activity in the North Sea and Asia Pacific and reduced services revenue due to typical offshore seasonality. Adjusted EBITDA was $242 million, with a margin of 14%, up 90 basis points from the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was driven by strong execution and improved earnings mix from backlog.
In Surface Technologies, revenue was $307 million, down 14% sequentially. Revenue decreased due to the closing of the sale of measurement solutions before the end of the quarter, lower activity in North America and portfolio optimization in Latin America. Adjusted EBITDA was $41 million, a 21% decrease from the fourth quarter, driven by lower revenue from Measurement Solutions and lower activity in North America. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.5%, down 120 basis points versus the fourth quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $27 million when excluding charges of $5 million, which were primarily transaction-related costs associated with the sale of Measurement Solutions. Foreign exchange loss was $4 million. Net interest expense was $13 million, which benefited from higher average cash balances in the period. Tax expense in the quarter was $50 million. Cash required by operating activities was $127 million. The outflow follows the typical seasonal pattern of our business. Additionally, cash flow in the period included a payment of $56 million to the P&F. Similar payments will occur in the second and third quarters and will fulfill our remaining obligation.
Capital expenditures were $52 million. This resulted in free cash flow consumption of $179 million in the quarter. As Doug highlighted, we completed the sale of the Measurement Solutions in March. Proceeds from the sale were $186 million, with the majority being used for share repurchase. This drove a significant increase in total shareholder distributions in the first quarter to $172 million, which included $150 million for share repurchase and $22 million in dividends. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $697 million. Net debt was $327 million.
Now I will provide some thoughts on our outlook. Starting with the second quarter. For Subsea, we expect to benefit from the typical seasonal uplift as well as improved margins in backlog with sequential revenue growth of approximately $200 million and margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in line with the first quarter. This includes the impact of the sale of Measurement Solutions.
Now I will also give you an update to our full year outlook. Given the anticipated strength of our first half results and taking into account a range of outcomes, we now expect total company adjusted EBITDA to approximate $1.29 billion when excluding foreign exchange, an increase of approximately $40 million from the guidance we provided in February. Within this total company outlook, we see the following relative to the guidance provided in February. Subsea revenue and EBITDA margin both trending towards the upper half of the guidance ranges.
Both revenue and EBITDA margin for Surface Technologies as well as corporate expense remain on track for the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. Lastly, I want to discuss our current view of our capital structure. In March, we received an upgrade from Standard & Poor's to investment grade. This upgrade serves as a significant milestone for the company and reflects the tremendous efforts by the entire organization to materially deleverage the balance sheet and achieve investment-grade metrics. With this update, we are also revising our target capital structure to approximately $800 million of cash and $800 million of debt, together amounting to 0 net debt. This is a $500 million reduction versus our prior target and the level we can achieve over time as scheduled debt maturities come due.
Importantly, we believe this capital structure provides us with the flexibility to manage our operations and fund our capital needs while also delivering on our commitment to shareholder distributions.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Doug, I wanted to see if you could provide more details on Northern Endurance what do you think drove your success on the projects? Maybe more details on the scope and perhaps what technologies is FTI providing in terms of the CCS nature of that project? Look, this was -- as stated in my prepared remarks, a major milestone for our company but also for the industry. This will be the first application of an all-electric production system. We are extremely, extremely proud to have been selected. There was a very rigorous technical qualification are required to be able to be considered and to receive the award. And we're pleased that we came out on top of that qualification. Think of it as everything from the shore to the seafloor. We call it the integrated carbon transportation system. We have a specific CO 2.0 tree, so part of our 2.0 family. We have developed a configure to order CO2 injection tree.
It looks simplified compared to a traditional oil and gas tree, but it's actually very technical, particularly when it comes to the sealing surfaces because of the number of cycles that you will -- the number of times that you were opening close or would is called a cycle, the cycling of a valve in a CO2 injection tree is far, far greater than what you would do in a typical oil and gas development. So a higher technical standard. We were extremely pleased to be selected for that. And we have that entire scope and what's really interesting about it is the distance that is being traversed. There's over 145 kilometers, and there will be nothing floating on top of the water. In other words, we've taken it all subsea much like we did on the CCS project in Brazil. on the Hisetproject. It is just a major, major milestone where we are really driving the CCS market by enabling the seafloor to be a key component of these projects. Great, Doug. And I wanted to see if you could maybe comment in your prepared remarks, you talked about some new technologies that you're using to unlock opportunities in more mature basins. I was wondering if you can maybe expand upon that and maybe comment on what you see in some of the more mature basins? I know 1 of your peers talked about anticipating maybe an improvement in West Africa starting next year, but maybe if you could elaborate on that? Sure. So there's just the, I would call it, the traditional projects that are likely to be driven forward in mature basins given the project economics by doing it with an integrated with an integrated approach, what we call iEPCI, along with our 2.0 family, we can help unlock the economic value of those projects. But specifically, what I was referring to was in a mature basin there's really 2 opportunities is to find a different producing horizon. And in the case of the Paleogene, it's a deeper horizon, in the Gulf of Mexico, or it could just be a further step out from the host facility. And so what are the technologies that are the key enablers.
To get to the Paleogene, it's 20,000 and to have a full 20,000 production system fully qualified, supported by the regulators as well as our clients, major achievement. As noted, this is our third project. This is the first integrated 20,000 project to be awarded. And as alluded to in the script, we expect more to come in the future. When you look at the further step outs in a mature basin, that will be enabled by all-electric. So this will be the primary application in the traditional energy or the oil and gas environment when it comes to the all-electric production systems, again, enabling a much greater distance up to 3 to 4x further than you can do via using hydraulic controls to reach back to an existing host facility. So the 2 key technology enablers in this case being 20,000, and the all-electric.
In the case of HISEP, as we talked about in the first quarter, it was advanced CO2 separation, subsea separation technology, where we are separating and then reinjecting all on the seafloor. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Actually, I saw your results. I know how you're doing well. I wanted to start a little bit bigger picture. It's something we've talked about a bit in the past. With the backlog that you have now, all of these EPCI contracts coming through, how are you feeling about capacity? And are you starting to really lever into some of these joint ventures and partnerships to add to that capacity to make sure you can deliver on all those? James, a timely question. I would expect that you will see us utilize the support that we have within our ecosystem to be able to continue to grow and expand the iEPCI market. And just for those that are not as familiar with the terminology, ecosystem, we made a decision years ago that we would restructure the way that the subsea industry operated, both from the integrated projects, but also from the way that we would drive higher asset utilization and drive through cycle returns, to a standard that was not only higher than in the past, but sustainable. And the way we would do that was to work well with others. And that's the personality of our company. We're not a big monster. We work well with people. We have very deep relationships, and they're all trust-based, and we put a lot of time and effort into that. So what that's allowed us to do was to go out to other vessel operators introduce them to the iEPCI concept. And as the iEPCI market continues to grow and become a very significant portion of the total projects that are being awarded today giving -- providing access to our partners to work alongside us on those projects and deliver integrated projects. .
So that's what allows us to, if you will, expand beyond theoretical capacity in the installation portion of the projects, but there's also the manufacturing side of the projects. And this is the -- a significant benefit. And I think one that's not been fully understood, but as you see it showing up in our financial results now of the ability to be able to get leverage by using Subsea 2.0 configure to order. It runs through our plant at approximately double the cadence or 1/2 the time as a traditional 1.0, which is what the rest of the industry is building today. So they have to get additional capacity either through consolidation or by expanding their capital budgets and building plant whereas we've invested in the technology and the technology and then the system of going from an engineering to order to a configure to order allows us to have that additional cadence through the plant.
So again, allowing us to expand far beyond the traditional theoretical capacity. So look, we monitor the situation very closely. We're very open. We share it with our clients we're having very long-term discussions well beyond the time period that we would traditionally be having discussions, and they have the confidence to have those discussions with us because of this new operating model, and they see that we -- they understand that we are doing things that will allow us to have the capacity to be -- to continue to expand and deliver and support their projects. Okay. Got it. Very helpful, Doug. And then I thought the -- some of the first-time awards, particularly in the carbon capture side or fascinating. Could you maybe expand on this use of the C4 for CCS? And was this contemplated initially as we targeted these projects? And if so, are additional offshore projects all targeting that? And then is it the technology are you using kind of existing technology? Or is this new novel technology? Both great questions. So look, we've been working on this for quite some time. And James, as you know, we kind of we look at any challenge from the sea floor up. And I think we might be the only company that really takes that approach because most companies and quite frankly, most developers kind of think about onshore. And then if they go offshore, they want to have some sort of fixed bottom like a mono power or something that is touching the sea floor or if they go further offshore, they want to have some sort of a floating structure. We fundamentally believe the right way to do it is to eliminate the greenhouse footprint associated with those structures is to put everything on the seafloor, but it takes very advanced technology, material science, automation and controls that, quite frankly, there's very few places in the industry. But beyond the industry, in academia, et cetera, that really exists today.
And we're proud, that's where we operate. We're putting things 1 to 2 miles deep in the water on the sea floor, designed to last for 25- to 35-year life with all advanced automation, robotics and controls that, quite frankly, challenge anything that's being done in the industry or beyond the industry today. So when we look at a challenge like CCS, sure, we can be involved in a terrestrial project and happy to be involved in those projects. But fundamentally, we believe that the safest and best place to store the CO2 will be in say line or abandon depleted reservoirs, far offshore. And they exist. They're well known. You can then transport from shore all the way out to those into those injection fields all subsea without having any sort of a floating infrastructure. It's being demonstrated in the Northern Endurance partnership project, as we described.
From a technology point of view, it is important to note there are people that believe you can just reverse the flow and use existing oil and gas infrastructure, that's not true. It is much more of a technical challenge than that would make one believe. I talked a little bit about the tree and the tree design, The valves on the tree, as I explained. It also comes down to the control and automation and also the monitoring that's required on these projects. So we have developed an entire -- what we, again, call an integrated carbon transportation system that allows us to take it basically from the host facility to an injection point. And we would see -- we definitely see the trend and not just in CCS, but also in other forms of energy. And and new energies that are really for them to reach their fullest potential to achieve the scale that is required. We see this going offshore, and that is certainly the trend and one that we are helping to enable and we're proud to do so. Our next question comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. You recapped the [indiscernible] all-electric subsea already, and you have the first announcement with Northern Endurance for CCS? Luke, you dropped off, Luke. If you don't mind repeating the question, you dropped off, Luke. Yes, sure. Just talking about the first all electric system for Northern Endurance for CCS, when you kind of look at oil and gas, when can we start seeing the uptake for all-electric? And when you're speaking with customers, what are the pinch points if there are any on your chatting with them? The look, oil and gas is happening in parallel to the CCS opportunity. So you will see oil and gas opportunities using a Electric full field development, and I stress full field because keep in mind, we've been using electric actuation for many years, and we have over 600 electric actuators installed on subsea equipment around the world. So that part of it is not novel. But to go to a fully electric system, which would include an electric subsurface safety valve would be unique, and that's a partnership for us that we're working together with Halliburton to enable an all-electric subsea field development.
But again, there's commercial activity going on in parallel. So you will see more in that area also. I would stress, though, in the area of oil and gas that I see the bigger opportunities in the tiebacks. And why is that? Look, all-electric tree is more expensive than a electrohydraulically operated tree, for all the right reasons. Now when you look at it from a tieback point of view, those economics dissipate very quickly because in a long-distance tieback, the umbilical and the cost of the umbilical across that very long distance to be able to use hydraulic actuation would either be limiting. It would not be possible or it would be very costly. But when you look at it on a unit cost versus a unit cost, and all-electric tree is more expensive. So therefore, in a greenfield development, I think those opportunities will be there.
And -- but the big market, and I stress, it will be a significant market will be in the area of brownfield. We've talked about it before. If you look around the world at all the floating production assets that are today, FPSOs, FPSUs, they're producing at between 60% and 70% of nameplate capacity. All electric brownfield tiebacks will allow them to be able to bring that back up to near nameplate capacity without any significant capital cost. And we've gotten the cycle time now on those brownfield projects down to such a level slightly over 1 year that it makes the economics very, very compelling. Our next question comes from the line of Guillaume Delaby with Bernstein. Yes. Maybe a quick question regarding your new capital allocation policy. I'm not sure we can call it that way. So is it essentially resulting from, I would say, a better financial outlook or is there also some kind of underlying, I would say, strategic thinking behind it, so maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on that? And an associated question. Maybe I know it's time for capital discipline, but are you still considering or do you make consider to do some small targeted acquisitions again in the coming quarters? So let me start with the second part, Guillaume, and thank you for the questions. Look, we have and will continue to do small targeted acquisitions. But in most cases, we're taking small investments in early start-ups. Often, it doesn't cost any capital because we're using a few financial capital because we're using human capital. The greatest currency we have in our company today is our subsea engineering. It is very unique to our company. And we have, by far, the most significant and most experienced and talented workforce. .
So often, we can trade, if you will, subsea engineering hours to a company who's trying to tackle this challenge of how do I go from being a terrestrial developer to being an offshore developer. Things change quite a bit. And we have that knowledge, particularly when it comes to dynamic design, and I won't get into the details of that, but that's a major component. And then also, obviously, putting things onto the sea floor. I'm going to have outweigh in on the first part of your comment. But I do want to comment, Guillaume, there were 2 major messages that Alf delivered earlier. One, we were upgraded by S&P; and two, we are targeting net 0 in terms of our net debt. So 2 major milestones, but I'll pass it over to Alf. Yes. Doug, thank you. And maybe just to build on that. So today, so we have a gross debt of just above $1 billion and a net debt of EUR 327 million. And we have previously stated that we will operate this company on $800 million of cash. And further, as Doug said, believes that the net debt neutral position us, and it would imply that we would reduce debt by a little more than $200 million -- reduced that by a little bit more than $200 million from the current $1 billion level. And so this is, call it, an intermediate-term target and not necessarily where we need to be immediately.
And we certainly have debt that is going to mature over the next 2 years that will take us there naturally. I will also emphasize that given our business outlook and the strong cash generation, we see ahead, we continue to believe that share repurchases remains one of our best uses of funds, and we demonstrated that by distributing the majority of the measurement solutions proceeds here in the first quarter, but we also remain committed to achieving investment grade. And as Doug said, we achieved an upgrade to investment grade from S&P now just in March.
But overall, when you think about it longer term and strategically and maybe that's what you're asking, with expected growth in EBITDA and with the debt keeps on coming down from current levels, clearly expect to be below 1 time gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio as we go forward. . Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. I wanted to ask about sort of your scope opportunity on large projects. And I'm looking at the WhiptailAward and the Yau earlier I think you had expected them to be over $1 billion of inbound and they ended up being $500 million to $1 billion. I suspect what might be going on there is some of the scope that you anticipated to get didn't materialize for you on to competitors. But could you maybe address that? And then talk about for your direct awards, sort of what scope you're getting right now versus maybe what your opportunity could be over time? Look, that's an important question. If it's on your mind, then we need to clarify it. So I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to clarify it. The Subsea opportunity list that we publish every quarter is published from an industry perspective. Think of it as the rig count, if you will. So we're trying to demonstrate to give people, the opportunity to be able to see the opportunity set that exists within the subsea industry. Therefore, when we put that out, that's not what we expect or what we anticipate -- it's -- these are tenders. These are projects that are being tendered by our clients, and the full scope of that is reflected in the value of those awards or we place the value, if you will, we use purple, blue and red on our chart.
So hopefully, that clarifies this is just what the company happens to be tendering. We may or may not be targeting the full scope of the project. In many cases, we are. What's important also to understand is that is a subset of the opportunity list for TechnipFMC. Now that is the full opportunity set for the competition. But for TechnipFMC, because we are an integrated company, because we have iEPCI, because we do integrated FEED studies, we have the ability to enter into an exclusive proprietary integrated FEED study that upon completion, assuming we achieve the economical hurdle rate, for the project and the project receives FID, that project is then direct awarded to our company. Those aren't on the Subsea opportunity list.
Occasionally, one might show up on there just because it's such a well-known project. We need to put it out there. But because these are direct awards and proprietary to us, they're not on that opportunity list. So we have a second opportunity list that we look at every day, and that's really what drives the performance of our company and quite frankly, the performance and why our inbound numbers often surprise to the upside. So just to give you a little bit of an idea of which there's really 2 lists, we're looking at one, the world is looking at the other.
We may not be tendering some of the projects, by the way, on the Subsea opportunity list because we may not think that they're projects that we can contribute to greatest value to, meaning integrated or Subsea 2.0 or whatever it may be or we may be concerned about something about the project. So we may or may not tender those as well. As far as the scope, I think you know we have the most comprehensive. We can do an entire subsea project. We don't have to bring in a third party or by a third-party key components. We've talked about it before, the ability to be able to have the entire SPS, the entire SURF, both products and installation capability. makes us and positions us uniquely. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Maybe just a quick follow-up with respect to Mark's question, right? So again, in the most recent past, you guys have given some your outlook regarding what you would anticipate your subsea order book to look like over the course of the next couple of years that wasn't explicitly referenced in this call. However, given the dynamics at play where you talk about quality over quantity, and then you talk about new technologies, unlocking new business opportunities. I was wondering if you might be able to give us some update on how that -- on how the order outlook has changed or if it has changed at all? Again, Kurt, much like Marc, thank you for clarifying because we do our best to communicate effectively, but you learn as well. So the fact that we did not mention that we have a target of $30 billion of orders for 3 years through 2025 or that we remain very confident in achieving our 2024 guidance of approaching $10 billion of orders. Us not saying it, we thought was a strong message that we're very confident, but let me be very clear we remain very, very confident. In terms of the feed activity in terms of the tendering activity and in terms of the, I would say, very mature, meaning late-stage pre-FID conversations that I'm having with clients today and I'm not complaining about it, Marc, but I'm very, very busy. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. One for Alf. With the profitability of the business improving, the tax rate should trend towards a more normalized level over time. And we have the guidance for this year, how should we think about the evolution of the tax rate in '25 and '26, where could that fall to in the years ahead? So thanks for the question on the taxes here. So first of all, maybe just point out, if you look at the effective tax rate for the quarter, there is a little bit of a timing effect of it being a little bit lower than normal in this quarter. So first of all, we stand behind our guidance of $280 million to $290 million for 2024. And if you consider the growth in EBITDA, et cetera, that we are projecting, I'd say that this is implying a roughly 35% effective tax rate for the year with our current earnings mix as planned.
As we talked about a little bit before, we are targeting a normalized tax rate of 30%, and I would continue to build on that or model on that if you're looking for the out years it largely will come from a combination of earnings mix and some other utilization of tax opportunities that we couldn't take advantage of in the past. So overall, we remain confident to drive towards a 30% normalized tax rate. And how long do you think it would take to get there? Is that something that's possible in '25 or in '26? You're in the right ballpark of somewhere in that between those 2 years, yes. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Becker with Capital One. Doug, you previously mentioned that all-electric subsea production systems could result in incremental tieback opportunities of $8 billion through 2030. I was just hoping you could frame maybe a realistic or risk opportunity as you see it today for FTI? Yes. Thanks, Doug. Yes, that number is probably a little stale actually at this point. I would say there's upside to that number in terms of -- we put that out in, I think, 2021. Clearly, All-Electric and the adoption and qualification of all-electric is now. We've pretty much covered our entire client base. And that takes some time. It's obviously developing the technology, but then qualifying it and then getting your customers aligned.
In terms of -- I don't have a hard set year-by-year kind of how I see that developing yet. It might still be a little bit early, but obviously, getting the first award was key, that being in the CCS environment, not in the brownfield tieback environment. But as I said, things are being bid in parallel today between CCS and traditional energy. So there'll be more to come. But look, Doug, we remain very confident.
And this one, I'll be honest, this one is a little bit of a no-brainer. If you're sitting with an existing host facility that's aging every day, that you can get some additional hydrocarbon to flow through and obviously improve the financial results and leverage the cost of that capital investment that you may have made many years ago it just makes sense. So we're kind of in a unique position. We have a lot of the infrastructure. You know over 50% of the world's infrastructure on the sea floor.
So we're in a unique position to really try to help to kind of marry up somebody that has a, what would be called a stranded asset, simply meaning it was too far away from a host facility to be able to be economically produced and could not support its own host facility because of the CapEx required to do so to be able to marry that up with somebody that has a production asset. And that's certainly what we're doing today in the conversations that we're having. No, that certainly sounds encouraging. Is it reasonable to expect an all-electric award on the oil and gas side this year or more of a 2025 award? We'd like to think about things in 24-month time frame just to be a little bit conservative, but you could see something on the shorter end of that for an all-electric oil and gas award or a project being FID. I do think you could see that. again, up to our customers when the FID. But if I just think about the commercial discussions and the maturity of those discussions, and that's what I meant by in parallel, meaning it wouldn't be too far out. Got it. And then just a quick one. Alf, the free cash flow loss was narrower than at least I expected to that consensus expected in the context that Subsea is toward the upper half of the guidance range. For free cash flow, is that trending toward the upper half or midpoint still the best place to anchor? So first of all, on free cash flow, you're right. We had a strong first quarter for being us at least. The net outflow represents really of 179 really represents a solid start for the year for us. And because it is typically our seasonally most weak quarter that we have. And also point out that we did have the $56 million payment towards the legal settlement that affected the quarter. So overall, we feel really good about where we are. And I expect, obviously, to build during the year. We typically trend up during the year, and you will see the majority of the cash flow generation in the second half of the year.
And clearly, as we grow EBITDA, and in particular in Subsea, we expect to see a little bit of additional conversion of free cash flow from EBITDA. So -- and we typically use the 50% ratio is where we operationally sit today. So if you want to use that as an approximation. But we're not ready to officially take up free cash flow. There is always working capital dynamics and other things that lead to the end of the year. And again, if you look at our business profile, if fourth quarter will still be the big quarter to determine the overall cash flow for the year. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Thomson with Exane BNP Paribas. I had a question on HISEP. I mean now that the contract has been awarded and clearly, your part of the technology has been qualified with Petrobras. Can you talk about the sort of conversations you're having with that client around using the technology in other fields, anything specific to flag? And have you had any interest from other clients in Brazil or internationally about using a similar technology? The answer is yes and yes is the short answer, but I'll give you a little bit of color around it. Clearly, Petrobras is approaching this as a design one, build many, obviously, a benefit of being part of this first award. But they clearly see this as an opportunity to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity first and foremost, but also in the case of the Mero 3 project because it's an existing in an existing field or a brownfield, if you will, it also allows to debottleneck and increase production at the same time. But I don't want to speak too much on behalf of my clients, but I can assure you, Petrobras has stated and very much see this technology as 1 that they are going to use multiple times.
Interest from other clients. First of all, there were partners in the Merrell 3 project, a very well-known large world-class companies as well along with Petrobras.
So they've obviously been intimately involved and are supportive of the technology and obviously supportive of the project, they provided partner approval for the -- so we have those who are quite intimately included. And I'll tell you, just recently, I traveled actually with a client to Brazil because they wanted to learn more about it. Now they won't be using it in Brazil. they would be using this type of technology outside of Brazil, but they were so interested and I was more than happy to participate in that visit with them.
And with the support of Petrobras, we were able to share with them some of the good things that we're doing and what we've done in terms of the development of the technology. So again, short answer, yes and yes, and if I can squeeze in a follow-up. This time on the surface business in Saudi Arabia after the Aramco MSC 12 announcement, I mean given the incremental spending is going onshore unconventional gas from an offshore market where you don't compete. I mean this seems like an incremental positive for your particular mix in the Middle East. But can you confirm your sort of readiness to respond to that incremental onshore demand for surface equipment? And how does the opportunity in Saudi compared to your expectations for demand before the announcement from Aramco? Sure. And Daniel, maybe just to clarify for everyone, in Saudi Arabia, that business falls under our Surface Technologies business. And when we think about wellheads and trees, if they don't get wet, i.e., if they don't go below the water surface, then that falls under our surface business. So our business in Saudi Arabia is primarily an onshore business. That's what we do. And actually, we're very, very good at it. So the reduction in the jackup market and the reduction in some of the offshore activity.
It does affect us because, again, they typically are produced from a production platform, so it's a dry tree. But the number of wells versus for the CapEx dollars spent versus the number of wells that can be drilled for the same amount of CapEx on land. The latter is obviously far greater. So from our perspective, I'm only answering from our perspective, selfishly a shift to land CapEx from offshore CapEx is very favorable to our company. Think of it as simple as we sell product that allows a well to be safely and environmentally appropriately produced.
And so we get paid by the wellbore, if you will, and that's what matters. In addition, gas is important to us. our revenue per unit sold is higher in gas than it is in oil. So the shift to gas is favorable. And in unconventional gas, we are able to provide additional products around the fracturing and the stimulation side of it as well. So it expands our, let's say, revenue per well. So that's how the market works for us.
Now more importantly, and as you've been following the company, we decided to make a strategic investment in Kingdom to bring manufacturing capacity from Asia to the Kingdom. We continue to ramp up our new facility, and that has gone very successfully. We've not yet reached its fullest potential, and we anticipate further improvement in the second half of the year. So Saudi Aramco remains very important to us. The Kingdom is a key contributor to our surface international business, and we're very well positioned. And quite frankly, some of the announcements have been favorable from our perspective. Our next question comes from the line of Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Doug, maybe let's spend a little time on the quality of the backlog that you've been talking about on the subsea side, right? I think it's a little bit and resulted pulling the margins you are delivering, but also the new technology work that you're winning. So if you can spend a moment on a phrase you mentioned in your press release that the heightened focus on project selectivity, how are you doing that? What's the focus? Is it more about terms and conditions? Or are we talking about just integrated projects versus the stand-alone projects? Sure. Great question. We talk about it every day. as we look at the different opportunities that we have in front of us. Look, it's a combination of all of the above. But let's start with the main thing that really drives we would deem as quality because we believe -- and we've demonstrated it's best for the project in terms of shortening cycle time, accelerating time to first production and it greatly simplifies our execution model is the Subsea 2.0 configured to order. So clearly, the higher the 2.0 orders, the higher the quality the backlog. And that allows us to go from engineer to order to configure to order.
As I've talked about before on this call, that allows us to eliminate 9 months of engineering. So we take a 1.0 order, which is how the rest of the industry is operating, they have to spend 9 months or we would have to spend 9 months doing detailed engineering because you're building a first article. It's never been built before. So you have to go through that before you place a single purchase order with the Subsea 2.0 configure to order a platform. And again, you can't just say, I have it.
You have to have a platform, you have to have critical scale that allows you to not only simplify the internal, as I talked about, putting twice the volume through our existing manufacturing footprint but it also allows us to simplify and to secure a much more reliable and competent partners in our supply chain. So it's really a combination of the 2 that lead to the quality. In addition to that, an integrated project, we just have many more levers. We take on the full scope. We have the ability to be able to schedule activity that best works for us, and that's why it was so important to consummate the relationship and create TechnipFMC because very difficult to do when you're not a single entity with a single set of financial reporting and a single set of objectives because then you have underlying competing interest. So we have that.
And then on top of that, sure. The terms and conditions of the contracts are important. Our customers understand that. We've talked in the past about what we've done to ensure that the things are being shared in the most appropriate way. And for instance, when it comes to inflation, we put in place several parameters that allow us to be more confident that we're not going to be surprised on that side. So all in all, it's a combination of the 3, but it's very clear for us where our focus is, and as you hear us announce these iEPCI and iEPCI 2.0 and 2.0 awards, it's just very, very favorable to the future and to the assurity of our execution. No, that's very helpful. Just a very quick follow-up, Doug. I know your $30 billion in your order outlook for subsea that does not include any of the frontier basins. But the new flow, especially from Namibia has been particularly positive. Can you share any updated thoughts on your outlook in terms of the front year basis? I know it's beyond '25, but any updated thoughts there? Sure. lots of discussion, lots of activity. We're using our playbook from Guyana and Mozambique, both of which we were the first mover. We understand how to do this in these emerging markets. We're executing the same playbook in the other emerging markets. And I would say, net-net, from most recently, the indications from our clients that they have stated publicly, I'm not saying anything that's not public I would say, is more favorable trending in a very favorable fashion. So we look forward to the contribution from those emerging markets in the latter part of the decade. Our last question will come from the line of Bertrand Hodee with Kepler Chevreux. I have probably a follow-up on Namibia. Based on your early discussion and clearly no need to mention any operator name here. But conceptually, from your understanding, do you believe it will require specific technologies and/or the iEPCI model or Subsea 2.0 will be well suited for future Namibia development? Look, the -- speaking of Namibia in particular, the one well-known challenge will be the water depth. So these are very deep. It's very deep within the operating parameters of 2.0, so no concern there. And certainly, we believe the iEPCI model, as we've demonstrated in other emerging markets is clearly a very favorable model and 1 that we would expect would unlock the greatest value and accelerate time to first oil for our customers, which drives their project economics.
So iEPCI 2.0, but working very closely with our clients. So they're obviously learning as they're doing their extended well tests in terms of the producibility of the reservoirs, the compartmentalization, the geochemistry. So there's things we're learning along the way, but we are actively engaged with them to ensure that we'll be ready to provide the world-class subsea support. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Seinsheimer. This concludes our fourth quarter conference call.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call.
Our quarterly results reflect strong operational performance throughout the company. Subsea inbound orders were robust $2.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially for both Subsea and Surface Technologies.
Results were particularly strong in Subsea where adjusted EBITDA margin improved 370 basis points sequentially to 17.7%, which is a level of performance we expect to continue in the third quarter. With these results, Subsea is now trending above the high end of our prior full year guidance range, and Alf will provide further details on guidance in his prepared remarks.
As highlighted in our earnings release earlier today, we now expect Subsea EBITDA -- Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin to exceed 16.5% in the current year. Let me put that number in context.
At our Analyst Day in 2021, we provided a longer-term outlook that included the potential for a 450 basis point improvement in our Subsea EBITDA margin over the next 4 years. Delivering on our updated guidance for 2024 will represent an improvement of at least 600 basis points in just 3 years. The much improved performance has resulted from the bold steps we took to create a new business model that reshaped the subsea industry and to deliver innovative technologies such as Subsea 2.0 that further improve project economics. And today, those actions continue to provide sustainable differentiation for TechnipFMC, driving results higher than what could be achieved through a market recovery alone.
Continuing with total company financial highlights in the quarter. Revenue was $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $379 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.3% when excluding foreign exchange impacts. Total company inbound was $3.1 billion.
Subsea orders in the quarter were driven by partner collaboration and long-standing partnerships. Inbound included iEPCI projects for Woodside Xena Phase 3 and Energean's Katlan Catlin development, both repeat clients of the integrated model. We were also awarded over 100 kilometers of flexible pipe from Petrobras, which is incremental to the volume associated with our existing frame agreements.
Further expansion in Guyana also contributed significantly to quarterly inbound with the award of ExxonMobil's Whiptail project, which will utilize Subsea 2.0 systems and manifolds. Importantly, Whiptail represents more than just another sizable project in the period. It is the sixth project sanction in the stable block in just 7 years. Given the importance of Guyana to TechnipFMC, I would like to share how we established our presence in country, focusing on the development of partnerships and our people.
In 2016, before the start of any tendering activity, we partnered with ExxonMobil to demonstrate the value of collaboration and innovation. That same year, we began hiring our first class of engineers from the University of Guyana and created training programs to support the further development of local employees. We continue to invest in our people. And as of today, approximately 80% of our workforce is local Guyanese with nearly half of management positions held by local talent. This team has been highly successful in establishing our business in country, including the completion of our state-of-the-art services facility in Georgetown, which is also staged to support further expansion.
We are honored to be the premier supplier of subsea systems and services in Guyana. Based on our delivery track record, ExxonMobil has awarded TechnipFMC the subsea production systems for all 6 developments. And we have already delivered more than 100 Subsea trees for these projects with a similar number in our backlog. In addition to these production-related projects, we were also awarded scope for ExxonMobil's gas-to-energy project, which will help the country utilize its natural gas resources for domestic power generation and other industrial uses.
Our success in the region has allowed us to establish a strong reputation for meeting the accelerated schedule requirements of an emerging basin. Importantly, our commitment, collaboration and innovation have created a winning playbook for local development, one we also exported to Mozambique for the execution of the region's first offshore project, ENI's Coral South development. And we will utilize this very same approach in the emerging basins that follow with strong potential for countries like Suriname and Namibia. This playbook leverages our know-how and capabilities to support our customers globally and doing so in the right way.
For TechnipFMC, it's not about building capacity and growing headcount. It's about developing people and creating an advantaged ecosystem that provides growth and opportunities for decades to come. Successes like Guyana have also driven growth in our backlog. At quarter end, total company backlog was $13.9 billion, a record level for TechnipFMC, driven by a book-to-bill above 1 in 10 of the last 11 quarters. We are well positioned for Subsea orders to approach $10 billion for the year, also giving us continued confidence in achieving $30 million in orders over the 3-year period ending 2025, and we expect this will drive further growth in backlog.
Client discussions remain focused on project activity that extends beyond 2025 as they look to secure capacity for future phases of their developments towards the end of the decade. There is also momentum in new offshore frontiers, which are likely to yield additional inbound well beyond the orders we are discussing today.
Moving to Surface Technologies. Here, we also demonstrated solid performance in the period. Despite the sale of measurement solutions in the first quarter, we experienced sequential growth in both revenue and EBITDA margin. We are seeing tangible benefits from the targeted actions taken to optimize our portfolio in the Americas. And in the Middle East, the growth we anticipated is now occurring, allowing us to further utilize our new in-country capacity. When coupled with our first half results, the improved visibility gives us even greater confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year expectations.
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our second quarter results. The strong financial performance in the period clearly demonstrates the solid momentum we are experiencing in our execution. But more importantly, this success reflects the bold steps we have taken that provide us with unique market visibility, improved commercial success and enhanced operational insight, all of which we expect will drive higher and more sustainable returns for our company.
The steady improvement in our results has also led to the recent achievement of a second investment-grade rating, and this serves as further confirmation of our financial strength. And these factors when combined with the proven success of our playbook will allow us to capitalize on the expanding opportunities that extend beyond the decade.
I will now turn the call over to Alf to discuss the financial results and the favorable impacts to our 2024 outlook. Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $3.1 billion, driven by $2.8 billion of Subsea orders. Total company backlog increased sequentially to $13.9 billion. Revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion. EBITDA was $379 million when excluding a foreign exchange loss of $18 million and restructuring impairment and other charges totaling $2 million.
Turning to segment results. In Subsea, revenue of $2 billion increased 16% versus the first quarter. The sequential improvement was largely driven by increased iEPCI project activity in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Services revenue also increased primarily due to seasonal improvement. Adjusted EBITDA was $357 million with a margin of 17.7%, up 370 basis points from the first quarter. The sequential increase was due to strong execution, improved earnings mix from backlog and higher project and services activity.
In Surface Technologies, revenue was $316 million, an increase of 3% sequentially. The revenue improvement was primarily driven by increased activity in the Middle East, largely offset by the absence of revenue from the Measurement Solutions business disposed of in March. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, up 11% versus the first quarter. The improvement was driven by increased volume in the Middle East, largely offset by the absence of measurement solutions. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.5%, up 100 basis points versus the first quarter.
Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was $24 million, net interest expense was $21 million and tax expense in the quarter was $59 million. Cash flow from operating activities was $231 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $180 million in the quarter.
Total shareholder distributions in the quarter were $122 million, including $100 million of share repurchases. This brings year-to-date distributions to $293 million, nearly a 20% increase versus all of last year. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $708 million. Net debt declined sequentially to $260 million.
In June, we received an investment grade rating of BBB- from Fitch. This announcement follows a ratings upgrade to investment grade from S&P in early March. With investment-grade ratings from two agencies, the company will now benefit from lower interest rates and fees and the elimination of all collateral requirements for both our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and $500 million letter of credit facility. Importantly, we now have access to the lower-cost investment-grade bond market for any future term debt needs.
Moving to our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for both Subsea and Surface Technologies to be in line with the second quarter. For the full year outlook, we are providing several updates to our guidance. In Subsea, we are increasing our guidance range for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Subsea revenue is now guided in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 16.5% to 17%.
In Surface Technologies, we continue to expect revenue at the midpoint of the existing guidance range, and we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper half of the range. When these items are taken together, we now anticipate total company full year adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1.35 billion when excluding foreign exchange.
Given this higher level of financial performance, we are also increasing our guidance range for free cash flow to now be in the range of $425 million to $575 million, which includes the P&F payments approximating $170 million. Importantly, we fulfilled this obligation with a final payment made in early July.
Let me now address our outlook for Subsea in 2025. We do expect to exceed our guidance calling for Subsea revenue of $8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 18%. We will update our 2025 view for both metrics with our third quarter results in October. And in keeping with prior practice, we will provide the remainder of our 2025 financial guidance with our fourth quarter earnings.
In closing, our strong execution was particularly notable in the quarter, and this should serve us well given the continued growth in backlog to $13.9 billion which is the highest level achieved since the formation of TechnipFMC. The increase in our full year estimate for adjusted EBITDA to $1.35 billion equates to a nearly 45% increase over the prior year when excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and the expected increase in our free cash flow generation further supports our outlook for at least a 70% increase in shareholder distributions versus the prior year while still allowing for a further reduction in net debt.
Operator, you may now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Steady stream of announcements in FIDs going on during the quarter. Clearly, you're very confident in the $30 billion in orders with the 2025 target with Guyana and Brazil at the core. But I want to ask you about the sustainability of this market beyond that. And you touched on that a little bit, but I'm just kind of curious how you see Subsea evolving beyond just kind of what you can see in front of you?
You mentioned New Frontiers, Namibia, Suriname, maybe kind of -- what other basins are you eyeing for that next leg? Is the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean, something else? And kind of related to that, where do you see electric trees and kind of electric funds Subsea fitting in that and creating new opportunities for you? Is there certain markets, maybe certain applications that are best suited for electric?
So just sort of thinking beyond kind of how long this market can kind of go on for you in terms of Subsea? Thank you, Dave. Let me kind of walk through a few growth opportunities in the Subsea market as we see them playing out. You have the new horizons within the existing basins. So last quarter, we talked about the Paleogene and the strength of the Paleogene not only in our current orders, but potentially in upcoming orders as well.
And you'll see that more and more where within an existing basin, operators will look for other opportunities, other horizons, other reservoirs to develop. And in this case, a great example of that is the Paleogene in the Gulf of Mexico, which continues to be quite attractive.
The second area is really as you start to look at growth opportunities within existing basins, but relatively new to the mix and Guyana is obviously the leading example of that, but also Mozambique. There's been a successful project completed in Mozambique. We would anticipate additional activity in Mozambique. And as that unlocks, I think Mozambique could surprise to the upside in terms of activity.
And then you get into the emerging basins. And now realize you're now getting towards 2028 and beyond. And this is kind of what keeps the durability of the cycle. And that's when you start -- I should -- let me add Suriname in the second bucket. It's likely to come a bit earlier than the others, but also a very prolific opportunity. And then you start to look at the other basins, and that's where you -- obviously, Namibia is one everyone's talking about, South Africa, Tanzania, Colombia, Mexico, Eastern Med, there's a lot of activity out there and a lot of gas-focused activity out there that will likely continue to occur towards the latter part of the decade and into the beginning of the next decade.
So lots of activity, lots of durability in this cycle, largely enabled by improved project economics. We support that through our iEPCI and Subsea 2.0 offering by accelerating the time to first oil and significantly derisking the execution. That's the customer's primary focus today.
Let's say most are opportunity rich, certainly, the offshore space is opportunity-rich today. So what they're really looking for is to partner and collaborate with companies that they are confident in the -- that they can deliver per schedule to ensure that the project economics remain very favorable. I'm humble to say our track record there has been exceptional, which has led to 70% of our business being direct awarded, but also multiple direct multiple repeat orders from existing clients on both the iEPCI and the 2.0.
All electric, as you mentioned, is also extremely exciting. We've actually seen 2 awards now. We announced the first award in the first quarter and there was an award also announced here this quarter as well. Both are great examples of how our electric will create additional opportunities. The first is in the CCS market. We believe that will be the primary market for the all-electric subsea system. And the reason why is just the long extended reach that's required.
So the project that we're excited to be working on is the BP Northern Endurance partnership project, where we'll be the -- gas will be -- the CO2 will be taking sequester from the emitter onshore, and we'll be taking that 145 kilometers offshore and storing it permanently and safely for the future. So to be able to achieve 145-kilometer distance could only be done with an all-electric system.
In the oil and gas market, the all-electric -- the primary market will be in Brownfield Tiebacks. This will be the same idea that you can go a bit further with electric controls than you can with hydraulic controls, a greater distance, if you will. And we approximate that to be about 4x the distance that you can go with hydraulic controls. So if you look around the world today, most of the oil and gas production facilities are only operating at about 60% to 70% of nameplate capacity. That's not unusual. That's because reservoirs decline over time. So they're designed for the initial production, which is the highest level and then it declines over time.
By being able to expand, if you will, the radius by 4x around those hose facilities with an all-electric brownfield or tieback solution, we'll be able to tie back stranded reservoirs -- reservoirs that would otherwise be stranded, we'll be able to tie those back to these existing host facilities which will have very attractive economics as well. So very excited about the future, both in terms of new energy as well as in terms of conventional energy in the offshore market. Great. Maybe I can kind of shift over on the surface side. You mentioned Middle East a couple of times in the release. You built-- I believe you have a new facility that's in country. So Middle East, is the opportunity set mostly in Saudi as we're seeing kind of some of the unconventional gas basins build-out.
And I guess, secondarily, is there opportunity from this facility, can you export to other regions in the Middle East? What's the strategy overall as you look at Middle East into Surface business over the next couple of years? Thanks, Dave. Timely question. I just returned from Saudi Arabia. So look -- so the first part of your question, no, it's not just Saudi Arabia. Just as importantly for us is the UAE and the activity level is fairly similar between the UAE as well as within the Kingdom. And also Qatar, Qatar there's a lot of activity. Although these are offshore platforms, they're dry trees. The trees are on top of the platform.
So technically, it's offshore that again, because it's a dry tree, it doesn't go under the water. That's part of our Surface business line. But for us, certainly, Saudi and the UAE are really, really important. We have local facilities in both. Both are ramping up as we speak which is why we're beginning to see the real benefit and the strength of that. And I can just say, following my visit here just real time, the opportunity set is significant for the Surface business, and we're really beginning to see and get the payback on the investment that we've made. Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. My first question, I was wondering if you could go through the drivers of the guidance raise in 2024 on the Subsea side. Would love to better understand what drove the $300 million increase in the revenue, and more importantly, just the drivers of the EBITDA margin raise between maybe pricing, better cycle times, a better mix. I'd love to get more specifics around that? Sure. Arun, this is Alf here. I'll start. So first of all, very pleased with the quarter. Sequentially, Subsea revenue up 16% and not only from seasonal factors, but also from very strong operational performance.
If you look at the revenue increase, majority of the revenue increase is really due to our iEPCI revenue coming through, in particular, in North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. And when you consider that this is really us demonstrating our ability to convert this higher quality backlog that we've been talking about and really realizing the financial benefits that also includes the fact that we are going for shorter cycle times in that -- in our operating model and meaning we are demonstrating ability to convert to revenue at a faster pace as well.
Then if you look at kind of the 370 basis points sequentially up. Again, it's just a pull-through from these improved efficiencies as well as Subsea services business that has continued to be solidly strong. So all in all, when you look at the raise, it's the first half strong performance, demonstrating to ourselves what we are able to do and then we continue to have a favorable outlook, and that's again why we are raising our guidance to the range as I gave of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion for revenue and the 16.5% to 17% for the EBITDA margin. Great. A follow-up question. Doug, you elaborated in your prepared remarks on the successful formula that you've put together in Guyana with a Whiptail, now the sixth award in Hammerhead still on your project list.
I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on this formula, as you think about Suriname, Namibia and Mozambique, interested to hear your comments that, in a lot of cases, not just the technical specs that you meet with some of the ecosystem that you build, some of the local content. So I was wondering to see if you could elaborate on some of these softer but important elements that you take on to secure project awards. Thank you, Arun, and thanks for the question. I emphasized it in the script because it's who we are as a company. Again, this isn't about assets or equipment or vessels or people, headcount. This is about the development of talent, giving people an opportunity to improve their lives, to improve the economic well-being of their families, as well as giving them the training and the development so that they can be running operations and taking responsibility in the countries in which we operate in.
Guyana is just a phenomenal example of that. As I indicated, we were hiring at the university before there was any tender. Was there a risk associated with that? Of course, there was. But we were taking the Guyanese talent and training them in the Gulf of Mexico on ExxonMobil projects or in Brazil and other Subsea projects so that they would have the proper training. So that when the activity started, we weren't just doing it with 4 expat crews. And more importantly, by the time activity really began, we were able to put our 100% Guyanese crews led by Guyanese managers offshore.
The ecosystem we talked -- you brought up, which I appreciate is also about working with academia in these countries at all levels, as one is the supply chain. Developing a supply chain, it is in many cases exclusive to our company now within these countries providing us to support that we need to be successful. All of this obviously benefits the countries in which we operate and not just for the duration of the projects, but again, trying to create a sustainable advantage for the future.
Quite frankly, that's what drives me. That's what gets me excited about moving into these emerging basins. Sure, there's revenue and there's profit opportunities. We all understand that. But what's more important is what we leave behind. Your next question comes from the line of Luke Lemoine from Piper Sandler. Doug, I'll touch a little bit with the '25 Subsea margins expected to exceed the 18%. You've previously discussed some of the additional drivers in the coming years. But could you talk about where the 2.0 line utilization is? And this might be tough without quantifying, maybe framing how increasing production and utilization through the line, helps propel margins further? Sure. Thanks, Luke. This is a lot of what we're experiencing right now and realize we're still in the very early phases of realizing the benefits of not only the 2.0 configure to order, but the overall changes in the operating model of the company, including our focus on SSI, sustainability, industrialization and standardization. And what we're seeing and experiencing now is the result of that. And as we see more 2.0 orders being inbounded and then ultimately floating through the facilities, we expect to see continued, if you will, even greater benefit than we're seeing today, which Alf alluded to the quality of the projects and really beginning to see the results of those in the operational performance, hence, raising the guidance.
But if we just -- if we just look at 2.0 alone, we can also look at iEPCI by the way because it's just as important or you could look at iEPCI 2.0 projects, which most are now becoming iEPCI 2.0. But when you look at those factors, let's start with 2.0. About 50% of our current orders are Subsea 2.0. Now that means only about half of that or about 25% is running through the facility today, which will ramp up to 50%, obviously, to reflect the inbound orders.
But I'll also tell you that the bids that we're working on today are significantly higher than 50% of those being 2.0. So that kind of gives you a feeling of the runway here. So you got a multiyear runway which will continue to get greater benefit from the internal execution model, now will also benefit from the macro market environment. We all know that it's favorable, both for the offshore as well as the landscape in which we participate.
And what we're building now is a company that's going to have higher, sustainable, through-cycle margins than we've ever achieved before and far greater than what others are able to do in the market that are only benefiting from the market uplift alone. And that's a commitment we've made, and that's a commitment that we'll continue to follow, and 2.0 is a major part of that. Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Doug, I wanted to dig in again on a topic that we -- I know we've discussed before, but as this backlog just continues to grow and you guys bring in all of these, especially the direct awards capacity. I'd love if you could elaborate a bit on the capacity, both your capacity, but also as you're talking with your partners and suppliers on their capacity. Because there's -- it seems to me there could be a pinch point -- at some point, not soon, but at some point, and I know you guys are probably actively planning to work your way around that? No, look, a great question and a very fair question. And I would say, if we have not reinvented the company, i.e., iEPCI and 2.0, that would be a real issue today, and I don't say that lightly. We've had two customers reach out to us in the past quarter to ask us to support others, competitors, if you will, who aren't performing. So it's real. James, your question is real. So why is it that it's not happening to TechnipFMC? And we get that question often.
When we went to a configured order from an engineered order, which we're the only ones who have this platform, it allowed us to really work closely with our supply chain and change the way that we operate. So in a traditional subsea business, like everyone else, like the others, you bring in an order, you do 9 months of detailed engineering specific to that project -- or that product, excuse me, before you can place the very first purchase order either with your internal supply chain or your external supply chain, then you hand them a drawing that they actually never done before.
So then they go about looking at it. They might agree to it. They might ask for some modifications, which then have to go back to -- we'd go back to the supply -- go back to us if it was us and then we would have to go back to the client and it just creates an enormous amount of latency and an enormous amount of new order defects or the new order defect rate is quite high because people are learning real-time on the project.
Today, when our clients order Subsea 2.0, there are 0 product engineering hours at the time of the order. It simply goes into manufacturing, assembly and test. So our suppliers know what they're going to be building. And on top of that, because of our success and because of their confidence in us, they will actually premanufacture subcomponents for us because they have a good idea of what's coming because we can now give them commitments on an annual basis instead of on a project after it's awarded basis. So they're able to work on that.
So they'll flex their capacity. They're adding capacity as required to be able to meet our needs, James. Now again, we're not naive. Every day is a challenge. And certainly, there is some point in time, but we've built -- we've gone from a very rigid non-scalable business model, Subsea 1.0, to something that has a lot of leverage, has a lot of scalability not only for us but also for our supply chain and that's what's made the difference.
In addition, we get the much shorter cycle times, as Alf alluded to earlier. Well, that means we create capacity within our own internal capability either on the installation side or on the manufacturing side. So we don't have to spend more CapEx on new assets. It's just about doing things, but doing things better, doing things faster. It benefits the customer greatly because they see improved economics and it benefits us economically because we're able to deliver more with less. Your next question comes from the line of [ Sherif L. McGrady ]. You added a new customer to your configured order platform in Q2 and [indiscernible] pretty broad-based, but are there many more customers that could migrate to Subsea 2.0 who haven't already? And wondering how those conversations are going? Thank you very much for the question. I kind of hinted at it earlier, almost -- let's just leave it with a large portion of the tendering that we're doing now is 2.0. Obviously, there's some selectivity. We have the opportunity to be selective given our position in the market. But our customers are also asking for it, right? I mean, they are seeing the benefits.
So I would say almost every quarter, we're adding new people -- new customers into the 2.0 mix. But we're also seeing as customers now going to it on an exclusive basis and it's just become their standard, which leads to a direct award because, again, no one else has this. So that's part of, if you will, the magic and the benefit of focusing on innovation, instead of consolidation in terms of driving growth for our company.
So yes, another nice quarter, both for 2.0, also for iEPCI. We announced 2 new integrated awards. And interestingly, both of those awards are also using 2.0. So they're both, if you will, iEPCI 2.0 awards. So yes, very exciting for the company. And we'll -- as more and more orders flow, we'll get more and more internal efficiencies, which will continue to give us the opportunity to deliver a greater financial performance. And our last question will come from the line of Kurt Hallead from Benchmark. I just wanted to follow up. About a year ago, right, you were in New York with a group of us, and you were kind of talking about the outlook for the business at that point in time and the conversations you were having with your clients, and it looks like a lot of the things you were talking about a year ago are obviously coming to fruition predicated on your revised upward outlook for orders and so on and so forth.
So maybe if you could give us a little bit of a refresher because I think at that juncture, you also referenced that you were having multiple discussions about potential opportunities that extended out towards 2030. So I just wanted to see if the customer base is still going home on these projects and still feeling comfortable and confident in the demand outlook to continue to push these projects forward and push them at pace. Thank you, Kurt. Most definitely. I would say the difference between now and a year ago is not so much in the duration of the projects that they're looking at. I mean they continue to look indeed 2028, 2030 and beyond. They continue to really focus on new opportunities in some of the emerging basins.
I would say the thing that has maybe changed the most between then and now is the level of commitment that they are prepared to make in order to secure quality capacity. And so that realization that the capacity is not infinite, is leading to our clients, making us earlier commitments longer, commitments for future projects.
Obviously, this is all in the direct award category. Signing up for long-term partnerships exclusively with us to be able to use proprietary Subsea 2.0 and iEPCI offering. So it's more about really getting things secured, not only for the next project, but for the future projects or for the emerging basins. So we are in discussions today about they want to work with us, they've seen the success that we've had in Guyana, they've seen the success we've had in Mozambique, they like the way we do business.
And by the way, our customers stand for the same values that we do. And so they want to work with companies that share those same values. That's the -- I'd say that's the biggest change, which is obviously a positive change for the industry, but specifically for our company, Kurt. That's great. That's great. Really appreciate it. And if you don't mind, I might put you on the spot with this last one, but you referenced a goal to have a higher through-cycle margins that at any point in time in FTI's history. So I figure I'd be the first one to ask you, what you think a sustainable margin could be? Well, Kurt, if we keep bringing in these high-quality orders and keep executing at the rate that we are, which goes to the 22,000 women and men of the company performing every single day, we're creating a lot of value for our clients by giving them first production up to 1 year earlier than what others are able to do. They're happy to share some of that economic value with us. That's what we're going to stay focused on, and we'll let the numbers speak for themselves as they materialize.
But as we've said all in all, any numbers that we've ever put out there are simply major milestones on a more ambitious journey. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Matt Seinsheimer for the closing remarks. This concludes our conference call.
