At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call.
And with that, I will hand it over to Mike Magaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. Welcome to Workday's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our Co-President and CFO, and Chano Fernandez, our Co-President. Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after the close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our first quarter quiet period begins at the close of business on April 13, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2017.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone from sunny Florida where we are holding our annual sales kickoff event. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter, ending the year with significant momentum across the board. Our success as a company continues to be driven by our forward-thinking customers who expect more from their enterprise applications and continue to choose Workday as their partner for their move to the cloud for finance and HR. We now have over 2,100 customers and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our 98% customer satisfaction rating, and industry-leading referenceability.
On the sales front, our consistent sales execution throughout the year extended into Q4 and enabled us to deliver excellent full year fiscal year 2018 results. In Q4, we saw healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. Starting with HCM, we added nine new Fortune 500 customers, including five in the Fortune 50. A few of the new additions include Home Depot, Banco Santander, General Electric, PNC Bank, Chevron U.S.A. and Telstra. We now have over 175 Fortune 500 customers for our HCM product line, including more than 20 of the Fortune 50. And consistent with past quarters, more than 70% of our HCM customers are now in production.
Switching over to our Financial Management applications, Q4 was our best quarter ever for this product line. In the fourth quarter alone, we added 58 new core Financial Management customers, up 45% from last year, including two Fortune 500 customers, one of which is a Fortune 100 company. In addition to the strength of our core Financial Management offering, we also added over 60 planning customers bringing our total number of planning customers to over 250 and our total number of Financial Management customers to over 450.
A few of the notable new Financial Management customers include American Family Mutual Insurance and Quicken Loans. Indeed, we continued to see strong signs of increasing digital transformation in the CFO organization and believe that our strong and growing referenceable customer base will be a key driver to our future success. Similar to our HCM product line, Workday continues to deliver on our commitment of getting customers live and successful, with over 60% of our Financial Management customers now in production. As we head into fiscal year 2019, we are confident in the pipeline we have built and the sales execution model we have put in place. As such, we expect fiscal year 2019 to be another strong year of growth.
Fiscal year 2019 is also another big investment year for Workday on the product and innovation front. We're doubling down on our focus of customer-driven innovation and are ramping up the investment into our two newest pillars, Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Cloud Platform, both of which are off to a great start. On the Prism Analytics front, we saw over 45 new customers sign up for this new offering in its first quarter of availability. On the Workday Cloud Platform front, significant development progress has been made over the past several quarters. Customer and partner interest in the Workday Cloud Platform continues to grow and we are pleased with the initial results and feedback from our early adopter program.
Switching to the people front, a key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end, we are proud of our recent recognition as number seven on the list of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For in the U.S. and number two on Great Place to Work Institute's Best Workplaces in Ireland. Being a great place to work is something that Dave and I have cared about since day one, so it's an honor for Workday to be on these prestigious lists.
Staying on the people topic, we also recently announced some leadership changes that further strengthened the company and underscore our belief that much of Workday's ongoing and future success will be fueled by continually identifying leaders from within the company. As we announced earlier this month, Robynne Sisco and Chano Fernandez are stepping into the roles of Co-President and will lead us through our next phase of growth. This move enables Phil Wilmington and Mark Peek to focus on strategic initiatives for us, while also continuing to serve as key members of our senior management team. Phil now serves as Workday Vice Chairman, and Mark has taken on the role of Managing Director, co-head of Workday Ventures alongside Leighanne Levensaler.
As we head into fiscal year 2019, I'm optimistic as ever about the future of Workday. On the innovation front, we are delivering against our unique vision of bringing planning, transactions and analytics into one unified cloud system. And with the introduction of Workday Cloud Platform, Workday is being increasingly viewed by our customers as not just an applications company, but as a platform provider too. We continue to invest heavily in our company culture and our value system, and have a great group of employees committed to delivering the highest levels of customer satisfaction to our great customers. Given the backdrop of the continued migration of enterprise systems to the cloud, hopefully you all share my optimism.
I'll now turn it over to our CFO and newly minted Co-President, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter capped a very strong year where we continued to demonstrate momentum across our subscription revenue growth drivers. We added a record number of net new customers during the quarter and our high levels of customer satisfaction continued to drive industry-leading renewal rates as well as strong add-on sales to existing customers.
Our subscription revenue grew 34% to $490 million for the fourth quarter, and was up 39% to $1.788 billion for the full year. Total revenue was $582 million in Q4, reflecting growth of 33% from last year, and $2.143 billion, or 36% growth, for the full year. In Q4, $441 million of our $490 million of subscription revenue, or 90%, came from the balance sheet, consistent with the Q4 of last year. We continue to see strong quarterly performance outside the U.S., with total revenue up 53% to $131 million, representing a record 22% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $5.2 billion, growth of 34% against a very difficult comparison period a year ago.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $55 million, or 9.5%. For the year, we saw significant leverage in our business, as our non-GAAP operating profit increased to $216 million, or 10.1% of total revenue, up almost 7 percentage points year-over-year.
Operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 was $466 million, representing 33% growth from last year. Our free cash flow was also strong, increasing to $324 million in fiscal 2018, 41% year-over-year growth. The operating and free cash flow strength was primarily driven by unusually strong customer collections in our fourth quarter.
We successfully added and integrated almost 1,600 net new employees to Workday this year, bringing our total employee count at year-end to over 8,200. Operationally, we continue to execute well against our long-term vision and appreciate the continued support from both our new and existing customers.
As we enter fiscal 2019, our strong pipeline gives us confidence in our continued growth story. We see significant opportunity across product segments and geographies, with financial management and business outside the U.S. incrementally becoming a larger portion of the overall mix. Our focus remains centered on driving strong sustainable growth and we will continue to prioritize both new customer acquisitions and long-term contract economics, which will likely result in continued quarter-to-quarter variability in some of our business metrics but will serve us well in the long run.
Let me now turn to guidance for fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue to be between $514 million and $516 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. For the full year, we expect subscription revenue of $2.265 billion to $2.280 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27% to 28%. Sequentially, we expect quarterly subscription revenue to increase by approximately 6% to 7% throughout the year, with Q2 closer to 7%, and Q4 closer to 6%.
On the professional services front, we continue to value and support a growing SI ecosystem. Our partners are seeing robust growth in their Workday practices, and we will continue our tight alignment with them to ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $93 million in Q1, and $405 million in fiscal 2019, or growth of 16% and 14%, respectively. Professional services margins will be slightly lower than last year, as we continue to invest in programs to support customer deployments, and to sustain our high levels of customer satisfaction.
As we continue to focus on long-term customer economics, contract structures and payment terms, especially with larger customers, are expected to continue to impact unearned revenue trends period to period.
As we look at FY 2019, we want to provide some additional color on our expected balance sheet trends, given what we know today. Current unearned revenue growth is expected to fluctuate during the year, with Q1 seasonality resulting in a year-over-year growth rate in the low 20% range. The timing of some large customer invoices in Q2 will improve current unearned revenue growth into the mid 20s, with growth in the second half of the year likely to return to the low 20s. We would expect long-term unearned revenue to continue to decline year-over-year, but expect it will fluctuate period to period based on up-front cash dynamics. We expect more typical seasonal trends in our subscription revenue backlog with little or no sequential growth in Q1.
We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 10% to 11% in Q1, and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2. We expect our non-GAAP operating margins for the full year to be approximately 12%. This 200-basis-point year-over-year improvement for FY 2019 reflects our continued investment in products and other areas of the business to support our long-term growth aspirations. The GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 24 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margin. We expect operating cash flow growth in FY 2019 to be 30%, resulting in an operating cash flow margin of over 22%.
Given our recent non-GAAP profit, we are now introducing a non-GAAP tax rate. We have determined this rate by using a three-year non-GAAP outlook and calculating the average expected tax rate over that period, taking into account the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recently passed into law. The non-GAAP tax rate for FY 2019 is 17%.
Our new Pleasanton development center construction project is in full swing and is the focus of our owned real estate investments in fiscal 2019. We expect capital expense for this project to be approximately $200 million in FY 2019. The entire project is on track for completion in early fiscal 2020, and we continue to fund construction from cash on our balance sheet. We expect FY 2019 CapEx, excluding our development center, to also be approximately $200 million. The increase from FY 2018 is driven by datacenter investments, leased facilities expansions, and large furniture purchases as we near occupancy of our development center.
With that, let's begin the Q&A process. And your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Yes, thank you very much and congrats on a very strong finish to the year. Aneel, you mentioned a Fortune 100 win, I believe, in Financial Management, and I realize that's not the very first singular situation like that, but it seems like it's something that's probably pretty meaningful. Could you share any more details on the deal dynamics there in terms of which general ledger might have been displaced, which vertical, when maybe it would go live, anything else that you think might be interesting? Sure. It's a company that we're not able to name right now. It's a full platform opportunity. I'd say it's best described is in the food business, and its volumes are almost an order of magnitude higher in some areas than anything we've taken on in the past. And that's relative to the Aons and J.B. Hunts of the world, which are already in really high volumes. So, our view is this one really, from a scalability perspective, demonstrates that we can scale to Fortune 100 size companies even in sectors that are not necessarily a target sector for us. This is more of a traditional ERP-oriented company that decided to go with the full platform from Workday. I believe the displaced product is SAP. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Hey, thanks very much. So, what do you think, what would be, as an outsider, like kind of a reasonable set of milestones that we should expect in terms of kind of your ISV partners that you're building on kind of a more open platform? Because in the end, I think that's a really positive move, because it's going to make your software, like, really sticky. Thanks. Well, it's a great question, Richard. We're still in the mode of early adopter work with our customers and exploring what they can do with the Workday Cloud Platform. And the takeaway so far is there are lot more use cases and ideas than we had ever expected. By the time that we're together in six months for, or a little bit more than six months for Workday Rising, you'll see a more deliberate step forward on how we're going to open it up with business partners. And that's consistent with what we said at the last Rising; we were going to be in early adopter mode. Basically every one of our big systems integrators is lined up to either want to extend on behalf of customers, or come up with ideas where they would like to build their own intellectual property on top of the Workday Cloud Platform, and right now, my goal is to actually keep expectations both from a bookings perspective and a customers' perspective in check because it's an exciting new move for the company. But just stay tuned for Rising when we open it up more broadly to the broader ecosystem. Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Congratulations on the quarter. I'm curious to get a little bit more perspective on the sequential growth in the backlog, which was quite impressive. And what, in rank order of descending in terms of priority, were the product sets that contributed to that significant growth in backlog? And I'm also wondering if, at this point in time, the headwind that has affected the calculation of short term deferred revenue due to invoicing durations coming in, are we well past the anniversary so as to expect a more moderate set of comparisons for this particular metric since the invoicing terms had been coming under pressure, but presumably that should go away next year? Just want to clarify these two things. Thanks. Yeah, so Kash, on the backlog, there are really three main factors that drive the incremental backlog number. And that is net new ACV, obviously Q4 being our strongest quarter. You saw a similar trend Q4 last year in the backlog where we got our largest increase quarter-over-quarter in Q4. Additionally, renewals add to that backlog number, so any contract that renews during Q4, that contract value goes into the backlog as well, and Q4 being our historical seasonally high quarter, we've got a lot of renewals that happen in Q4 as well. And then duration, we did see a slight uptick in duration in Q4, but it wasn't a meaningful change from prior quarters. So, those are the big drivers. We expect seasonality in backlog to be very similar in FY 2019, as what you saw in FY 2018, meaning really flat Q4 to Q1, and then some incremental movement in Q2 and Q3, and then another big increase next Q4. So, this represents normal seasonality for us.
On the deferred revenue front, as you know, we've continued to structure deals in a manner that best serves the long-term interests of Workday and the customers, and our business isn't linear, and contract structures can vary particularly with the larger ones, which means that we expect both billings and unearned revenue to continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter. So, I don't think we're going to really lap anything that will give us consistency. I still expect it to vary. We did think it would be helpful to give you some color on what we're seeing in current unearned from where we stand today, and the year could unfold in a different manner because it really will depend on some of the new contracts that we do, and how those structures play out. Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Thanks so much. You mentioned that growth from international and from Financial Management are obviously going to be incrementally larger in 2019 than 2018. Is there any way to sort of parse those out? And as a follow-on, I'm curious especially in HCM given the success we've had in the U.S. in the last 12 to 18 months, especially in large Fortune 50 accounts, does the onus begin to shift towards international wins a little bit more as you look forward? Thanks so much. I'd first say that the U.S. market continues to be a very healthy market for HCM. There's still a number of companies that have not made decisions. I think the trend in the parts outside the world, I'm going to turn over to Chano, is that we are both experiencing markets that are later to the cloud, and so we're seeing the early adopters and two, we're opening up new markets. Maybe you want to get into more detail about what you're seeing internationally. Yeah, we're getting more mature in some of the markets that we're already present and definitely with great customer referenceabilities, opening more opportunity to us, which the thing is executing well on. And as Aneel is saying, we are expanding into new markets, which opens opportunity as well. And Robynne, any comment on financials in international within the backlog mix or any other way to think about that? If you look at the Q4 data as a point, the representation of financials in international is pretty balanced, meaning that they also contributed well to the growth and to our best ever quarter. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Aneel, I just wanted to ask you if you could comment on the business linearity in the quarter. You're one of the first companies to report with a January quarter-end. We saw very strong results in the December quarter from the SaaS companies. There was a change with tax reform and the regulatory environment. It seems that the business optimism has ticked up since the start of the year. Maybe hard to parse that given the third month is typically strong in enterprise software, but can you comment at all on the cadence of the business activity and what you saw in the linearity during the quarter? Thank you. Yeah, it's a pretty healthy business environment frankly across the globe right now. And I was interviewed on CNBC during the World Economic Forum. I always get a little nervous when everybody is so optimistic, but I would say right now that there's optimism to be had really across the globe. What's driving Workday though is this focus on really two things: The transformation of the HR function into a people-oriented, leadership-oriented, talent-oriented function, and it's hit the CEO agenda and it's happening across the globe. People realize that we're in a very competitive job environment and their people are their most important asset. And we just have far more proof points of success, not just of deploying cloud systems but actually people getting the benefits of that transformation. And now we're beginning to see that same cycle with the finance organizations. And so I think people are looking at this environment as, hey, business is good. Let's get on with getting ready for the future, and looking at how we're going to be more competitive against their own set of competitors. And it's driving a lot of interest in the products we have.
I also think the last piece is that we're seeing the linearity has been strong all year. That's kudos to Chano and his sales team. I don't think the fourth quarter was any different; strong linearity through every quarter. The conversations we're having with companies are much more around the business drivers rather than our quarter-end drivers, and that is a really healthy change for us. And on a previous question, we talked about the – I think Ross had asked about financials. We said we experienced 45% growth in customer count. That's a pretty good proxy for ACV growth, too, just to give you a little more sense as to the growing strength of our financial product line. Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Thanks. Robynne, I wouldn't mind going back to your decision to give us some current DR (00:26:17) guide. I definitely appreciate it and you haven't really given much comment on that metric in a while, and I just wanted to dig a little bit into why you felt comfortable now. Is it that Workday's getting to be sufficient scale, maybe the volatility around payment terms is a little bit less, your visibility into the pipeline is a little bit better? What gave you the comfort maybe to give us a little color where you haven't for a good 12, 18 months? Yeah. Karl, it was really the recognition that even though we're not focused on billings, we know that it's something that all of you have been using to model us for quite some time. And I know it's not an easy thing to let go of. And so given you are still looking at our business that way, we just wanted to give you some color because there is a lot of variability, right. And the historical trends really don't apply, and we expect them to continue to not apply going forward. And so we thought it would be helpful to take some of the noise out of the system to give you guys just a little color into just what we're seeing as we go into the year and what we expect. Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Thanks very much, and congrats on a nice end to the fiscal year. Aneel, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about within the financials business where you're seeing some momentum from a vertical perspective. I know this market relative to HCM is a little bit more sold into a vertical. So I was just kind of curious where you might be seeing some nice uptick both in terms of deals signed as well as when you look into your pipeline. Thanks. I'll offer up a couple comments and then ask Chano to weigh in as well. We have stated strategies around several key industries. The first one was education and government, the second was healthcare, we've been doing more work in financial services, and then I think the last one is technology. And those are really the four places where we saw continued strength with our financial management products in particular. Financial services continues to be a great market for us. The two wins we highlighted, the Family Health Insurance and Quicken Loans are two great names in the financial services area. But when you look at the wins in healthcare, they have been strong as well, and the education and government heritage from five or six years ago continues to be a really strong driver for us. Anything you want to add, Chano? Those are really the key strong ones. Those are potentially where you see the stronger pipeline. Potentially the only one to add would be hospitality and in some areas business services as well. But the key ones are the ones we highlighted. And I think as Chano laid out those new industries or those additional industries, I think what you should expect from Workday over the next 12 to 18 months is we will become more industry-oriented from our go-to-market messaging, our go-to-market organization, and our products beginning to reflect some of that industry-specific capabilities that our customers want. If I may add, Aneel, there is also an increased interest in areas like retail where our solution can fit very well for companies that will do their merchandising and logistics on separate systems, which is a very common practice as well. And that's a big, large interesting one. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Excellent, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and very nice quarter. I wanted a little big picture about the financials opportunity. In our CIO survey work over the past year, we've seen actually ERP rise in priority. Are you seeing anything from a industry or sort of macro perspective that you think is driving guys more to sort of evaluate how they're doing the financials, how they're doing the ERP that could be in addition to just the product getting better could be helping that overall business? I think there's three things. Number one, the CFO organization tends to be a conservative organization for all the right reasons. They're not going to be the firsters of new technology. I think it's pretty well established now that the cloud is mature technology that works across the biggest companies in the world, and frankly, more secure than the legacy systems. So I think that's number one. The cloud has become mainstream from the CFO perspective.
Number two, the finance organizations are trying to transform themselves into being better business partners to the business, and that involves being better at planning and being better at analytics. So our message of planning, analysis, and execution all wrapped into the same system is beginning to really resonate. Where just a new accounting system wasn't enough to drive change, the whole vision that we're able to present gives the CFO and their team a way to really transform the CFO organization. And then I'd say the last thing is the product capabilities that the product as it matures from a global perspective just continues to open up new markets, and people don't look at it as something that's two or three years down the road. Many companies can look at it and say we can make this change right now. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really good quarter. I guess my question is, I don't know if it's for Aneel or Chano, but around the implementation efforts for the financials platform with some of the uptick in deals that you've had, are these deals to be implemented by partners or direct? I imagine that Fortune 100 win might be more of a direct type of an implementation, but just wanted to see how you're planning for those over the next year. In the HR world, it's far greater than 80/20 being done by the partners. I think it's probably 85/15 at this point. Financials was 50/50, but it's beginning to also become more partner-centric. On the Fortune 100 account you mentioned, you're absolutely right. We decided to take the lead role, but it's very important for us to continue to get skills into our ecosystem, so we are subbing out work to our partners so that the next financial opportunity that pops up, they could lead it themselves. And that will continue to be our strategy, and I think in two years, we'll be at pretty similar levels on the services component for both HR and financials. Any time we have a newer initiative and we're really trying to prove our customer success, in the case of Prism Analytics right now, we're going to be front and center just to ensure customer satisfaction. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Investors have really been fixated on these Fortune 500 financials deals for you guys for some time. So maybe, Aneel, do you see these two signings representing any kind of inflection point for Fortune 500 from a pipeline perspective? And is it possible at a high level either for ACV growth in fiscal 2019 or as a percentage of total bookings contribution to get a sense for how you're thinking about your targets for financials or how we should think about them? Yeah. I personally think there's too much focus on the Fortune 500 accounts. Although we are very happy with where we are from fiscal year 2018 and the pipeline for fiscal year 2019 has a lot more of them in there, they're just hard to predict. I think the important trend is that across the board, finance is becoming mainstream in the cloud. And when you look at the medium enterprise, which in many ways is our bread-and-butter business, we have a huge advantage over any competitor in that HR and finance is delivered by one vendor in a unified system. Almost everybody else is cobbling together multiple technologies.
And the idea for a medium enterprise company to want to integrate multiple solutions from multiple vendors is just not very practical. They just don't have the skills – well, they have the skills. They don't have the IT scale to do all those integrations. So the idea they can get a lot from one vendor is a really great opportunity for us. And in that medium enterprise, we really stand alone as the only one that can deliver that full unified solution. But on the Fortune 500 accounts, I think we're now beginning to see the movement. It's going to continue to be lumpy. We can't predict when they land, but they're in the pipeline. And now we have some really good proof points. Aon is pretty far along the way to close the books globally for the first time. So that's gone really well. I think a lot of people are looking to see what they do post this next few months. With this Fortune 100 company, it just opens up a new scale of opportunity for us. I think in the traditional Fortune 500, they're all beginning to look at financial systems in the cloud now. Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. The question is sort of to Aneel and Chano. Obviously you mentioned about another large Fortune 100 displacement on the financial side, but if I think about it over the course of this whole fiscal year, there's been a number of large displacements in Financials and HCM. When you look back, call it, over the past 12 months, is there anything that you'd suggest from just a competitive standpoint versus let's say the three kind of legacy players, where either win rates are improving versus those competitors or as you look at the pipeline for this coming fiscal year, where the opportunity set is really starting to diverge and you think that there's sort of a greater opportunity because of some sort of competitive window versus any of these given players? We've said this on past calls. Win rates have been fairly consistent over the last few years. I think what continues to be the case for both HCM and Financials, customer success and proof points really matter, especially in those large Fortune 100 situations, where frankly cost is not the driver. They just cannot afford to have a failed project. It's a huge investment. They usually have a burning platform issue or a major transformation they want to get done. And they call around to the different vendors, customers, and ours are really happy.
And a couple of years ago, it was still early enough where it was hard to compare, but now it's very clear that Workday has the happiest customers, and I think that continues to drive success for us. And that's our golden goose. We got to protect it. If I were to say one thing about financials on a competitive side, it really is just two players in the cloud. SAP does not have a cloud financial offering. That's just not our perspective. That is the analysts' perspective. There's nothing to evaluate against. So most of the opportunities for cloud financials come down to us and Oracle. And it's a plenty big market for both of us. And without getting into the commentary that they say or what we would say, I would just say it's a huge market for two vendors and we really like our position right now. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Great. Thanks very much. Aneel, I think last quarter you said Financial Management ACZ grew at least 50%. Obviously you said 45% a little while ago. Given the big signings, I'm just trying to understand what may have caused that deceleration? Thanks. Honestly I know it's at least 45%. I was asking Robynne. I don't know what the actual number was. It's not deceleration. It's more than it was last quarter. Yeah. Aneel said it is a good proxy. I said it was a good proxy in terms of customer count, but it's better than – yeah. Whatever Chano said. It's not deceleration. It's acceleration. Your next question comes from the line of Bahavin Suri with William Blair. Hey, this is actually Vinay on for Bahavin. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to talk about midmarket. I know we haven't touched on that. Could you provide, Aneel, any commentary on what the market was like in Q4 within the midmarket and what that pipeline looks like for fiscal 2019? And then I have a follow-up for Robynne. Thanks. I would say in the midmarket, less so about Q4 but generally the trend for the year was that our win rates this past year in the medium enterprise were better than they were the previous year. And I think that's due to great sales execution by Doug Robinson and his team in the U.S. Beginning (39:12) to roll out the medium enterprise story in the rest of the world. And Annrai O'Toole and the development folks in Ireland have been coming out with better and better tools to reduce the cost of implementation which we've always said is the biggest driver for our success in the medium enterprise. Software costs are similar, our implementation costs were a bit higher and we're beginning to address that with these implementation tools. So our win rates, I think, historically were in the 50% range in the medium enterprise and they're significantly better in fiscal year 2018. Got it. That's helpful. Robynne, just wanted to follow up on the two large enterprise financial wins. I know you've mentioned talking about focusing on the longer term and looking at contract structures that focus on long-term value. I'm just curious with these two large Fortune 500 wins, I know they're still early, but are they more ramped in nature than maybe some of the strategic HCM wins or any color to help us think through that? Thanks. No, they're actually not unusual in structure at all. They're fairly standard structure deals. And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens, Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and very, very nice quarter. I guess I wanted to ask on Prism Analytics. It looked like there was a big jump in the sign-up and number of customers now that it's generally available. Is there any particular profile of the adopters that you've seen so far? And maybe color on what they're either replacing it with or are they treating it as an add-on to existing BI implementations? Or is it a replacement? And then, Robynne, maybe if you could just remind us how the pricing model for Prism works? That would be helpful. Thank you. It's still too early to tell in terms of patterns. The number 45 was a bigger number than I had expected. Whether it's replacement for BI or additional projects, I think it's too early to tell from a 2,100 customer base, what 45 think. What we are seeing are use cases that are very valuable from a customer perspective and in all the cases so far, they're marrying data from other systems with Workday to get to insight that they could not have gotten on their own.
The Prism product was built around the Platfora technology that we acquired two years ago. It was rewritten in a pretty broad way to work within the Workday cloud construct and be completely unified with the rest of the platform. It has this great ability to get data in and then to transform it to fit our BI strategy. And so some examples have been for hospitals where they were able to take HR data, finance data, and patient data and better understand the profitability or lack thereof of certain procedures and certain patients.
And that's the kind of analysis bringing multiple types of data, and allowing them to do it really quickly and simply that they're not able to do. So I think we're going to see a whole host of use cases around it. My gut tells me many of the use cases are going to be very industry specific. There'll be a set of healthcare use cases, a set of financial services use cases. And they'll be using Workday as that system of record to bring in their core business data, whether it's healthcare data, patient data for a healthcare organization or trading data for a financial services organization, bring it into Prism and then do the rich analytics that they've always wanted to do. And in terms of pricing, Prism pricing is structured largely like most of our other products are, as a percent of HCM, and it runs approximately 40%. We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Great, thanks. And I'll echo the congratulations. Looks like a really nice end to the year. Well done. I had a question for Aneel and then one for Robynne. Understanding that billings is just one metric to look at, you beat the Street by more than 10% this quarter and it was a real outlier from a growth rate perspective, well above the last couple of quarters, and well above the forward guide. Do you think you're getting to the scale where you're just going to see more back-end loading of the year, or more concentration of the larger deals in Q4? Any thoughts around that? And then a question on cash flow for Robynne. Yeah. So Adam, I do think that what you're seeing here is the compounding seasonality effect, right, that some of our peers have as well. And I don't see that that will change any time soon. And on top of that, you also have the variability of different contract structures, right, which just make it a metric that's very, very difficult to predict. And it becomes less meaningful to really our model and our focus on long-term revenue growth on a subscription basis. Got it. And just on cash flow, as we think about cash flow for next year, I know you didn't guide to it, but just to put some parameters around it, it seems like there are a few things that converge in fiscal 2019 that should drive strong cash flow, whether it's the mix of revenue changing, the anniversarying of some of the deal terms. There's a few different things. How should we be thinking about the growth of cash flow relative to either revenue or the soft billings guidance that you gave? Thank you. Yeah, Adam, so I actually did guide cash flow at 30% gross, which will give us cash flow margins in the mid to high 22 percents, right? Which is higher than they've been in the past. And I would expect over the coming years that we'll continue to see strength in cash flow growth and cash flow margins. And your final question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats also on the quarter. So changing a little gear a little bit. As you're expanding in general, especially in financials, are you seeing increasing client requirement for local cloud datacenters delivering your functionality in the country that the client specifically is? And how do you expect to plan to be able to meet those requirements? Thanks. We have been distributed from a datacenter perspective for really for almost our entire history. We have several datacenters in the U.S., several datacenters in Europe. We're opening up two datacenters in Canada through our partnership with AWS. We were a leader and way ahead of the pack in adopting GDPR, and actually working with the EU to be really a progressive company and making sure that the data is protected around the globe. So at this point, we don't really have any concerns. If we do down the road, it's likely that if we have to open up in a specific country, it's likely that we'd use a third-party provider like an Amazon to get there. We thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO, and Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO . unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons will be to our results for the comparable period of fiscal 2017 .",0.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of the call. And with that, I will hand it over to Mike Magaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Workday first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our Co-President and CFO; and Chano Fernandez, our Co-President.
Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after the close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Our second quarter quiet period begins on July 15, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2018.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Michael. I'd first like to thank everyone for joining our Q1 2019 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 got us off to a great start for the year.
We continue to see strong demand across our human capital management and financial management suites of applications and we saw solid performance across customer size, geography and industry.
Starting out with the Workday HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to lead the market with our true cloud platform. In Q1, we added Inter IKEA Services, [Myer] [ph], Great Lakes, Tyson Shared Services, Unisys Corporation and a Fortune 100 pharmaceutical company among the many new HCM customers in the quarter.
Our proven ability to support our customers' large volumes of data and transactions continues to be a big differentiator in our success. We now have over 2,200 customers and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our industry-leading 98% customer satisfaction rate and referenceability.
Notable go-lives in Q1 included 21st Century Fox, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Limited, Ingram Micro and PricewaterhouseCoopers to name a few.
Turning to Workday Financial Management, we continue to expand the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance system. And in combination with Workday Prism Analytics, Workday Benchmarking and Workday Planning, we're delivering a global solution that is essential for empowering business leaders.
We saw continued momentum for our suite of applications in Q1 with new Workday financial management customers, including Sprouts Farmers Market, Rivera and Race Truck Petroleum, one of the largest private companies in the US.
We believe these wins, when combined with our momentum from fiscal 2018, demonstrate the growing traction of our financial management applications across medium and large companies.
In fact, Gartner published its May 2018 Magic Quadrant for cloud core financial management suites for midsize, large and global enterprises. And once again, Gartner acknowledged Workday as a leader for cloud core financial management applications.
This year, we are proud of being recognized by Gartner and achieving the furthest overall position for completeness of vision.
As always, our key focus is bringing customers live successfully. Among the many go-lives of Q1, I would like to highlight Aon, who became an HCM customer in 2013; and since that time, has added additional products including Workday Financial Management. Aon is now live on financial management in 28 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the US. Special kudos to their great effort and progress with their global deployments.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes talking about innovation. As you know, innovation is a core value and part of our DNA at Workday.
First, I'm pleased to share that Forbes recently named Workday number two on its list of the world's 100 most innovative companies. It's an honor to be recognized by Forbes and a testament to our customer-driven innovation.
In Q1, I'm pleased to announce that in just three hours we moved all customers to Workday 30. With this release, we expanded our global foundation and industry-specific capabilities of Workday Financial Management and delivered a set of new employee experience features in Workday HCM.
We also delivered against the roadmaps for Workday Prism Analytics by introducing data discovery capabilities. In addition, we introduced the first financials benchmarks and expanded our HR benchmarks through our data-as-a-service offering.
We continued to deliver against our unique vision of bringing planning transactions and analytics into one unified cloud system.
As we look forward to the rest of fiscal year 2019 and beyond, we will continue our relentless focus on innovation and expect to see continued momentum from our growing family of applications.
Switching to the people front, as you all know, we believe a key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company.
And we believe this investment in our people continues to pay off. We're once again recognized globally as one of the best workplaces by Great Place to Work Institute, ranking number one in the UK, number two in Ireland, our largest office outside the US and number three in Germany. A very special thank you to our employees who make these rankings possible. We're very proud that even as we maintain our very fast pace of employee growth around the world, our company culture remained strong.
All in all, this quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year. I will now turn it over to Co-President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel. And good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel mentioned, we continue to execute well against our long-term market opportunity, differentiating ourselves through our technology and uniquely purposed customer success model.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results, delivering total revenue of $619 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29%. Our subscription revenue was $522 million, up 31%.
Subscription revenue outperformance was primarily driven by solid net new ACV growth against a difficult comparison a year ago.
Professional Services revenue came in at $96.5 million, representing growth of 20%.
We continue to see strong performance outside the US with total revenue up 43% to $139 million, representing 22% of total revenue.
Subscription revenue backlog was $5.2 billion, growth of 31%, also against a very difficult comparison period a year ago. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately two-thirds of the subscription revenue backlog balance will be recognized over the next two years.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the first quarter was $81 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.1%. The strength reflects strong topline growth, record gross margins and the benefit of overall spend being slightly lower than expected.
We did not see any material impact from FX changes within the quarter.
We achieved record high cash flow from operations of $184 million in Q1. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was also a record high at $470 million, up 28% year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $310 million, up 24% year-over-year. Note that in calculating our trailing 12-month free cash flow, we have excluded $135 million related to our owned real estate projects as we consider these investments non-recurring in nature.
As always, our cash flow results can vary with the timing of customer invoicing as well as seasonal and varying spending patterns.
Moving to the balance sheet, total unearned revenue at the end of Q1 grew 18% year-over-year to over $1.4 billion. As expected, current unearned revenue grew 22% to $1.32 billion, which was in line with the low 20s growth we discussed in our Q4 call.
The corresponding sequential decline in current unearned revenue from Q4 was the expected result of our compounding seasonality as Q1 continues to represent the smallest portion of our annual net new ACV.
Non-current unearned revenue was down 21% year-over-year, consistent with the trend that started last year as we continue to see fewer customers electing to pay more than one year of ACV upfront.
We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 360 net new employees to Workday, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to almost 8,600.
Operationally, we executed exceptionally well in the first quarter, delivering overperformance on both the top and bottom line. We're extremely pleased with our results and have gotten off to a great start for fiscal 2019.
I'll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on driving strong sustainable growth and we will continue to prioritize both new customer acquisitions and long-term contract economics, which will likely result in continued quarter-to-quarter variability in some of our business metrics, but which will serve us well in the long run.
Based on outperformance in Q1, but keeping in mind we still have difficult first half comps from last year, we are raising our fiscal 2019 outlook and providing Q2 guidance as follows.
For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $2.275 billion to $2.290 billion. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $557 million to $559 million or 28% to 29% growth, with sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 of approximately 4.5% and 6.5% respectively.
Similar to last year, this pattern reflects our increasing seasonal trend towards larger Q4s.
We still expect Professional Services revenue to be approximately $405 million in fiscal 2019 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success above Professional Services revenue expansion. For Q2, we expect services revenue of $104 million.
For non-GAAP operating margins, we now estimate Q2 to be in the range of 9% to 10% and we still anticipate 12% margins for the full year as we prioritize continued investment in our growing business over margin outperformance.
The sequential decline in non-GAAP operating margin from Q1 reflects typical seasonality and is primarily a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.
The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 24 percentage points in each remaining quarter and for the entire fiscal year.
We still expect short-term unearned to follow the pattern we laid out on our Q4 call. We also still expect strong operating cash flow growth of 30% for the year. As a reminder, Q2 traditionally generates limited operating cash flows.
This is due to the combination of seasonally low collections and the seasonally high sequential increase in expenses resulting from our annual employee compensation cycle mentioned earlier.
There is no change to our fiscal 2019 plans for capital expense for our development center project or other CapEx provided on our last call.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work. We're still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without a shared goal.
We're off to a great start and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
Operator, let's begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just two quick ones. Maybe first for Robynne. I think, at the end now, you just reiterated your current deferred guidance, which I think is high 20s for Q2. Can you just remind us why that steps up so much from what you just printed in Q1? And then, I've got a quick follow-up for Aneel. Yeah, Justin. So, we actually said mid-20s for Q2. And the reason it steps up is we do get a slight tailwind in Q2 from some of the contracts that we entered into a few years ago that had step-up payments. So, that's the primary driver there. Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, Aneel, it seems like from the guidance you guys are sort of implying a subscription revenue growth at least. If you look at the balance of the year, it's pretty stable from what you just printed in Q1. And I'm just wondering, is that a reflection of financials in some of these emerging products are sort of at a point where they're offsetting any potential slowdown in HCM or what gives you conference around that stabilizing subscription growth? Thanks. I think we have a lot of growth vectors. Financials percent again year-over-year and it continues to be now fairly healthy and becoming a more sizable business. And we've seen good uptake on Prism Analytics and Planning. And I'm very optimistic, probably not for the rest of this year, but I'm very optimistic about the Workday cloud platform going into next year. The demand continues to grow. We're beginning to [doing] [ph] the pricing and packaging. And I suspect it has the ability to just be another booster for us going forward. So, just a lot of fires, a lot of irons in the fire in terms of continued growth.
And then, I'd say the last piece is the HCM business continues to be healthy and, in particular, we're doing quite well outside the US where the markets are probably two or three years behind or maybe even five years behind in cloud adoption. So, we're seeing the first wave of big companies moving to the cloud with Workday overseas and there's a lot more opportunity there. Got it. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. One clarification question and then one broader question for perhaps Aneel. Did I hear you right, on the call you said that your new ACV did grow in Q1 because it was a step down in terms of billings growth what we saw in Q1 versus what we last year. So, we don't have much visibility into what new ACV looks like, but our back-of-the-envelope math would suggest that's not the case. But you did say new ACV growth grew in Q1.
And then, the broader question, just on sort of how machine learning is starting to impact the product portfolio. Are you starting to see people pick up some of that functionality, they're starting to be more of a differentiator or more in use within the product functionality? And how is that impacting, if at all, yet? How people are using the solutions today? We've had some machine learning capabilities for now multiple years in areas like retention risk and talent scorecard and customer collections. I'd say the uptake is – I think there's a lot of hype around machine learning. We're providing the technology for our customers to use. They're still getting comfortable with it. The tech vendors are out selling and marketing it, probably ahead of where customers are in terms of using it. But it's picking up and it's definitely a differentiator because I think many customers have plans to use it in the next 12 to 18 months once they get their data and processes in order and a big part of that is getting clean data going forward. In some cases, they're coming off of systems where they don't have clean data. So, it takes a while to up-ramp it. Keith, on your first question, we did see net new ACV growth over Q1 of last year. So, we're really pleased with the Q1 performance, particularly on a test comparable. If you recall, in Q1 last year, we said we had our strongest net new ACV growth in almost 3 years. So, really difficult comp, but we were still able to beat that for this current year.
It's one of the reasons frankly that we wanted to give you guys some color around unearned balances and what we were seeing this year is because we did see, just with existing contracts, a lot of variation. So, we thought that it was important that we share that with you. So, the results that you're seeing are really due to the variation that we knew coming into the year on existing contracts. Thanks. That's super helpful. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC. Thanks so much. Maybe one for Robynne. Just to clarify, you'd helped us last quarter with the unearned balance trend through this year. And, I guess, you gave us the view on Q2 after Justin's question. Can you just remind us what we should expect in Q3 and Q4?
And then, Aneel, I just had maybe one for you on international HCM. You made some comments on that. And I was just curious from a competitive standpoint, would love to get your views on how the, call it, two big incumbents stack up internationally. Thanks. So, Ross, on your unearned question, so what we said last quarter was for Q2 mid-20s current unearned growth, which you should take as 25%. For Q3 and Q4, we said low 20s in current unearned growth, which is about 20% to 22%. Great. Sorry. In terms of international HCM, I think I'll offer up point of view and then ask Chano to jump in. Over the last several years, the competitive win rates have remained pretty consistent and we definitely see more of Oracle in the US. We see Oracle pretty much – they're the competitor we see the most. We see SAP more in Europe than we do in other parts, than we do in the US. And maybe Chano can talk in more detail about what we're seeing competitively. I think you're right, Aneel. Basically, the opportunity there is fantastic. It's absolutely amazing. And we're very pleased with some of the large new customer that we've been winning into the international markets. Win rates remain very strong. A little bit behind the US, but it's more a question of maturity. Clearly, as Aneel said, the difference is more that the stronger competitor there is potentially the local one because of the higher installed base. And as you know, we're just trying to gain this new business, which is really [updating] [ph] incumbents on the legacies in place. But the most mature markets are in similar win rates as the US ones. And the ones that we are more starting earlier, we're starting with really flagship customers in those markets and a few points behind as part of the maturity in terms of win ratios, but very strong ones. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Robynne, first for you. When you think about your pipeline and the potential seasonality for 2019, does it strike you as any more or less backend loaded than it has been historically? And how should we think about the progression of kind of subscription backlog through the year?
And then one – just a quick follow-up for Aneel on the platform opportunity. Yeah. Alex, so with regard to seasonality, we have seen a trend of more backend loaded years and we don't expect that to be any different this year. It is still early in the year, so we just finished our first quarter. It's our seasonally lowest first quarter. so, we really need to see how the year unfolds, but we do see that trend overall continuing.
And then, with regard to backlog, you'll see somewhat similar trends as last year, flat from Q4 to Q1 which is what we predicted and which did occur. A slight uptick in Q2. Q3 will be flattish again. And then, we'll get a big jump in Q4 due to the seasonal high of that quarter. So, fairly consistent with what you saw last year in terms of trending. Great. And then, Aneel, you mentioned some ramping excitement around the platform opportunity, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing from either your partners or existing customers that's driving that enthusiasm? Well, as much as we're trying to keep it out of the sales cycle, customers are excited about it. And they want to talk about it. So, we are showing our customers and prospects the evolution of the Workday cloud platform, where it was a year ago and where it is today. And we made tremendous progress.
I think where it's getting more exciting is as we're working through the pricing models, and they're going to be very fair to the customers, probably some combination of access fee and then a usage model. You can see how that scales into a nice business over time.
I also think that there are good partners in our ecosystem. We've got a great partnership with salesforce. There are some companies within the broader ecosystem that frankly are burning our compute cycles and we have somewhat of a free rider problem. This is not the indirect access issue. They're burning our compute cycles that we're paying for.
And with the Workday cloud platform, we will rework some of the partnership dynamics, so at least it's a fair model for us. As a system of record, we have so many different systems hitting our system and we just need to make sure that it's in the best interest of Workday, our customers and our shareholders. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions here. A question really around international financials opportunity. With Aon now being live in 28 countries, wondering if you could talk a little bit about the financials opportunity, pipeline activity internationally, given Aon is now live in those 28 countries. Aon was a big milestone for us. To your point, for a complex global financial services company, proving out that Workday is a strong platform. And I think if you talk to the folks at Aon, they're very pleased with both the implementation and now they're experienced post going live.
The first wave of larger financial services opportunities, I think, will still be in the US, US-based multinationals, but we are beginning to see the pipeline emerge in markets that are natural markets like the UK, like Australia, like Canada which are more similar to the US. And, over time, you'll see the large multinationals in the rest the world emerge as well, but that's the pattern that we're seeing and I very much expect to continue to see over the next 12 to 18 months. I don't know if you want to add anything, Chano. No. I think you've commented it all. Yeah. Very helpful. And then, one quick follow-up for Robynne. Financials business growing north of 50% year-over-year again. As you think about the pipeline for the rest of the year, do you think the mix between kind of midmarket and larger financial customers will be similar? Or as you think about growth there or sustainability of growth in financials, what that mix between large and midmarket going to look like here based on the pipeline so far? Yes. So, we're really pleased with what we're seeing in the pipeline in the large enterprise for financials. The medium enterprise continues to be a great steady run rate business for us. I expect the mix to move around a little bit, given the number of large deals we get in any given quarter. But, in general, I think it will slowly creep up into the large enterprise over time. Definitely, on the dollar perspective, on the customer account, that really doesn't – that's not really what drives our model. So, definitely, on the dollar side, you'll see it continue to trend more towards large enterprise. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Hi. Thanks very much. First a numbers question for Robynne and then I had a product question for Aneel.
On the numbers question, I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the seasonality of the business. So, understand that Q1 is a small quarter, seasonally weak quarter, et cetera. You'd think some of that would get picked up year-on-year and the billings and bookings numbers were sub 10% by our calcs. Would you expect triangulating what you said about deferred revenue current and the backlog that bookings will actually accelerate on a year-on-year basis through the year? It looks like they should, but I want to make sure that's right. Yeah. I mean, definitely, we have a tougher compare in the first half than in the second half. So, we would expect to see that later this year. Having said that, it's early days, so we'll need to see how the year unfolds, but I think you're looking at it in the right way. Thank you. And then, Aneel, we've been hearing some good things about financials in the market – the planning product in the marketplace both with respect to pulling forward the financials business, but also as a standalone. Can you maybe walk us through in a little bit more detail what you're seeing there? Are you seeing more of a Trojan horse strategy around planning plus financials? And are you actually starting to see planning deals outside of the Workday base or are they still largely in the base? Thanks. We won't sell planning standalone, at least not at this point in time. We will sell a subset of financials with planning that would include consolidation and reporting, but really the predominant model is planning either with HR or planning either with financials. And frankly, it's a compelling application in both cases. On the HR side, we've had very significant uptake and interest on the workforce planning side. And on financials, I'd argue planning is the strategic application now for the CFO's office. And it drives the execution system. I'd say the two strategic pieces are planning and the analysis piece with Prism Analytics. And those two together, have definitely created a lot more interest in the Workday financial suite. [indiscernible], Aneel, in many cases, we're seeing it more and more of them together, which is a great opportunity just for the interest and what our customers are main planning, basically assumptions, but also bringing third-party data from other systems in combination – so, that's basically the enhancing the opportunity going forward as we increase our customer base and the opportunity for selling through within them. That's terrific. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nice top line growth. Aneel, I was curious to see, you have the cohort of customers that signed contracts two to three years back that come up for renewals, what is the prospect for attaching new modules such as Prism Analytics, Planning and Financials look like and how do you – could that have a materially positive effect on the second half of this year or is it still too early to talk about attach rate of new modules on existing contracts? Thank you. That's it for me. Okay. I'll take a crack at it and then I'll ask Chano to pipe in as well.
I think just taking a step back, the most important thing to recognize is we now have 2,200 happy customers. And for really the first time, in a concerted way, we're actually looking at selling back to those customers. And the renewal is just one moment in time to sell back. It tends to be a good one to add new modules.
But Chano has put in place a strong customer base sales team, so that we're engaged more on those new modules rather than just renewal time anytime that they see an opportunity within an existing customer. Yeah. I would add that – you've seen that – out of that loyal customer base, we had enjoyed good attach rates and more mature products, like it could be recruiting, payrolls and tracking. We're seeing great growth, very high double-digit growth rates in areas like learning. They have been out there for quite some time now. And we're experiencing the same, but it's more early days in planning – or planning, not so early, and clearly high double-digit growth as well. And as well as in areas like Prism, being a newer product, so we're very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Looking a few basically quarters forward, I would expect similar attach rates that we've been enjoying on the other solutions as far as managing to keep the customer focus and satisfaction that we've been doing. Got it. I'll save the other questions next week. See you then. Bye-bye. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Quick question for Robynne. Actually two questions. One on the gross margin which hit a rock here. I'm wondering if you still have room for more efficiency gains from these levels.
And then, the second question I wanted to just follow up, I think you mentioned in your introductory commentary that you didn't spend all the budget that you're planning for in Q1 and I was wondering if you maybe could just share with us what area of the business that you didn't fully allocate the spend in the quarter. Yeah. Brian, so where we came up slightly short on our expenses for the quarter was really in the timing of our hirings, so we didn't quite hire to plan. We do plan on catching up. Our focus is on investing back in the business, not on margin expansion. So, it is our goal to actually reinvest any of our top line overperformance and catch up on hiring and other spend.
In terms of gross margin, if you look at subscription gross margin, we think there may be some opportunity there, but we're at pretty high numbers, at the 87, which was our midterm goal. It will be a little lumpy just based on timing of capital spend and other such things, but we will continue to get total gross margin expansion just as the mix continues to shift more toward Subscription versus Professional Services, so we do expect continued efficiencies based on the mix shift for sure. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Thanks very much. And apologies for the background noise. But, Aneel, I was curious on the financial side, if there are any verticals that you guys are – I know you guys have a negative targeted approach to a select number of verticals. I was wondering, when you look at your pipeline, some of the enthusiasm from customers, if there any verticals that are standing out to right now and maybe just start there. Sure. Not really much of a change. I think anytime we put a vertical focus on selling, we tend to do well usually because we always back it up with product. So, healthcare continues to do well for us. Financial services continues to do well. Our first industry foray was public sector with higher ed and state and local government. We had a series of very nice higher ed wins that we weren't allowed to disclose by name, but they were prominent universities choosing our financials. And then, the last area, technology, I think with changes like 606 and other accounting changes, it just creates an impetus for people to look at changing their system. So, really, it's the world outside of manufacturing and supply chain, the services based economies. They're all at some point going to be upgrading their finance system. And I think we're a good fit for those services-based companies. And if I could just ask quick follow-up, just when you look at the macro environment right now, which seems very healthy, has that changed the thought process at all from CFOs and executives around how fast they might want to move around taking financials to the cloud or is it still sort of methodical approach to it from your point of view and no real change because of how the economy is doing broadly? Thanks. I'd love to say that we're big enough that we can look at the data and see economic trends. And frankly, I just don't think we're there yet. We're still driven by some big wins in a given quarter. I think, frankly, what's driving CFOs is more a focus on operational efficiency first and where the legacy systems are falling down, but, more importantly, now moving towards analysis and prediction as to trying to get ahead of the curve with these faster and faster business cycles.
And there are conservative ones, to be sure. And I think they have been more cautious than the HR or the sales worlds, but they are coming around. And I think what people are realizing is that, look, if you're on the legacy system, those systems are not changing. The vendors that sell those legacy systems aren't adding new capabilities there. So, those systems are falling behind. And at some point, you don't have a choice. And I think that's really what's changed the mindset of the CFO. It's now a matter of when, not if. And so, they're looking for the capabilities that would give them business advantage rather than just updating the platform technology wise, and that's why Planning and Prism Analytics have been so powerful for us.
I don't really see it as them – that has not come up in any of the sales cycle that has been tied to the economy. Frankly, we did quite well during 2008/2009 because we were viewed as a way to save money. And so, we didn't grow as fast, but we still grew healthy during that economic downturn. So, I'm not sure that we're super tied to macro cycles.
That was a good question. We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Basically I have two questions. One would be with regards to financials. Just coming off the last comment that you just made in terms of the CFO attitudes, where would you say we are with regards to kind of the trajectory of financials relative to HCM a few years ago? Do you think we are where we were four or five years ago as it relates to HCM when we're just looking at the trajectory of the financial subscription, particularly with Aon having good success? It's hard to unpack it because we're a much larger company now as well. So, we have a much larger sales force. But if I were to guess looking at all the data in terms of adoption rates, I think we're probably five years behind where HR was in terms of adoption and maybe even a year or two later. So, when I go back to five years, five, six years ago, cloud HR amongst large companies was beginning to take off. We had – our first big customer was Flextronics in 2008. By 2011/2012, it was becoming more mainstream. And that's the time we went public in 2012. It feels about that in terms of the number of companies coming to market and the pace of growth of the pipeline, which bodes well. I've been saying about four, five years behind the last couple of years, but the data has moved around quarter to quarter. I think now we've got trendlines that say it's probably five years behind. And maybe slightly further behind outside the US, but it's growing nicely and now it's a consistent business which is a big change in the last couple of years. And that sounds like it bodes really well in terms of seriousness of some of the proposals that are out there as it relates to the fourth quarter and basically the selling cycle for this year. I believe so. It's still early. It's Q1. Q1 on both HCM and financials is really a quarter where you see the big Fortune 500 accounts close. No, I'm not talking about closing. I'm talking about the serious of discussions in advance of that. No. I totally agree with you. The thing is we won't know if they were truly serious until the fourth quarter on some of these big ones. But I think they are. And the way that the pattern of the fourth quarter last year worked, those ended up being serious discussions and we had a wave of big companies join us. And I think, if anything, it's going to be better this year. That's great. And then, just with regards to HCM internationally, can you just talk a little bit about how you size that relative to the US? And if there's anything that we should take into account with regards to differences in terms of margins that we should expect? The only data point I have is from our previous life at People Software. PeopleSoft was not as global as SAP in that mid to late 90s timeframe. I think it was 60/40 US versus rest of the world on the HR side. I think it's reasonable to see us at 50-50 at some point in the not-so-distant future on the HR side and we're not anywhere close to that right now.
I don't know if, Chano, you want to add anything to that. I think you're right on that assumption. That would be my expectation in a few years from now. We're still opening, as you saw, quite significant markets. Like, markets like Italy, we just really enter this year. We clearly have kind of on excess of 300 already multinationals present there, but really going into the market and making investments. We have just done a couple of months ago. So, that tells you that there are still key markets where we are still early. And, clearly, there lies a great opportunity ahead. We're looking in terms of pipeline today and growth and in terms of large basically customers and flagship companies talking to us. It's quite exciting and quite engaging and support a very growth – basically factor going forward. Great, thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Great, thanks very much. I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you guys provide the financial management and the planning customer adds in the quarter? No, we did not now this time. Is that something you can provide? No. We'll announce when we have significant milestones on that front, but we don't intend provide it at this time. Okay. And then, Robynne, on the headcount side, I think you grew about 25%, which is a little faster than any quarter last year. Was that meaningful below plan or just modestly below plan? It was modestly below plan. We actually came into Q1 with a really good pipeline of candidates, really good momentum on the growth. So, it was slightly below. Got it. Thanks very much. We thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO; and Chano Fernandez . this call is being webcast and will be available for the next 90 days .",0.0

Welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call.
And with that, I will hand it over to Mr. Mike Magaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Magaro, the floor is yours. Welcome to Workday's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our Co-President and CFO; and Chano Fernandez, our Co-President. Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after the close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter quiet period begins on October 15, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2018.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you Michael and hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to share the details of another strong quarter and Q2 continuing our momentum as a vendor of choice for companies embarking on digital transformation across cloud finance and HR. Our customer satisfaction rate remains among the highest in enterprise cloud software and the success of our customers is an incredibly important part of our enduring business longer term.
Let me share some of the highlights from Q2 beginning with HCM. And as of today more than 35% of the Fortune 500 and approximately 50% of the Fortune 50 have selected Workday for core HR. Our continued success amongst the largest companies in the world is a direct reflection of the value we place on live, happy and referenceable customers.
In the second quarter some of the new customers we added include Eli Lilly and Company and Bridgestone Americas in North America, Siemens Healthineers in Europe and DBS Bank in our Asia-Pacific region. Notable go lives in Q2 include Humana, Michelin, Samsung and Target. We believe that our global HCM leadership position is once again being reinforced by industry analysts. Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for cloud HCM suites for midmarket and large enterprises on August 15, 2018 and once again positioned Workday as a leader.
We also continue to see strong traction in cloud financial management where we had over 60% new customer growth in Q2 and also added another new Fortune 500 customer. We now have over 530 Financial Management customers including 8 in the Fortune 500. In the second quarter Group Foncia, Kemper Corporate Services, and Horizon Healthcare Services are few of the many new customers who selected Workday for core Financial Management. Also and equally important, we had several customers go live in Financial Management in Q2 including Continental Casualty Company and Advantis Healthcare.
As we have continued to push into the financials marketplace over the past several years, it's become very apparent that for many companies the first push into the cloud is in the area of financial and operational planning. This market dynamic is the main reason we accelerated our path into planning with the acquisition of Adaptive Insights which closed August 1. With Adaptive Insights we now have the ability to sell best-of-breed planning on a standalone basis or as part of a broad ERP suite.
Since the close, Adaptive Insights has been operating as Workday business unit under the brand Adaptive Insights a Workday company. Adaptive Insights CEO and my good friend of 15 years, Tom Bogan is reporting directly to me and has joined the executive committee of Workday. We are thrilled about the combination of Workday and Adaptive Insights which will enable customers to better plan, execute, and analyze across the enterprise all in one system, the leading cloud platform to drive their financial and business transformations. The acquisition increases the power and reach of the combined companies who share a common employee first and customer centric approach to developing enterprise software.
Additionally, we have decided that our single planning solution moving forward will be the Adaptive Insights business plan in cloud. This represents a huge opportunity for us to increase the speed to market on our long-term vision of companywide integrated financial workforce and operational planning for all enterprises large and small. With an improved value proposition for the office of the CFO we strongly believe that over time we will drive more sales for financials. We believe having Adaptive Insights as a single planning platform reduces the complexity for both customers and employees.
We are committed to unifying Adaptive Insights with Workday not bolting it on. This means the Power of One will stay intact ultimately equipping our customers with access to one source for data, one security model, one user experience and of course one Workday community that enables them to plan, execute, and analyze all in one system.
Our investment in broadening our platform and extending our product capabilities is creating many levers to drive enduring long-term growth, while Human Capital Management is our most mature segment and has fueled much of our growth, penetration rates for cloud HCM remain low globally and HCM only represents approximately 25% of our total addressable market long-term.
We are in the early days of our journey as a company and remain focused on investing to drive customer success and to help transform the way our customers do business. We look forward to sharing more about our products and market opportunity next month at Workday Rising, our annual customer conference. The financial Analyst Day takes place on October 2, in Las Vegas and we look forward to seeing many of you there.
And now over to you, Robynne. Thanks Aneel and good afternoon everyone. As Aneel discussed we continue to see momentum in our business driven by our differentiated technology and unique focus on customer success. In the second quarter we delivered total revenue of $672 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 28%. Our Q2 subscription revenue was $566 million up 30% year-over-year. Our subscription revenue outperformance was driven by net new customer growth as well as a record high for renewals achievement as a percent of the original contract value, a clear benefit of our consistently high levels of customer satisfaction.
Our Q2 Professional Services revenue grew 17% to $106 million. Total revenue outside the U.S. was up 48% to $156 million representing a record 23% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was over $5.5 billion growth of 26% year-over-year. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately two thirds of the subscription revenue backlog balance will be recognized over the next two years.
Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were down slightly to 74% primarily as a result of a decline in our Professional Services margins. This normal seasonal decline was primarily due to the costs associated with our Annual Global Partner Conference as well as the impact of our annual employee compensation cycle which went into effect at the beginning of Q2.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the second quarter was $68 million an operating margin of 10.1%. This includes the impact of $3 million of expenses related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition which was not contemplated in our previous guidance. Our investment philosophy remains focused on growth and ensuring we deliver the best products to enable our customers to transform the way they do business. We remain early in addressing our long-term opportunity with the majority of our products still in the beginning phases of their growth curves and you should continue to expect that we will reinvest any incremental topline over performance this year.
Cash flow from operations was $58 million in Q2 led by stronger than expected collections in our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $512 million, up 36% year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $338 million also up 36% year-over-year. Note that in calculating our 12-month free cash flow we've excluded $161 million related to our owned real estate projects.
Moving to the balance sheet, total unearned revenue at the end of Q2 grew 21% year-over-year to just under $1.5 billion. The current unearned revenue was $1.4 billion in line with our expectations of 25% year-over-year growth. Noncurrent unearned revenue was down 14% year-over-year.
During Q2 we completed the settlement of the convertible senior notes that became due in July. The face value of the notes was settled with $350 million in cash. We also issued approximately 1.5 million shares per the terms of the conversion provisions. The shares issued were offset completely by our exercise of the related hedge and as a result the note settlement had no net impact on our share count.
Our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q2 we successfully added and integrated over 500 net new employees bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 9100. We continue to execute very well operationally and finished a great first half of the year despite the difficult comps.
Now let's turn to guidance. Please note that our guidance incorporates the impact of transaction and integration costs as well as the ongoing operations net of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition which closed on August 1. Additionally, given current FX rates our subscription revenue guidance includes a headwind of several million dollars in the second half.
For subscription revenue we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $2.341 billion to $2.348 billion or growth of 31%. This guidance includes an estimated contribution of $42 million from Adaptive Insights. We expect our Q3 subscription revenue to be $609 million to $611 million or 31% to 32% growth inclusive of $18 million from Adaptive Insights.
We expect Professional Services revenue to be approximately $424 million in fiscal 2019 of which approximately $9 million is from Adaptive Insights. For Q3 we expect services revenue of $112 million with $4 million coming from Adaptive Insights. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 4% for Q3 and approximately 9% for the full year.
This 300 basis point reduction from our previous full-year margin guidance is related solely to the Adaptive Insights acquisition. Approximately $40 million of this headwind comes from one-time transaction and integration costs with the remaining coming from ongoing operations.
The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 31 percentage points in Q3 and 27 percentage points for the full year. Our previous expectations of organic short-term unearned revenue growth in the low 20% for the third and fourth quarters this year is unchanged. Adding in Adaptive Insights however we now expect the growth in short-term unearned revenue could be up to 25% in Q3 and Q4.
We expect operating cash flow to be approximately $550 million for the year reflecting the full impact from the Adaptive Insights acquisition. We still expect FY '19 capital spend to be approximately $200 million for our development center project and an additional $200 million for all other CapEx.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results for the first half of the year. We are also thrilled to welcome the incredible Adaptive Insights team to Workday and are excited about what we will accomplish together in the second half and beyond. We look forward to seeing many of you Workday Rising in October as we share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.
Operator, let's now begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Sir, you may ask your question. Hi, this is Kevin Ma on for Brad. Thanks for taking the quarter and congrats on the quarter. Can you give any update on how you are thinking about the go to market strategy with Adaptive and coordinating the sales force with Workday's enterprise reps? Sure. So we're going to continue to sell Adaptive as a standalone best-of-breed planning product through the Adaptive sales force which will continue to grow both in their medium enterprise as well as large enterprise business. You'll see them continue to focus on selling planning standalone.
If it's inclusive of a larger ERP deal with financials or HR then the Workday reps will take the lead with support from Adaptive and we are figuring out the compensation model just to make sure that everyone is acting in the right mode. It's really important for us to continue to leverage Adaptive's place as a best-of-breed solution and so it will be sold standalone whether or not the customer is a Workday customer. Got it, thank you. And just as a quick followup, can you give any color on how much Adaptive contributed to subscription backlog for the quarter? Adaptive is not in subscription backlog for the quarter since we closed that transaction the first day of Q3. Our next questions come from the line of Mr. Justin Furby from William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Thanks guys, and congrats. And I guess couple of questions for Aneel. Maybe a first one in terms of subscription growth this quarter, it looked like it was more or less stable from Q1 at around 30% and in last few quarters you had some pretty notable deceleration there. So I guess I'm just wondering if you feel like the business is nearing a floor in terms of organic growth over the medium term and what do you think Adaptive does you sort of called out the inorganic pieces, but when you look out over the medium term, what do you think it does to your organic growth in terms of planning and driving that business but also driving financials deal? Thanks. Yes, you know in terms of subscription growth I'd probably defer that question to Robynne, but I think we've been pretty clear all along that the first half of the year had pretty challenging comps from last year and the second half of the year the comps are easier. In terms of Adaptive, what we recognized through the past few years of selling core financials as soon as we introduced planning we had a new entry into the sales cycle.
The planning area was viewed currently as a good place to start in the transformation to the cloud and very strategic to the office of the CFO. What we found is that, while we were making traction with our own development efforts, we were two years or three years behind where the market needed us to be.
So with Adaptive we very quickly get into the market with a leader defined by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant and those will open more doors for us the broader Financial Management suites. So it's the double bonus of now being viewed as a leader in that space as well as opening up the doors to the larger core Financial Management business and so we're very excited about it.
Also the acceleration that we see – the acceleration we see as a big potential for us is in large enterprise that has historically not been a focus of the Adaptive sales organization. They are going to move into large enterprise and of course we have hundreds of large enterprise sales reps that will be able to introduce Adaptive into the large enterprise accounts. Okay got it. And then maybe just one more on the HR service delivery market it seems like that is a opportunity and the market is starting to really inflect and I'm just wondering if you guys plan to at some point enter that market directly or if it is really to leverage partners because it seems to me as a pretty big opportunity within your installed base there? Thanks. For the time being it is leveraging partners, but it is definitely one of the areas on our roadmap as we explore new areas of growth. Okay, great. Thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Mr. Murphy, you may ask your question. Thank you. I'll add my congrats. So Aneel, I was thinking back here 12 to 18 months ago and you seemed to be entering a pretty unusual period where there were many large enterprise HCM deals and it ended up including Walmart and Target and Dow Chemical and BT and many others and I think you had a single quarter where you closed 13 Fortune 500s and I think it was partly due to some of the competitors products that were being sun-setted or end of life. What are you observing today in terms of the HCM replacement cycle and when do you think is the next point in time where you would expect to see kind of an unusual cluster of the large enterprise deals coming together like that? Well, the large enterprise deals are continuing to come and they are coming to Workday and I think we're getting far more than our fair share. I think this past quarter we had eight Fortune 500 accounts that became Workday customers. So it continues to be a very strong market and it's the second quarter which is not typically a Fortune 500 quarter that typically is our fourth quarter.
So we don't really see anything changing that dramatically. I think if anything what we're seeing are some of the multinational Fortune 500 accounts not based in the U.S. coming to market and looking for a partner to help them move HR into the cloud and go through their HR transformation. And I'd say most of the international markets are three or four years behind the U.S. and so some of those markets are really beginning to pick up now. Okay thank you, Aneel. As a quick followup for Robynne, I just wanted to ask you what are you observing today in terms of the typical subscription fees that are being generated in financials versus HCM for instance and I mean, if you're comparing like-for-like size of organizations, so if a company has 10,000 employees and you look at the ratio of the subscription fee for financials relative to HCM, what exactly are you observing there and what do you think it would look like in the long run? Yes, Mark. So the way our list price works is it’s about a one to one ratio and we’re seeing very consistent discounting rates across both of those products. And Chano, is there anything you want to add? That's accurate, that's what we’re seeing. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may ask your question. Hi, thank you, guys and thanks for taking the question and a nice quarter. Similar question to what Mark was asking but on the other side of the business in terms of financials, one of the things that we noted in our recent CIO survey and in a couple of other recent CIO surveys is, ERP refreshes and ERP investment is rising at the CIO priority list. I want to ask you if you’re seeing that in your interactions with customers are you seeing financials kind of rise in priority? And then I have a followup. Absolutely, and I think the combination of core fin procurement expenses and planning all together we can be an ERP replacement today and it definitely seems to be the next area of focus from IT, it was CRM then HR, IT, and I think it’s now, I think finance is the next big one to tackle.
And one of the reasons why it hasn’t, it’s been clear one of the reasons it hasn’t taken off in the past is that the products including ours were just not ready to take over that operations of the truly large multinationals, but from a future function perspective and we’re confident that they are today and so when they go off do their analysis, they are confident with the fact that, hey I’m not actually giving up anything on the functionality side and I’m making a huge leap forward on the technology side. Got it. Got it and then the followup question was on sort of the mid market opportunity, any kind of changes that you may put your sort of go to market or the mid market focus with Adaptive, because I know they had a really big new market presence within their customer base. Does that become a new sort of distribution avenue for financials to come into the new market for you guys or with the core financials? Well, we’ve had a very strong run in medium enterprise since about a year and half ago. Chano really created hard and fast lines between large enterprise and medium enterprise all the way through the sales organization, all the way down to the rep level and all the way up to the senior sales executive level.
I think that with Adaptive our medium enterprise business lines are very nicely with their medium enterprise business and I think we’ll be able to take their product into our existing installed base medium enterprise accounts and sell into other accounts together. The big benefit though is frankly taking their great product and moving it into the large enterprise market and our 2200 large enterprise customers. That I think we all agree is the biggest opportunity. Is there Chano, do you want to add anything? No, I think you’re right. We had a great financials basically quarter also in the medium enterprise, we commented on the customer growth of 60% year-on-year that was tremendously strong and particularly in that part of the market. We’re very excited about with Adaptive expanding the capabilities we have particularly around financial planning and sales operation planning where we have not been playing that much before is being more work force planning. So I think that would be a great offering and we are coordinating on the lining in that mid-market. So we see extended having - and has opportunity there besides the one with large enterprise here in the U.S. and particularly in the rest of the world where the Adaptive coverage is also shorter than basically the footprint we have as a channel there. Super, helpful. Thank you so much. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Hi, congratulations on showing the strong sequential billings acceleration, I think you guided to that and you delivered. I’m also curious to get your thoughts on how to think about backlog growth rate. Certainly, we’re seeing more seasonality on the backlog sales, sequentially it did grow but it has grown a little bit faster, so I’m just wondering if the business is becoming more seasonal therefore or the weight of backlog performance, is it going to be really shifted towards the second half?
And maybe a quick followup, Aneel how do you expect the Adaptive acquisition to catalyze the sales cycles of financials customers and potential prospects and how they are likely to close on the broader geo [ph] opportunity not just the planning aspect? Thank you so much. So Kash on the backlog we are seeing multiple dynamics there including the seasonality that you’ve talked about, we also had very difficult comps in first half of last year, so that impacted the backlog revenue growth and we saw some headwinds in Q2 from both duration and FX. As the renewal cycles also can move around that will impact as well. So on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it could vary a little, but we do expect that on the longer term it’s going to be a good indicator of our growth long-term. On the second question Kash, there is no question that we believe planning will accelerate some of the core financial business as well. But I think the most important piece is that much like Workday, Adaptive is very focused on customer success and if they are able to get in the door and win even just the planning business, we will get a shot at the HR business and the finance business down the road.
So it just gets us in the door and once we get to the door, we are confident that we will prove ourselves from a customer success perspective and it’s one of the reasons we were so drawn to Adaptive. They have the same exact focus on employees and the same exact focus on customer success and I think it’s just going to dramatically open up the market.
So you go visit a customer they are not ready to swap out their core accounting system, but they are ready to take on a planning system. Well that’s fine. We will get in the door and when they are ready to switch to core accounting, we will be the best positioned both from a product integration perspective and a relationship perspective. Wonderful, thank you so much. All the best. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc Capital. Sir, you may ask your question. Great, thanks for taking the question here. I guess Robynne, I wanted to follow up on subscription backlog kind of growth metrics. If I look at our analysis over last year, it looked like you doubled the number of Fortune 50 customers in year ago. I guess my systemic question is, when do those compares start to ease, is that really kind of the April quarter of next year, just trying to understand if you think about the growth metrics on subscription backlog has decelerated I get the tough compares, it sounds like there is FX as well. But when are we through the bulk of the tough compares there? Yes, so if you take out the very large deals, we’re through the bulk of the tough compares right now. So it was really the first half of last year where we had really strong reacceleration of net new ACV and so we do expect net new ACV growth acceleration in the back half of this year as the comps get a little more favorable for us.
I think the wildcard here is that large deals of Fortune 500 and the Fortune deals and when those come to market which can make the results lumpy, certainly when they do come to market we really like our odds to win them and we’ve got great competitive win rates in that space as Aneel talked about, but they are a little hard to predict in terms of timing. Great, and then Aneel one for you here as we think about eight Fortune 500 wins this quarter, one Fortune 500 cloud financial win, what is the pipeline activity, we continue to hear more around ERP refresh cycles and modernization projects, how is the pipeline on cloud financials in the Fortune 500 look for the second half? Chano? Well, we have a solid pipeline growth for both financials on our international business in the second half. From a mix perspective really the financials continues to grow as a percentage of the mix, although clearly we have given sustained growth in ACA and the mix shift is moving slowly. But there are some large deals there in the second half, it’s always difficult to predict exactly the timing if those deals are going to happening in Q4 as we have expectations for during Q3 and Q4 or a couple of them may slip one or two quarters right given the timing basically of those discussions. But we had good coverage and healthy pipeline for that financials opportunity in the second half. Very helpful, that is all I had. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats. Yes maybe just a bigger picture question in terms of the Fortune 500 HCM deals that you expect this year versus next year versus last year not just for you but for the industry as a whole and maybe with the positive economic backdrop and budget cycles, are you seeing in any way an acceleration of that cycle this year and again how should we think about that, the proportion of that activity over the course of this year and next year? It’s a good question, I’m not sure we see an acceleration of activity. I definitely think we’re through the early adopter segment of companies moving to the cloud. I would hope that we have a shot at getting to 50% of the Fortune 500 and we’re within distance of that over the next couple of years, if you look at the number that we’re signing every quarter.
I think actually the bigger phenomenon is that these Fortune 500 accounts once they are live are coming back and taking on more modules and we have shared this at past user conferences, we will share it again, but for that first dollar spend on core HR, it can be $2 or $3 more in terms of add-on products whether it’s payroll or learning or recruiting time now planning.
There are so many areas that once we get that customer into production, it’s so important that we get them into production they come back and buy more. That is probably the biggest phenomenon we have seen as these big companies have gone live there are customer base sellbacks as much stronger than it was maybe two or three years ago. Yes, that is helpful. And then Aneel maybe just another follow up on Adaptive, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that Adaptive will become your planning cloud solution. I’m curious can you maybe drill down into what exactly you mean about are you going to rewrite their product on your platform or are you going to standardize on their platform to preserve that power of one, and maybe just drill in a little bit deeper on that and also how long do you kind of expect this process to take before you can really start making the meaningful sales? Well, I think we’ve make meaningful sales immediately just selling it. It was a thriving business before Workday and I hope hopefully we can have it do even better. So there are a couple of things into making it our platform. Number one, Workday had its own planning product, Workday Planning that was primarily focused on Workforce Planning. Our original take was that we will continue to build workforce planning and Adaptive would focus on financial and operational planning.
As we dug into it and understood the real breadth and power of the Adaptive platform, they are not that far away from Workforce planning. Today it made sense just to say let’s put all of our eggs in that one planning basket. So we will be over time sun setting the Workday workforce planning product and moving all those customers to the Adaptive planning platform.
In terms of the integration, I will get into trouble with the development team, but I will put a range 12 to 18 months to completely have it unified, but you will see it in steps. The first step will be very tight integration and making sure that the data models are in sync over time user experience and security and I think within 12 to 18 months, you will not be able to tell the difference that one product was built separately.
The beauty of it is, is that it’s not a transactional application. Planning is really built around a modeling engine. Workday did not have a modeling engine in its platform. So that is additive and now we’re just making sure that the data models, the metadata models, the security model, the user interface are all harmonized and that’s something that we have had good experience with in the past. Great, thank you, guys. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Thanks very much. Aneel, I was wondering if you could just talk about adoption of the Financial Management product by vertical? I know your strategy in the financial management world is a lot more sort of industry focused, so I was just wondering if you could just comment on the industries, you are seeing good adoption or maybe the ones that are sort of either ahead or a little bit behind what you are thinking maybe at the start of this fiscal year? Thanks. We do have a much more industry focused approach to financials, number one because the financial products themselves require more industry capabilities than the HR products do. HR is pretty homogenous across different industries. With financials we started out with E&G, Education and Government, we continue to do very well in that space. Many of the largest universities use Workday Financials as well as Workday HR. That was followed on by healthcare and we continue to land some of the largest healthcare transformations as they move their financials into the cloud.
Technology continues to be a strong area for us largely now on the back of 606 and people having to go through the painful change of their RevRec and within Workday that is already built in and easy to use.
And then other business services, Professional Services, those have all been good areas for us. Financial services has been strong in pockets. Insurance has been one of our most I guess strongest markets of moving financials to the cloud. Wall Street Banks have been slower, so if I were to say where I would hope we'd see more traction, it would be in Wall Street Banks.
Wall Street Banks were also later on the HR side due to the heavy regulation and just the amount of work we have to produce for regulators. So I suspect that in the next year or two, you'll start seeing the big investment banks coming to market with financials for the cloud. I don’t know Chano, if I missed any. I think you covered it pretty greatly. What I would say is when you look at the pipeline particularly on our core financials verticals, they have been there for longer Education & Government and Healthcare, you see that kind of 70% of the deals are kind of ERP deals kind of hovering - having both ACA and financials on the industry component as part of the mix of the pipeline and clearly our win ratios are stronger into the verticals that Aneel mentioned and those services and people focused than outside of our core verticals. Great, thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Well, thanks so much and my congrats as well. May be two for Robynne. Robynne just the commentary on the tough comps, I think from the HCMs late last year are you exclusively saying that we should look for the backlog growth to reaccelerate in the second half? That's question one.
And then question two FX, you mentioned this, but I don’t - you said several million, but I just wondered, are we getting to a point now where the international non-U.S. dollar denominated business is getting significantly now such that we should start to think about constant currency versus reported growth, and I wondered if there was any more color on that as you think about the back half. Thanks. Yes, sure Ross. With regard to the backlog growth and the tough comps, so I wouldn’t expect backlog growth re-acceleration because it’s such a large number $5.5 billion and so the backlog has reached the large numbers there where it would be really hard to reaccelerate growth. So we do expect to see a reacceleration of our net new ACV growth, but that likely won’t lead to a reacceleration of backlog growth.
We do though expect the seasonal pattern to backlog growth to still hold going forward, so relatively flat Q2 to Q3 and then our more significant uptick in Q4. We still are watching the backlog numbers, still a fairly recent metric for us now that our peers have started to adopt 606 and report this number we're still beginning to evaluate the patterns and think about how we want to look at that and talk about it going forward.
With regard to your second question on FX, the FX doesn’t always impact us as much as some of our peers because we are functional U.S. dollar currency and most of our entities out of which we sell which means once we contract, enter into a contract then the FX rate gets locked once it's billed and then we actually hedge it going forward.
So the real FX impact is on new deals during the quarter and the year whereby we may have gone into the year with an assumption of British Pound deal translating into certain amount of USD and that may fluctuate over time. So not as big of an impact for us as some of the other companies out there but still something we are keeping an eye on. Great, thanks for the clarification. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Sir, you may ask your question. Yes, hi thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Aneel, I wanted to ask you how you are thinking about capitalizing on the opportunity and operational planning? The reason I ask is that if I recall Adaptive Insights I think about 20% of the users are actually business users and are using it for operational planning. I think you mentioned Adaptive has a modern sales planning product that they just came to market.
You are also talking little bit more about ERP here on the call. So I just want to ask you how you're thinking about investing in capitalizing on the operational planning, positioning that Adaptive Insights already has in the market today? Thanks. It was definitely one of the parts of their strategy that was very attractive to us. That was not the Workday planning strategy. Before Adaptive, we were pretty narrowly focused on financial planning and workforce planning. Adaptive had several years ago embarked on sales planning as sales and operational planning as its next push after financial planning. We are only going to accelerate that with more development resources for them and after that they’re going to focus on Workforce planning, so that we can retire our product and who knows after that.
There's lots of different directions, it is a really powerful planning platform built around very powerful modeling engine and with their new versions they are able to scale to largest companies in the world. So maybe manufacturing is not and raw materials and part is not something that happened to the next two to three years. But there is no reason it couldn’t be part of the Adaptive platform long term. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Berg from Needham. Sir, you may ask your question. Hi everyone, congrats on a good question as well. I guess one quick one for you and a quick followup for Robynne. For you Aneel, you had mentioned that Target went live already and knowing when that contract was roughly signed. It seems like your implementation cycles have actually become faster in HR. But can you talk about maybe impacts that you’ve seen with getting better and improving those process and how it might be speeding up maybe your sales cycles and customers willingness to dive into something like financials. I’m not sure they have gotten faster. They are definitely more predictable and we've seen Fortune 500, even Fortune 50 companies go live in 12 or 13 months and Target had a great team in place. They really focused on the implementation and got it done in a very quick time. We have seen that in the past with companies like Bank of America, with AstraZeneca. It can be done in that I’d say 11 to 13-month timeframe is best-in-class for a Fortune 50 type company.
I would say that what’s making it more predictable are the tools that we’re delivering for the implementation side. We've had an ongoing development effort to streamline the inputting of data to streamline the process configuration where many of the functions are now automated. We actually did these things for the medium enterprise to bring down the services cost. But we’re now able to leverage some of these tools in large enterprise as well. So it’s definitely a big area for focus. We've got some of our best people working on it based in Dublin to just make implementations faster and simpler. Got it, very helpful and then the followup for Robynne. Robynne, you specifically called out improved renewals, I think you said record high renewals. I guess the question is, was that on a gross basis or a net basis, if the gross basis maybe what is driving the improved renewals, I don’t know if you can point to anything, if on a net basis what are customers buying more say maybe a year ago? Yes, so we have been reporting fairly consistently that on a dollar value basis, we have been over 100% right and last quarter was really just a very stellar quarter for renewals. And I'm going to turn over to Chano to comment here in just a minute. But we actually have an increased focus on renewals and trying to sell more into that base and make sure that we’re maximizing the renewals and that was an organizational shift that Chano affected at the beginning of this year. Do you want to comment on that Chano? Yes, so our customer base is basically increasing. We make a change in the go to market as some of you have noticed which is putting more focus in terms of our customers for our cross selling and up selling efforts and that seems to be paying off. We look at basically at the pure data from the first half of this year and clearly we’re just double down the efforts with engagement on those customers making sure that we plan ahead of those renewal cycles properly.
So if anything they come as expected or better than expected. That thing has happened particularly in Q2, we are highlighting positively. On top of that clearly we take those opportunities for an increase basically adoption of new products or [indiscernible] use and has come also on board very nicely within Q2. But to answer your question with more door to door [ph] compared to the initial contract in terms of performance. Helpful, thank you. We will take our final question from Mr. Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Mr. Ravens, you may ask your question. Great, thank you and I will add my congratulations. I mean as you have geared a little bit, Aneel if you look at the $40 billion CRM market, under what circumstances would it make sense for Workday to offer sales marketing or customer support solutions? You know, I have said this really since we started the company. Marc Benioff and Salesforce have been great partners and they have chosen not to enter our space and we’ve chosen not to enter their space largely because the partnership we have together I think benefits both companies. If that were ever to change then we might reconsider it. But I don’t see it changing and they continue to be one of our best partners and it’s nice having partners where you're not competing, it just changes the relationship. So I don’t see that as one of our future growth areas.
There are so many other things for us to do. When I look at the world right now 90% of our business comes out of HCM, financials is growing at a nice clip, Prism Analytics relatively new growing at a very nice clip, planning relatively new and then of course the Workday Cloud platform coming to market and is slowly coming to market it is already in limited general availability. But we can already see a lot of demand for that. So we've got enough irons in the fire so to speak that will keep us busy for the next several years without even considering a different category. Even Aneel you mentioned that HCM only represents 25% of our total addressable market. I mean when you look at the international markets we are in so early stages with that extends over there the opportunity when they are still super significant besides all the other areas and products we just mentioned. So we have no, we see no problem in terms of shortage of market opportunity right now that we need to execute on. Great, thank you. We now conclude this call. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great day. You may now disconnect.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO; and Chano Fernandez . this call is being webcast .",0.0

And with that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q3 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that in our third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we experienced an acceleration in net new ACV growth.
Our Human Capital Management business remained strong and we had a great quarter for our Financial Management suite of applications. Importantly, the business acceleration we enjoyed took place independent of the impact of the Adaptive Insights acquisition.
Starting with HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to gain share in the market with an industry leading true cloud platform, the deepest product capabilities, an unparalleled user experience and the highest levels of customer success. In Q3, some of the new HCM customers we added include Bank of Montreal, Glencore International, and Piedmont Airlines, a subsidiary of American Airlines.
We continue to land marquee accounts in part due to our proven ability to support our customers' large volumes of data and transactions, a capability that neither of our legacy competitors has been able to consistently demonstrate in the cloud.
In Q3, we also saw accelerated growth for the Workday Financial Management suite of applications. Subscription revenue once again grew over 50% with net new ACV for core financials growing over 60%.
We believe that a combination of our expanded set of offerings, the increasing acceptance of the cloud by the office of the CFO, and our ever-increasing cohort of financial customers in production are collectively driving broader adoption of our Financial Management applications.
New Workday Financial Management customers in Q3 included the Atlanta Braves baseball, Spectrum Health, H & R Block, Fox, and a large U.S. based financial services organization. In addition to the strong growth from our core financial suite of application, Q3 was our first quarter with Adaptive Insights as part of Workday.
I'm pleased to report we got off to a great start together, accelerating the pace of adoption of cloud planning with early success selling Adaptive Insights product to large enterprise customers.
Indeed, the early feedback on the Adaptive business plan and cloud offerings from customers and prospects alike has been very positive with high interest and enthusiasm for the Adaptive offerings. And we are actively working on migrating many of our Workday planning customers to Adaptive.
We're committed to unifying Adaptive Insights with Workday [indiscernible]. While we will continue to support Adaptive integrations with all ERP systems, we are on track to 12 to 15 month delivery of the Power of One which will benefit our customers with access to one source for data, one security model, one user experience and of course one Workday community that enables them to plan, execute and analyze on one platform.
And lastly in Q3, we also experienced strong growth in our media segment of our business. As many of you know, we announced the Workday launch program last year which introduced fixed fee preconfigured application packages for U.S. based medium enterprises.
Our ability to offer a full platform solution across HR, payroll and finance with lowered implementation costs have enhanced our already strong competitive position and accelerated our growth in that segment of the market. With the success of Workday launch in the U.S. we are now planning to take that program overseas in fiscal year 2020 to target medium enterprise businesses outside the U.S.
Our momentum in customer success was best captured at our annual user conferences, Workday Rising in the U.S. and in Europe. Between our U.S. conference in Las Vegas last month and our European conference in Vienna two weeks ago, we welcomed more 13,000 attendees including almost 8,500 customer attendees representing approximately 1,700 organizations.
At Workday Rising, we once again revealed our annual customer satisfaction rating which came in at 98%. As you hopefully know by now, customer success is a core value of Workday and the Workday team works hard every day to help our customers run their business more effectively and make better decisions along the way.
On the product front, we continue to push technology and innovation with our most recent focus on embedding AI and machine learning as the fabric of the Workday platform. With Workday analytic, data, finance and HR systems, we're leveraging the acquisition of storage to offer Workday People Analytics, a new application that will give executives, organizational leaders and HR business partners a view into the most critical trends in their workforce and an understanding of the most likely drivers of those trends.
It will leverage powerful artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented analytics technologies to provide dynamically created metrics accompanied by explanatory narratives, what we call stories.
Our customers continue to benefit from our continuous innovation cycle. During the quarter, we announced the availability of Workday 31 which among the many new features included skills cloud, a university skills that helps organizations cleanse, understand, and relate job skills data.
We believe our investment in innovation and our people will continue to pay off. In the quarter, we were ranked number one on Fortune's Future 50 list which recognizes the world's most forward-looking innovative companies that are investing in the future. From day one innovation has been in [indiscernible]. From the products we built, culture we foster, we've always had our eyes on what it takes to launch our company and our customers and our industry into the future.
And employees will always be our number one core value. Happy employees build the best product and make customers happy. On that note, I'm also pleased to share that Fortune and Great Places to Work announced this month that Workday is number three on the list of 100 Best Workplaces for Women.
As we look to the future, we are firmly established our leadership in HCM where we differentiate ourselves through innovation, scalability and customer [indiscernible] and expect to continue to gain market share globally. And we are an early leader in cloud Financial Management with a strong set of offerings for CFOs who are looking to modernize their financial analysis and planning systems.
Both HCM and Financial Management will continue to be the primary drivers of growth in the near term with the strong foundation for future growth drivers and Workday analytics, Adaptive Insights, business plan and cloud and the Workday cloud. All in all, a great quarter with strong momentum heading into Q4 and the year end.
And now over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel discussed, we delivered strong performance in Q3 resulting in accelerated growth across our core business metric and giving us great momentum heading into year end.
On today's call, I'll touch on the highlights from our third quarter, update our guidance for Q4, and provide a preliminary high level view of FY 2020.
Given this is our first quarter with Adaptive Insights, we are providing an additional level of transparency during this call to assist in your understanding of how Adaptive Insights impacted our Q3 results across our key metrics. Internally, however we are not tracking Adaptive Insights differently from any other product so you should not expect us to guide or report planning metrics separately going forward. Instead, as with all key products, we will give you milestone updates as and when it makes sense to do so.
For Q3, we delivered total revenue of $743 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34%. Our Q3 subscription revenue was $624 million, up 35% year-over-year. Approximately $4 million of the over-performance is attributable to the finalization of the deferred revenue haircut related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition. The remaining upside was driven by very strong performance across our product suite.
Revenue outside the U.S. was up 47% to $170 million, representing 23% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $5.9 billion, growth of 31% year-over-year. Approximately $140 million of this increase or 3 percentage points of growth relates to the inclusion of the Adaptive Insights backlog balance.
The remaining growth was driven by an acceleration of net new bookings growth, including a few deals that pulled in from Q4 and very strong renewals with net retention once again over 100%. Our 24-month subscription backlog was $4.02 billion or growth of 31%. Approximately $125 million or 4 points of growth relates to the inclusion of Adaptive Insights.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the third quarter was $49.7 million and operating margin of 6.7%. The margin upside from our guidance was primarily a result of the strong revenue performance. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $114 million. As we noted in our guidance last quarter, cash flow in the second half of this year is impacted by one-time acquisition related payments with a majority of the impact occurring in Q3.
Total unearned revenue at the end of Q3 grew 28% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Current unearned revenue was $1.46 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday.
During Q3, we successfully added and integrated over 1,000 net new employees, including over 500 from Adaptive Insights, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 10,200. We are very pleased with our operational execution in Q3 and feel well positioned going into our historically strongest quarter.
Now let's turn to guidance. The continued strength in our business is allowing us to raise our Q4 and fiscal 2019 outlook as follows. For subscription revenue, we're raising our full year estimate to be in the range of $2.375 billion to $2.377 billion or growth of 33%.
We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $663 million to $665 million or 35% to 36% growth. We expect professional services revenue to be approximately $433 million in fiscal 2019 and $112 million in Q4. We therefore estimate that total revenue for fiscal 2019 will be $2.808 billion to $2.810 billion, or growth of 31%, with Q4 total revenue in the range of $775 million to $777 million, or growth of 33%.
We are expecting non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 10% for both Q4 and the full year. The GAAP operating margins are expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margins by approximately 27 percentage points in both Q4 and fiscal 2019.
Given strength in the business, we now forecast short-term unearned revenue to grow approximately 26% in Q4. We are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $550 million for the full year, but believe there may be some upside to that number depending on Q4 linearity and timing of collections.
We are also maintaining our capital expenditure guidance for the year of $200 million for our owned real estate projects and another $200 million for all other CapEx. Please note that next year we will no longer be providing color around short-term unearned revenue growth rates.
We did this in fiscal 2019 as a bridge until our peers transition to the new reporting requirements around remaining performance obligations, what we call subscription revenue backlog. While this new metric is not perfect, we believe it's a better gauge of the health of our business over the long term primarily because unlike unearned revenue and billings, it's not impacted by varying contractual invoicing terms.
While we are early in our FY 2020 planning cycle and still have an important Q4 to close, we would like to provide a preliminary and high level view of FY 2020. We remain confident in our ability to sustain strong long-term revenue growth, given the secular market trends towards cloud adoption and our established leadership position.
We are currently planning for FY 2020 subscription revenue of approximately $3.0 billion to $3.01 billion. We continue to expect pronounced and compounding seasonality towards Q4 with our Q1 being the seasonally slowest in terms of net new bookings.
We would expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY 2020 to grow approximately 4% sequentially from Q4. We continue to prioritize growth over margin expansion and have made and will continue to make significant product and other investments next year and beyond.
While FY 2020 still faces some margin headwinds from the Adaptive acquisition, we do expect to return to more normal levels of operating margin expansion. We are currently planning for FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margins of 12%, which represents an estimated 200 basis point improvement year-over-year.
With that, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work which allowed us to deliver great results in the third quarter and have set us up for a strong finish to the year.
Operator, let's now begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you. This is Kevin Ma on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I just wanted to ask on Pro services, that reaccelerated pretty substantially this quarter, even taking out what you originally guided for the Adaptive acquisition. Can you give any color on how much of that was from incremental synergies and uptake from financials or any other drivers. Yeah, so what you see in the Pro serve growth is kind of seasonal patterns that are pretty normal for us. That number can ebb and flow based on the number of implementations going on at any given time, how many of those we're priming, so really just normal levels of growth there. Got it. Okay. That's it from me. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark, are you there? Next question, please. I'm here. Yeah, I was trying to ask you on the platform deals that our field work has been showing a real increase there on the deals that include both HR and financials, and it's been not only in the mid-market but also in the portion of enterprise that kind of gets up towards 10,000 or 20,000 employees.
So just curious from what you're seeing how tangible is that trend toward the platform purchases if you look at the bookings mix? And then when you take a look at the pipeline for next year, do you see that accelerating in terms of the platform consideration? Well, there's no question that for medium enterprise buyers, really for the last several years that the platform solution is a really popular solution. They need to move HR and finance to the cloud. They would prefer not to have two different systems.
They would rather have one unified system. And now what we're seeing is that trend begin to move up market, probably more driven by financials moving up market. And so I would expect that to continue and to become a bigger part of our business. Tom, anything to add? No, I think that's correct. Hi, Mark. From a perspective, the financials management continues to grow as a percentage of the mix. Although give of course sustained solid growth in HCM, the mix shift is moving slowly. Okay. And Chano, if I may, just a quick follow-up. I think at Rising you commented that the pipeline was particularly strong for Q4. So I think it's a little surprising to see kind of the blowout results in Q3. Is the confidence in Q4 equally high, or were the deals that pulled into Q3 material enough to kind of change that Q4 setup at all? Thank you, Mark. I think we commented we pulled in some business forward from our Q4 quarter but we have similar levels of pipeline coverage as of last year, so I think it's going to be a question of execution. It's still early in the quarter. But we're positive about the outlook. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi. This is Sanjit Singh sitting in for Keith. Congrats on a really strong quarter. I had two questions. First on international, on the 47% growth there, seems like that's getting a lot of momentum. Aneel, you mentioned about the opportunity to further penetrate the mid-market, but any sort of color you can provide on what's driving the strength in the international side of the house, whether it's new HCM wins or further expansion of the base. Any detail there would be appreciated. I'll turn that question over to Chano. Thanks for the question. We are happy with the momentum in the international business, the foundation that we had created, the strong customer visibility and we had a hugely successful rise in Europe Vienna. Our footprint across Europe and Asia really is still expanding. It's early days as those markets are behind the U.S. in terms of cloud adoption which is clearly a great opportunity over time.
I believe there are a couple of emerging geographies where we still have work ahead of us in terms of establishing consistency, but we are very focused on improving the great opportunity ahead of us in international. I appreciate the comments, Chano. Maybe as my follow-up, Aneel, you mentioned that ACV growth of 60%-plus in Financial Management, ahead of revenue growth. To me, I know we've been hesitant to call this out before, but it felts like a bit of inflection, and I wonder how you were sort of interpreting the strong Financial Management performance this quarter.
Does this feel like a different type of environment for Financial Management versus some of the previous times when we've seen a bit of an uptick and then maybe a little bit of a leveling out. Any sort of comments there. Well, I'm going to be careful to not draw any conclusions from one quarter. We have been growing the business at over a 50% clip on the subscription revenue side now for quite some time. The medium enterprise business continues to be very strong for financials.
I think sometimes people discount how good that opportunity is for us, not just in the U.S. but across the globe. And we are continuing to see the move amongst large enterprises. I won't say that all Fortune 500 accounts are showing up at once, but the rate of Fortune 500 accounts showing up to evaluate financials for the cloud is definitely picking up.
So ask again after every quarter and we can start looking at patterns, but I don't want to draw any conclusions just out of one quarter. But very pleased. I do think that one of the things that CFOs are paying attention to by nature, a fairly risk averse crowd, we're now over 500 customers who are using Workday Financials and I think 70% of them are live and in production.
And so now there is a cohort of very happy customers using the system to close their books and run their business. So CFOs can ask their peers about Workday and financials in the cloud, and a few years ago, that was a much smaller universe of companies you could talk to. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Thanks, guys. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. Great. I guess just – hi. I just wanted to follow up on the financials commentary. I guess if you look competitively, Aneel or Chano, how do you feel about sort of your win rates in that market versus what you see on the HR side of things?
And I'm curious – I know it's pretty early were Adaptive, but what the conversations have changed at all now that that business is inside of Workday and how that changes the dynamic, particularly in the enterprise, if it's changed at all yet. So on the first one, our win rates are relatively similar for HR and finance, and that's been the case for quite some time. In the finance market, there are – the only overlap and really main competitors in finance is Oracle. SAP doesn't have a product in the cloud. Ultimate is just an HR competitor and we see NetSuite less and less. So it is a slightly different competitive landscape but our win rates are pretty similar.
In terms of Adaptive, there's a high degree of interest amongst the Workday enterprise customers and Adaptive Insights. Not just the ones who had already signed up for planning, but ones that are HR customers, maybe not quite ready to switch out core financials but looking at planning as a first step to moving financials into the cloud.
So Tom and I couldn't be more thrilled as to how the Adaptive products are being received by the historical Workday customer base. Tom, you want to add anything to that. Yeah, I think that's right, Aneel. I think both the receptivity on the part of the Workday customers who bought planning and the conversations we've had with them in terms of moving to the Adaptive platform.
But I think from an Adaptive perspective what we've seen is a lot of interest in the Workday large enterprise customer base. And we've had a number of conversations, there's certainly in many cases in the early stages but they've been extremely constructive and we're very optimistic about the potential to grow that business as we move forward. Okay. Great. Super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, either for Aneel or Chano. I know you've been sort of throttling the selling effort on Prism this year. When you look out to next year, I’m just curious sort of what your expectations are there.
And then student is one that I don't know if we talked about in some time but it seems like that's getting closer to a market that's starting to inflect and curious sort of those two products, Prism and student and how you think about them for next year. Thanks. So I would say on Prism we're less and threat throttling our willingness to sell. It's much more about making sure that the use cases fit where we are with the products. But the product line is one of the fastest growing product lines from a net new ACV perspective we've ever seen. Can I say what numbers, Robynne. Triple digits. Triple digit year-over-year growth. And as we begin to mature the capabilities and grow the use cases, we honestly expect that to continue and as we've done some analysis, we've had one of our long-time strategy folks, Derek Butts, do some real analysis on many of our new initiatives.
And one of the surprises was the upside we see on the Prism business as we turn an offering into a product line and people analytics is one of those first steps into turning it into a product line. There's a clear path to building a billion dollar business there on Prism that might not have been as obvious to us a little while ago.
In terms of student systems, we're very focused on getting the first four or five large universities into production and after that we can think more about scaling the business. But that's where we are right now, very focused on building out the capabilities and getting those large universities live in the coming quarters. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. Just two from me. So maybe first, Aneel, on financials, can you talk about the activity around selling into the HR base versus net new logos?
And then as you think about the pipeline for both 4Q and next year, how do you think about it in terms of -- or how does it compare in terms of the mid-market financials versus the enterprise financials business? And then I have a quick follow-up on Adaptive. So it’s basically additional HR into HR. Well financials into the HR customer base. And I think and additionally HR into HR. Yeah. Hi, Alex. This is Chano speaking. Regarding financials into our customer base, we are very happy with the progress there. We clearly have the mapping within our key verticals, and I would say we have great engagement with the majority of the customers. Clearly, how are those going to be folding on particular quarters is yet to be seen, but the progress is on a positive track.
In terms of our HR add-on business or additional extensions of the product set into the customer base, if I understood your question correctly, I would say that since the of the go-to-market customers based on this year, we have seen a good acceleration of business there. Especially after our customer base is more significant and is growing, and particularly taking advantage of being a happy customer base. Got it. Thanks. And maybe just on the pipeline, just finishing up on that, the second part of that question in terms of financials on mid-market versus enterprise. I would say both are similarly -- basically similar percentage or similar mix as we've been having before. So there is good activity in both levels.
Clearly since our launch of our go-to-market into medium enterprise launch activities, the medium enterprise has been taking significant traction in terms of the offering and not only the subscription but basically the implementation, fixed fee services and we're taking time to value there, really shortening and really good customer base and basically reference ability.
So that is tracking very well. We continue to do well in terms of the large enterprise momentum and activity, both in the U.S. and internationally. Perfect. And then Robynne, just a quick follow-up on Adaptive, if I may. Is it possible to get just the contribution to subscription revenue, revenue and deferred revenue and unearned revenue in the quarter from Adaptive. If you'll recall, last quarter we did talk about what we thought the contributions from Adaptive would be in terms of subscription revenue and we were $4 million ahead of that number this quarter because of the finalization of the deferred revenue haircut which came in lower than we had originally anticipated.
We mentioned also at the time last quarter that we expected Adaptive to contribute $22 million in Q4. That number would now be $25 million with the change in the haircut value. But we're actually not going to be updating those numbers now or going forward because as you can imagine, given the cross-selling of the product across both companies, the lines have really already blurred in terms of what's purely Adaptive and what's organic Workday so we don't think that makes sense to break out anymore.
In terms of unearned, we also gave color last quarter that we expected 25% short-term unearned growth for Q3 and Q4, 3 percentage points of that were attributable to Adaptive and including their balances into our balance sheet and so all of the upside from that, both the 29% we delivered this quarter and the 26% we're guiding for next quarter is strength across our product suite that we're expecting. Understood. Okay. Thank you so much. Congrats again. Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks so much. Congrats from me as well on the super strong numbers. And Aneel, I'm curious your HCM momentum remains very strong and you made commentary I think back at the management team made commentary at Rising about how much was still left in the Fortune 500 Global 2000 and I just wondered from your perspective how do you think about the durability of that HCM business in terms of sustaining what you would like to see as a target rate of growth. Yeah, I think it continues to be a very healthy business. We're not quite yet at 200 of the Fortune 500. We're at 50% of the Fortune 50. I think we can do a lot better. Without being negative on our competition, the reality is they don't have proof points of large companies in production and we're beginning to where we continue to see the network effect of large companies who are happy with Workday, referencing to other large companies who haven't made a choice yet in the cloud.
So I think there's still a lot of opportunity for us especially as you get outside North America where depending on the geography, they're three to five years behind in cloud adoption and they're looking across the globe to see what their peers have done.
A multinational thinks like a multinational, independent of where they're based and they want to have successful deployments and as you look at the multinationals in the other geographies and they see a lot of successful Workday deployments it's impacting their decisions. So there's still a lot of opportunity in front of us.
I'd add the other piece, what we saw in Q3 with the success of medium enterprise, really accelerating growth as well with the Workday launch program, reducing the cost of implementation, most of the world outside of the top -- the largest 10 countries, most of the world is a medium enterprise world.
Even in markets like Germany, the bulk of the economy is driven by a group called the middle stat, basically the bulk of the economy are medium enterprise companies and now that we've got a better cost story there on the implementation side I think it opens up that opportunity as well. That’s great. And just a follow-up, Robynne, just you mentioned a few things that impacted the strength in the quarter, net new bookings accelerations, some deal pull-forward and then renewals. Just on renewals, were you saying renewals that pulled forward or just renewals were at very healthy levels, maybe were larger? What was the implication you were trying to drive on renewals. Thank you. Yeah, just renewals that came up within the quarter were very strong and we continued to meet or exceed our target of 100% net renewal and 95% gross renewal so we're very pleased with our renewal performance in Q3. That's great. Thanks so much, and congrats again. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is open. Hey, thanks. So we sent our guys out in the field to talk to some of the vendors and stuff, and we were asking about like digital transformation and stuff. What was interesting was they couldn't really -- we got different definitions of it, right. And then the other question that we had, we asked was when they did have troubles with that, the biggest hang-up was when HR and finance were not working as a team.
So Aneel, you've been around long enough to see this before as a whatever, reengineering problem. Where are we in that process in the market in terms of educating people on this? It's more than cloud but where do you draw the line and where do you pull in your systems integrators and how do you see that evolving? Thanks. I think in particular -- it's a great question, Richard. In particular, in companies that are not manufacturing companies but people based industries, HR and finance need to work absolutely hand in hand. Because the biggest asset and the biggest expense for these companies are their people.
So we definitely see that as a big advantage for us and we see companies beginning to leverage what they did in HR, say hey, we've already got the work structures in place. We've got the security model in place, why not look at Workday first for financials and we would have all the unified reporting and analytics we would like and then you throw in Adaptive planning and we've got effectively our business operating system all working together.
So I think it's beginning to play that way. And for companies that haven't chosen to do HR until now, they're definitely looking at HR and finance together where five years ago people were just not doing that, they were just looking at HR. So I do think that that digital -- digitization and reengineering as both product lines become market ready or have been market ready happening together is a real positive trend. Great. That's super helpful. Thanks, man. Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on a fantastic quarter. I guess I'll ask a macro question, since I assume it's not been asked. So Aneel, I think last year or maybe two years back, you were rightly prophetic in caution that you saw going into Q4 results and ended up that the business environment was largely more supportive than we all feared and we had a nice two-year run.
Now we're back again at those kinds of crossroads with a similar list of topics that are not pertinent necessarily to Workday but to investors keep wondering is this good stretch of results can really sustain the momentum going into calendar 2019.
Since you have the purview of talking to decision makers, CFOs, CEOs, that really -- your product touches practically millions and millions of end users. What is your feel for what's on the minds of CEOs and CFO as they prioritize Workday and their budgets for calendar 2019, what are the things you're hearing from your customers specifically? I generally hear that business is good and the uncertainty in the global political environment gives them pause. And I just don't know how much of what gives them pause is just rhetoric. Some companies are worried about the aspects of a potential trade war. So will that factor into the way they're thinking? Right now it seems like bluster back and forth.
So I would say if you just separated out the business cycles, it still seems like we're in a good part of the global growth economy cycle. It seems like most economies are doing well. I think Europe is doing surprisingly well based on what people expect it to be doing. But there's this hangover of uncertainty coming from the political environment that's not just limited to the U.S. but somewhat happening everywhere and I don't think any of us really know what -- how to factor that in or predict it.
So I would say stay tuned. And right now, we're just trying to ignore it and the world -- the new normal in the world is political volatility and hopefully it doesn't have a huge amount of impact on our business. Congrats on the results. I'll yield to the next question. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just have one at the moment. I don't know if Aneel or Chano wants to take it, but can you tell us about some of the lessons you've learned with Adaptive in the portfolio today with regards to how it can help you sell financials going forward?
I know we all know it's going to help that platform generically over the next two to three years as customers become more comfortable with that entire ecosystem, but is there may be a direct tie that you can tie it from one to the other. Well I’d say the number one takeaway so far is our companies have very, very – we hoped they had very similar value systems and cultures, and they do.
And if you look at the history of acquisitions in the technology field in particular, I think that's the biggest determinant of success and failure. So from that part, the two companies are working extremely well.
I think largely the thesis that planning was going to open the doors for Workday have played out and the other thing that we knew going in is that Adaptive planning was far ahead of Workday planning, has turned out to be true which is why we put all of our eggs in the Adaptive planning basket and why we're moving capabilities like sales planning and Workforce Planning to Adaptive. It's all played out and what we were hoping to see was interest in large enterprises in the Adaptive product who had been historically Workday customers and all those things have happened.
So Tom and I were talking about it earlier today. It's really played out the way we had hoped to play out and that's not always the case with two companies coming together. So feel very fortunate. You want to add anything, Tom. Just that there's -- we continue to have momentum. We added approximately 200 new customers this quarter and we agree that there's a great opportunity to sell financials behind that. Most of those customer additions are stand-alone customers but we've also seen a lot of resonance, a lot of interest as I said earlier in existing Workday customers and the opportunity to sell Adaptive to those customers. Thanks for taking my question. Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open. Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Maybe actually for Tom, just a follow-up on that line of thinking around the 200 customers you have. Seems to us talking to a lot of the partners in the field that right now planning is something that CFOs are very engaged in talking about.
Is there any way that you can sort of give a, I don't know, a guesstimate or sort of your thoughts on after someone buys into planning or connected planning vision, how long after that do you think they're ready to make another decision around financials?
It seems like an incredible way for you guys to have just that more much more dialogue with CFOs and ultimately so that when ultimately they decide to move their general ledger to the cloud you're involved in that account. I don't know. I'm trying to get a sense on is there a six to eight quarter lag before they're ready to make another decision in financials or can it come faster based on some of your experience or your conversations? I think we do see the thesis companies are willing to move to a cloud-based planning system earlier than perhaps they are financials. We do see that playing out. So we're very encouraged by the conversations we've had with customers and prospects around moving their planning to the cloud.
I think the decisions around when they're ready to move their financials to the cloud are really dependent company to company. And while I agree that there are opportunities, particularly when we have satisfied customers and we do an effective job of engaging with those customers, we believe that will result in follow-up on opportunities in financials but Chano, I'd say that the timing is probably a little bit more customer situational. I agree, Tom. Kirk, I think the most important thing is the feedback we're getting from our prospects and customers so far regarding the capabilities and scalability of the Adaptive planning cloud is super positive. That's the thing that is really relevant.
If you think it's -- it's early days but we had a quarter where we were in double digits planning customers over 10,000 employees, clearly some of those are not yet financial customers but we expect that some of those are going to see time to value and planning in four to six months time frame cycles of implementations.
I think we'll be in a great position to go back and have a discussion about our point of view and why it makes sense to extend and there is good business value and benefits in taking on to the full financial platform. But it's early days so I guess we'll be learning but we're very excited how that's looking. And maybe just one follow-up actually on financials which seems to be building some momentum. I guess when you look at the acceleration in that, is there any one particular vertical that seems to be sort of taking off in front of some of the others?
I know you guys have nine that you focus on. Are you seeing a lift kind of across all nine, or are a few kind of pulling ahead based on either just more customer references in those? I'm just kind of curious if the entire sort of strategies moving ahead or there's a couple that are going to be sort of lead dogs in this movement longer term. Thanks. Well, financial services has definitely begun to pick up. There's no question about that. Business services was already an interesting segment as was the tech segment. But financial services has been slow to move to the cloud and not just for finance but for HR. I'd say that's the area that's picking up very nicely and that's a huge market for financials. The other one I would say, Aneel, core verticals on health care. Has been clearly PSA professional services, automation around more business services, that seems to be performing really well given now the strength of our solution portfolio there. Super. Thanks so much. We will take our final question from John Di Fucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. This is Samad Samana on for John. Just a couple questions. First, you mentioned the acceleration in net ACV. I was wondering if you could give us some additional color on whether it accelerated, when you look at it broken out for mid-market and enterprise and maybe by Geo and then did it accelerate both for HCM and financials and then I have a follow-up question. All of the above. Okay. Accelerated across the board. Okay. Great. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up. I think at Rising Europe in the Q&A I think Aneel you mentioned a that the company had 100 customers for Prism already and about half of those are in production.
I'm curious if you started to see any type of patterns emerging in terms of what type of customers adopting it, are they more platform oriented on Workday already, are they mostly HCM only, anything bit vertical or by size, just something to maybe help us understand who the adopters of that is. Looks like it's up considerably year-over-year. Why don't we come back to you on that with a more thoughtful answer. Right now I'd characterize it more as early innovators in a new product category. They're all finance -- HR customers but there's quite a few finance customers as well.
And what we're seeing is the opportunity to bring in third party operational data to do analysis so health care has been an interesting space for us. They bring in patient data or procedure data to do the analysis with HR and finance data as well. So let us come back to you with a more thoughtful response.
I don't think it's a big enough sample set yet to draw any big conclusions. The big conclusion I draw is that it's across industry and across product line so far. So it's what we like it to be. We're not seeing any areas where it's not interesting. Great. Well I appreciate you taking my questions and congrats on an awesome quarter. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's third quarter earnings call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO, Robynne Sisco, our co-President and Adaptive Insights . this call is being simultaneously webcast .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mike Magaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Workday's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our co-president and CFO; Chano Fernandez, our co-president; and Tom Bogan, CEO, Adaptive Insights. Following Aneel and Robynne's prepared remarks, we will take questions.

Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.
Our first-quarter quiet period begins on April 15, 2019. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2018. With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth-quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter, capping off a great year. We continue to attract new customers, and many of our current customers are growing their investments with us.
We now have over 2,600 customers, and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our 98% customer satisfaction rate and broad referenceability. In Q4, we saw healthy demand across all product areas.
Starting out with Workday HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to lead the market with our differentiated suite of products. In total, we added 10 new Fortune 500 customers and now have approximately 40% of the Fortune 500 using our HCM product line, including half of the Fortune 50.
New customers include A.P. Moller-Maersk, Caterpillar, Sumitomo Chemical and Wyndham Worldwide Operations. We continue landing these large marquee accounts in no small part due to our proven ability to uniquely support our customers' high volumes of data and transactions. Notable go-lives in Q4 include Lloyds Bank plc, McKesson and Siemens AG.
Switching over to the world of finance. Q4 was our best quarter ever for our Financial Management product line. In the fourth quarter, we added 79 core Financial Management customers, including four new Fortune 500 customers, two of which were net new customers and two of which who were existing customers that added on Financials. A few of the notable new Financial Management customers include Ryder Truck, Ameriprise and Banner Health.
One interesting new trend is that we are beginning to see large enterprise companies now starting their finance and HR journeys with Workday Financial Management. This is a new development and something we view as a positive indication of the growing awareness of our Financial Management applications and the high levels of satisfaction our finance customers have experienced in the past several years. In addition to the strong growth from our core Financial Management Suite, we saw strong momentum in our second full-quarter selling the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud. Indeed, it was an excellent quarter of execution within the core Adaptive Insights business, with over 200 new Planning customers for its stand-alone offering.
We also achieved great success bringing Adaptive Insights into new large enterprise opportunities as add on sales into the existing Workday customer base, adding Planning in more than 50 new Workday platform deals and 30 existing Workday accounts.
With Workday Prism Analytics, we had a record quarter in terms of number of new customers and again had triple-digit ACV growth, giving us strong momentum heading into fiscal-year '20. Indeed, our customers seem to be resonating with the idea of bringing any type of operational data securely into Workday in order to deliver better business insights and outcomes.
Switching to the people front. A key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end, I'd like to thank our entire team for making Workday No. 4 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list in the U.S. Being a great place to work is something that Dave and I have cared about since day one, and it's an honor for the Workday team to be recognized on this prestigious list.
As we look forward to fiscal year '20 and beyond, we will continue our relentless focus on innovation and expect to see continued momentum from our growing family of applications. We're confident in the pipeline we have built and the sales execution model we have in place. As such, we expect fiscal-year '20 to be another strong year of growth. I will now turn it to our CFO and Co-President Robynne Sisco.
Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter capped a very strong year as we continue to demonstrate momentum across our subscription revenue growth drivers. We not only added a record number of net new customers in Q4, we also closed a record number of core Financials deals. Our high levels of customer satisfaction continued to drive strong renewal rates and add-on sales, supporting our thesis that satisfied customers not only become long-term customers but grow their relationships with us over time, both of which drive long-term shareholder value.
Our subscription revenue grew 37% to $674 million for the fourth quarter and was up 33% to $2.386 billion for the full year. Total revenue was $789 million in Q4, reflecting growth of 35% from last year and $2.822 billion or growth of 32% for the full year. We continue to see global expansion as one of our growth levers, with total revenue outside the U.S. up 41% to $184 million in Q4, representing 23% of total revenue.
Subscription revenue backlog was $6.74 billion, growth of 30% year over year, driven by strong net new bookings, success with add-on sales into our customer base and strong renewals, with net retention once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.47 billion or growth of 29%. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $93 million or 11.8%. For the year, non-GAAP operating profit grew 35% to $291 million or 10.3% of total revenue.
Benefiting from strong collections in Q4, operating cash flow for fiscal '19 was $607 million, representing 30% growth from last year. The integration of Adaptive Insights have gone extremely well. And the headwind to cash flow from the transaction and integration costs we incurred in the second half of FY '19 is now largely behind us. Current unearned revenue was $1.84 billion in Q4, up 29% year over year while, total unearned revenue grew 27% year over year to $1.95 billion.
We successfully added and integrated more than 2,300 net new employees to Workday this year, which include approximately 500 from the Adaptive Insights acquisition, bringing our total employee count at year end to over 10,500. Operationally, we continue to execute well against our long-term vision, and our great second-half performance capped a very strong year. Now let me turn to guidance for fiscal 2020. As we enter the year, we see strong growth levers across all our products and geographies.
We remain early in addressing our long-term opportunity, with most of our products still in the beginning stages of their growth curves. And you should continue to expect that we will reinvest any incremental top-line overperformance this year. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue to be between $692 million and $694 million, representing 33% year-over-year growth. For the full year, we are raising our subscription revenue guidance to a range of $3.03 billion to $3.045 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27% to 28%.
Sequentially, we expect subscription revenue to increase from the previous quarter by approximately 7% in Q2 and approximately 5.5% in Q3 and four. On the professional services front, we continue to value and support a growing SI ecosystem. Our partners are seeing robust growth in their Workday practices, and we will continue our tight alignment with them to ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $120 million in Q1 and $500 million for fiscal 2020, growth of 24% and 15%, respectively.
Professional services margins will be slightly lower than last year as we continue to invest in programs to support customer deployments and to sustain our high levels of customer satisfaction. As we enter FY '20, I want to reiterate that we don't run the business to maximize either unearned revenue or calculated billings. As we discussed throughout this past fiscal year, our focus continues to be on new customer acquisition and long-term customer economics, which means that we will likely continue to see variability in unearned revenue throughout the year. We believe that our subscription revenue backlog is a much better gauge of the health of our business over the long term.
And even though backlog will have some variability quarter to quarter based on contract duration and the timing of renewals, including early renewals associated with add-on business, unlike billings and unearned, it filters out the noise caused by varying invoicing terms. Based on our current outlook, we expect total subscription revenue backlog to have year-over-year growth in the high 20% range in the first half of the year. Given the accelerated growth we experienced in the back half of FY '19, the comps get more difficult in the second half of FY '20. So we are currently expecting year-over-year growth in the second half to be in the low 20s.
Consistent with the preliminary outlook we gave last quarter, we expect a 200 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year, bringing our margin to approximately 12.3% for FY '20. The margin improvement reflects leverage as we scale, with continued investment in products and other areas of business to support our long-term growth aspirations. We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 27 to 28 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins.
We expect operating cash flow in FY '20 to be approximately $790 million or 30% growth. The non-GAAP tax rate remains 17% for FY '20. Our Pleasanton development center construction project will be completed this year, and we plan to begin occupying the building in Q2. The FY '20 capital outlay for this project will be approximately $130 million and be front-loaded toward the first half of the year.
We expect to spend an additional $280 million in FY '20 to support our other capital needs, primarily related to investments in data centers to support our customer growth, leased facilities and corporate IT infrastructure to support our continued business expansion and large furniture purchases in Q1 as we prepare the development center for occupation. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results this past year. We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without shared goals. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
With that, let's begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. I wanted to ask about the four Fortune 500 wins in Financials in a single quarter. It seems impressive. And just to clarify, I think two were HCM customers, which added Financials. Two, I believe you said, were net new.
Does that mean that they were platform wins or Financials only? And then could you just comment in general on which incumbent systems are being replaced more commonly? Thank you, Mark, for the question. You got that right, two were existing HCM customers. Chano can answer the question about the other two being Financials only, and we can come back to that. I would say, of the 79 new financial customers, we saw for the first time a pattern of financial only or financial first, frankly, was enough of group of companies to actually think of it as a pattern.
It's the typical systems you'd expect to be replaced, the legacy ERP systems, including the one we know best, PeopleSoft, but the others as well, of basically, the large company incumbents. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Aneel, just as a follow-up, we noticed a recent article alluding to the possibility of Workday reaching $10 billion in revenue in six years. And I guess I'm not sure if you plan to comment or address that, but I think the last multiyear target we heard from Mark Peek was $4 billion. And so I'm just curious if you're sensing some incremental confidence in starting to think about a much higher number and maybe just what mix of business would Financials contribute as the company becomes multiples of its current size? Well, that number was really -- first of all, it's aspirational and was internal to our employees to get them excited about our future. We definitely feel like we have the market opportunity to get there. And it's all about the persistent growth rate over the next number of years in terms of how long we could get there. I have a ton of admiration for what Marc Benioff and Salesforce has done in getting to that and now passing that number, and we'd like to be the same.
And we're not at a place yet to talk about the relative splits. All we can say is that our market opportunity across all of our different products is definitely sizable enough to get us there. And the reason we updated the goal is given guidance, we're going to be close to the $4 billion target. Well, I mean, we'll be in the north of $3 billion this year.
So kind of keep people focused on the future, and we needed to think about the next targets to get people thinking about the long term internally. Mark, this is Chano speaking on the two net new core Fortune 500 Financials. They were platform deals. Chano, do you want to comment on what you're seeing in terms of Financials only as well? Yes. As Aneel mentioned in his script, we are seeing a new trend where large enterprise companies now are leading their transformations with Workday Financials. And that's the key compelling discussion before we're discussing the HCM opportunity. So we see this as a new development, and we believe it's a positive indication of the reputation we have built with our product and customers in the marketplace within Financials. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair. I guess for either Aneel or Chano, I wanted to ask about the medium enterprise because I guess the tone from partners in that space has picked up quite a bit over the last six or nine months. I wanted to see if you're seeing that in your results as well. And if you could give a sense for sort of what percentage or some sense of the mix of your overall business today is medium enterprise, and when you look out longer term, you think that mix will go up, down, stay constant? Any sort of thoughts there would be helpful. I think you are accurate in that we had a great quarter for medium enterprise. And we had a great quarter across all the parts of the business, but medium enterprise in particular grew faster than large enterprise, just given the number of accounts. And I think it's a testament to our lower-cost deployment model in that segment of the market really taking hold. Chano, do you want to add anything to that? No. I think you're right, Justin. We've seen strong growth. As we've said in all the calls, they usually are generally biased to the full platform, and it is clearly a testament of the go-lives, the value and clearly the lower implementation costs.
And we're now more focused on driving the same basic implementation method already outside of the U.S. internationally as we go into FY '20 and beyond. Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask on M&A because it seems like the early results on Adaptive have been really positive. And Aneel, I'm wondering if that changes your view at all on M&A.
When you look out over the medium term, do you think you could do another deal of that sort of size or even bigger? And what sorts of things are interesting to you from an M&A standpoint? I don't know if that changes our perspective. We have a very narrow filter, and Adaptive fits that on so many fronts. Number one, we have very similar value systems. Adaptive is focused on their employees, on their customers and on innovation.
Tom Bogan is a close friend for 15 years, and so integrations go well based on trust and cultural fit. And if you apply that filter, it narrows the group to a pretty short list of companies that fit. And I'm not going to comment on what industries or what spaces, but I think the Adaptive experience has been a great experience. I think a huge part of it is the cultural alignment.
And where we've had misses in the past on much smaller opportunities, it's been also around cultural alignment. So that is the key factor for us. And I don't know, Tom, if you want to add anything to that. No. I agree, Aneel. And I do think the cultural alignment is really important. And what I might add to that was the opportunity for Adaptive to leverage the core Workday sales force, particularly around large enterprise and international opportunities.
Now I think that's one of the elements that's made this acquisition so successful in the early days. Next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. I'm just curious, as you start to see this pattern change on Financials, either Aneel or Chano, do you feel you need to change anything in the sales org? And maybe specifically, is there an opportunity to create a sort of new motion -- stand-alone Financials motion? And then just as a follow-up, Robynne or Aneel, do you have the new ACV growth for Financials this quarter? I'll let Robynne answer the second part. I think we have the right set of motions. I don't really think it requires a change in motions. I think it just means that as we engage with the customer, we should make sure we ask the question, ""What is the scope of the project?"" and not just default to, ""Hey, they're going to lead with HR because that's been the pattern we've known for the last, let's say, five years but probably for the last decade."" If that's changing, we just have to really listen to our customers and our prospects as to where they want to go first.
I think overall, we're in a world of digital transformation. Those are the buzzwords that get used quite often, but it's true. And as the finance organization gets more comfortable with the cloud, and frankly, as our products mature and we continue to have success with deployments, it's very similar to what happened in the client/server wave as well. Client/server started out with products like HR and then got more into mission-critical applications like finance as of the technology matured.
I think we're actually seeing a very similar pattern this time around. I'd also add that one of the reasons, I think, we're getting Financials-first conversations is that the Adaptive products are opening the door to the CFO earlier or in some cases, they're opening the door for the first time, and then we can have that broader conversation. So I wouldn't underestimate the power of now having a conversation, not just around core Financials but also around the Planning products from Adaptive and also the Prism Analytics on the analysis side. We can tell a full story around planning, execution and analysis.
And that's key for the CFO community and the finance organizations. Robynne, do you want to comment on growth rates? Yes, absolutely. So our net new ACV Financials, Financial Management growth rate was still very, very strong. Keep in mind we had a tough compare from Q4 last year where we had some very large Financials wins as well, but it continues to be very strong and outpaced the HCM ACV growth. And that is driving revenue growth, over 50% still on the Financial Management side. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Two questions. The first one is, can you give us some sense for these platform sales in terms of the revenue mix between HCM and Financials? And then I have a follow-up. Chano, do you want to take that one on? Yes. I would say that you could tell approx a one is to one ratio, depends, of course, on additional SKUs in terms of the full scope that the customers may be buying. Perfect. And then as a follow-up, you're discussing how you're seeing not just the customer growth, but you're getting more revenue per customer. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers are that's allowing you to sell up? Is that selling new products since they're new customers? Is it sales of incremental usage? I know obviously, it changes all the time. But again, anything that can give us some color on what's driving the incremental revenue growth per customer. It's generally the sale of additional modules. And I think I'd point to a couple of trends along that line. When you have happy customers, they definitely look to buy from vendors that they've had a good experience with. And once they're live with -- typically, a customer will start with core HR, maybe core HR and Payroll on the HR side, core accounting on the accounting side.
Once they're live, they'll look to extend the footprint. So getting customers into production as quickly as possible and using our core capabilities then opens up the door for Learning, for Recruiting, for Prism Analytics, for Planning, for Time Tracking for those that didn't pick upfront Payroll. And so now that we have over 2,600 customers and 70% are in production, we have a big base of customers that are already up and running in our products. And it's just created a big base of opportunity to go back in and see what else would be useful to them. Next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Very nice and strong close to FY '19. Two questions sort of looking forward into sort of the FY '20 guide. I hate to be kind of Debbie Downer, but what's the macro environment that you're thinking about in the forward year? And is there any indications that -- because I mean, there's definitely some macro indicators that are starting to cool and then slow down. Any indication that that's impacting your pipelines that are sort of getting you concerned as of yet? Or is just sort of the strategic focus on digitalization and financials just outweighing any macro concerns that guys have? And then maybe a follow-up question for Robynne on the margin side of the equation.
I understand that sort of the focus of the company is still very much on sort of the growth side of the equation. Can you help us better understand kind of the puts and takes between sort of the more mature HCM business and the types of margins you're seeing there versus the Financials side of the equation where you're still putting a lot of investment in and how that kind of dynamic is impacting margins in the near term? On the first question, I was at a conference and saw one of our large financial services customers talk about their view of the global economy. And I tend to really resonate with his point of view. He broke it into three buckets: businesses, consumers and then government. Generally, businesses and CEOs have a positive outlook on their businesses and on the environment.
The global economy continues to move forward at a nice pace. The general global consumer is spending money and generally in a positive frame of mind. The wild card is government, and I don't think this is an environment that many of us really know how to predict. Government has become unpredictable across many parts of the world, and we don't yet know how that's going to impact business or maybe it fades away.
But that's the way -- we're, I think, in wait-and-see mode to see, will any of the government -- the government question marks out there actually have an impact on the pipeline? But businesses are still focused on digitization. Consumers are still spending money. It's really the question now, are these trade wars, some of the other macro environmental things coming out of government going to impact our pipeline? And I think we're in wait and-see mode view rather than having any view right now. Right now, I would say we probably haven't seen it yet, but we're watching it very carefully. And Keith, to your questions on margin, so we've talked in the past about long-term margin targets, non-GAAP operating margin targets of 25%. And we're really pleased to see that our HCM business is already there on a fully loaded basis. And so that really gives us confidence that we've got a very strong long-term operating margin, and we can continue to expand toward that long-term goal over time. But as you know, we are still heavily investing, not only in Financials but in some of our other products such as Adaptive and bringing them into the Workday fold, Prism Analytics, Workday Cloud Platform, and building out a lot of our industry modules as well, such as inventory for healthcare and supply chain.
So we're very much in investment mode, but the proof of the HR business right now really gives us a lot of confidence that as we move toward those long-term targets, they are very achievable in the long run. Next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. I actually had two for you. First, I was wondering, Aneel, if you could talk a little bit on SAP's decision to force migration to HANA. And I'm wondering if you see this as starting to help the pipeline of financial conversions. Are you starting to have conversations with customers about that even though it's obviously many years out? And then the other question was on Adaptive.
You guys obviously sound like you've seen really good initial traction. I'm just wondering if you could highlight a little bit of the competitive environment here and what features are resonating the most with clients versus what you had before. On the first question, Heather, I don't think there's any one factor we look at to increasing the pipeline. And a lot of the HANA customers that they're pushing toward are using Financials as part of distribution and manufacturing, and that's not really part of the sector we're targeting. I think overall, the cloud momentum that started with Salesforce in the world of CRM then moved to HR with Workday and ServiceNow with IT, is now coming to finance. And so when you look at the viable finance products in the cloud, it's actually a pretty short list.
And so as people are looking to transform their finance operations and as part of that move to the cloud, it, frankly, tends to be much more about us and Oracle. And SAP doesn't really have a native cloud story, and so they really don't factor into the conversation as much. And I think what they're doing with HANA is kind of orthogonal to where we are since it's really affecting their manufacturing base on the finance side, and we're not really targeting that sector. Tom, do you want to comment on what's happening in the world of Planning? Yes. Aneel, thank you. So I think, Heather, it's fairly similar to what we saw before the acquisition with a couple of important changes. So the environment for Planning continues to be competitive.
It's a large and attractive market space right now. As Aneel said in the prepared remarks, we had over 200 stand-alone Planning wins this quarter. We had over 50 platform wins and 30 upsells within the Workday base. So I think the attractiveness of the Adaptive platform in large enterprise customers, that's one of the areas that we're seeing a lot of resonance.
From a competitive standpoint, we continue to see HANA Plan. We continue to see Oracle and others from a competitive standpoint. But I would say one of the positive signs has been our traction with large enterprise customers, and those are more than FP&A use cases. That's holistic business planning across the organization where organizations are modeling all parts of their business and using Adaptive as a platform to model and plan all aspects of their business. Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Aneel, I'm curious, when we hear a lot about digital business transformation, I'm curious how you would describe the journey for your customers. Is it like a multipart, multiphase journey? And as that journey progresses and you choose to characterize it that way, how do the parts of the Workday product portfolio align with the journey toward digital business transformation? It's a great question. And honestly, it changes every day. At the highest level, used to be 20 years ago, when you talked about HR, you would talk about HR with the HR leader and maybe IT. Today, you always still talk with the HR leader, but you also talk with the CEO, and that is a market change 20 years ago.
And every company is trying to figure out or I would say every company that sees the world through the lens of employee engagement and how important is trying to engage their employees get better information on their hands, create great employee experiences. And so part of the transformation is, from an HR perspective, looking at HR as people engagement and employee engagement and, in some cases, partner engagement as opposed to traditional administrative applications the way they were thought of 20 years ago. And that is a big transformation, and it's a big change management project. And I think it's the same for finance.
HR and finance together are going from being viewed as back-office operations in the world of client/server to front-office business partners to the CEO today. And finance is very focused on helping the business make the right decisions along the way to grow the business and make the business more profitable. And it's just a different mindset than the way client/server systems were implemented 20 years ago where it was just about automating business processes and making sure you could generate the right statutory reports. It's pretty massive.
It's happening in every part of the business, not just HR and finance. And what we ask our customers to do is to really think about how they want to transform their business, not just move to a new platform because if they just move to a new platform, they miss the big opportunity, and the vast majority get that. And that was the reason why they switched. Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Maybe just to start. Actually, I had one for Tom just around Adaptive. Tom, I think Aneel that mentioned having you all there is actually opening the door to talk to more CFOs directly as they think about Planning and connected planning as sort of a strategic imperative. When you look at your customer base, how many of those customers have actually made a decision from a cloud financials perspective? Meaning, how much uplift -- obviously, there's a lot of uplift of you being pulled into the Workday customer base.
But actually, how many of those Adaptive customers have yet to actually make a financial planning decision? Yes. I think it's early days, but we're seeing a lot of interest. I can think of three specific customers that started with Adaptive, and that was the early part of the conversation, so that quickly led to financials decisions. Obviously, the planning decision cycle, it tends to be shorter than a financials decision cycle.
And so that's what we'd expect. But I can let Chano comment on this as well. But I think we're seeing a lot of interest from financial organizations in Workday that the conversation is often starting with Financials, but we expect it's leading to discussions around Financials as well. And maybe, I don't know if Aneel or Chano wants to take this. But when we think about the shift to more Financials first, is there any commonality from a -- are you seeing it start in one particular vertical or one particular region, meaning it's the U.S. in front of the international market? I'd sort of expect that to be the case. But I was just kind of curious if you could address it from maybe a vertical perspective and sort of a geographic perspective if you're seeing anything that stands out in particular on that front. Chano, your thoughts on that? Yes, I can. Kirk, well, as you know, we'd mentioned before always that there are verticals where we see that is more a platform mode clearly and clearly would mention verticals like healthcare verticals, like education and some others, that it is more platform. I would say that outside of those, it is more where is the compelling event and the reason for change in terms of order of priority, right? So the change is that there is much more confidence as Aneel was mentioning, now better understanding on the benefits of moving toward the cloud and transforming. So if that company is seeing that they're burning platform or their opportunity for growth and their need for visibility or agility or the way that they're engaging with their customers or geographies or business areas, I think, having more impact starting with Financials, then they do start there.
I wouldn't like to really finger-point to a particular vertical to be more prominent than other, other than the ones I mentioned. I think that's more the reason where they can capture more opportunity or really they have fall a little bit more behind the investments that are required to compete and to have the visibility they need on today's business landscape. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. So I'll try to ask about pipeline both for HCM and Fins, if you could compare it to this time last year in terms of size and mix. And then maybe just for Robynne, what are you seeing on renewals at this point with respect to pricing uplift and expansion? Chano, I think that first question is for you. Thank you, Aneel. Alex, thanks for the question. We have strong or solid pipeline that we can create to start it at the beginning of the year and clearly to the end of first month of our first quarter. So it's going to be a question more of the execution, which is I think a good place to be.
In terms of the percentage of pipeline, clearly, Fins needs to keep it growing faster as a total of the mix. Obviously, as the mix is still higher, that is not a massive movement in terms of percentage of points, but it is a significant movement. So clearly, the Financials one is growing faster as a percentage of the mix, as you would be expecting. So that's good. And Alex, on your renewals question, so we continue to see very, very strong renewals. With net retention rates over 100%, growth over 95%, we continually hit those marks quarter after quarter and did so again this time. We've got really strong add-on history as well and had great add-ons in Q4. And I think that the dedicated customer base sales team that Chano put in place at the beginning of last year has really, really paid off, and we're seeing very strong add-on sales. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. I guess for Aneel or Chano, you guys are clearly putting up strong growth in Prism Analytics, but I think penetration rates are still fairly low. So do you think we could see much greater adoption in the installed base this year? And what would be the key reasons for that? We'd hope so. It's a great product that's still relatively young, and so it continues to gain capabilities. And I think the big part is bringing out very specific use cases like People Analytics, so we would expect that the Prism Analytics momentum continues. And I would hope -- well, I'm not going to give a time frame, but I would hope that over half of our customers will be using Prism over the next several years, and we're not anywhere near that level of penetration yet.
I don't even think we're at 10% penetration yet. So there's a tremendous opportunity. And a big part of it is Prism is metadataware of Workday HR and finance. And if your analytics are HR finance based, it's a phenomenal platform to bring other operational data into to do deep analysis.
And that's what our customers are experiencing, and I think that trend's only going to continue. I think one of the things the team did a really nice job with is making the ability to bring in third-party data much simpler than what systems have been like in the past, and then the visualization is much better than what systems have been like in the past. And so we continue to invest in those areas, but it's a very exciting product, and I expect it to continue to gain adoption rapidly. And just a couple of quick ones for you, Robynne. Anything unusual with invoicing timing this quarter? And then in terms of the 30% growth in backlog, was there any impact from a duration standpoint there? Yes. Nothing to call out on the invoicing front. I mean, we will still continue to see some fluctuation based on that, but nothing I would call out in Q4. And on the subscription revenue growth, we did see a slight uptick in duration, which is not unusual when we have a lot of large deals as we did this quarter. So that was a small piece of it. Next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Two quick tactical questions. So one, since you're keeping Adaptive independent -- I think the answer is yes, but anyway, can an Adaptive rep cross-sell an HR deal and vice versa? And then the second question is, you've done a good job bringing down the implementation costs, and I know that's not easy. Is there still material room for improvement? On the second piece, there's always room for improvement, but we've taken it down in the medium enterprise from $3 spent on integration to $1 software to closer to one is to one. And so that is pretty much best in class. And I think that's why our win rates in the medium enterprise have gone up so significantly. As it relates to the first question, we definitely believe in the stand-alone business of Adaptive.
And so the Adaptive team will continue to sell the Business Planning Cloud into Workday accounts and non-Workday accounts. But at this point, we're not leveraging the Adaptive team to sell the Workday products. They'll obviously send over the leads, but we're not doing that. There is definitely an opportunity down the road.
Right now, we just want to be very focused on continuing the momentum that the Adaptive Planning team have built around the Planning products, Adaptive Insights built around the Planning products. Tom, anything you want to add to that? No. That's right. I mean, we've set the incentives in place, as Aneel said, to make sure that the Adaptive team is incentived to work very closely with the Workday team. And so far, we're really pleased with what we've seen so far. We will take our final question from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. One question, just on the topic and the message about seeing the new pattern in the core financials platform demand in the large enterprise market. Is it possible to stack-rank the drivers of what's causing that between, say, market maturation, the enterprise SaaS versus, say, competitor challenges or, say, something specific with your go-to-market strategy? I personally think it's just the maturation of the market. And so if customers believe that they're equally OK to go down the path of starting with HR or starting to finance, they'll focus on whatever platform is burning at a higher level. And if they view the finance platform, legacy platform, being the one that's on fire, they're going to replace that one first. So I think the biggest driver is the companies now view finance as becoming more mainstream for the cloud and therefore are prioritizing which of their platforms is the one that needs to be replaced the soonest.
I wouldn't really tie it to competitors or to a different sales strategy. Our sales strategy has been pretty much the same, and I think it's been the right one the last several years. I think it's the maturity of both the view of financials in the cloud and our products. This concludes the Workday Q4 Call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Our second quarter quiet period begins on July 15, 2019. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2019.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you Michael. I would first like to thank everyone for joining our Q1 2020 earnings call. I am pleased to report that our first quarter fiscal year 2020 got us off to a great start for the year. We continue to attract new customers and many of our current customers are growing their investments with us. Our customer satisfaction rating remains amongst the highest in enterprise software and the success of our customers is a cornerstone of our long term business strategy.
Let's start with some of the highlights from Q1, beginning with Workday HCM. Momentum for this application suite remains strong as organizations continue their transitions to the cloud. In Q1, we added Carl Zeiss AG, Cisco Systems, Daimler Trucks North America, Old Mutual Limited and Procter & Gamble among the many new HCM customers in the quarter. Our proven ability to support our customer's large volumes of data and transactions continues to be a big differentiator in our success. Notable go-lives in Q1 included Enterprise Holdings and Tyson Shared services.
Turning to Workday financial management. We saw continued momentum in Q1 with over 50% customer in net new ACV growth. New customers included Advocate Aurora Health System and E-Trade Financial Corporation. In addition, during the quarter, many existing customers expanded their relationship with Workday. Legg Mason, for example, a leading investment management firm, expanded their use of Workday financial management to include all of their affiliates. Lastly, we also had a large Fortune 500 scale insurance company add financial management to become a full platform customer. As always, getting customers live and on budget is core to our business.
Amongst the many go-lives of Q1 for financials, I would like to highlight Sprouts Farmers Market and NASDAQ. Q1 was also our third quarter with the Adaptive Insights business planning cloud and customer demand continues to reinforce our confidence in the long term opportunity. We added approximately 150 standalone Adaptive deals and once again saw success selling it to the large enterprise market with approximately 50 deals representing both platform sales and planning add-ons. New customer selecting Adaptive Insights business planning cloud in Q1 included Advocate Aurora Health System, Airbus, AstraZeneca, AutoZone Parts, H&R Block and the Ohio State University.
We are pleased that our customer and product momentum continues to get recognized by leading industry analysts. This month, Gartner published its 2019 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large and Global Enterprises and Gartner named Workday as a leader for the third year in a row. Also in Q1, I am pleased to announce that we moved all customers to Workday 32. With this update, we delivered more than 500 new features, including deeper investments in Workday Learning and Workday Recruiting, finance-focused machine learning capabilities to help resource managers align skills resources to projects and deeper integration between Workday and Adaptive Insights. Indeed, we are well on our way for a goal of bringing Adaptive Insights full into the power of one.
And last but not least for Q1, we are pleased to share that we were once again ranked number one on San Francisco Business Times' Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list. This is the seventh time Workday has been ranked number one on the list. Workday also ranked number one on the UK's Best Large Workplaces list by Great Place to Work Institute. All-in-all, this quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year.
I will now turn it over to our Co-President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks Aneel and good afternoon everyone. As Aneel mentioned, we continue to execute well against our long term market opportunity, differentiating ourselves through our technology and our uniquely purposed customer success model.
We are very pleased with our first quarter results, delivering total revenue of $825 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 33%. Our subscription revenue was $701 million, up 34% and professional services revenue came in at $124 million, up 29%. We continue to see our long term opportunity expanding outside of the U.S. with revenue up 42% to $197 million.
Our non-U.S. revenue now represents a record 24% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $6.8 billion, growth of 30% year-over-year driven by strong performance across net new bookings, add-on business and renewals with net retention once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.56 billion, growth of 29%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $108 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.1%. Operating cash flow in Q1 was $209 million. Current unearned revenue was $1.73 billion in Q1, up 31% year-over-year while total unearned revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion.
We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 400 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to almost 11,000. Operationally, it was another strong quarter of execution in Q1. We are extremely pleased with our results and have gotten off to a great start for fiscal 2020.
I will now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on driving strong durable growth and we will continue to invest in our products and other areas of the business to support our long term growth aspirations. Based on our over-performance in Q1, but keeping in mind we face a very difficult second half comps from last year, we are raising our fiscal 2020 outlook and providing Q2 guidance as follows.
For subscription revenue, we are raising our full year estimate to be in the range of $3.045 billion to $3.06 billion. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $746 million to $748 million or 32% growth, with sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 of approximately 4.7% and 5.7% respectively. Similar to last year, this pattern reflects our increasing seasonal trends towards larger Q4s. We still expect professional services revenue to be $500 million in fiscal 2020 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q2, we expect services revenue of $124 million.
For non-GAAP operating margins, we estimate Q2 to be 10% and we still anticipate 12.3% margins for the full year as we remain committed to 200 basis point of margin expansion even as we continue to aggressively invest for continued growth. The sequential decline in the non-GAAP operating margin from Q1 reflects typical seasonality and is primarily a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 27 percentage points in each remaining quarter and for the full year.
We still expect subscription revenue backlog to follow the pattern we laid out in our Q4 call with high-20s growth in the first half and low-20s growth in the second half. We continue to see a healthy pace of cloud migrations across HR and finance but as we look at the full year we are seeing more opportunities move into the back part of the year, specifically shifting into Q4. There is no change to our operating cash flow guidance in FY 2020 of approximately $790 million or 30% growth. As a reminder, Q2 traditionally generates limited operating cash flows. This is due to the combination of seasonally low collections and the seasonally high sequential increase in expenses resulting from our annual employee compensation cycle.
We are excited to have recently begun occupying our new Pleasanton development center, which will house more than 2,200 employees and also be home to our new customer center. We continue to expect the FY 2020 capital outlay for our owned real estate projects will be approximately $130 million, of which $94 million relates specifically to the development center. There is no change to our fiscal 2020 plans of $280 million for other capital investments to support customer growth and continued business expansion.
And finally, I will close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work. We are still in early stages of executing against our long term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without a shared goal. We are off to a great start for FY 2020 and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
Operator, let's begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Please ask your question. Hi. Congratulations on a spectacular start to the fiscal year. One question for Robynne. If you look at the deferred revenues, I know that you don't guide to deferred revenues and billings. They are not exactly representative of the strength of the business. But nonetheless, I just wanted to understand if there were certain factors that might have driven better, much better than the typical seasonality we have seen in deferred revenues? And one for you Aneel, you mentioned 50 platform deals with Adaptive. Are these fairly large corporations? Or as the next few years unfold for the company, how do you see planning playing out alongside financials? Does one synergize the other? And just wanted to get your broader thoughts on the adoption of planning and financials. Thank you. Congratulations. Well, I will take that and thanks Kash. I will take the second part first. One of the traction we saw with Adaptive in the suite market was in large companies. And I mentioned, several of them, they were either add-ons or a part of platform deals. AstraZeneca, Airbus and H&R Block, these are big organizations that are embracing the Adaptive business planning cloud.
I don't know, Tom, if you want to add anything? Yes. I think that's right, Aneel. And from our perspective, we have seen a lot more traction with the larger companies working with the broader Workday sales team. And as we know, those are longer sales cycles, but the early traction with those customers is very encouraging. Kash, on your deferred revenue question. Nothing particular to call out in Q1 outside of just the strong performance that we had overall. And as you know, just a reminder that unearned balance can vary with contract terms and renewal timing as well. And if I could just take one. Aneel, any broad comment on the replacement cycle you are seeing in core HCM, whether it's legacy SaaS or legacy on-premise? It looks like there is a bit of an acceleration of another inflection point in that journey and maybe I am wrong about it, but just wanted to get your comment on that. Thank you. Yes. I don't think we are seeing an inflection point or a reacceleration. I think the HR product line continues to do very well. And we are now on mainstream in terms of the types of customers that are looking to move to the cloud and with the high levels of customer satisfaction and the proven points of customers being live, I think it just bodes well for Workday. I think if there is anything that I would say about this quarter is that all the product lines are beginning to kick in and take some of the pressure off HCM. I hope that continues.
Operator, can we have the next question please? And we have a question from the line of Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc. Please ask your question. Thank you for taking the question here. One for Aneel and a follow-up for Robynne. Aneel, my question is on the demand drivers for cloud financials in the Fortune 50. Given the increasing number of proof points over the last year within the Fortune 500, what are the remaining objections you are fielding from the larger enterprises? And when would you expect to see some of the larger Fortune 50s begin to go down the path to embrace cloud financials? Well, I would separate out, you said Fortune 500 and Fortune 50s in there. The Fortune 50s are really hard to predict and we have a few of them. I would hope keep my comments to the broader Fortune 500. I believe, we are seeing a very similar adoption pattern for Fortune 500s as we did in HR five or six years ago. The more reference customers we have, the more that customers are facing painful upgrades of their legacy systems, the more that the regulations change with things like 606, those are all catalysts and I do think that the cloud is now viewed as the preferred deployment option versus on-premise, even for CFOs and whether that's through planning or through core accounting, I think that that is happening as well. And that's has been the case in HR and CRM for a while. It's beginning to happen in finance now. So a lot of things, no one thing to point out. Certainly good to hear. And then as a follow-up for Robynne. You talked about more opportunity shifting into kind of Q4. My question here is just, is this tied to a handful of larger lands that are shifting, because of complexity? Is it more geo-specific? What are the factors there that you should point us to as you think about some opportunity shifting in the quarters there in the second half? Brent, this is Chano speaking. I don't think there is one single factor. I would just say that particularly large deals, the timing move quarter-to-quarter. And as we are becoming a larger company, those tend to navigate more and move more towards the back end part of the year. But overall, the pipeline is healthy and quality of the global opportunities remain strong. Okay. So it's not geo-specific then? Nothing to highlight really specific, I think Great. Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Yes. Thank you and I will add my congrats. Robynne, just following up on the prior question about more opportunities moving into Q4. At the same time, you are raising guidance and I think you are reaffirming the subscription backlog guidance. So I just wanted to clarify, are you highlighting the same trends that's been there, I think, for many years of the business just becoming a little more Q4 seasonal? Or were you intending to call out some type of maybe more meaningful change in this fiscal year? No. Nothing more meaningful, Mark. As you know, in the past, there have been times when we have called out specific trends that we are seeing just to help our analysts and investors understand the dynamics that impact the metrics that you track. For example, last year, we talked about the difficult first half comps where we were seeing, in terms of larger deals flowing into the second half of the year. We are actually seeing a similar dynamic this year, but they are just flowing into Q4 instead of more evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. So we thought it might be helpful for you to just highlight that as you look at how to model our business. But it's has nothing really unusual. It's just a continuation of the trend that we have been seeing. Okay. Great. And then as a quick follow-up. Aneel, when you secure a planning win with a large organization like an Airbus or an AstraZeneca, do you see that as a precursor to a core financials win in the future? Or do you have enough data to know whether that increases the odds that that you would be able to win core financials from that organization in the future? I think it's still early, but if you look at it, if they have HR and planning, so they are more than just one Workday product in the customer account, then I think it bodes well for finance. Then the account has chances to default to a Workday platform. If it's just standalone planning, I think it's probably harder to predict at this point.
And Tom, if you want to add anything? No. I agree. I think all those accounts are opportunities to engage with the customer and develop a more holistic relationship. But I think it's more likely to advance if it's an HCM and planning deal. Thank you very much. And we have a question from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. And congrats on a swell and a strong start to the year. Robynne, maybe kickoff with a cash flow related question. When I looked at the billing performance this quarter and the deferred revenue performance, all very strong at nearly 30%-plus and it seems on the cash flows side, though, it seems to under pace the growth in billings as well as in overall cash flow. Can give us a sense of why cash flow grew 40% year-over-year versus the 30% type of growth you saw in deferred revenue? Yes. So because Q4 is sort of a high volume collections quarter, it's not really easy to predict how much we are getting at in Q4 versus Q1. And so we saw an over-performance in cash collections in Q4, which took some cash out of Q1. So we still feel really good about our guide for the year. But Q1 was a little bit of a lower cash flow quarter for us than usual, but you should expect that to pick up later in the year. Great. That's very helpful. And maybe Aneel, for you. As we think more broadly about the platform, it seems like each of the various HCM, financials, financial planning, just seem to be performing well. When I look back to PeopleSoft all those years ago, you guys, I think, brought on supply chain at the later stages of the PeopleSoft story. Is that and area where the platform can move next in serving where the sort of manufacturing type vertical? Any thoughts on that? I would say, it's on the radar but I wouldn't say that we are going to announcing imminently. That's a big undertaking. We still have more work to do to really establish ourselves as leaders outside of HR. We want that same leadership position for financials, for planning. I think we are planning with Adaptive. We are one of the two. And then, with Prism Analytics, we saw 70% or almost 70% growth this past quarter. So I don't feel the need for another growth engine at this point. Frankly, I think it would be a distraction. We have a lot of work to do on the product side, especially as we take all the products into the world of machine learning. But you know, I would ask that question every year. And some of you might get a different answer. Appreciate that, Aneel. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair & Company. Please ask your question. Thanks guys and congrats. Chano, I want to ask about just your efforts selling back to the base. I think there has been a bit more focused around that over the last several quarters. I am wondering if you are seeing any sort of measurable impact, whether retention rates or bookings mix? Or if it's more incremental? And then I have got a quick follow-up for Aneel. Thanks Justin. That customer base efforts or add-ons is tracking well. We see increased adoption around many different product lines, recruitment, learning, clearly Prism and planning, expenses and some others. We are very happy with the retention rates. We have commented again over 100% on a net basis. So, those efforts, we feel, that they are paying off. They are still early days but clearly as the opportunities increase, not only domestic here in the U.S. but also internationally, with a larger customer base, we see a huge opportunity there based on our great customer satisfaction and proven solution adoption. That's a great opportunity for us going forward. Okay. Great. And then, Aneel, I think you mentioned Legg Mason, which if I remember right was an Oracle win and it sounds like a win back for you guys. I am just wondering if you could speak more broadly on whether you are seeing more of those types of opportunities in your pipeline from Oracle, SAP? And is so, what do you think is driving that? Thanks. I would probably rather not comment on that. We won Legg Mason for the full organization. Not going into all the competitive dynamics. They were happy with what they rolled out initially and decided to broaden their use of Workday. And that's probably best to leave it there. There are failed cloud implementations. There are also cloud implementations of best-of-breed products tied back to legacy core HR and finance that are on-premise. All those create opportunities for us. So it all comes back to having happy customers and having projects that are successful. And as we stay focused on that and other people don't have successful outcomes, hopefully they do look to Workday. Okay. Great. Thanks guys. And we have Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Please ask your question. Thank you. And again, as you heard, congrats on the quarter. I have got two questions. The first is, can you give us a bit more color on services specifically how have you seen the Workday delivered services shifting from HCM to financials? What I am really trying to understand is, how the process is moving in terms of getting the partners to deliver not just on the HCM side but on the full financial side themselves? Are you seeing the partners able to build and implement better and bigger implementations of financials? So where are you on both of those journeys? And then a follow-up question. I have to get back to you with some of the specific data. But finance is definitely now more than half of the ecosystem, well more than half of the ecosystem is the partner ecosystem. That was the case for HR many years ago. And I am going to guess it's better than 80/20 for HR. I am not quite sure where it is for finance, probably tracking close to that. But partners have all, to a large partner have all embraced financials and in some cases, some of the firms that were late to embracing HR have made up by embracing finance early. And then we have got the boost from these partners embracing Adaptive. So I feel very good about the partner engagement on financials. And our stated goal is that our services is there to support our customers and they are for customer satisfaction, but we really count on our partners to take on the bulk of the implementation work. That makes sense. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, where are you on moving the existing planning customers over to Adaptive? Yes. This is Tom. We have made excellent progress and I think at this point we have had conversations with probably 75% of the customers. Some of the customers who had implemented the Workday planning product, it's operating successfully for them. So they will be a little bit slower in their migration, but we have several successful customers. For example, Bucknell University is up. It is live, running on Adaptive. And we have five or six other customers who have already converted and gone live. Very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it. And we have a question from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Hi. This is Samad Samana, on for John. Couple of questions. One for Aneel, the 50% net new ACV growth for financials is really impressive. I was curious, if we were to stratify that for midmarket customers versus large enterprise, how would that growth rate look? And then I have maybe a follow-up question for Robynne. Chano, on that first one? I wouldn't know exactly. I would need to come back to you on that one. What I can tell you is that the momentum continues in terms of seeing financials moving more upmarket and there is a good strength there. We had a great quarter in terms of large financials customers, particularly in healthcare and financial services, to mention some. We still have good to momentum continuing in terms of financials first move that we highlighted in Q4 and as well some good progress in terms of our HCM customer base coming out of, again being very happy with the product and the partnership considering us for financials. And the pipeline around those opportunities seems pretty healthy going forward. Great. And then Robynne, I guess from a bit of the CFO perspective, if you think about the adoption for financials, how do you think in terms of all the changes we have seen. And if I think about even ASC 606, as some of that lessens, do you think that adoption for financials should continue to increase as a result of that as well as the CFOs maybe have less to deal with from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just help us understand from your perspective on financials adoption as well? Thank you. Yes. That's a great question, Samad. I do think there has been some distraction around some of these big accounting changes, including 606 and then more recently the lease accounting changes which was, I know, a lot of work for public company's finance organizations. It will be interesting to see as the company's get beyond that, you know if that freeze them up to make system changes. I do believe that one of the things that these accounting changes really highlights is how difficult it is to implement these changes if you are on a legacy on-premise financial system, where customers who are in the cloud and even more specifically on Workday financials we built in all the functionality that they needed to adopt and account properly under the standard going forward. And we did that internally ourselves as well. We are using all of the lease accounting functionality to adopt that at the beginning of our Q1. So I do think that it will highlight the need for CFOs and businesses to move to the cloud. So I do expect some positive momentum coming out of that but the timing of that is unclear as a lot of companies will move along their own timelines. Great. I appreciate you taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. And we have a question from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Please ask your question. Hi guys. Two quick ones for me. Robynne, maybe just one more time on the linearity of the pipeline through the year, if you could talk to? Are you saying that this is a question of the comps being just more difficult in the 3Q period versus last year? Or is it something about the size of some very large and pace of some very large transactions that could make 4Q or could make the year more backend loaded? And where would that show up? Should we look at two years ago from a billings linearity or deferred linearity to get a better sense than the year ago period? And then I have a got a quick follow-up. Yes. Alex, so really two different things. One, I wanted to highlight the difficult comps from last year for the back half, right, just overall. But my comment specifically about Q4 and then I will turn it over to Chano to add what he wants is when we look at our net new ACV for the year, a higher percent of it is landing in Q4 than what we have seen in the last few years. Now this is just a continuation of a trend that we have been seeing. But I did wanted to call it out because it will impact backlog, it will impact unearned, which will impact other metrics that you derive from those. So I just wanted to make sure that you had the visibility that we were seeing with that dynamic.
Chano, anything you want to add? Thank you Robynne. Not much. I would say, Alex, that as you know we come off of a very strong FY 2019 and particularly strong Q4. And some of the large transactions that will be certainly larger cycles in terms of how long it take us to get there will also happen more materially around the Q4 time frame again this year. So that potentially has an impact of what we are commenting here on the yearly linearity. Nothing else to highlight. But I think that's a normal cycle and trend as we are becoming a larger company, I would say. Got it. And then maybe just, Aneel, a quick one for you. Now you are seeing the strong, really strong continued traction with Adaptive, your first much larger acquisition. As you think about the broader aperture of your financial suite and you think about organic versus inorganic innovation around that suite, do you feel even better now about your ability to add functionality there through M&A to accelerate your vision? Or just maybe any comments about how you think about that for the future? I think my personal view is that larger acquisitions are really difficult and frankly a lot of things fell in place with Adaptive. Number one, we knew the team really well. Tom and I are close friends going back 15 years. We had very similar corporate cultures, very similar focus on customers. And then the products and technology were very complementary. We knew the space. We were pretty far behind where Adaptive was. So there was a lot of things that fell into place to make that work. I just don't think there's a lot more targets out there like that. So you could see us continue to do smaller M&A. But the big ones will have to pass through a very tight filter on cultural fit, on technology compatibility, on limited overlap in terms of both revenue and technology. So I wouldn't see that as a precursor for us doing a whole bunch of more large acquisitions. Perfect. Thanks Aneel. And we have a question from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on planning. It seems like you guys are having a lot of really good success there and I know you have only owned the asset for a little less than a year. But I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the selling motion has changed since you have owned it? If it's a shorter sales cycle for you, given how well you know these customers already when you are going into your installed base with it? And maybe any comment on your ability to sell this, like as an add-on to what you know as a sweet sale versus standalone traction? Thank you. Yes. Thanks Heather. This is Tom. So there are two fundamental selling motions. The first is a stand where we are selling planning on a standalone basis and that's analogous to the way we sold the product prior to the acquisition by Workday. We continue to have a lot of success with that selling motion, a lot of interest from customers and the business there. We continue to be very pleased with the business there. I think in the nine months since the acquisition, the biggest change has been in Adaptive's ability to penetrate larger customers and have meaningful conversations. These are often platform deals and I will let Chano comment on that as well or they are planning upsells to existing customers. And I believe the credibility that we have being part of Workday has really accelerated our ability to have meaningful conversations with those customers. Yes. Completely agree, Tom. I think, yes, the decision planning cycles are shorter than the normal financial cycles. So you see a couple of motions there. One is those customers that will be going with Adaptive on a standalone basis, even some of our HCM or financial customer base is starting with and you see those where basically they see Adaptive as critical solution for them to make a decision to move forward with us, either on a financial transformation or an HR transformation and that is certainly an asset that we didn't have a significant strength before. And that was, I would say, a gap and it is much more complementary now. So clearly it's great, the power that it is giving us in terms of not just the Adaptive planning standalone business but obviously for customers making broader decisions with Workday. Well, I would just add that the three we highlighted in the press release were all existing Workday customers and they bought it as an add-on, Airbus, AstraZeneca and H&R Block, all were already existing Workday customers. So that was even part of a platform deal. So that's also a very exciting new development for us. Great. Thank you so much. And we have Derrick Wood from Cowen & Co. Please ask your question. Great. Thanks. Aneel, you mentioned trying to get new machine learning capabilities woven into the platform. Where are you guys in this journey? And how should we think about the modernization? How you get modernization out of it? Does it give you pricing leverage? What the revenue capture is? Well, we have been, for the last three years, basically sowing in the machine learning capabilities into the platform rather than making it a feature app-by-app, right. You could add machine learning to one specific app, but it's not leveraged by the rest of the application. So we are taking the longer term approach of building it into the fabric and today we have got several examples of where it's shown up.
In the career planning world, the system can make recommendations for the next move you should take or the next course you should take on the learning side. In the finance world, a lot of automation around the audit process. So it's coming to life really rapidly and we are going to unveil a whole wave of more capabilities at our next user conference.
I don't see it as pricing. We are not going to charge extra for it. It's hard to see charging one price for the products with machine learning and then charging less, if they don't have machine learning. I think it's going to be a core capability that is just required just to be competitive. And so maybe it gives us pricing leverage because we will be ahead of our competition. I think it's very likely that we are already ahead and we will just extend that gap. And we will see if that gives us some pricing leverage. Okay. And I guess just staying on the product question. Do you have any update on your platform efforts? I know it's a long build out cycle, but are there certain milestones we should be looking at as you roll this out to the market? Well, so we now are up to almost 100 customers that have signed on for being either a pilot customer or actually using the platform in production. Very simply, the path to being in full GA, right now we are in limited GA, is just opening up the full platform from an API perspective. Right now, we are building out the APIs for very specific use cases, making sure those first wave of customers are successful and then adding a new set of APIs to open up additional use cases.
And you will just see over time that, I think of it maybe won't take us long, but Gmail was in beta forever even though it was a great product. I think we are going to be in some form of limited GA for some time just as the breadth of APIs increases. But if the APIs that are there meet your needs, then it's full GA. So I think maybe that's not a clear way to describe it, but we have work to do on the APIs. The rest of the platform looks very strong. Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And we have a question from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Please ask your question. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question here this afternoon. Either for Chano or Aneel, I was wondering if you can share with us, it's an industry question, on what you are seeing on demand trends and the pipeline momentum in the federal government? And then as we think about financial management in the federal government, is it possible to either compare or contrast the adoption trends that you are seeing for that industry versus what you are seeing in the commercial area? Thanks. Yes. This will be really simple and really short. We don't sell to the federal government. There's a whole set of unique accounting requirements and even HR requirements that almost make it a completely different product line. Now if the federal government continues down the path to acting more like commercial organizations, that would open up a brand new market for us. And we do have some quasi-federal agencies that are Workday customers because they actually tend to operate more like a commercial entity. But right now, it's not a focal point for us. And we have Scott Berg from Needham. Please ask your question. Hi everyone. Congrats on a good quarter. Just one question for me and I don't know who wants to take it. But we heard in the quarter that, I assume it was Workday ventures who made an investment in one of the large RPA, robotic process automation, vendors that's out there. That company subsequently bought both your financials and HR platform and is using it to reduce the implementation times by 50% or better. I just wanted to know, is this the technology you guys are looking to bring into your own implementation cycles because I know that has been a large focus for reduced implementation time frames in costs over the last few years? Thank you. Yes. I would say that's in the TBD category. We make investment in a lot of interesting technologies. This new world of automation is definitely interesting to us. But we haven't made any decision yet to bring it into our own platform. And some of the estimates in terms of reduced time, we haven't been able to validate those ourselves. So we continue to invest heavily in our technologies to reduce the cost of implementation. And if some of this RPA stuff can reduce the cost of implementation or reduce the time, we definitely would embrace it but unclear at this point. It's an exciting new area, but unclear that this is something that we are going to bring in closer to Workday. We have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please ask your question. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question for Aneel. If you look at the competitive landscape, one of your competitors, large competitors is trying to force their client base over to kind of non-value add upgrades. Do you see anything of that showing up in your conversations already? Or is that something that's still going to come? Thank you. Anytime a customer is facing an upgrade from the legacy platform, they tend to look around and all we want to do is just to be in the mix of conversations. There definitely are customers that probably don't come to market, but increasingly customers are smart about their choices. And so I do think that those kinds of tactics just drive customers into a decision making process and they look at alternatives and hope we do well as part of those evaluations. Customers don't like, they don't want to be forced to do anything. But I think if they are being pushed to move into the cloud, if I were them, I would say, hey take a look at all the alternatives that are out there before you make a decision. Yes. Okay. Bye, bye. It makes sense. Thank you. Well done. We will take our final question from Brad Reback from Stifel. Please ask your question. Great. Thanks very much. Can you give us a sense of how the renewal pipeline looks for the remainder of the year and the opportunity that can afford you to sustain the strong upsell you saw in the current quarter? Thanks. Yes. This is Chano. The renewal pipeline is looking very strong for the remainder of the year. We, at this point, have no reason to feel other than confident with the same kind of renewal ratios in terms of the net basis that we have been sharing with you. And Chano, on that point, how is your confidence on the ability to upsell with this much broader products set than these customers saw when they first signed their deals? As I commented before, having a broader customer base with a broader set of products, when you have the customer satisfaction ratios that we are enjoying is just a blessing, right. Because it clearly allows us to have conversations with the customers that are already seeing value in some of the products and investments they have done with Workday. And we have to try to prove basically the opportunity for them to get value of the additional solutions that we bring to market. So we feel very confident and we have been sharing with you some of the attached ratios on very high rates that we have been experiencing on the sale of our products, around 70% or 70%-plus on products like time tracking, recruiting, payroll and others that have been longer in the market. We have no reason to believe that some of the other products that are just new will not get to the same ratios over time. Great. Thank you very much. We now conclude the call. Thank you for joining Workday's Q1 earnings conference call. Have a good night.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO, Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO, Chano Fernandez and Tom Bogan . unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2019 .",0.0

With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Michael. And hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to share the details of another very good quarter. In Q2, we continued our momentum as we partner with our customers to drive digital transformation across cloud finance and HR.
Let me share some of the highlights beginning with HCM. As of today, more than 40% of the Fortune 500 and approximately 50% of the Fortune 100 have selected Workday for their core HCM platform. And as we continue to expand our efforts globally, 17% of the Global 2000 have also selected Workday for their core HR system of record.
In the second quarter, some of the new customers we added included the Gap, Stanley Black & Decker and Rockwell Automation in North America, Aldi Stores Limited in Europe, and Bunnings Group Limited in our Asia-Pacific, Japan region.
Our continued success globally is a direct reflection of the value we place on live, happy, and referenceable customers. Notable go-lives in Q2 included, Deutsche Bank, Home Depot and PNC Bank. Our customer satisfaction rate remains amongst the highest in the enterprise cloud software industry and the success of our customers an incredibly important part of our enduring business longer term.
Shifting to cloud financial management. We had another strong quarter with approximately 50% revenue growth. In Q2, we added a Fortune 100 insurance company which was another in a growing trend of financials first customers. In addition to this large new customer, we also added the City of Baltimore, Veolia, UK, and the Government of Singapore.
These are just a few of the many new customers which selected Workday for their core financial management applications in Q2, bringing our total customer base for this product line to over 725. Also and equally importantly, we had several customers go-live on financial management in Q2, including H&R Block, Loews Corporation and Shake Shack.
In addition to the strong performance from our core financial application, we continue to see great opportunities with Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud, as we officially lapped the one year anniversary of the acquisition. In Q2, Adaptive Insights added over 200 new planning first customers and over 45 new platform and upsell deals to new and existing Workday customers.
We believe that with the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance products, in combination with our industry-leading HCM suite, Workday Prism Analytics and the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud, we are delivering a global solution as highly differentiated and critical for empowering business leaders to plan execute analyze and extend all in one system and powered by machine learning, and we continue to invest in areas that leverage our strengths and open up new market opportunities.
I now like to spend a few minutes talking about innovation. As you know, innovation is a core value and part of our DNA at Workday. First of all, I am pleased to share that Fast Company recently named Workday as one of the 50 Best Workplaces For Innovators.
We are very proud of that distinction that even as we maintain our very fast pace of employee growth around the world, our Company culture around innovation remains strong. We have a lot of product innovation as we look ahead to our upcoming Workday 33 release and I'd like to mention just a few.
First for HR, we continue to hear from our customers that addressing today’s skills gap is critical as they look to better develop and re-skill their workers and prepare their workforce for the future.
We continue to leverage machine learning built into the core of Workday to broaden our skills cloud offering with two new features, skills minor and skills insights to help customers better understand and manage skills across their organizations.
In financial management, we’re using machine learning to detect anomalies. Anomalies will be flagged as they occur affording users an opportunity to detect and correct potential reconciliation issues when they happen rather than during the high pressure month-end close.
And on the analytics front, we are making data insights available to all, for both finance and HR, with data discovery boards for Workday Financial Management and Workday HCM, allowing users to quickly visualize data, detect patterns and discover insights all within Workday.
We look forward to sharing more about our product innovation, customer success and market opportunity in October at Workday Rising, our annual customer conference. The Financial Analyst Day takes place on October 15th in Orlando, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.
And now over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel. And good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results, with total revenue of $888 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 32%. Our subscription revenue was $757 million, up 34%.
Our professional services revenue came in at $131 million, up 23%. Revenue outside the US was up 35% year-over-year to $211 million, representing 24% of total revenue.
Subscription revenue backlog was $7.03 billion, growth of 27% year-over-year. Growth was driven by solid results across net new bookings, add-on business and net retention, which was once again over 100%. Also impacting Q2 backlog growth was a duration headwind of approximately 1%.
Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $4.77 billion, growth of 28%. Current unearned revenue was $1.80 billion in Q2, up 29% year-over-year, while total unearned revenue grew 27% to $1.89 billion.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $118 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.2%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line over performance and the shifting of certain expenses from Q2 to the back half of the year. Operating cash flow in Q2 was $100 million.
We continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q2, we successfully added and integrated approximately 470 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 11,400. We continue to execute very well operationally and are pleased with our solid first half results.
I’ll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on investing in our products and other areas of the business to support our long-term growth aspirations. Based on our over performance in Q2, but keeping in mind we face very difficult second half comps from last year, we are providing Q3 and full year guidance as follows.
For subscription revenue, we’re raising our FY '20 estimate to be in the range of $3.06 billion to $3.07 billion, 29% growth at the high end. We expect our Q3 subscription revenue to be $783 million to $785 million, 26% growth at the high end.
We are raising our professional services revenue guidance to $520 million for fiscal 2020, as we continue to focus on driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $135 million.
For non-GAAP operating margins, we estimate Q3 to be approximately 10.5% and we still anticipate 12.3% margins for the full year. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 28 percentage points in Q3 and for the full year.
We still expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the low 20s in the second half, and there is no change to our FY ‘20 operating cash flow guidance of $790 million.
We continue to expect the full year capital outlay for our owned real estate projects to be approximately $130 million, of which $95 million relates to the development center in Pleasanton. There is no change to our fiscal 2020 plan of $280 million for other capital investments to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.
I’ll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners and employees for their continued support and hard work. We had a solid first half of the year and we’ll continue to focus on our customer success.
We look forward to seeing many of you at Workday Rising in October, as we share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.
Operator, let’s begin the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord. Hey, thanks very much. So I talked with a early user of your Platform as a Service and they like it, and they said there is obviously a few little mix that's they are working on and stuff like that. But the thing they really like the best was, you’re not kind of pigeonholing them into a specific database and things like that.
But I guess, the main question is, what point does this kind of become widely available or what are the gating issues that we need to address to kind of make this thing running full speed and fully available? Thanks. Thanks for the question Richard. It’s available today in what we call limited GA, which means it is actually widely available, but it’s around a set of well-defined APIs and particular areas of the product. And going into next year 2020, calendar year 2020, we expect to have the broader set of APIs available where we will be in through general availability across all aspects of the product line. Got it. And then a quick follow up on technology. You know one of the things that I was talking to someone at WakeMed, and they just said one of the big problems they had is all but credentialing that they do is on a paper. And you guys already - I don't know what you - it's a system of record for people.
Is there a way that you could digitize that stuff in a safe way, so it's not - so it's private and stuff like that, because it's not just driver license, but it's records and all this other stuff and all that and you - are you guys working on that direction? We actually introduced Workday Credentials, which is exactly what you described at our Altitude conference just a month back, which is our professional services conference for both our professional services and our partners professional services people.
Jon Ruggiero actually wrote a blog which you can see in our website about Workday Credentials and you learn – you’ll see a lot more about it at Workday Rising. It’s a very exciting new area for us. It's been under development for 18 months and it accomplishes exactly what you described Richard. Perfect. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good afternoon. One for Aneel and one for Robynne if I could. Aneel, if you look at the international expansion strategy, you talked about, I think, having only what 17% penetration in the Global 2000. It looks like international revenue was less than 25% of the business.
Can you just remind us where you’re at relative to international expansion? What are your efforts there to kind of really accelerate the footprint internationally? Thanks. So I’ll take a crack at it, then I’ll ask our President, Chano Fernandez, to weigh in as well. We’re very focused on selling to large multinationals, and so as a result, we’re focused on the large national - multinational markets, UK, France, Germany, in Europe, Japan, Korea, those really have been the big markets outside the US moving into Mexico, but it really has followed sort of the G8, G10 countries.
And I would say at this point, we’re pleased with the results. We’ve actually done quite well on the Asia-Pac region and Australia, New Zealand as well. It’s still early on and it's a combination, both of us going into those markets and those markets just coming online into moving into the cloud for HR and finance more aggressively. I’d say the market is - outside the US is three or four years behind where we are in the US today. Anything you want to add Chano? I would like to highlight that as Aneel is commenting, we are pleased with the progress and results in our international markets. We remain very focused there. I think on top of our traditional large enterprise focus, we are really having and seeing great results and success in the medium enterprise, since we took to the same implementation and project methodology from the US into markets like Germany, Nordics, France and some others, and we’re seeing great traction.
So you know early days and a lot of opportunity still to be captured from us in the international markets, but great customer satisfaction so far and great progress. Helpful. And one quick follow-up for Robynne. Just looking at calculated billings growth, it looked like that peaked last year during Q3 at 48% year-over-year. How should we think about that compare – you’re talking about I think 20% plus growth in the second half, but should we put consideration around our calculated billings growth assumptions for Q3 given that tough compare a year ago? Yeah, I mean, we’ve got tough compares across all of our metrics in the back half of the year. So definitely keep that in mind. I would expect that our earn - unearned growth rates would be largely in line with the subscription revenue backlog numbers that we gave you. So you can infer from that what billings would be. Okay, great. Thank you. Helpful color. Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Yes. Thank you, Aneel. Just given all the headlines and cross-currents that are out there. We have had a few software companies start to encounter some problems driven by Brexit or the trade situation. You know, looking at this in contrast, your results and guidance are showing real health, real consistency.
So just curious if there is anything worth mentioning on the macro side in terms of business confidence or what you’re hearing from other CEOs, whether they have any incremental concerns or not? So when I look at our pipeline across all the product lines, they are very healthy. So we’re not seeing any impact on our pipelines. But there is no question, there is uncertainty in the air. And I think the CEOs, you talk to the closer they are to doing business in China, the more uncertainty they feel.
So I just think we’re taking a wait and see and listen to our customers mode. We haven't seen any issues in the pipeline. But the way that it would materialize, I think for most tech companies would be seeing things slow down here, which we haven’t. But I know there’s a lot of uncertainty in the air and we are trying to – we’re trying to read tea leaves the same way you are. Okay. That makes sense. As well Robynne I wanted to - just mentioned, it’s great to hear you're adding a Fortune 100 company as a financial customer, and I am just curious, what are you inferring from having an enterprise of that kind of scale. You’re moving forward with financials first, I think, is how you described it, because that’s been so rare in the past. So I’m just kind of wondering is it a reflection of product maturity or enterprise readiness or something else? Yeah, Mark, I think it's actually both of those things. We had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see financials first - large financials first deals in our pipeline, which had been a change. We still see those. I would expect that those wins will be lumpy as with all of our large deals and that they will kind of ebb and flow.
But I do think we’re at a convergence point now where our product is ready and has been for a while and now the market is ready up in that large enterprise space as well. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Thank you very much. I appreciate. Congrats on the quarter. Two separate questions. First one is, are you seeing any change in the number of opportunities or the size of the opportunities entering the pipeline for financials. I’m trying to get a sense of how the early stage of that pipeline is starting to mature? And then a follow-up question. I think, Mark, as we’ve been commenting, we - I mean, when I look at the pipelines for financials second half and beyond, we are pleased with what we have and what we would be building both in the US and the rest of the world. We are seeing more traction in a couple of verticals, very consistent with what we commented before. Those are mainly financial services and healthcare in the large opportunities.
But yes, we see that is moving up market and yes it is growing our financial pipeline faster clearly than our - than being on our core business lately. Perfect. Excellent. Very helpful. I’m going to ask, given how good the quarter and clean the quarter was, I’m going to turn to something investors don’t generally hasn't talked about and that's the GAAP margins. Pro forma margin is improving, how should we think about, when the GAAP margins will start to improve return positive. What are the factors that can drive? And any color would be interesting. Yeah, so as you know, stock is a very important part of our compensation philosophy here at Workday, and so we should continue to expect that we’ll spend a good portion of our revenue, 20% now, but nothing declining in the near future going forward.
So as we reach towards the 2020 mid '20s non-GAAP revenue, that's when we would expect to start to look towards the GAAP profitability. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess, Aneel, I was curious just about your thoughts on the Adaptive a year after the acquisition, just maybe some thoughts on how it’s done, I guess, relative to your expectations, which I know you were high going into it?
And maybe anything that's been surprising to you, just on maybe a positive basis whether it’s help stoke more conversations around the financial organization broadly, you know just maybe a little bit more color on kind of how that’s panned out relative to what you thought a year ago would be great. Yeah, it’s obviously been a great year. Dave - my co-founder Dave Duffield and I were actually at in a plan for an all-hands meeting there yesterday with Tom Bogan, our - the CEO and my good friend. And all the key people are at the company, there is a lot of momentum. We’ve had a great first year.
What I think we expected to happen was that the product would be a great fit up market with the Workday customer base and it has played out that way, and it’s actually happen probably faster than either Tom or I would have imagined, we’ve had some really big wins like Airbus and AstraZeneca choosing the Adaptive product line.
I think the really positive pieces at the standalone Adaptive business has continued to be very healthy independent of being attached to Workday, and so it really has worked out extremely well and I think it all starts with the most important thing, very, very similar cultures.
We both care about our employees, we both care about our customers, high integrity places and so. If there were five more Adaptive, we would probably look at making acquisitions like that, unfortunately those are - there are few and far between, really - really a phenomenal first year. That’s great. Maybe just one quick one for Robynne. Robynne you mentioned more spending pushing into the second half of the year. Was that - I mean hiring seems strong, so I guess it is just some one-off items that are maybe pushing a little bit in the second half versus expectations? Yeah, we were slightly behind on hiring, but nothing that was very impactful and nothing that's going to jeopardize all the good work that we have planned this year. Most of the slippage was, what I would call, program spend, things like advertising and other types of program initiatives that just moved out of the quarter and are going to start a little later in the year. Sounds good. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey guys. I just wanted to ask on, maybe first on Adaptive. Are you starting to see or maybe can you talk about the cadence of Adaptive leading to more kind of core financials deals? And I've got a quick follow-up. There is no question. It’s helped on the pipeline for financials. And I mean, the key is, if you were to look at the CFO priorities, planning is way at the top of the list and Adaptive has a best in class planning product, both for finance and increasingly for workforce planning.
And so it's a great entry point and broadens the conversation. And if a customer is not quite ready for core financials, we’re still okay with that, we’ll get into the door with planning and can follow it up later.
But I think it just - it broadens the appeal. There’s just no question, it broadens the appeal. I think Prism Analytics does that as well. So having that broader product footprint for the financials customer base has been really important for us. Perfect. And then, maybe just one for Robynne. Is there any way to conceptually think about the impact of Adaptive on the subscription backlog numbers or kind of how we should think about that going forward? Yeah. So when we bought them in Q3, we disclosed that we had inherited a $140 million of Adaptive backlog. And so we got that benefit Q3 of last year, which obviously impacted the bookings number as well. So it’s a very tough comp for us starting in Q3 and into Q4. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Hi. Thank you for taking the question guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. You continue to make good progress, adding new customers into the fold and it’s definitely kind of more to go, particularly in international.
I wanted to take the other side of that equation in terms of the progress and upselling into existing customers, maybe get an update on how that's going with sort of the broader HCM portfolio and the ability to sort of further penetrate into some of the existing customers? Keith, I’m Chano speaking. We are pleased on how that business is doing. In terms of the attach ratios, I would say starting with selling, financials, back into our HR installed base and then clearly planning, prism, recruitment, learning.
I think most of our attach rates and our products are doing very well, which is great, because as we said before, it is taking off pressure from a growth perspective from the core HCM.
We usually have disclosed some of those attach rates number on the Analyst Day around Workday Rising. I’m sure we will do this year. But stay tuned, but good progress. I would just add, I think it's been really good progress since China put a more dedicated focus on customer base, but we could also still do better as we’ve embarked on a pricing study with one of the top consulting firms. It’s very clear that we are still more geared towards net new from new logos then from our customer base and that’s probably different than the other cloud peers out there. So it’s an area of high interest for us. Got it. That makes sense. And then a follow-up for Robynne. Given the like - the uncertainty that Aneel was speaking to within the customer base, I understand, it’s not in your pipeline, but does that impact your kind of forecasting methodology at all, like in terms of the guidance you gave - did any more conservative on any of kind of the inputs that you guys use and putting up at the back half of the year? So, as you know, we’ve said all along that we’re more back-end loaded this year than we have been in other years. So we’ve definitely taken that into account in our guide and we’ve got a large pipeline and we’re focused on executing against that and we’re looking forward to updating you more next quarter. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations team on a fantastic quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the core HCM product. Aneel, you mentioned that personal 40% of Fortune 500 have standardized on Workday and you also mentioned 17 - only 17% penetration of the Global 2000.
In markets like this where the number one player generally tends to get dominant market share. Are we still targeting that kind of market share that you have with the Fortune 500 on a global scale, and so therefore, not to put words in your mouth, but how do you think or how sustainable do you think is the growth rate for the core HCM product line, especially given this difference between penetration levels of the Global 2000 versus Fortune 500. What does the company need to do in order to get to that equally dominant position on the Global scale as you have with the Fortune 500? Thank you. So I’m not going to sign probabilities, but obviously aspirationally we’d like to have the same market share in the Fortune 2000 that we do in the Fortune 500. And by the way, we’re at 40% of the Fortune 500. I expect that to continue to rise. There is still - there is still probably 200 accounts that have not made decisions yet.
The Fortune 100 was the first group to make decisions and there we know we have - we're also around 50% of the Fortune 100. For the rest, as long as we can continue to execute and take care of customers, I don’t see why we can't have high penetration rates of the Global Fortune 2000.
It’s incumbent on two things. Number one, continuing to expand globally and reaching those opportunities and they’re not all in the countries we’re in. There are probably some opportunities that are in places that were not yet selling to. So we have to factor that in.
And number two, some of those markets as we talked about earlier are still very early on in their cloud migration and so that’s probably the most important focus for us as to be there as these companies begin to migrate of with their legacy systems.
But it’s opportunities out there and it gives me confidence that the HR opportunities continue to be a long-term opportunity and there are so many modules that we can go back into these customers with, even modules we haven’t even brought to market yet. So very confident, it’s a big enough market to continue to support our growth. Wonderful. And if you have a couple of words on replacement of legacy SaaS installations. Is that still a tailwind for you guys as it was the case a couple of quarters back? That's it from me. Thank you. Legacy SaaS meeting failed, meaning either bolt-ons that we're replacing or core systems of record that failed in the cloud from... Exactly. From one of our competitors that - I think that will continue to be a trend for us and an opportunity for us. When you get to - when you look at the Fortune 500, candidly neither of our large competitors have real proof points over 100,000 employees or even over 50,000 employees that are in production and a huge part of our success has been not just winning the customer by giving them into production and having them be happy.
I think the stats are, we have of the approximately 50% of the Fortune 100 that are using Workday, 35% or 35 of that 50 is already live, right. So that’s a huge advantage. And when people have a failed project, the next thing they wanted to is, get the sure thing and make sure that it works, and that’s where we hopefully come into play. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Thanks. First one Aneel, you changed up some leadership and leadership structure in your international regions during the quarter. Could you just talk about the reasons for the changes or maybe just comment with the new leadership and structure kind of what you're hoping to sharpen your focus on? I’m going to turn over that to Chano. Yeah, international remains - Derrick, international remains a very big focus for us within the sales organization. And as we said, we are happy with the progress. We also said that there were a couple of countries where we had opportunities for better performance and to improve. So that's part of that process.
We promoted someone within the company that has been with us for quite a few years and we are very - and really, really excited about the opportunity ahead. Personally, I am. Okay. And Robynne, you mentioned last quarter, I guess this quarter, again, it’s more of a back-end loaded quarter or back-end loaded year. You maintained the low 20% backlog growth for the second half.
Can you just give us some color as to what you think around, you know, kind of Q3 versus Q4 and whether it’s more weighted towards higher growth in Q4? Any color there would be helpful. Yeah, Derrick, it is more weighted towards Q4 than last year. So we had a more even distribution particularly when it comes to the large deals last year than we have this year and we’re seeing really back-end loaded into not just the second half but into the second quarter. And then - I mean sorry, the fourth quarter. And then on top of that, we're facing really difficult comps from lapping the Adaptive acquisition. Okay. Thanks. Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Hey, two quick questions. Congrats from me as well. Can I go back to Adaptive, like when you got it, Aneel, like it was more focused on SMB and - but you kind of were convinced that the core technology was really good to just scale it up. Could you talk a little bit about the progress you've made there. And then, like just one word also then on the partner - evolution of the partner channel? Thank you. So at the time of the acquisition of Adaptive, they had already been working on scaling the products and re-writting their modeling engine for the biggest companies in the world. It was not well known to the marketplace. They were not yet public, but the work was well underway.
And we're very pleased with how that work has gone, a big chunk of it got delivered in the earlier part of this year, it continues. But we now have the confidence to sell the companies like AstraZeneca and Airbus, you know two very, very large companies. So the scaling efforts that was already underway has gone really well.
They have a world-class, I just say we because - we now - we've got a world-class development team on the Adaptive front and they continue to scale the system to the largest companies in the world and that really was - that was really it.
I think it's - it was also the - the other part of it was an investment in the sales side for large enterprise. That's a big - it's a big cost. I think if Adaptive had gone public that would have been a big investment for them. By becoming part of Workday, they were able to leverage our high-end enterprise sales organization immediately and that's paid big dividends as well.
On the evolution of the partner channel, we continue to have a broad base of strong partners. Of course, we've got all the big - the big SIs. I think the two big trends in this last 12 months has been they’re embracing of the financial product line and they're embracing of Adaptive.
Adaptive was historically not as close to some of the big SIs and as the big SIs have learned more about the products. They’ve got very excited and we expect that that sort of partners are going to be very helpful to us in some of the larger situations that we’re in competing for right now. All right. Excellent. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. I was wondering, Aneel, if you could elaborate a little bit more with regards to the heightened focus in terms of driving attachment within the existing client base?
Could you dimensionalize that in terms of the opportunity and how long would that take to scale up and how quickly do you think that would be visible from the outside? I think we’ll do that for you at the user conference at Rising. We typically update that kind of thinking. It’s hard to do in a short call, but we’ll have that for you at the next analyst meeting. And there is, we’re at - and we’ve always been in the high 90s of customer satisfaction. When we come out with new modules, our customers on the margin tend to want to buy from us. There is more opportunity there.
But rightfully so the last three or four years have been focused on getting new accounts. But now we have a base that's closing in on 3,000 customers for HR and 700 for Financials and over 4,000 for Adaptive.
So we now have a big installed base, and we probably need to adjust our thinking a little bit about how to go back to that base more systematically or not more systematically, probably with a bigger footprint on the sales side. Great. And then with regards to the guidance, typically the subscription revenue guidance has been conservative. I understand the year-over-year compare. You know looking at it from a seasonal sequential perspective, it seems conservative. Is there anything that would drive that this from a seasonal sequential perspective? Well, we do have some seasonality in our subscription revenue, mostly between Q1 - Q4 and Q1, and Q1 and Q2. Sure. Based on the number of days. So we do get a tailwind in Q2 which then we don’t get in Q3 and Q4 from that. Obviously, we take a lot of things into account when we guide. We take into account, overall sentiment. Aneel talked a little bit about what he was saying.
The fact that this is a more back-end loaded year than we've had in the past, obviously, is weighing on our guidance as well in terms of us having more to close now in this back half than we generally do halfway through the year. So we’re focused on execution. And as I said before, we’ll update you as we get through the back half of the year. Great. Congratulations again. We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Hi, thanks. Robynne, simple one for you. You had mentioned three months ago that on the cash flow side, 2Q would be quite limited. $100 million is a little bit more than limited. I trust what happened here is, maybe some of the margin outperformance worked its way down to the cash flow line or were there one or two other things that might have contributed to that over performance? Thank you. Yeah, Karl, that was definitely part of it. We also came out of the quarter with a stronger collections number than we had gone into the quarter thinking we would have.
Obviously, Q2 the seasonal low for us and so it’s a little hard to predict where we're going to land quarter by quarter given we do a lot of our business at the end of the quarters and invoices are due in the back half. So whether they pull-in or slide out is really a bit of an unknown. So we were pleased with our performance on the cash flow. Got it. Okay. That was it from me. Thanks a lot. We will take our final question from Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Oh! Great. Thank you. Aneel, when I checked this quarter, we actually heard good things about Prism. And so I was wondering if you could tell us how that’s going and then maybe that would be an opportunity, your long time partner spent $16 billion to buy Tableau, so they clearly see some opportunity. So maybe that’s - maybe you could work in your perspective just for the analytic space in general for companies like you and Salesforce? Yeah, you know Prism has been a strong performer, continues to be a strong performer. So we had another very good quarter with Prism. I think we’re going to see it go. It’s more and more in the way of dashboards and usability that we highlighted in the prepared comments and a set of applications that sit on top of Prism, people analytics being the first, but you can see financial analytics, spend analytics and this idea of package analytics is really resonating with our customers.
So it’s a big part of what we’re doing in many ways. It’s the culmination of a lot of work to show when you have a strong transactional engine, the kind of deep analysis you can do with that data. So it continues to chug along and we only didn’t mention it just because it's Q2. When we get to the Analyst Meeting in a few months, we will show you more detail about what’s happening with Prism, it’s very exciting. All right, great. Thank you. I’m very happy for Mark and Tableau. It's not competitive with Workday. We actually used Tableau in some situations internally, like a lot of companies do. At the end of the day, people are using our analytics to really focus in on the data types that we drive HR and financial data types and vice versa. So it’s probably a very good move for Mark and it’s a very good company that he acquired. Great. Thank you for that perspective. That concludes the Q2 Workday earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Have a good night.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO, Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO, and Chano Fernandez .",0.0

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2019.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. As we highlighted at our Rising User Conference, in October, we are firmly established as a leader in cloud HCM applications, and increasingly strengthening our leadership position in the broader cloud finance management market. We're very proud of the company we've built with now over 3,000 customers globally, over 70% of which are live and in production. These customers have deployed Workday to help transform both the way they engage their employees and operate their business. We're excited by these success stories as well as the thousands of other companies we have the opportunity to help along their transformation journeys.
With that, let's quickly review our third quarter results. Starting with HCM, we continue to gain market share with an industry-leading true cloud platform, which believe has the deepest product capabilities and unparalleled user experience, and the highest levels of customer success. In Q3, we added six more Fortune 500 customers, and 11 in the Global 2000. A few of the new HCM customers include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Magna International, Royal Bank of Canada, and Sutter Health. Some notable go-lives in the quarter included Glencore National AG, the Dow Chemical Company, and Telstra Corporation.
Turning to Workday Financial Management, we saw continued momentum for our suite of applications in Q3, with new customers including Consumer Direct Care, P.F. Chang's, the State of Iowa, and WPP Group USA. We also had a natural and organics grocery store chain with over 85,000 employees, add Financial Management to its existing use of HCM. We now have approximately 800 total Financial Management customers, which include notable go-lives in Q3 of Rivera, and American Family Insurance. In addition to core Financial Management, Adaptive Insights, Business Planning Cloud, and Workday Prism Analytics continue to be a strong up-sell and add-ons to our core applications.
In Q3 alone, Adaptive Insights added approximately 200 new planning first customers, and approximately 50 new platform and up-sell deals to new and existing Workday customers. Our momentum in customer success was best captured at our annual user conference, Workday Rising. Between our U.S. conference in Orlando, in October, and our European conference, in Milan, last month, we welcomed more than 15,000 attendees, including more than 9,700 customer participants representing 2,250 organizations. At Workday Rising, we once again revealed our Annual Customer Satisfaction Rating, which was 97%. We are very proud of our customer success and the confidence they have in Workday as they embark on their digital transformations for finance and HR globally.
Innovation has always been at the forefront at Workday, and it continues to be a key to our success. As I highlighted at Rising, Spend Management is one of the areas where we are putting more focus and investment. We have designed Workday Procurement and Workday Inventory as part of our single system to streamline the procure-to-pay process and improve operational efficiency, driving down costs while enhancing supplier collaboration and engagement. We expect to accelerate our efforts in this area with the proposed acquisition of Scout RFP, a leading cloud based platform for strategic sourcing and supplier engagement.
With Scout, which has been a Workday Ventures portfolio company since 2018, Workday provide organizations a comprehensive source-to-pay solutions with best-in-class strategic sourcing to help transform the procurement organization and deliver better business outcomes, including reduction in spend, greater policy compliance, and maximized engagement across key stakeholders. We're also thrilled to welcome Scout's employees, who share our passion for customer service and fun to Workday. We looked forward to expanding our efforts in this area and will share more information as the deal closes, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter.
As we continue to focus on long-term growth there are a few leadership changes I'd like to highlight; first the appointment of Rich Sauer as our New Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary. Rich brings with him over 20 years of experience at Microsoft, and we're excited to have him on board. I'm also pleased to share that Leighanne Levensaler has taken on a new role as our Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Leighanne is a 10-year Workday veteran and one of our strongest voices of our products, values, and vision. Moving forward to ensure our corporate strategy is in lockstep with our go-to-market strategy. And I'm also excited to share the appointment of Emily McEvilly into the role of our first Chief Customer Officer, overseeing the newly created customer experience organization. We are bringing together professional services, education services, customer success, and customer support under one leader to continue our relentless focus on the customer and to drive new innovations that will deliver even more value to our existing and future customer base. We are in a great position heading into Q4 and we look to finish the year strong.
And now over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon everyone. On today's call, I'll provide highlights of our third quarter results, update our guidance for the fourth quarter, and then provide a preliminary and high level view of fiscal '21. We delivered another solid quarter in Q3 with total revenue of $938 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26%.
Our subscription revenue was $799 million, up 28%, and professional services revenue came in at $140 million, up 18%. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 38% year-over-year to $234 million, representing 25% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $7.19 billion at the end of the third quarter, growth of 22% year-over-year. Backlog growth was driven by solid results across net new bookings, add-on business, and net retention, which was once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months also grew 22% to $4.91 billion.
Current unearned revenue was $1.8 billion in Q3, up 23% year-over-year, while total unearned revenue grew 20% to $1.88 billion. As a reminder, the Adaptive Insights acquisition closed and the comparison period a year ago, adding $140 million to the subscription backlog, $90 million of which was recorded on the balance sheet as unearned revenue. This one-time benefit created a very tough comp for Q3 for both backlog and unearned revenue.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $143 million resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 15.2%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line overperformance and favorable expense variants. Strong sales execution and a significant improvement in linearity within the quarter resulted in our strong top line beat. Additionally, we saw some marketing spend and hiring originally anticipated in Q3 move into the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $258 million, more than double our operating cash flow from Q3 FY '19.
We continue to invest in our people and then attracting top talent to Workday. During Q3, we successfully added an integrated over 400 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to more than 11,800. We are focused on maintaining operational efficiencies that will allow us to drive long-term enduring growth. Q3 was a solid quarter that positions as well as we head into our seasonally strongest and most important quarter of the year.
Before providing updated guidance, I want to briefly touch on the Scout RFP acquisition, which we expect to close later this quarter. We're excited about the opportunity we see ahead in the broader spend management category, and believe Scout's best of breed technology will accelerate our positioning in the market. It is important to note; however, that Scout's revenue base is still relatively small and when combined with the timing of the transaction, and the required purchase accounting adjustments, it has a negligible impact on our fourth quarter revenue outlook.
With that, I'll now turn to guidance. Our focus remains centered on investing to support our long-term growth opportunity. Based on our overperformance in Q3, but keeping in mind we face another very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter, we are providing guidance as follows. The subscription revenue we're raising our FY '20 estimate to be in the range of $3.085 billion to $3.087 billion, or 29% growth. We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $828 million to $830 million, representing 23% growth. We are raising our professional services revenue guidance to $529 million for fiscal '20 as we continue to focus on driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $134 million.
We now expect FY '20 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13%, up from our prior guidance of 12.3%. This guidance incorporates estimated expenses related to the pending Scout RFP acquisition. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 27 percentage points in Q4, and for the full-year. We still expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the low 20s in the fourth quarter, and there is no change to our FY '20 operating cash flow guidance of $790 million.
We have slightly lowered our FY '20 capital expense forecast for both owned real estate and all other capital expenditures, driven largely by the push-outs of certain projects into FY '21. We now expect the FY '20 capital outlay for owned real estate projects to the $110 million, and our outlay for all other capital expenditures to be $250 million.
While we are early in our FY '21 planning cycle and still have an important Q4 to close, we'd like to provide a preliminary and high level view of FY '21. As a reminder, and as we discussed in detail at our recent Analysts Day, we have a lot of new products coming to market in FY '21, including Workday Cloud Platform, People Analytics, and our Employee Experience Solution. Given the timing of these launches, and the time it takes the new product to impact subscription revenue growth at our scale, these emerging products won't start to have any notable impact on our revenue growth until fiscal '22, and beyond. In addition, while we are very excited by the pending Scout RFP acquisition and the long-term opportunity that we see ahead of us in the spend management category, Scout is expected to contribute less than 1% to our subscription revenue growth in FY '21.
With that context, we are currently planning for FY '21 subscription revenue of approximately $3.73 billion, gross of approximately 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect pronounced and compounding seasonality towards Q4 with our Q1 being the seasonally slowest in terms of net new bookings. We currently expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY '21 to grow approximately 4% sequentially from Q4 FY '20. We remain focused on investing to drive long-term durable growth, while progressing towards our 25% plus non-GAAP operating margin goal. While we are still in our FY '21 planning process or early view of FY '21, non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 14%, which includes roughly 1.5 points of expected dilution from the Scout RFP acquisition. But in other way, without the Scout acquisition, we would have expected a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15.5%.
I'll close by thanking our amazing customers, partners, and employees for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results in the third quarter and have set us up for a strong finish to the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thank you very much, and congrats on the results. Aneel, I am curious of you're seeing any material difference in the volume of HCM projects that are presenting themselves if you were to look within the Fortune 500 are the Global 2000 today versus, say, 12 or 18 months ago, whether there's a natural cycle there that kind of ebbs and flows over time? Also, looking way out into the future is there a timeframe where you think that that volume would converge in financials, perhaps five to 10 years down the road? So, I think our growth in the pipeline, and I'll ask Chano to weigh in, in a second, for HR it's actually been fairly steady over the last, not just 12 to 18 months, but last three or four years. This was another strong quarter in terms of Fortune 500 wins and Fortune 2000 wins. As we get to -- as we begin to close in on over 50% of the Fortune 500 running Workday, we're on that path to get there. We do look at the broader Fortune 2000 marketplace for HR, and we look at more of the international opportunities in front of us, still a lot of healthy growth in front of us. For finance, and I'll just bucket everything else because in many ways the rest, finance, planning, now procurement and Prism are really about the office of the CFO.
That business continues to grow at a rate north of 50% as we see it's 20% of the business, and I think there's durable growth in that business for many years to come. I would hope in five years that that business is on par -- within five years that business is on par or bigger than the HR business; it just takes time. And I would point you to the transition that Salesforce went through. They're six years older than us, one of our best partners. They went from being a sales company to and services company, to a sales and service and marketing company adding Platform, now they've got Analytics. We're going through that same journey and growth rates kind of ebb and flow as the different pillars take off. So, very optimistic on what we continue to see as continuing growth in HR, but healthy growth rates in the office of the CFO.
Anything you want to add, Chano? Mark, and to give you an idea, a data point, this Q3 we closed six Fortune 500 HCM [ph] financial customers, a year ago it was four. To give another data point, the pipeline on the Fortune 500 or large customers, more than Fortune 500, large HCM customers for the next 12 months is better or stronger than it was 12 months ago. That's another data point. So it's not a direct correlation that some of those pending customers, 175, give or take, Fortune 500 customers are still coming to market, and it's not exactly basically directly linear every single quarter as they come. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thanks very much. I was wondering if you could follow-up on Chano's comment around the pipeline, and just sort of what's the expectations I guess -- I realize this is a preliminary there for '21, but is there anything I guess do you expect that the financials demand will remain kind of the way we've seen it or is there opportunities for that to sort of tick up. I'm just trying to get a sense on, I guess, what's embedded in that number, especially around sort of the financials business, because I think we understand the HR business is -- where that's trending these days. Thanks. So, we've got another quarter to get through, but I think as we think about fiscal year '21, cautiously optimistic that all the pieces are coming into place. Planning, and by the way I should mention, we're actually hosting the meeting from Adapter's headquarters, in Palo Alto, today, which is a nice thing and a fun thing, but planning and analytics, and now with procurement, all the pieces are coming together to I think drive a really exiting story. And so nothing else -- I don't expect the momentum to slow down. And maybe there's a chance it ticks up, time will tell. It's a good question to ask us in a quarter. Okay. And maybe if I could just ask a quick follow-up on that point then, coming away from Rising it seemed like the combination obviously of having analytics and planning and financials together makes that entire decision more strategic for CFOs. And I was wondering if you could just add some color, Aneel, on whether or not that actually is what you're seeing in your conversations, meaning it's getting beyond just sort of moving your financial system to the cloud is becoming much more of a strategic imperative. And is that kind of why you feel still very confident about where this is going? Thanks. Absolutely, I would say before planning and analytics really took off for Workday we had a very competitive financial offering, and I think two things were at play. One, the CFO market in general wasn't ready to move into the cloud. And number two, just having a next generation accounting platform or financial platform was necessary, but insufficient. The areas of planning and analytics, that's really what drives CFO decisions today, but they also realize that they do need to modernize their accounting systems from a financial transformation perspective.
So all of a sudden now it is not just, hey we have to modernize it from a technology platform perspective, but look at all the benefits we get from a planning perspective, from an analytics perspective, and yes, even from a core accounting perspective what we can do in terms of machine learning, what we can do in terms of tagging so that you can create richer analytics. All those come to play. The story is just much stronger going into this year than it ever has been. And I think the last piece that has come more and more recently have been a area of procurement and the chief procurement officer, and with the acquisition, or the pending acquisition of Scout, we're filling that one hole where we can be best in class in that pillar which is increasingly important to the office of finance. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thank you very much. Aneel, it looks like the trends in the quarter were certainly very encouraging. Linearity improved, your backlog growth was pretty solid, and the market certainly seems to be wide open for financials and whatnot. So I'm just curious what are the factors that could cause you to take up an even more positive view of the company's growth expectation in fiscal '21, say certain things happen in Q4 that materialize, what could cause you to take an even more positive view, as positive as it is? And secondly, as the company becomes multi-product company, how is the go-to-market strategy of the company going to change? Thank you so much. I'll take the first part and ask Chano to weigh in on the second part. What could we see in Q4 and going into next year? I'd say an increasing percent of Fortune 500 accounts coming to market for financials. We've, after waiting for a long time; they're now coming at a steady pace. What we saw in HR, there was a period of time where it accelerated. If that happened with Finance then I could see us being more optimistic. When I look at our win rates they're very high, and when I look at the pipeline growth it's very healthy. The ones that move the needles and are unpredictable are the large Fortune 500 transactions. And those started coming in in bigger numbers that would improve our opportunity for upside. Is there anything you want to add Chano on go-to-market and any other comments on that? Hey, Kash. And on go-to-market, I think we highlighted data at our financial analyst day. I think you should expect kind of three big focus; one around more dedicated vertical focus in the coming years, and second one; continue to global expansion and the opportunities we highlighted there with only around 11% penetration on the Global 2000, and the third one, an increased focus on we're selling to back to the customer base especially with the broader portfolio of solutions that we have today. And if I could add one more piece of potential upside, when we acquired Adaptive a little over a year ago, we were focused on financial planning. But as they move into workforce planning, sales planning, operational planning there's upside there in terms of providing a broader planning footprint, which we frankly hadn't really thought about a year ago. Thank you, so much. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Yes, one question just on Prism, and then one on the macro. In regards to Prism, can you provide an update at all in terms of the cadence that the business is starting to experience, the new use cases around Prism, Analytics, and then maybe any feedback you can share with us in terms of the growth rate or maybe the shape of that overall size of the business today. And then the macro question I wanted to give you, Aneel, just kind of when you're thinking about the puts and takes of all of next year's guidance that Robynne guided to in the commentary. Do you think that the overall environment, are you expecting the environment to be stronger, to be weaker, or similar to what the business experienced this year? Thanks. So, that's a lot of questions in there. On the first one, Prism stated out as a very powerful analytic platform that came pre-populated with effectively the Workday data model and the Workday data, and then we'd bring in other types of data, and customers would write their queries and analytics against that. What we saw were a series of trends that pointed us in terms of building out use cases, and the first one was People Analytics. And People Analytics is being received extraordinarily well by our customers. They view us as, ""Hey, that's a great platform in terms of Prism analytics, but you're an applications company, give us some applications capability."" And with People Analytics we're delivered on that. You can expect the same over time on Financial Analytics, Spend Analytics, additional prepackaged set of analytics that are being informed by watching our customers and working with our customer to see what use cases they deliver.
Robynne, do you want to comment on the growth on Prism, that was another part of the question? And then I'll come back to the macro. Yes, we're still seeing healthy growth on Prism. The numbers are still fairly small relative to core fins [ph] and HCM. So it's not hugely moving the needle on our growth, but we expect that with the high growth rates in Prism it'll start contributing more to the overall growth next year. On your macro question, we're just looking at each other here. I think we're kind of expecting it to be the way it is. There has been for a period of time, there's just been uncertainty in the air. It's hard to say it's going to get worse or going to get better. It's not easy to predict, we have the election next year, but I think what we see in the pipeline, even with the uncertainty, our ability to close business. Q3 was a really important data point. We had some concerns there might be some slowdown, but we had a really good quarter and the business that we wanted to close closed. So I'd go into Q4 optimistic. And to next year, I would say next year cautiously optimistic that it's going to be the same. And I think that's probably -- I think the world I just getting immune to uncertainty, and people are just going about their business as if it's going to continue in the right direction and ignore the headlines in the press that would generally get us scared five or six years ago. Thank you for answering all those questions. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter also. Can I give us some more color on the types of companies that are selecting Workday Financials at this point, the markets, whether they're single country versus global financial implementations, and how that is changing? And also a quick follow-up, can you give us a sense of how the backend technology integration of Adaptive is going? Thanks. So, Chano will take the first one on, and then maybe Tom Bogan can take on the second part. On the company selecting financials are mostly global companies, mainly on the sectors we are more focused on, and those are financial services, healthcare, professional and business services, among others. Clearly it's U.S. and Western Europe or most advanced in terms of financials cloud customers are the ones what you see more predominantly. But I would say it's mainly with a global focus in, I don't know, I would say 80% of the deals that we do are basically with a global footprint, taking advantage as well of our localizations on the strength of the solution as a whole. Yes, on the technology integration we're making very good progress. At the time of the acquisition we indicated that it would be a journey that would take us roughly 24 months to complete the full integration. Our design focus is to have an experience where customers have a seamless experience whether they're starting inside the core Workday applications or they're starting inside the planning experience. We have a design group of a set of customers who have worked very closely with us, helping to guide our development efforts and initiatives. We still have some work to do, but we're really pleased with the progress thus far. Excellent, thank you. Your next question comes from line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Can you guys hear me? Yes, we can. Great. Thanks for taking the call, and great to see the permit here exiting the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the strategy with professional services into FY '21, and should we expect a change in the mix of the business contribution over time there? Thank you. No, I think our strategy has been the same for the last four or five years once the large integrators embraced Workday. We tended to take a backseat to them running the projects. That's the Accentures, KPMGs, PwCs, Floyds, IBMs of the world, elites of the world, we have -- those are probably the big six. Is there anybody I missed, it can trouble now. Those are the big six. They have become very good partners over the period of time. And so, our professional services is very focused on being the product experts that basically supplement those large firms on the large scale projects and a handful of cases there'll be a customer that just wants to deal with one vendor and work they will do the do the prime work on the implementation side as well, but that is not our core strategy. Our core strategy is to leverage the great partnerships we have. There is just a huge demand for Workday skills right now in particular as financials and planning and prison have taken off. We had to supplement the market as they're ramping up their skills in those areas. But no change the strategy or the model? Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Scott Berg with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, and I jumped on late, so I apologize if my questions been asked. But first of all, for either Aneel or Chano, with the Scout acquisition, can you help us understand maybe is this a product that helps you maybe change the trajectory or the adoption of financials ultimately, or is this just another way to get a footprint like Adaptive was within these customers, so when they're ready to make these changes to cloud based ERP that you're in a prime position to potentially win that business? So I think actually Adaptive was slightly differently than that. I think in some cases Adaptive is there before us. And a lot of other cases, Adaptive was the reason why we were chosen for the broader financial footprint. As the Office of the CFO or the opposite finance has really turned their attention to moving into the cloud, it's become clear that part of the way they see the financial solution definitely includes best-in-class procurement. And it's why we've seen companies like Cooper continue to do very well have a lot of respect for them. So for us, in order to -- I think it does two things, it creates a new revenue opportunity and down the road, it could even be a standalone revenue opportunity for spend management. But in the short-term, it makes our financial products that much more competitive. And there's new revenue specifically for the Scout product that we believe it's an amazing product and amazing team. And now we get to leverage our sales force in our customer base to see how much more Scout we can sell. So I think there're multiple dimensions to it. One of which is included increasing our competitiveness and core financials, but to also adding some new revenue opportunity for us. Very helpful, thank you. And then from a follow-up perspective, Robynne, you've made a couple of at least for Workday larger acquisitions over the last 18 months between Adaptive and Scout now going forward, but as you look at these acquisitions is, I guess help us get a sense of maybe what the gross margin or operating margin contribution of these acquired assets is longer time, will they be dilutive to the core Workday financial profile, or is there a way that maybe they're additive in terms of raising your margin profile longer term? Thank you. Yes, so I think longer term they're definitely additive because we can operate at a larger scale and so get better economies of scale as we run the larger combined entity that we are, in the shorter term, obviously, they are dilutive, Adaptive was dilutive, Scout will be diluted as I discussed next year, but the goal is that they would actually be additive to our margins longer term. We just had -- there was nothing in their gross margin profiles where that was that different from Workday. It's much more about where they were in their stage of stage of growth, and then we have the ability to leverage our sales channel, but from a gross margin perspective that was not entitled. That's correct. Your next question comes from line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to drill down a little bit into the progress you guys are making in sort of improving and expanding the capability to do upselling into the existing customer base, particularly around ATM. I am just looking for an update on kind of how that's progressing, number one. And number two, for Robynne, really sort of nice upside on margin this quarter. Sounds like a decent part of it was from sort of the pull forward for sort of the push out of marketing expenses, I just want to sort of double check just to make sure, is there any kind of fundamental change in how you guys are thinking about the margin profile and sort of the speed with which you get to that 25%, or is this just really sort of timing impacts in terms of margins? So I'll start with the margin question, really no change in how we think about margin expansion going forward, we certainly expect to continue to march towards the 25% goal that we've set forth. This is really about a couple things this quarter one, the top line over performance, which was driven largely by better linearity, frankly in month one, and we have seen in over five years as a company, so we certainly don't expect that that's going to keep repeating itself, but it was a big win for us this quarter. And then the push out of expenses like I said, in Q4 really is just a timing issue. So we will continue to get margin expansion and see efficiency gains across all areas of the organization going forward including R&D. Excellent. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Aneel, with regards to the financials pipeline, it sounds like, it's growing steadily. I'm wondering what you think it would -- what would need to occur in order for the trajectory, the slope of the growth in terms of that pipeline to really increase. What sort of feedback would we need to get from existing clients in order to get an even higher level of interest? That's the first part of the question. And then the second part of the question is, you made a comment with regards to maybe within five years financials could get to the same level of revenue as HCM. Would that require a slope change or how are you thinking about that? Thank you. Well on the second part, just say we're talking about finances, I am talking about the broader offices of finance solutions. So that does include analytics and that does include planning and prism. And that's the way we think about it internally, not just the core accounting products. It is that full suite is really what is enticing these CFOs to move their plants applications into the cloud, and they're moving all of those collectively into the cloud. In terms of what would change the slope, I mean, I think we see the pipeline is being very, very healthy. And I come back to what I said earlier, it would be a growing percentage of the deals coming from fortune 500 accounts, and that's what propelled Workday on the HCM side where we really went through for the hyper growth era was when the fortune 500 market almost a mass decided to go to the cloud. It's happening now, but it's not happening at the pace that we saw in HR that the market came at once.
So, that would be one thing. I don't know if Chano you want to add anything else? I think Mark, where we share them on a couple of our financial analyst days, where with these local declare between adoption and financial adoption and until now core financials or general ledger was very similar. The difference is that HCM was started more with large customers and the financials adoption has started more with medium enterprise customers. We're seeing more lately maybe because of the maturity of the solution and maturity of the market and confidence into that this brings a good value proposition to the office of the CFO is the some more large customers are starting to move right we mentioned to the customer for WBP or an Asian customers 80,000 grocery customer that just became general ledger customer as well for us on some of the last ones right. So we are expecting from what the pipeline is reflecting that clearly this moving up care, right? What we're seeing as we're when we evaluate that we're selling value in terms of customers in financials is that is increasing nicely representing of course larger customers adopting financials, and that's what we see represented on the pipeline, then we know we will remain a little bit variance quarter per quarter. And I'd add, one area that we're not necessarily counting on for growth, but we're seeing signs of interest and excitement is the state and local market. We've experienced great traction of our financial products and HR products in higher education. The state local market has been much slower for both areas, and with the state of Iowa turning to our products for financial management, that is a nice data point. The states are a huge market. It was a hugely successful market for us at PeopleSoft, and we've been waiting for that market to start moving to the cloud, and hopefully the couple data points we have suggested that might be happening, and that's not something we're really planning on right now. That's great to hear. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for two more questions. The first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to drill little bit into Internet phone market. Could you give us some color, the progress on the Internet outside -- channel, you talked about 40% sales growth outside North America, so just wondering in your fiscal '21 guidance, what are backed into the growth outside of North America? Yes, I think that was more Robynne providing basically the growth of the international market, right. We're pretty pleased with the opportunity in the rest of the world. We're pretty pleased how those markets are growing. I mean, I don't want to set up proxy for every single quarter, but at least usually twice the speed at which we're seeing the growth in our North American markets, which is natural due to the lower penetration. They are that we commented on that 11% of the global 2,000 companies in those markets. We had great performance contributions in Q3 in places like that. That's Germany, Austria, Switzerland, in places like Canada, some good growth in some of the Continental markets in Europe. So, we're pretty pleased how internationally is basically performing these days. We did a couple of leadership changes that will require -- we are much more excited for the potential opportunity and growth that we also see representing on the pipeline going forward. Thank you. We will take our final question from Brad Reback with Stiefel. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks very much. Robynne, if I look at the 20% organic guide for fiscal '21, it would seem to imply a mid-teens HCM growth rate. So, I'm trying to figure out how much of that natural be selling the business versus conservatism? Thank you. Yes. So, a couple things there, as I talked about during Analyst Day, right, our exit rate for the HCM growth is 20%. That certainly will fluctuate throughout next year, given the large deal activities as Aneel talked about. So, that's one thing. Also, we have a really big Q4 ahead of us to close, and that Q4 business will have an impact on next year, so it's still very early days. So, we look forward to getting back to you with an update on next year and next earnings call. Perfect. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Workday's Q3 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO; and Tom Bogan, our executive vice president of the business planning unit . this call is being simultaneously webcast .",0.0

With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter fiscal year '20 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter, ending the year with significant momentum in position as well as we enter fiscal year '21. Our success continues to be driven by the relentless dedication of our workmates and by our forward thinking customers who expect more from their enterprise applications, and who continue to use Workday as their partner for their finance and HR cloud transformations. We now have over 3200 customers and our commitment to their success is demonstrated by our 97% customer satisfaction rate and broad reference-ability.
In Q4, we saw healthy demand across all product areas. Starting out with Workday HCM, we had another strong quarter as we continue to be the market leader with our differentiated suite of products. In total, we added 11 new Fortune 500 customers, almost equalling our best every quarter and now have 45% of the Fortune 500 as HCM customers, including 60% of the Fortune 50. We also added 16 new Global 2000 customers and now have almost 20% of the Global 2000. New customers includes Spanish multinational bank BBVA, Southwest Airlines and Wells Fargo Bank. New HCM go lives in Q4 included Natwest Group, Banco Santander and Prudential Company of America as we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production.
Switching over to our financial management applications Q4 was our best quarter ever. We added a record number of core financial management customers, including KeyBanc, Beth Israel Lahey Health, Dun and Bradstreet, and West Virginia United Health System. In addition to the strong growth from our core financial applications, we saw continued momentum from our expanding suite of products that support the Office of the CFO. Both Workday and Prism Analytics and the adaptive insights business planning cloud had outstanding quarters. We added over 100 new Prism customers and over 350 planning customers, which includes over 100 on a broader Workday platform.
Our new workmates of Scout RFP had an excellent initial quarter as well, with strong momentum on sourcing opportunities, both standalone and as part of Workday fund management offerings.
We believe the depth and breadth of our cloud-based finance products in combination with our industry leading HCM suite, Workday, Prism Analytics, adaptive insights, business planning, cloud and expanding spend management offerings with Scout RPF delivers a global solution that is highly differentiated and helps to empower business leaders to plan, execute, analyze, and extend all in one system, powered by machine learning.
Switching to the people fund. A key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end, we are proud of our recent recognitions as Fortune A Great Place to Work announced their 100 Best Companies to Work For list ranking Workday as number five. This is the sixth consecutive year that Workday has made the list and the third year in a row that we've been in the top 10. Being great place to work is something that Dave and I have prioritized since day one. So it's an honor for Workday to be on these prestigious list.
As we look forward to fiscal year '21 and beyond, we are relentlessly focused on innovation and expect to see continued momentum from our growing family of applications. We're confident in the pipeline we have built on the sales execution while we have in place. As such we expect fiscal year '21 to be another strong year of growth. We continue to invest heavily in our company culture and our value system and have a great group of employees committed to delivering the highest levels of customer satisfaction to our great customers.
I'll turn it over to our CFO and Co-President, Robynne Sisco. Over to you Robynne? Thanks Aneel and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter capped a strong year driven by solid execution across the company. We not only added a record number of net new HCM and fins customers our high levels of customer satisfaction continued to drive 95 plus percent gross renewal rates as well as strong add on sales to existing customers.
Subscription revenue was 840 million in Q4 and 3.1 billion for the full year representing growth of 25% and 30% respectively. Professional services revenue came in at $137 million for Q4 and 531 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue outside the US increased 33% year over year to 244 million representing 25% of total revenue. We see a significant global opportunity ahead and expect that our revenue mix from the rest of the world markets will continue to increase over both the near and longer term.
Subscription revenue backlog was 8.29 billion at the end of the fourth quarter growth of 23% year over year. Backlog growth was driven by healthy net new bookings add on business and strong renewals with our net retention, once again over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was 5.48 billion growth of 22%. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was 117 million or 11.9% of revenue with the margin over achievement, primarily driven by our top line outperformance. For the year our non-GAAP operating profit increased 66% to 484 million or 13.4% of total revenue up more than 300 basis points from FY '19 as we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our business.
Operating cash flow for Q4 was 297 million bringing our operating cash flow for the full year to 865 million or 43% growth. This strong performance was driven by a combination of operating margin expansion and exceptionally strong collections in Q4. We successfully added and integrated more than 1,650 net new employees to Workday this year, including approximately 150 from the Scout RFP acquisition in Q4, bringing our total employee count at year end to over 12,200. Overall, we're very pleased with a strong companywide execution in our seasonally most important quarter.
Now let me turn to guidance. We entered the year with considerable momentum and we see significant opportunity ahead to support both our near and long-term growth aspirations while continuing our progression towards 25% plus percent non-GAAP operating margins. We are raising our FY '21 subscription revenue guidance to a range of 3.755 billion to 3.770 billion representing year over year growth of 22% at the high end. As a reminder, Scout is expected to add less than one percentage point to our overall subscription revenue growth in FY '21.
For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue to be between $873 million and $875 million representing 25% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription revenue to sequentially increase from the previous quarter by just under 6% in Q2, approximately 4% in Q3, and 4.5% in Q4.
As we continue to expand our product portfolio, we want to provide investors with increased visibility into the growth sectors across our business. At our Analysts Day last October, we provided incremental disclosure around our HCM and Fins Plus businesses. As we look into fiscal '21, our current full year guidance assumes high teens HCM subscription revenue growth and low 40% growth in our Fins plus business. We do not plan to provide quarterly updates to these numbers but we'll revisit them annually.
On the professional services front, we continue to value and support a growing systems integrator ecosystem. Our partners are seeing robust growth in their workday practices, and we will continue our tight alignment with them to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.
We're expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $137 million in Q1 and $580 million for FY '21.We expect FY '21 professional services margins to be flat from FY '20 as we continue to invest in programs to support customer deployments, and to sustain our high levels of customer satisfaction.
Based on our current outlook, we expect total subscription revenue backlog growth in the low 20s for the first three quarters of FY '21 moderating to the high teens in Q4 against a very tough comp. We are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year to 14.5%. As a reminder, our margin guidance includes roughly 150 basis points of dilution from the Scout RFP acquisition.
We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 15% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people for annual compensation process. The gap margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26 to 27 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. We expect operating cash flow in FY '21 to be approximately $1.08 billion representing growth of 25%. The FY '21 non debt tax rate is 19%.
We continue to invest in our real estate footprint at our Pleasanton headquarters to support our continued growth. In FY '21 we expect approximately $230 million of owned real estate investments, which includes the potential purchase of a five building complex that we are currently occupying. We expect to spend an additional $350 million in FY '21 to support our other capital needs, including investments in customer data centers, leased facilities, and corporate IT infrastructure to support our continued business expansion.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver great results this past year.
We are still in the early stages of executing against our long-term vision as a company, but our progress wouldn't be possible without shared goals. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. And congrats on a very strong finish. I wanted to inquire about the corona virus situation. We certainly understand that there's no reason you would be experts on this, but we had seen the headlines about changes to your sales kickoff and I'm just wondering, what you are seeing from your customers, whether they are pulling out of conferences or restricting travel or, having employees work from home, if they visited Italy or Southeast Asia and just at a high level, whether, any disruption, kind of seems manageable to you through this fiscal year or whether it's just too hard to gauge that. Yeah, it's still early and we're not experts, as it relates to the sales kickoff. I, and I think the rest of the team didn't think the risk was very high in the US but our Asia PAC folks could not attend. And then with the outbreak in Italy and we actually had a joint meeting with some of the UK and Italy team, we felt like just the US team that's not really inclusive enough not really the way Workday would go forward with a global sales kickoff meeting. So we're going to wait until we can get all the people together in person. After this outbreak gets past us. In the meantime we're going to do things virtually. I think in the US though right now it still feels like mostly business as usual. Okay, great. Just as a quick follow up. I was wondering if you could just comment on how far reaching your ambitions are going to be in procurement and whether you think in the long run it could be possible to replicate the kind of success you've had in recruiting. I think it took you five years to go from zero to number one market share in the Fortune 500 there. I'm just curious whether you see that type of potential in that market? There's definitely a ton of potential. And as we've gotten smarter about the spend management market and particular with Scout RFP, first of all, they had a great first quarter as part of Workday really a great team. But the dollars that flow through sourcing are just massive. Even at Workday, the amount of money that goes through the procurement organization is huge.
And I do think there's a chance to build a differentiated solution in the short term that is more, Scout as a standalone solution plus as part of our suite. But over time you can see our procurement suite B be a best in breed, best in class suite. And I think the markets only going to grow and it's a really exciting market opportunity for us. Can I mimic recruiting? Time will tell. I think what it can do is be a great, a great driver of financial sales. I think financial sales can be a great driver of the spend management marketplace and every company on the planet has to manage their spend effectively. So it's, it is a truly global opportunity. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Aneel I know that you sounded just a little cautious about the, the slowing HCM business. I'm curious, given the particular strength in the quarter, are we doing more of a smoother ending with the HCM business showing obvious strengths in the quarter. And also you could talk to the network effects or the platform effect or you are able to sell financial deals to existing HCM customers that have been very successful. And one for you Robynne, should we stop looking at billings counted as deferred revenue change and instead focus on your backlog because that calculation of bookings comes up at 28% and it has been more predictable more consistency. Is that the right way to look for indicator of your business. Thank you very much. So on a on the HCM market, we had a great fourth quarter. We had 11 Fortune 500 accounts, the second best quarter we've ever had as a company. So the large enterprise market is alive and well for HR. But, we continue to gain and see growth in the medium enterprise business for HR and there's still a ton of greenfield opportunity in that medium enterprise market across the globe. So, as we head into this year, I think we're thinking about high teens growth for HR.I think that's what we've been forecasting. And I think it's going to hold up. I'm not necessarily focused on the next 12 months, I think longer term, we'll just have to understand, how that market matures and what we can do to come up with more add-ons to continue the growth in that marketplace?
No question that the suite market is picking up today. I think one of every four customers has both product lines. And what we saw in the fourth quarter for another quarter was a bunch again, of financial first customers and that's a great sign for us. That means our financial products are winning on a best of breed basis, even without the leverage from the HR marketplace. And I still think for the foreseeable future, large enterprises or the mega enterprises, they will buy HR and finance separately. They're just -- that's just the way they've done it historically, with the medium enterprise increasingly is buying HR and finance together. And that's a really powerful trend for us. And Kash to your second question. Yeah, we absolutely do believe that looking at subscription revenue backlog is a better indicator of our performance and billings are deferred revenue. Keep in mind, however, that there's several factors that influence the bookings calculation, including renewal volume duration. So the quarterly bookings count can vary widely from actual ACB net bookings as we discussed at Analysts Day. We've been saying all along that this would be a back end loaded year for us and that's exactly what's played out which has led to the high growth in the bookings number as you noted. Wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Thanks very much. I'll echo that congratulations on a good quarter and finish to the year. Aneel, just on the financial side talking to your partners healthcare seems to be one vertical. And I think you mentioned a couple companies on your prepared remarks. That's seems to be taking up some steam for you all. Can you just discuss that a little bit and when you think in this fiscal year '21, maybe in addition maybe to healthcare are there any other verticals you feel that are starting to pick up some momentum for you in that area? Thanks. So we did have a good year and quarter and health care but we also had a very strong year and quarter in financial services. And I think that is a really key market for us and of course KeyBanc was a big win for Workday that's a huge bank, well respected bank and they already worked the HR customer, it was great to see them buy Workday Financials, I think Financial Services is the next market. We've had good success in government I think you'll see that continue. And I think you'll see Business Services be another great market for us with financials, but candidly it was strong across the board. It was the best quarter we've ever had for financials. The best quarter we ever had for adaptive planning business insights. It was not only their best quarter growth accelerated in the fourth quarter for the planning products. And that was, it's a testament to the fact that the office of the CFO is looking at planning analytics and transactions together and want a unified system and our message is resonating. So it's resonating to all types of companies. And then if I just ask one quick follow up along that same lines where you were just talking about, you know, when you think about sort of selling and the Office of the CFO, are your partners aligned with you now in terms of being able to go in there with, you know, both planning and financials to have, you know, a little bit of a broader base discussion? Because it seems like that's where the market wants to go. I was just kind of curious. I know you all are there, but you think your partner base is with you at this point. Chano, you want to comment on that? Thank you, I will. Hi, Kirk. Definitely they are, I mean the interest on our partners in terms of enabling training resource fees, both in implanting and now in procuring has been increasing significantly. We're pretty happy now with our vertical strategy as well that it's much easier to align towards the go to market for our partners. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks so much and I'll let go of my congratulations on a great finish to the year. I wanted to ask a question, a competitive question of perhaps Aneel or Chano specifically relative to Oracle because while we're all very familiar with your success replacing legacy HR systems, we more recently picked up a couple of significant Oracle HCM cloud displacements, which stood out to us just because this is their current generation product. Can you give us a sense of how prevalent these conversions are and what might be in common when you come across them? I'm not going to comment on how prevalent they are. I would just say that as it relates to all of our legacy competitors, they were slow to move to the cloud. They have not had the success on the deployment side. They might've done a good job on some of the sales opportunities, but the deployment side hasn't worked out. And so those, those accounts come back to market. And that's happened with Oracle accounts. It's happened with SAP accounts. And what we hang our hat on is a great experience for our customers first and the deployment. And then once they're in deployment in their production phase, and that's how customers measure the success of these projects. It's not about what they buy, it's what they get live and what they get value from. And that's going to continue to be the case. Thanks so much. And if I can follow up with one for Robynne. I just wanted to check on the variability from your preliminary view of 14% non-GAAP op margin in '21 to now 14.5%. What areas in the business gave you the flexibility? Can you speak to the levels of investment into Scout or is it sales and marketing? How should we think about that? Thanks. Yeah, so our raise in the margin guide is really the top line over performance in the business in Q4 and running that through the year and the raise in the guidance that we had for sub revenue, but we do expect to continue to get efficiencies across all areas of the business. But one of the things you're going to see this year and going forward, which is different is given our scale, we do expect to start getting efficiencies out of R&D in FY '21 and beyond even as we continue to incrementally invest in our products. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Ms. Bellini can you check to see if your line is on mute. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Hi, this is Josh Baer on for Keith. There's been a couple of large acquisitions in the HCM space recently and I'm just wondering how you expect those changes in the market to impact the competitive environment for you in HR. I think the two are probably Cornerstone and Saba. I don't really see any impact on us. We have displaced both of those learning products over time. I don't really see anything except upside for Workday on that one. As relates to Kronos and Ultimate time will tell. I have a lot of respect for Aaron. I respect for the Ultimate team. I think bringing together two companies of that scale and that in different cultures is not an easy thing to do. But again, you know, Aaron is a proven excellent CEO. The Ultimate team was strong. So time will tell it's definitely not a negative. There'll be some disruption that could gives Workdays some benefits. Yeah. But we're not going to count on that. Great. That's helpful. And I'm just wondering do you anticipate any disruption from canceling your - the in person sales kickoff conference? No, we'll replicate as much of it as we can. Virtually and at the appropriate time we'll get the people together in person. There will be in person meetings across the globe, it just will not involve travel and that what we want to do is minimize that while we're in this time of uncertainty, minimize that plane travel. And I should say international plane travel.
But you'll see clusters of folks getting together in all parts of the US as we do this virtually. I don't know Chano if you want to add anything. No, nothing to add. We're really excited about the virtual experience that we are creating for our colleagues across the world, as well in Saudi EMEA offices they will be getting together and we're pretty positive we can deliver most of the content enablement and the strategy that we have to do there for you to know that we are creating. I actually think there's no silver lining in a virus that that's affecting so many lives, but it's going to cause us to learn how to do things on a virtual basis that frankly, we haven't thought about before. And I think that will be something we'll learn and use in the future. That's really interesting. Are there any costs that are shifting around associated with that or is it not big enough to show up in a meaningful way. Not really. Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Hello, thanks for taking questions. Just hoping, wondering if you get a little bit color on international performance this quarter. Any specific geos of outperformance, and then just which areas you're most excited about for FY '21. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for your question international remains a very big focus for us. And we continue to see healthy subscription growth out of the international markets. I mean, we still great growth in terms of net new in Q4 in terms of the areas mainly to highlight I would say I would say our DACH which are Germany, Austria and Switzerland markets as well as some of the continental markets did great performance. Our A&Z region. In the other side, Australia, New Zealand were some of the markets and maybe I would like to highlight in Q4, but overall we still have healthy subscription net new ACV growth in Q4. But any new areas to focus on for FY '21. From a geographical perspective, nothing of relevance to highlight. I mean, we're considering into the Mexican market during this year, but that was the basically more a market that we will be developing going forward FY '22 and onwards. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hi, this is Luv Sodha on for Brent too. I wanted to ask maybe, it was impressive to me that you saw Prism Analytics becoming part of the net adds. Maybe you could talk about what you saw specifically in terms of deal flow in that and what it represents for the future. We saw a hundred new accounts at Prism Analytics this past quarter, which is a really strong showing again for a relatively young, a new product area. I think as we bring out more specific solutions like people analytics, then we'd go into finance analytics and spend analytics. I think it's going to be even more powerful. But the idea that you can plan, execute, analyze in one system and not have to worry about how data goes back and forth between the different systems and can do it in a real time basis. You know, it's resonating. And as a result, people look at Prism as a really great extension to gain, not just better transformation from the business process side, but better insight into their business. And then quick follow up if I may, on the Workday cloud platform, was wondering if, what the customer feedback has been and when, if when would become generally available for deployment. The customer feedback's been very positive. As we get ready, I'd say, stay tuned you'll hear about our general availability fairly soon. In the coming quarters, we are very focused on a set of repeatable use cases that we discovered in terms of working with our first wave of customers. And we're just making sure that the platform is really ready for prime time with those set of use cases. So just stay tuned. You'll see it fairly shortly. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for getting me on. Just wanted to ask on the vertical strategy of core financials, it seems like some of the efforts that you've put forward, especially in healthcare and financial services, yielded some nice results in your fiscal '20. Any plans or update on additional protocols that you plan to work on building out over fiscal '21. Hi Matt this is Chano speaking, as Aneel mentioned healthcare has been vertical we've now been working for the last three or four years highly successfully on the back of inventory management as a unique value proposition and then purely customers taking onto financials and HCM on top off education and government is another vertical we're being long-term time now. And the latest to our financial services where as you say, we are seeing single success with customers like KeyBanc and some others on the back of our accounting center solution. Aneel also mentioned you know professional business services becoming another significant one that we're going to stop talking from the go to market perspective and a product perspective as to this year. Just one follow up. Have those vertical efforts resulted in larger enterprises, whether it being signed or are in the pipeline in those specific verticals that you've put that effort into? Yes, definitely. When we are setting our vertical strategy, as it says on the back of unique value propositions that we have a good product, and the strategy for it and then we put our go to market efforts in terms of aligning toward our customers, I guess you're right of saying that is pursuing more value and customers with financial solution offerings to those verticals and customers. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks. Maybe two for Robynne. Robynne, just to start the growth rate of deferred revs and the growth rate of your subscription revenue backlog have been relatively similar through the first three quarters of the fiscal year just ended. But in the fourth quarter, DR grew by 18% backlog by 23, so the gap widened a little bit. I just want to ask you what might have happened in terms of invoicing duration or anything interesting around contract structure maybe more backend loaded deals, something that might have caused that spread to widen a little bit. Thank you. Yeah, Karl. There's no really one thing for us to point to I mean, these metrics are going to vary with occasionally deferred revenue growth being above sub revenue. And sometimes it being backlog, sometimes it being below. As you mentioned, it really does vary with invoicing and contractual terms and renewals. So, don't read anything into the difference in those growth rates. And you'll continue to see some disconnects in those going forward just based on contractual invoicing terms. Yep. Okay. Got it. And then my second one for you Robynne is thank you for the beginning of fiscal year guidance around the seasonality and subscription revenue growth, when we look at it and try to compare it to the sub revs growth seasonality you experienced in the last couple of years, it's a little bit tricky, given that you've had some acquisitions that might have distorted that. So do you mind just taking a moment and just maybe qualitatively reflecting on how seasonality might be changing in fiscal '21 on the revenue growth line. Thank you. Yeah, I think the one thing I would point out is we got an interesting dynamic in Q1 when we look at sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 this year, and there's really two things behind that. First of all, Q4 linearity within the quarter was actually more pronounced than what we've seen in FY '20. And so that's going to increase the step up in revenue from Q4 to Q1. And then layering on top of that is the fact that we are in the Leap Year and so we get one extra day of revenue recognition in Q1 as well. And so that's changing the sequential dynamics from Q4 to Q1 and then also from Q1 to Q2. That's really the only thing that I would point out as being different this year. Yep. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Robynne. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon let me add my congratulations with regards to the strong end of the year. Obviously, this is occurring real time and it's very fluid, but I'm just wondering to what extent, COVID-19 ended up being factored into the guidance. And, there have been other periods of uncertainty that we've gone through together, over the years. Just wondering how you think that ends up playing out. I know, it's obviously this is different, but how are you thinking about how it could end up impacting things? And then I've got a couple of vertical questions. So Mark, we really approach guidance this year the same way that we have every single year, right. And so we think we've provided, realistic based on what we know today. We today to date have not seen an impact to our business so far. But as you mentioned, it's really early in the situation, we're going to continue to monitor and we'll obviously update you as we go through the year. Great. And then with regards to financial? Sometimes you give us client counts and you've had some really nice wins. Can you talk a little bit about like KeyBanc who you ended up beating out? Key reasons why they went with you and I think there's a few other companies within the Fortune 500 that you ended up winning within financials over the recent few months. Just the progress that you're seeing there. Well, you know, without getting into the deal by deal basis, the two major competitors we see on everything are SAP and Oracle for financials. The more cloud centric opportunities favor Workday. And if there's a second one we see it's Oracle. The more cloud such people are looking at it, SAP tends to fall away. So we will have to talk account by account. As the cloud continues to mature in the finance marketplace, I think we'll see more of Oracle than we will of SAP. Great. And any update on the number of clients on financials now. We did 90 in the quarter, which was most adds ever in any given quarter. So we were really pleased with that result. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to touch a little bit on the success that you guys have had with planning. You gave some stats in the quarter about how many customers you've added. I guess if you could share with us kind of, if you would since the acquisition, if you could tell us kind of the number of customers, if you could kind of give that to us on a cumulative basis if you have it. So just as you know, if you could give us a sense as you look to this year, how you think about the growth of this add on, you know, and the penetration you're seeing into your installed base, right. If you can, you've given up some stats in the past about like payroll penetration into the install base and learning and things like that and just wondering if you could share with us kind of the momentum you're seeing there with the planning product. Thank you. Heather, this is Tom and we continue to see excellent progress. You know, with our planning products, I don't have exact customer number but it's well over a thousand new customers that we've added and that's a combination of customers that we're selling planning first as well as customers that we're selling into the Workday install base. I'd say that it's, we're very pleased with the progress we've made, particularly with larger enterprise customers both as they look at financial planning and for course planning applications as well. So, you know, six quarters into the acquisition, I think we're really pleased with the progress. There continues to be significant opportunity in the Workday install base in terms of selling, planning into that base as well as penetration both for large enterprise and middle enterprise customers. And just if I may, just one quick follow up, any commentary on kind of are you typically seeing greenfield opportunities, legacy opportunities or is it head to head versus kind of a newer companies such as Anaplan? We see both. I think there are customers who are converting from legacy on premise solutions and they want a cloud solution for planning. And they are typically coming from an Oracle or an SAP solution. There are also customers who have used we see spreadsheets in many parts of their enterprises, even if they have a legacy planning solution. But model and business logic is in spreadsheets and we're a great solution to bring that bring that planning process into the cloud. So it's typically Anaplan or Oracle for our cloud competes and we have we do exceptionally well in those competes. Thank you. If I could just add two things in my prepared remarks I mentioned 350 new planning customers for the fourth quarter that was really an outstanding performance and the growth rate for the business planning cloud is significantly faster than the rest of the Workday. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess Aneel, when do you think about the durability of the growth rate in your HCM business and you think about the tailwinds there, maybe even beyond next year, but over a longer time duration which is going to add more of a growth tailwind in your mind? Going down market and seeing kind of continued success there selling into the base or new additional functionality that we haven't seen yet? I would definitely say the biggest opportunity, at least in my mind is bringing the medium enterprise solution to the rest of the world. We've been doing that in the past 12 months, when we brought the medium enterprise offering, which is a different pricing and packaging and lower cost services. We've taken it to places like the UK. A lot of the rest of the world is a medium enterprise marketplace. So that's, that's a big opportunity. And it's largely a greenfield opportunity. I combine that with we're still largely underpenetrated in almost all parts of the world outside the US where the market was first hot for cloud. So we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity, there's always the ability to sell back into the base. But when landing the new accounts is what drives the longer term growth and durability growth because you need to first land the account before you can sell back into them. And so we're still very focused on that. Chano you want to add anything? No, I think the only thing obviously is kind of the financial class opportunities, but I think it's a combination with those just to recap, new enterprise totally with you Aneel. Selling into the base, we had a very strong record quarter this past Q4 Alex with over 50% growth in add on ACV. That was really good. And clearly me, personally, I'm very excited about the rest of the world opportunity and joining with anyone. That's super helpful. And maybe just as a final one, you know, if we think about the sales tweaks and changes that you make every year around this time, what's the best way to characterize kind of the go forward or the focus areas that you're looking at for 2020 and kind of giving us a bit of a help on the magnitude of the changes made this year versus previous. Alex is a great question. I think we try to always to keep an evolution more than a revolution in our go to market and is supporting our growth opportunities. So if you characterize those changes, clearly one is a verticalization that we talk on our Analysts Day, we've been talking on this call and there is more to support our financial plus opportunity. I think with the strengthening our motion into the selling into the base during last year, I just commented on some of the results in Q4. And you're going to see that going on and happening. And clearly last but not least Aneel is saying extending that medium enterprise and our offering in terms of shorter time to value in the rest of the world with the success we've been seeing in the US. So we've been taking go to market decisions to support some of these growth opportunities and motions, as they say see more on evolution is strengthening the talent that we have in some with the markets we need to do so. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude Workday's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you again for joining us.

And with that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our Co-President and CFO; Chano Fernandez, our Co-President; and Tom Bogan, our Vice Chairman.
Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the Customers page of our website includes the list of selected customers and is updated monthly.
Our second quarter quiet period begins on July 16, 2020. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2020.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's First Quarter FY '21 Earnings Conference Call. Before we get into our results, I want to express my sincere appreciation to our more than 12,000 employees who have responded in such a remarkable way to support one another and our customers during these uncertain times. This team continues to push forward across all areas of our business, and I've never been more proud of them.
As we continue to navigate this period, we have stayed very focused on our core values as our North Star. That means our employees come first, always and without exception. I also wanted to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to our customers, many of whom are on the front line and putting yourself in harm's way every day. Thank you from all of us at Workday.
Over the past few months, we've worked closely with our customers to configure their Workday solutions to help them navigate new challenges and opportunities presented by this current environment. We've also heard from countless customers who, like us, are using Workday to seamlessly close their books 100% remotely for the first time ever. We have health care customers that are relying on Workday to redeploy critical people resources with great agility. And we have heard from our Planning customers who are using our solution to dynamically adjust their financial workforce plans. In fact, in late March, we saw a more than 30x increase in the number of scenario models that our customers were running.
These are just a few examples where Workday has empowered our customers to better navigate this challenging and fluid environment. Just before today's call, we announced one more. Workday and Salesforce have been great partners for a long time and now have countless joint customers. When the pandemic hit, many had to flip to a completely remote workforce overnight, closing offices, schools, services, and more. And others had to turn on a 24/7 team in an instant. Our HCM customers are leveraging the power of the data in Workday as a source of truth to manage their workforces, which has included things like identifying essential workers, deploying people with relevant skill sets, and more. And at the same time, Salesforce has just announced Work.com, which is a powerful platform for organizations to reopen safely and manage the logistics of returning to work. So it only made sense to bring Workday and Work.com together in a way that will simplify things for our customers immensely eliminating the need for reconciliation between various systems and more as they prepare their workforce and return to work safely and securely, and this is just a start.
Now moving on to the business highlights from Q1 beginning with Workday HCM, where the journey to the cloud continued despite the challenging backdrop. In Q1, we were selected as core HCM vendor for one of the largest city governments, the City of Los Angeles. We also welcomed a utility company in EMEA with over 80,000 employees as well as a large insurance company in Asia Pac with over 50,000 employees among the many new HCM customers in the quarter.
Turning to Workday Financial Management. I'm pleased to say that we now have over 900 customers that have selected us as their core financial system. We saw continued momentum in Q1, including a Financials first win, a Fortune 50 company, Fannie Mae. Other new Financial customers included Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government, Okta, as well as a large healthcare company with more than 60,000 employees. Amongst the many Financials go-lives in the quarter, I would like to highlight Lithia Motors and RaceTrac Petroleum.
We also saw solid demand for our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO and the Chief Procurement Officer. On the Planning front, we expanded our partnership with Microsoft, so Workday customers can run Workday Adaptive Planning on Microsoft Azure Cloud. Microsoft became the first Workday customer on Azure as they adopt Workday Adaptive Planning to help them with planning, budgeting, and forecasting.
Scout RFP had a solid first full quarter under Workday with multiple Fortune 500 wins, including its largest-ever transaction with a large health care company and wins at Lowe's and Albertsons. One of the many benefits of the cloud is that we can deploy our customers 100% virtually, and we showcased the strength in Q1 with more than 90 customer go-lives in March and April alone. Quite notably, two of these customers have more than 85,000 employees each: Jardine Matheson in APJ and John Lewis Partnership in EMEA.
Turning to product, we delivered our latest major release in March, which included enhanced Workforce Planning with Workday Adaptive Planning; availability of Workday Assistant, an intuitive chatbot to guide employees; new machine learning-based skills capabilities with Workday HCM to verify current employee skills and supporting reskilling efforts; and new data visualization and benchmarking features with Workday Prism Analytics.
In addition, we made great progress on our extensibility journey. Just this past weekend, we moved our latest offering on Workday Cloud Platform, Workday Extend, to GA. This is a significant milestone for us that we believe further increases our strategic positioning with customers and partners. In addition to our powerful integration capabilities, customers can now build deep extensions from Workday's core applications. As an example, within just a few short weeks, one of our customers built an app on Workday Extend that help facilitate hazard pay to their workers on the front lines.
I'm confident that this period will ultimately serve as a catalyst to accelerate the adoption of our growing platform, supporting HR and finance systems in the cloud. Now more than ever, companies are realizing the incredible importance of having agile, flexible systems to support their mission-critical business processes.
With that, I'll turn it over to our Co-President, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing an update from the field. Before I do that, I would first like to thank our entire go-to-market team for their response to this new selling environment. Though I may be biased, I've long held the belief that we have the best sales team in enterprise software. And I have never been more confident in that belief than right now, having watched our teams engage with and take care of our customers and prospective customers over the last few months.
As Aneel mentioned, there were many highlights in the quarter, including the Financials first win in April at Fannie Mae. Key to signing this deal was Accounting Center, one of our new products that will enable Fannie Mae to account for and analyze their vast loan portfolio.
The medium enterprise team also had another stellar quarter, continuing a multiyear trend we have seen since introduction of our Launch program, a preconfigured deployment approach with a streamlined sales and delivery, which has dramatically reduced the cost to deploy.
In addition, momentum with our back-to-base team continued in Q1. With 50% plus new ACV growth, performance with our back-to-base team spans across customer segments and products, including core fins, Adaptive Planning, Learning and Prism Analytics. The mix of new ACV coming from installed customers has been on the rise for us over the last few quarters. We continue to add resources to better target the growing installed base opportunity, and we expect to continue to lean into this effort in the quarters and years ahead.
We had considerable sales momentum across all areas of the business entering FY '21. However, as COVID-19 forced a lockdown across much of the global economy, we saw higher-than-normal deal pushouts, particularly in industries most impacted, including travel, hospitality and health care. All major geographies were affected, though we saw an earlier impact in our Rest of World markets.
Making the decision to move on to Workday has always been a very important and strategic one for companies and one that is not taken lightly. Given the importance of the decision and the strategic nature of the partnership with our customers, in this uncertain environment, there are companies that are prolonging that decision process as they focus first on assessing and responding to the immediate impacts to their business.
The good news is that based on where we stand today, most of the pipeline impact has been opportunities moving into later periods rather than deals altogether going away, with the largest expected impact to be in Q2 and Q3. It's also important to note we have seen improved prospect engagement since April. We have also seen healthy pipeline growth for FY '22 as opportunities shift from first half to both Q4 and into FY '22.
Finally, we have adapted our messaging and areas of focus by solution and industry, doubling down on the go-to-market motions that we are confident will yield the best returns in these times of uncertainty.
We are in a competitive market, but we feel very confident in our positioning and saw no meaningful changes to competitive dynamics in Q1. In addition, our discounting was in line with historical levels as most customers' negotiations centered around more flexible payment terms to help ease the initial upfront cash burden. We view our customer relations as long-term partnerships, and we are willing to leverage our balance sheet where we think it makes sense.
We strongly believe that this unprecedented environment only strengthens the importance of having a single cloud system to plan, execute and analyze your business. I cannot tell you how many prospects I have spoken with over the last few months who have told me this environment has highlighted how ill-prepared their legacy ERP systems are for rapid change. At the same time, I have also spoken with many of our customers who have told me just how mission-critical Workday has been in helping their business respond to this crisis. And I have heard from many customers currently implementing, we're experiencing a faster and more productive project on a fully remote basis.
There are many potential outcomes that will determine what the pace of recovery will look like, and we expect the environment will remain very fluid throughout FY '21. Yet despite some near-term uncertainty, we are confident that as the recovery takes hold, we're incredibly well positioned to capture on the multi-decade opportunity that we see ahead of us.
With that, I will turn it over to Robynne. Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite a challenging environment, we reported solid first quarter results, which we believe is a direct reflection of the mission-critical nature of our solutions. I'm going to briefly recap our first quarter and provide updated guidance for FY '21, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We had our first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter in Q1 with subscription revenue of $882 million, up 26% year-over-year, and professional services revenue of $136 million, up 10%. The total revenue outside the U.S. was up 30% to $256 million. Subscription revenue backlog was $8.19 billion at the end of the first quarter, growth of 20% year-over-year. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $5.52 billion, growth of 21%.
In Q1, our retention rates continued to be strong with gross retention over 95% and net retention, which includes upselling at the time of renewal, over 100%. As Chano mentioned, our add-on business is growing rapidly, and we see strong sales back into our customer base both during and outside of the renewal process.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $130 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.8%. To help support our employees during these unprecedented times, in April, we paid a onetime cash bonus equivalent to 2 weeks' pay to all our nonexecutive employees. This added $79 million to our first quarter and full year FY '21 expenses, both GAAP and non-GAAP, that was not contemplated in the guidance provided during our Q4 call.
Excluding this onetime bonus payment, our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin would have been 20.6%, well above our guidance, driven by top line outperformance, lower spend on travel, some noncritical program delays and more measured hiring. Q1 operating cash flow was $264 million, growth of 26% year-over-year.
During Q1, we successfully added and integrated approximately 150 net new employees, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to roughly 12,400. And lastly, in April, we closed a $1.5 billion credit facility comprised of a term loan and a revolving line of credit, which we believe strengthens our financial position and provides us greater flexibility as we plan for the future. As of the end of Q1, $500 million of the term loan had been funded. Overall, we're pleased with our results and execution against a very challenging environment.
And now I'll turn to guidance. When we provided our outlook in February, it was very early in the COVID-19 crisis, and we could not yet reasonably predict or quantify the potential impact to our fiscal year. In the 90 days since then, we've started to see an effect on our business on several fronts, including new business bookings, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses and cash collections from customers. The updated guidance we are providing today takes into account these impacts based on what we have observed over the last few months.
Significant near-term uncertainty still remains however, so we are providing wider-than-usual guidance ranges to help take that into account. Built into our revised guidance is the expectation that the pace of recovery will be relatively slow, with Q2 and Q3 being the most challenging periods, followed by a reasonable improvement in Q4.
Before providing our updated outlook, I wanted to make a few high-level comments around our business model. First, we primarily serve the large and medium enterprise market. And although even the largest companies are not immune to the current economic environment, we believe they are better positioned than SMBs to weather this downturn.
Second, while our licensing model is based on the number of workers within our customers' organizations, we have measures in place that help reduce near-term volatility from employment changes. As an example, our contracts are typically only trued up annually to account for increases and decreases in worker counts.
In addition, our contracts have base minimums, which limit our downside. And it is only upon contract renewal, which is typically every 3 to 5 years, that our customers have the opportunity to reset these base levels.
And finally, we are very strategic to our customers, which makes our products incredibly sticky. As a result, while we may see some moderation in retention rates in the near term, likely due to increased bankruptcies and reduction in base worker counts during renewals, we expect that our retention rates will remain high. And we will continue to update you on this metric as we move through the year.
With that as a backdrop, we are lowering our FY '21 subscription revenue estimate to be in the range of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion or 19% growth. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $913 million to $915 million or 21% growth. We now expect professional services revenue to be $500 million in fiscal '21 and $128 million in Q2.
As always, our priority is to support our customers' successful deployment and drive the highest levels of customer satisfaction. In line with these goals, we expect a balanced approach in terms of partner and Workday primes to ensure our partner ecosystem continues to be healthy and active.
For Q2, we expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the mid- to high teens. Given the current uncertainty around net new business, renewal rates and potential changes to contract durations during the remainder of the year, we will only be providing Q2 backlog guidance at this time.
Now moving to margins. We estimate Q2 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 19%. For the full year, we now expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, up from our prior view of 14.5%. This margin improvement reflects our expectation of lower operating expenses versus our original plan, even as we continue to invest and position ourselves to emerge from this period as an even stronger company. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 26 percentage points in the second quarter and 27 percentage points for the full year.
Our FY '21 capital investments guidance, excluding owned real estate, is now $280 million, down from our prior view of $350 million as several large leased real estate projects have been postponed. We currently do not expect to invest any further in owned real estate during FY '21. The FY '21 non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at 19%.
We had strong operating cash flow in Q1, but we have received and continue to receive requests from some existing and new customers for flexible payment terms. As always, customer relationships and customer retention are a top priority for us. During this challenging time, we're committed to providing flexibility to those customers that have been hit hardest by the pandemic so that we can emerge stronger together. Our ability to remain flexible in the area of cash is critical in supporting these goals, and we will therefore cease operating cash flow guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year.
In closing, we are confident in the fundamental strength of our business model, the resiliency of our customer base and in the long-term shift of HR and financial applications to the cloud. We plan to operate with agility while continuing to drive innovation to support sustainable, long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A process. Operator? [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. I hope you all are doing well. Chano, you mentioned that customers are obviously deferring decisions. I don't think that's surprising to anybody. Is that just a matter of just business confidence in sort of managing budgets? And can you talk a little bit about whether or not that conversation is different if you're having an HCM discussion versus a Financials discussion, or it's more -- it's pretty similar across both those product offerings? On the HCM or fins, it's a good question, but I would say that so far, we haven't seen one of these necessarily more or less impacted than the other by COVID. In both cases, there is significant ROI that we deliver to our customers and significant business benefits. But both of these are, as you know, very important systems. And the drivers of the change vary by company and situation. So it could be the need to have more agility or a burning [ph] platform or an executive change, and what we're seeing in our data is that no one area, either HCM or fins, is necessarily more or less impacted in the near term by COVID. In terms of the overall -- sorry, go ahead, Kirk. And if I -- please, you go. No in terms of the overall, I think you asked about the pipeline move if I'm -- am I right? Correct. Yes. Yes. Well, certainly, as we've said on the prepared remarks, our pipeline has definitely moved around. And in some cases, deals push out a quarter or two maybe in the large enterprise and really not significant or no changes in the medium enterprise, but I would say we don't have enough data yet to really call this accurately at this point in time. Definitely, this is something that my team is carefully monitoring. If I could just ask one quick follow-up. You mentioned the back-to-the-base growth was really healthy this quarter. And I was just curious, given the fact that some of your customers might be pushing back bigger decisions for now, are you able to sort of toggle the sales force to focus maybe more on those back-to-base opportunities within your existing customer base? It would seem that the hit rate on those might be a little bit higher until some of the uncertainty dies down. Yes. Thanks to you, Kirk. As you know, we already did significant investments at the beginning of this year to prepare for -- to cover the demand on the back to the base because we have a happy customer base, a great subset with SKU and solutions. So definitely, that demand was already increasing. So we felt ourselves very well prepared for it. And as we said, we had a good growth in that back-to-base customer in Q1, but we also had the same in Q4 as well. So, we feel prepared for that market motion. If I could just add one comment to Kirk's question. We did go through a similar environment with '08 -- in '08, '09, and we really focused in on a couple of things. One was a quick payback for customers and rapid implementation cycles, where we could get HR up and running in 6 months and Financials maybe in a little bit longer than that, and we're just dusting off that playbook and using it again to -- for the net new business. I think that's important to recognize now. It's very similar to '08, '09 from that perspective, and there is a way through it. Our next questions come from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Hope everybody is safe and healthy out there. This is a question for, I think, either Chano or Aneel. One of the things that I get asked a lot by investors is the priority for core HCM and core Financials when we get to the other side of this COVID-19 crisis. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the conversations you're having with your customers on where they think sort of these HCM investments and Financials investments will fall on their kind of priority stack, if you will, once the spending opens up again, once those IT budgets start to get spent again? Well, I think, first and foremost, on the finance side, I think this crisis will be a catalyst for people switching from on-premise into the cloud for finance. And we were already seeing the growth rates but -- the growth rates at healthy levels, but I've talked to lots of CIOs, who said, I wish I had everything in the cloud right now. I am struggling with my on-premise, both because of the labor required and people required to be on site and because those systems are really not very agile or flexible, and we see our customers coming up with new reports with new work streams, all these things that they're able to do in Workday. And so, I think it's going to be a high priority on the finance side.
On HR, HR is going to continue to be healthy. I think what we're going to see is a growing emphasis on the area of skills, the Skills Cloud, Learning, Talent Marketplace. All the areas where we're going to have over 30 million people unemployed, we've got to get these folks back to work, and we got to get them the right skills. And I think a lot of companies are going to be working probably alongside some of the states and local governments to figure out how to get these folks back to work, and that will be right up our sweet spot. Chano, do you want to add anything? No. And then perhaps one follow-up for Robynne. First of all, super cool of you guys to give that bonus to all the employees. I'll hook you up with the Morgan Stanley CFO, and maybe you guys could have a chat. But nonetheless, the full year operating margins still come up versus your prior expectations definitely from what we had in our model. How should we think about like -- and it makes a lot of sense, right? There's no travel going on, and a lot of events are coming out of the equation. How should we think about the durability of that margin gain, of that 16% if you will, as we move our model forward into FY '22? Is that the new base, and then it's going to grow from there or is this more a temporal step-up? Yes. That's a great question, Keith. And it's -- given all of the unknowns that we're facing right now, it's really hard for us to look into FY '22 at this time. And we certainly do plan as we start to see recovery, particularly in Q4 hopefully, that we'll continue to invest in the business. So not sure that this is the new baseline, but we certainly believe that we are showing the value of our business model and how it can leverage as we scale. But we still have a lot of important work to do. And we've got a long term, very massive opportunity ahead of us. So we will continue to invest. Our next questions come from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Hope you and your families are all doing well. I just had 2. I was wondering if you could talk to us about how your salespeople and your partners are kind of dealing with lead gen in this environment, kind of how have they adapted, if there's some stuff you can share with us there on how they might be creative on that front. And then, Robynne, I know this isn't something that you normally comment on anymore, but just given the environment and your comments about 2Q and 3Q being probably the more challenging quarters that you're going to face, any high-level comments even about how to think about unearned revenue trends for the July quarter? Yes, Heather. So I think we definitely expect that unearned will lag behind our backlog growth, right, and will continue to do that. And part of that has to do with the fact that, as Chano and I both mentioned, we're trying to be more flexible on cash, particularly for customers that have been most impacted. And Chano mentioned that a lot of his new customer negotiations, really, that's what they're pushing on. And so we really want to use our balance sheet to help them out during this time.
And so as you know, that will impact the billings and the unearned as well as the cash flow. And you should expect to see that throughout the rest of this year. The good news is that actually doesn't impact our revenue recognition profile, and so we think it's a good investment. And that flexibility has and we believe will continue to allow us to maintain our discounting levels. Heather, in terms of the -- thanks for your question, and I hope you're doing well, keeping healthy, too. In terms of your question on demand gen, our sales team obviously had to pivot during the course of Q1 to a fully virtual environment. But the reality is that we have always had a pretty significant portion of our sales cycle done virtually anyhow, particularly in the presales portion and the demoing of our software. And so what has changed is that we have moved the entire process virtually.
In terms of what we adapted, as I said on some of my remarks, we adapted our messaging and areas of focus by solution and industry. And we clearly focus more, double down on those go-to-market motions that we have more confidence that would yield best returns during these times. And obviously, you can think -- focus more on some of the surging industries or some solutions, like it could be Planning or Prism, Learning or Scout, some of the motions that we think will produce better results. Our next questions come from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. I'll add my congrats. I am interested in how you would characterize the environment so far in the month of May, just in terms of generating pipeline and booking new business. Should we think of that as being kind of a night-and-day difference versus late March, early April? Or is it something you'd call directionally better, but it will still kind of take some time to get back to the original plans? So I'm just trying to understand if you think it's improving or degrading kind of between late March and the month of May. Chano? Mark, it's early days, but we're still below our normal engagement levels and also below our normal pipeline builds. But there has been a significant uptick in engagement and positive sentiment relative to, I would say, 4 weeks ago. So much of our activity, as I said, is now focusing on certain industries where we're seeing the greatest near-term demand, but we also continue dialogue in verticals that are more impacted by COVID to ensure that we're well positioned as we emerge from this environment, Mark. Okay. And then as a follow-up, Robynne, I'd say it's understandable that you're withdrawing the subscription backlog guidance in the back half. But that said, just considering that you still landed essentially within the original Q1 guidance for subscription backlog, I think, surprisingly and during a real chaotic period of time, do you see high odds that, that backlog growth is going to end up, say, materially below this type of glide path that you're on? Or is the confidence a little better than that, but it's just kind of such a wide range of potential outcomes at this point that it's hard to know? Yes. Mark, it's pretty wide, I think... Let me start with this. I think what everybody needs to recognize is that no one knows how it's going to play out over the next couple of quarters. We don't know if there's going to be another outbreak. And so everything that we are saying is our best information at this point in time, Keith. I mean if you know how it's going to play out, please let me know. So with that, Robynne, jump in, but I think that has to be the backdrop on everything right now. Yes, that's right. And as you know, the backlog is tied to net new. It's also tied to renewals, and then it's tied of duration. And we really haven't seen -- we don't have enough data yet to predict those, how they could play out over the back half of the year because we just have far less visibility. Sorry. I realized that was Mark. Sorry, Mark. Yes. It's fine, Aneel. You can call me Keith. It's fine. Our next questions come from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America. I'm curious, the net new ACV growth of 50% within your base, how does that compare to recent quarters? And how sustainable is this? And also curious, what kinds of products are you having the biggest hit rate with the installed base? Well, I'll let Chano answer the first part. I would say that it's a lot of the -- not surprisingly, the customers that are adding are adding on to core HR and core finance. In this environment, and Tom can comment on it, both Planning and Scout RFP have been very strong solutions. People are really struggling with the legacy Planning tools. And I mean I even look at Workday how many plans we've generated in the last couple of months because no one knows how this is all going to shake out.
And with Scout RFP, it's a quick implementation that you can get in control of your spend in a very global and unified way, and that's another thing that's been doing well. But maybe I'll let Tom comment and then Chano comment. Yes. Thanks, Aneel. That's right. What we've seen is a real uptick in interest in Planning. Companies are running, as you would expect, significantly more scenarios, as Aneel said. I think there was a period of time in March, we saw about a 30x increase in terms of the number of scenarios that our customers are running. So it's not surprising.
So I think the importance of planning, and particularly cloud-based planning solutions, where the whole team can be connected to holistically, has resonated with customers. We've seen tremendous interest in Workforce Planning. Everybody is thinking through what the next-generation workforce looks like. There's obviously fundamental changes being driven to both location and the way we work, and that requires a focus on Workforce Planning.
And then, as Aneel mentioned, I think we've also seen a lot of interest in our sourcing products. Because in periods like this, companies are extremely focused on ways that we can save money. As Chano mentioned in the script, we had the -- we saw the largest deal ever in Scout's history this quarter. So I think there's a lot of resonance with customers, and we're seeing that uptake. Chano? Just listening to you, Tom, it sounds like maybe this is the case, and maybe this is not the case. The shift to cloud-based financials could accelerate post COVID. Is that right or too optimistic? Well, I think generally -- and there's been a lot written about this period of time accelerating trends that were already in place. And certainly, the trend towards cloud-based applications and the need to -- and how effective it is during a period of time like this where people have to work remotely. As Chano and others have stated, there's uncertainty in the short term in terms of what the uptick in terms of adoption of enterprise applications will be in the short term. But there's no question in the intermediate and longer terms that there'll be tailwinds towards the adoption of cloud-based planning and cloud-based applications more generally. Chano? Thank you, Tom. Kash, we've seen the 50% plus new ACV growth in the back-to-base motion in Q4 and in Q1. That's the data we've disclosed so far. And I think this is an outcome of, a, we having a happy customer base and certainly the investments we've done on the go-to-market motion to cover our customer base and as well, of course, the increase on -- broader solutions set and deeper on the -- solution offering that we have today at Workday. Our next questions come from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. I wanted to follow up on kind of the Microsoft relationship. I know you guys first announced the global partnership back in the summer of 2016. So my question here what -- how has the Microsoft relationship evolved over the last 3-plus years and maybe the new scope of what you're working with them on today? So we've had a great partnership with Microsoft for a long time, really around Office 365 and more recently around Teams, and this just builds on that, adding Azure into the mix right now just for Adaptive. But that's -- it's also the first time that Microsoft has become a Workday customer, although LinkedIn has been a Workday customer for quite some time. So it's just adding -- it's just the natural progression of a partnership. I think Microsoft is a great company. Satya is a great CEO. We'd like to do more with them. Awesome. And then just a quick follow-up relative to the concessions that you're giving some of the most heavily impacted customers. I know, Robynne, you talked about the base minimum not really being up for negotiation every 3 to 5 years. But I'm just wondering, are you proactively looking to kind of work with these customers that are impacted? Or is it something where it's nonnegotiable, and you really don't really see a change there until that is up for renewal? Yes, Brent. I mean we've -- we're taking all of our customer requests on a one-by-one basis, case-by-case. But really, the vast majority of requests we're getting are along payment deferrals, not renegotiating contracts but just deferring payments. So we have not really run into an issue with customers trying to renegotiate base levels at this time, although certainly that could be the case for some that are most impacted by this. Our next questions come from the line of David Hynes of Canaccord. Congrats on the results. Maybe I'll take the other partnership question. Aneel, can you talk a little bit more about Work.com, what you're doing with Salesforce, what it could mean for Workday's business and maybe how you see that opportunity evolving over time? Can you guys hear me? Sorry. Mark has been driving the contact management piece for some time around contact tracing. And we actually had started that thinking and that work all the way back to SARS. So -- and the Salesforce application at the end of the day is a content management -- sorry, contact management application. So it's really well suited to that. Mark has the same goal, and Salesforce has the same goal that we do. We want to enable our customers to get their people back to work safely.
And so what we're doing is we have all the data about employees, locations, what they're learning in terms of the learning content. And Salesforce has a whole set of things with Work.com around contact tracing, tracking skills, shifts. And we're just making sure that the two technologies are completely synced so customers don't have to reconcile between the two. And if you -- and so if you're a joint customer, hopefully, this solution is really going to help you manage your way back into the office.
And I think as all of you know on the phone, I mean, Salesforce has been one of our best partners, if not our best partner, almost since the day we started Workday. Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Robynne. So a few folks have hit on back-to-the-base strength in the Q&A, and I just want to tie that into net revenue retention. Gross retention has always been really strong, right, at 95%. But on the net side, is the consistent commentary about north of 100% just out of practice? Or are you actually seeing improvement there? And I guess could you get any more granular on a number for net revenue retention? Yes. The way we actually measure net revenue is we only count add-on sales at the renewal point. And so now that we're really focused more on selling back into the base -- and that's happening during renewal cycles, but it's happening a lot more than ever outside of renewal cycles. And that's not captured in the net retention rate. So I think it's -- we're actually looking at a better way to measure it now that we're doing so many add-ons outside of renewals, and we'll probably make a change there over the coming quarters. But for now, I would just think of it as, as long as the way we are calculating it remains over 100%, that's great news. And then on top of that, we're selling a lot more into the base outside of those renewal cycles. Right. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. DJ, I'm going to ask Pete Schlampp, our Head of Applications, to weigh in on the Salesforce partnership, too. He's closer to what we're actually doing from a product perspective. Peter? That would be great. Yes. Thanks, Aneel. And good question, David. As I think about Salesforce and Workday, Salesforce has all this rich information about the workplace, and Workday as... Pete, I think your volume is on Zoom and not on... Better? Yes. But you need to mute Zoom. I see. Got it. So as I think of the two, Salesforce has the data about the workplace, and Workday has the data about the workforce. And some of the most rich data that we have is data about skills. And so as companies are going through these big transformations that are happening with workers, with, all of a sudden, some demands in certain areas that they didn't have before and vice versa, being able to make those transitions quickly and use that skill data is so essential. So when we think about getting companies back to the workplace safely, securely, and their people back safely and securely, it's about the data and bringing these 2 data sets together, whether that's in Salesforce's, in their command center, in the Work.com command center or whether it's within the Workday application set itself. And that's how we're going to really start things off, is with the data integration and then develop more applications as we go forward. The next question comes from the line of Scott Berg of Needham Company. I only have one here in essence of time. Aneel or maybe Chano, probably Aneel. Just wanted to see if you had some additional comments on Workday Extend now that it's finally available in GA. Trying to understand the revenue model of it going forward, kind of how has it evolved today versus the initial announcement 2 years ago? And do you envision customers or other companies building commercial apps that they could actually sell off of it, like what happens on Force.com? Well, I'll take a quick crack, then I'm going to send it over to Pete. And hopefully, Pete gets his technology right this time. Excuse me, Pete. So Workday Extend is really focused on extensibility for our customers. And we're not looking to open up an ISV community to build commercial applications. Our customers are getting great value from Extend. I mean we've had Extend in limited general availability for several quarters, and so we really got a good handle on the use cases. And now what we're seeing customers doing is building, I call it, more mini apps and extensions. They've done a lot of it around COVID-19, whether it's to track essential workers, to track -- one of our customers is tracking cases of COVID around the globe for manufacturing plants. So it's really whatever our customers want to do and extend our business model, but definitely not ISVs. And Pete, what else should we add to that? Thanks, Aneel. You'd think I'd have the mute thing figured out here after working from home for the last two months. The -- really, I think the success that we've had so far, I'd like to highlight, 50 -- over 50 customers using it, over 90 different solutions built on the platform already. So we're going into this GA period with a lot of existing momentum.
As we think about the products, we think about really extending the entire use -- the entire surface of the Workday platform, all the applications that we have in Workday, and then enabling our customers to extend those. And so we continue to open up new surface areas, and I think that gives the different possibilities that customers can develop on top of the funnel. And I guess just to come back to the revenue question or the bookings question, I still wouldn't expect much for fiscal year '21. But I do think it can be a decent contributor in fiscal year '22 and beyond and a high-growth contributor. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Chano, I had a follow-up question. I think it was to Heather's about the marketing funnel and the lead generation. You commented on what the timing could be for these sales cycles, but can you shed light on what you are seeing in terms of the values? Are the deal values holding up at a similar rate as you've seen in the past as they are progressing through the funnel towards closing? Thank you for your question, Brian. I would say it's very early days, and we've seen no shift of significance to comment on. Certainly, when I monitor the pipeline coming in for either, I know, later on to this year or new pipeline coming in from FY '22, at this point in time, we have been -- and we've managed as well to qualify some significant or large deals in terms of value, even on the environment we are into. Of course, then we need to be able to progress those deals and finally close them. But nothing to highlight in terms of change on those deals. Are they being considered that they are shrinking, or are they having less duration or any kind of things like those? Not really. We need more -- definitely a bigger trend and more data points during the rest of Q2 and Q3. But right now, that's what I can share, Brian. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Call. Thank you again for joining us, and have a great evening.","we have aneel Bhusri, our CEO; Robynne Sisco, our co-President and CFO; and Chano Fernandez, our vice president . following prepared remarks, we will take questions . some statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today .",1.0

At this time, all participant are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call.
And with that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to Workday's second quarter fiscal '21 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri, our Co-CEO; Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEO; Robynne Sisco, our President and CFO; Tom Bogan, our Vice Chairman; and Pete Schlampp, our Executive Vice President of Product Development following prepared remarks, we will take questions.
Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.
Our third quarter quiet period begins on October 16, 2020. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2020.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's second quarter fiscal year '21 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered a strong second quarter with healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. Despite the challenging environment, our success as a company continues to be driven by the forward-thinking companies that expect more from their enterprise applications and choose Workday as their partner for finance and HR. I'm very proud of our workmates across the globe who came together in such a remarkable way, and mostly working from their home offices to drive these strong Q2 results.
We're obviously living in unique times, simultaneously navigating a health care crisis, an economic crisis and a social crisis. This year will no doubt be one we will remember for all of our lives. It's also a moment in time that businesses and their leaders are in a unique position to drive change for the good and demonstrate that companies can and should have a soul.
To that end, we have taken a leadership role in addressing social inequality and continuing to drive diversity and inclusion at Workday. To help move us forward, we have recruited some of the most passionate and brightest minds from across Workday into an accelerated team guided by our Chief Diversity Officer, Karen Taylor. We have four guiding principles: number one, building inclusive products and technologies; number two, hiring and developing diverse talent; number three, cultivating a culture of belonging; and number four, strengthening our communities. Our accelerated team is focused on helping us identify priorities and metrics that will help us drive and measure success against these principles. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the near future.
Moving on to the business highlights. We had another strong quarter for Workday HCM, where the migration to the cloud continues with notable customer additions, including Air Liquide, IB, the State of Oklahoma and German manufacturing leader, Thyssenkrupp. I'm also pleased to mention that we added one of the largest U.S. telecommunications services companies to our Fortune 50 customer list. And as always, customer success remains a key differentiator for Workday. In Q2, we had several HCM go-lives, including General Motors, The Hartford, Eli Lilly and Bridgestone Americas.
Turning to Workday financial management. We saw continued strong momentum across the expanding product line in Q2, including a financial's first win at Comerica Bank and notable platform wins where companies selected both core financials and HCM together at Sharp Healthcare, The Amenity Collective and American Financial Group. Among the many core financials go-lives in the quarter, I would like to highlight Prisma Health and Nebraska Medicine. In addition, CNA and Shelter Insurance both went live as early adopters of Workday Accounting Center, a new offering that has served as a key differentiator in several of our recent strategic core financials wins. I'm pleased to say that Workday Accounting Center is on schedule to be commercially available this fall.
In addition to the strong commercial success this quarter, we also added a federal government agency with 4,000 employees as an HCM and financials customer, and this agency has partnered with us as we seek FedRAMP authorization. Indeed, for many years, we have provided solutions for state and local governments as well as numerous federal labs and DoD contractors, and we view the federal market as a next logical step in our market expansion. Our near-term focus is on ensuring success with this initial partnership, but we are excited by the longer-term opportunity to serve the federal marketplace.
Turning to some of our newer initiatives. We once again saw solid demand for our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO and Chief Procurement Officer, including Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics and Spend Management, where we now support more than 1,000 procurement customers. Scout RFP had another excellent quarter as companies are increasingly looking for the ability to get their arms around their supplier network and appreciate the rapid time to value the solutions like Scout can provide to them. Indeed, the three Fortune 500 sourcing wins that we announced last quarter are all now live and in production.
Turning to product development. In Q2, we announced availability for Workday Help and Journeys, new solutions that extend the power of Workday people experience, our machine learning-driven employee experience. In addition, we announced availability of people analytics, which leverages our Prism foundation to help empower HR and business leaders to make better people decisions. We also continue to help our customers with their return to work planning during this time, including joint offerings with key partners, such as the announcement we had last quarter with Salesforce -- by the way, congratulations on the great quarter, Mark -- and more recently with IBM, where we announced the availability of a joint solution to plan, schedule and monitor our customers' safe return to the workplace.
Last earnings call, I shared my belief that this environment will ultimately serve as another catalyst to accelerate the adoption of finance and HR systems in the cloud. Our Q2 results and my conversations with business leaders suggest that companies are increasingly realizing the strategic importance of having agile flexible systems to support their mission-critical business processes now and in the future.
Lastly, I want to end on the exciting news that my great friend and colleague, Chano Fernandez, has been promoted to Co-CEO of Workday. In his expanded role, Chano will now oversee all of our customer-facing activities, including sales, customer services and support and many aspects of marketing.
Chano joined Workday back in 2014 as our President of EMEA and has taken out more and more responsibilities over time, most recently as Co-President of the company. He is an amazing values-based leader and has driven his teams to great success over the years. So the move to Co-CEO is a natural progression for him, for Workday and for me. I'm personally thrilled to be his partner for this next chapter for Workday. And for those of you who have followed Workday for a while, you will hopefully remember that my Co-Founder, Dave and I operated as Co-CEOs for almost five years, and the model worked great for us and for the company. I wholeheartedly expect the Co-CEO structure will also work great for Chano and me. Congratulations, Chano, and a big thanks to you and your team for a great Q2 and looking forward to being your partner for many years to come. Over to you. Thank you, Aneel. I'm incredibly grateful to yourself, Dave and the entire Board for the trust you have placed in me. It's an honor. I'm thrilled to partner with you and our exceptional workmates across the globe on our exciting journey ahead.
Before providing my update, I wanted to begin by echoing Aneel's comments and express my thanks and appreciation to our field team for a strong Q2. I am pleased with our progress, especially in the context of the ongoing macro uncertainty, and it was good to see the solid performance across our segments, regions, products.
Many businesses seem to be settling into this uncertain environment and increasingly realizing the need to move forward with their digital transformation initiatives. This, along with our strong execution drove improving conversion rates in Q2 relative to what we experienced in the March-April time frame.
Our second quarter performance was broad-based and included strong results from both net new and back-to-base teams. In the large enterprise, we landed nine new global 2,000 HCM customers and two Global 2000 FINS deals. We also saw strength in our education and government team highlighted by the win of the state of Oklahoma, and we have a growing pipeline of state and local government opportunities.
The medium enterprise also had another solid quarter, continuing a multi-quarter trend. From a regional perspective, North America and APAC were standouts, and we had improving performance in Europe. The back-to-base team delivered another solid quarter with over 50% growth again this quarter, driven by strength across products, including FINS, workforce and financial planning, Prism Analytics, learning, Scout RFP and newly launched Accounting Center. It's early, but we're also encouraged by pipeline creation from some of our newest products, including health, Workday Extend, people analytics.
Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic that market dynamics will slowly improve as we approach year-end and head into FY '22. More importantly, we are extremely optimistic on the longer-term opportunity that will come from this environment, as businesses increasingly realize the importance of Workday in navigating and driving times of change.
With that, I will turn it over to our newly minted President, Robynne Sisco. Congrats, Robynne. Over to you. Thanks, Chano. I look forward to continuing our partnership and supporting you in your new role. As Aneel and Chano both noted, Q2 was a very solid quarter despite an uncertain environment, driven by strong execution against a slightly improved market backdrop as many companies continued with their digital transformation initiatives. I'm going to briefly recap our second quarter results, update our guidance for Q3 and FY '21 and then open it up for your questions.
Subscription revenue in the second quarter was $932 million, up 23% year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by strong renewals, favorable new business linearity and a onetime benefit of $6 million from the acceleration of revenue on a customer contract. Professional services revenue was $130 million, and total revenue was $1.062 billion. Total revenue outside the U.S. was $257 million, 24% of the total.
Subscription revenue backlog was $8.60 billion at the end of the second quarter growth of 22% year-over-year. The backlog performance was driven by strong new ACV bookings across both net new and add-on business. In addition, we once again experienced strong renewals with gross retention over 95% and net retention, which includes upsells at the time of renewal, over 100%. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $5.78 billion, growth of 21%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $258 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. The operating margin outperformance was driven by a combination of top line overachievement; slower hiring; continued COVID-related moderation of operating expenses, including travel and marketing; and some onetime credits related to canceled events. Q2 operating cash flow was $157 million, growth of 57% year-over-year, driven by solid collections and moderated spending. We continue to work with customers, both new and existing, that request more flexible payment terms, specifically in industry's hardest hit by the pandemic. This payment flexibility acts as a near-term headwind to cash flow and unearned revenue, though it's important to keep in mind that it has no impact on our subscription revenue, subscription revenue backlog or long-term customer economics.
During the quarter, we settled our 2020 $250 million convertible note using cash proceeds from the final funding of our term loan. We exited our second quarter with $2.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and have access to $750 million of unused capacity on our revolving line of credit.
Our total workforce at the end of the quarter was approximately 12,300 employees, slightly down from Q1. The hiring in the quarter was focused primarily on a limited number of strategic positions to support our key growth initiatives. This was offset by normal levels of employee attrition that had not yet been backfilled by the end of the quarter. We're extremely pleased with our results and execution in Q2. And while we remain cautious on the near-term pace of recovery, we see significant long-term opportunity ahead to support our growth aspirations.
Now turning to guidance, which, despite our outperformance in Q2, continues to be governed by the assumptions we outlined last quarter, specifically, that we continue to face an uncertain and challenging environment, which we expect will remain in the near term with only slowly improving market dynamics as we approach year-end.
As a result of our strong Q2 performance, we are raising our FY '21 subscription revenue estimate to be in the range of $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion, 20% to 21% growth. We expect our Q3 subscription revenue to be $948 million to $950 million, 19% growth. We now expect professional services revenue to be $525 million in fiscal '21 and $135 million in Q3. As always, our priority is to support our customers' successful deployments and drive the highest levels of customer satisfaction. In line with these goals, we expect a balanced approach in terms of partner and Workday primes to ensure our partner ecosystem continues to be healthy and active.
For Q3, we expect subscription revenue backlog growth in the high teens. We estimate Q3 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 19%. For the full year, we now expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 18%, up from our previous view of 16%. This full year margin improvement is largely the result of our top line over performance. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 26 percentage points in both the third quarter and the full year. Our FY '21 capital investment guidance remains unchanged at $280 million.
I'd like to close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver strong Q2 results during these unprecedented times. Our first half performance has reinforced our confidence in the fundamental strength of our business and the long-term opportunity that we see ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Congrats on the quarter and congratulations to Chano on the promotion. Well deserved. I think my question is for Aneel. Aneel, I think there was some concern amongst investors that companies that were in the more traditional back-office categories of software, maybe namely HCM and ERP, would get shoved to the back of the line in terms of spending priorities due to COVID. And I think with these results, that thesis was clearly a bit faulty.
So I was wondering if you could talk about how customers are thinking about Workday relative to their other mission-critical systems in terms of prioritization around spend? And then why the conversations you're having today maybe put you in a different category versus some of the traditional ERP vendors? Thanks, Kirk. So first of all, I think the most important piece is we're not an ERP vendor. I think there's a lot of connotations with ERP that are 2- to 3-year implementations that the payback takes a long time. We're quick to implement HR and finance systems really oriented towards employees and running the business in a very agile environment. So on the HR side, very simply, with the pandemic and with all the other issues facing companies right now, employees are front and center for everybody. And you should think about HCM, not just as a back-office system, but an employee engagement system. But also with the pandemic, companies have had to change their business processes radically, and they're changing them on a weekly basis. And the legacy systems just can't do that. So we saw some holdouts of companies that were working with legacy systems just decide, ""Hey, we just need to make the plunge and go into the cloud even though we're in the middle of the pandemic.""
Similarly on the finance side, the flexibility that starts their planning system, the ability to recreate and generate plans on a really rapid basis based on a system adaptive that can go live within a month and our core accounting system where you can close the books without having anybody in the office completely remotely can be live in 6 to 9 months. And so I think companies that are in a place to invest continue to invest in these data transformation areas, and they're embracing the cloud. And HR and finance are still very important. And if I could ask just a quick follow-up for Robynne. Robynne, you mentioned, obviously, that most of the outperformance on margins was sort of due to the outperformance on the top line -- or the change in guidance rather was due to outperformance on the top line. In the back half of the year, do you expect to accelerate -- to accelerate hiring, rather? And how should we think about sort of your ability to raise -- to spend more in the back half, I guess, or hire more in the back half? Yes, Kirk. So we said in the last call that we do expect to see slow improvements in Q4. So we've been planning all along to start reinvesting in the back half of the year, and we continue to have that assumption. So we will start investing in areas like sales, marketing, product and technology. And as I mentioned before, we did have some onetime benefits in Q3 that won’t repeat such as credits for canceled events. So we feel very good about our ability to invest in the back half of the year and to execute against those investment plans and a good payoff from that in the future. Our next question has come from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions Congratulations for the Workday team on a fantastic quarter, and congrats to Chano on your promotion. A question for you, Aneel or Chano, whoever wants to take this. As you look at your user conference Workday Rising, which has tended to be a big event where [indiscernible] together serve as a great opportunity for building a pipeline, how are you thinking about calendar '21, assuming that calendar '20 is going to be just fine as far as the forward look of business and build a pipeline for next year's business initiatives?
And also, if you can just spend a minute on, we have been picking up from the field that there is pent-up demand for an integrated HCM financial system in the cloud that if you didn't do it, you’re stuck as guys as a customer. So how are you seeing that in your pipeline? And what is the adoption of financials integrated with HCM in the Fortune 500 segment of the market, is that poised to accelerate in calendar 21? I think Chano is the right person to answer those questions. So I'll refer to the Co-CEO. Thank you, Kash. So from a rising perspective, you are right, we made the decision to pivot and hold off Rising until next year, which is hopefully safe to get together again. And instead, what we are doing is introducing a special digital event that will explore the most present challenges facing businesses right now, which we think is more appropriate at this time.
But I would like as well to highlight that Rising isn't necessarily a big pipeline builder for us. The primary there is customers and later stage prospects Kash. From a pipeline build perspective, I'm kind of looking out to next year, we've seen improvement relative to what we saw in Q1, which is encouraging, and we're moving closer to pre-COVID levels, but we aren't yet quite back to this from a pipeline build perspective. And with the biggest impact here in the verticals, we already call out, like travel, hospitality and retail. But there are as well a lot of areas. I'm very encouraged by -- in terms of pipeline build like what we are seeing in state of local government vertical, financial services, technology and media and more broadly on our installed base team pipeline, also that one accelerates faster, which can also may be helpful for year-end faster build up pipeline to support the event on the back of this year. And on the financials, pent-up demand possibly for financials HCM in the Fortune 500 segment of the market, if that is the case? What we're seeing right now in financials is that, if you talk to some of our partners and we're seeing it indirectly ourselves, there are a number of evaluations going on at this point in time. So a, we've seen some improvement, clearly, on the financial side. And it's reflected as well in some of the customers that we've been mentioning. But as what we are expecting, as Aneel was mentioning, that as we turn the corner from COVID and due to the number of evaluations that are happening and taking place now, it may accelerate. Again, the environment remains uncertain on fluid cash. So it's difficult to call out. But certainly, the number of evaluations out there has increased until companies have realized this environment, the need for that flexibility and agility that Aneel was talking about, and that cannot be on our legacy systems. Our next question come from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions And Chano, I wanted to say congratulations. You've had the Midas touch in every single role that we've seen and just can't wait to see how it builds from here.
I just had a question on the imprint of the pandemic on Workday financials. Because we've heard so many anecdotes of how modernizing finance is going to be necessary from a survival standpoint. And I'm curious if that is overcoming the hesitation that we've always seen to change a core system like that amidst a pretty uncertain environment. Well, I guess I'll just leave it at that. Chano? Yes, Mark, kind of what I've been commenting with Kash, right? what I can say is that I think companies -- and this is anecdotal but are realizing the need to modernize the financial systems, again, some of them is having challenges across the book remotely. Some of them having challenges to basically made the changes required. I can tell you, customers that are telling they are having people sneaking onto their business to download some reports and being able to provide the financial numbers, right, while their offices are closed. So clearly, the understanding and the need for the modernization is there, as you would say, from a survival perspective, right, to be able to accomplish some of these tasks.
I would also, again, repeat myself saying that the number of evaluations that we're seeing out there and our partners are seeing has increased in the financial side, again, with the caveat, it's difficult to anticipate how the overall environment, which is quite uneven and fluid is going to evolve. We might be expecting that this might produce an acceleration on the other end. It's early to say yet. Our next questions come from the line of Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions Excellent. Very nice quarter. A question for Aneel and related to Chano, congratulations on the new role. Aneel, with Chano now becoming Co-CEO, do you imagine your role changing at all? And how do you guys think about kind of dividing up the responsibilities between the 2 of you? Are you going to move into something that's like more strategic and Chano is going to be working on sort of the day-to-day operations? Or like how do you guys foresee that working with the 2 of you as Co-CEOs now? Well, so Chano was taking on all of customer services and a lot of marketing, too. And that's half the company. And for me, I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future. And then it's super important that we maintain the great culture that we have. And so working with employees is critical, too.
So much like it was with me and Dave, two like-minded people are better than one in the CEO job. And it was my best experience at Workday, when Dave and I were Co-CEOs. So I'm thrilled to be able to share the role with Chano. And he's much stronger operational leader than I am. And so he's going to take over the things that are -- that he's really great at. And over time, we'll figure it out. We're great friends, and we'll figure out the right mix over time. Yes. Go ahead. No, you go first. No. I would like Chano to comment on that, too. . I'm very excited about the opportunity, clearly, and I'm really thankful, as I said, to Aneel and Dave and the rest of the Board. I think we are quite complementary, and we get together along very well. And we had a good point of views on kind of each other's areas. But certainly, really, really excited to be contributing as much as I can more from broader go-to-market, customer relationship as a whole, from the acquisition to customer success to services and clearly to support and driving the company going forward with the support of Robynne and the rest of the Executive Committee team.
So I think it's a good breakout, the one we have right now. Quite clean cut, to be honest, but allow us potentially to play to the strengths that we -- that both of us have. So it's great. It sounds great. And if I could sneak one last one in. Chano, you mentioned you're encouraged about the strengthening you're seeing in the new products. And you talked about Workday extend that seems like a pretty exciting solution set and that it can really expand the hand pretty greatly for Workday. Can you talk to us a little bit about some of the initial use cases and kind of workloads that you're seeing people put on the extend platform? I'm going to hand over that one to Pete Schlampp from the product because I think he's in a much better place to answer that one. Yes. Thanks for the question. So the first thing I would remind you is that Extend is more than a revenue opportunity for us. It's an opportunity for us to find ways to become more efficient in R&D because as we provide these tools to our customers, they're able to extend Workday in the ways that they need in their unique situations, instead of us having to actually go and build product for them. So that's great.
Now that said, we've -- this quarter, we've seen some great wins, some great early wins with Extend, and pipeline is looking great as well. We've been seeing lots of use cases. I think we have about 100 different applications live today. One of them that just went live this quarter was a company that had built a self-assessment capability inside of Extend, so employees could self-assess as they were getting ready to return to work and determine whether they were ready. So Extend is about any type of use case, just extending the surface area of Workday. Our next question has come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions And again, Chano, congrats on the promotion. Just I had a question, and I don't know Aneel or Robynne, if this is best for you, but just related to the pace of business, throughout the quarter. You guys obviously had very good results. You gave rightly so, conservative guidance for the quarter. But can you talk about kind of how the pace of business evolved over the course of the quarter, if you could share with us? Then I just have a quick follow-up. Robynne? Yes. So we actually, Heather, had really good linearity this quarter. So on our earnings call last time, Chano had mentioned that he was starting to see more sales activity in May than we had seen in April. And we saw continued execution throughout the quarter, strong linearity, which added to our top line beat and good close rates, really strong close rates. And so Chano, anything you would add to that in terms of what you were seeing? No, I think it was a solid performance throughout the quarter. A big part of, of course, of how was the quarter closed out as a whole. It's hard to draw a completely straight-line, Heather, and say that every month put better linearity. But clearly, the broader observation is that the environment has improved since March and April, as we commented, and has kept improving since then, right? But as I said before, the market remains fluid in the near term, which is also as well reflected on our outlook price. And again, the biggest impact we still see in the verticals that has been hardest hit. Great. Right. And then, Aneel, just to follow up on your introductory comments, do you think that what we're going through and just the desire to have more modern systems, do you think this will actually accelerate people's desire to move financials to the cloud? I know that that's been a market that's taken probably longer than people thought to really make a wholesale shift. Is this kind of an accelerant of that trend, do you think, based on what you're hearing? I definitely think it is. The need for agility, flexibility is so critical in today's world. And maybe if you were running your business the last couple of years, and there weren't many external factors, your core accounting system is probably fine.
But I actually think the bigger driver for us is the broadening of the fleet. 4 - 5 years ago, we were dealing with our core accounting message. And if the customer wasn't ready to replace core accounting, we didn't have anything else to talk to them about. Today, we can start with Planning. We can have the conversation about core accounting, but we could talk about Scout. We can talk about Prism Analytics. We now have the end-to-end suite that took a number of years, so legacy vendors to build on-premise, and now we have it in the cloud. 3, 4 years ago, we just did -- we didn't have that scope for that breadth. And today, we do. And I think that's a big part of why people are moving. They don't want to just move their core accounting system. They want to look at procurement. They want to look at Planning. They want to look at analytics and then increasingly now for a certain set of industries, the Workday Accounting Center. So when you add that all together, we now have a basket of products that meets the needs of pretty much everybody, and they can move forward with comfort that we can cover their full needs, not just one part of their needs. And I really do think that's the bigger driver. Our next questions come from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions Congratulations on the quarter. And Chano, really thrilled for you as well. So maybe, Aneel, one of the interesting things, and you touched on it, I think, in answering Kirk's question, but I want to dig a little deeper. One of the interesting things we picked up recently in our field work is this increasing shift of power back to the HR executive and department, to your point, as more executives are getting concerned about employee engagement, talent management, mental health, diversity, inclusion in this new kind of remote world, and I guess the question is, what are you seeing from this? Are you seeing this in the field actually starting to impact sales cycles, pipelines conversation? And does this impact the secular growth trajectory of the HCM business as we kind of come out of this crisis or longer term? In terms of the secular growth, that's a hard one to predict. But I would say that it’s part of our goal, but I've never had so many CEO conversations on the HCM product line. And I think the issue of employee health, mental health, physical health, how are they doing working remotely, how are they working on their projects, this new world of skills and a different world around talent, it's working to become a number one priority for the CEOS. So that is definitely elevating the CHRO to position within the company. And then maybe just one for Robynne. Can you talk about that $6 million accelerated payment term and also any just FX impacts on kind of the guidance, headwinds or tailwinds? Yes. Sure. So the $6 million was a result of a Workday customer, who was acquired by a non-Workday customer and therefore, they want to terminate their contract. So they prepaid the remaining balance of the contract, which should have gone several more years, and that caused an acceleration of the rest of the revenue across the contract, so a onetime event on that front. And I'm sorry, Alex, what was the second part of your question? Just related to FX, in terms of the tailwinds or the headwinds with respect to the guide? Yes. Really no FX impact to call out. Our next question has come from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions Congrats on the quarter, guys. I wanted to ask on Workday Launch and the expansion of the solution to large enterprises. Maybe first of all, is this a response to perhaps the demand for faster time-to-value solutions driven by COVID? Or is this something that was sort of always in the works pre-COVID? And then what's the scope of this in terms of the type of large enterprises that could potentially use Workday Launch to get up and running? Chano? Yes. Thanks for your question, Matt. I mean, it was always kind of on the works once Launch was more proven in the medium enterprise across the board. And clearly, that offering was basically resulting in good outcomes in terms of both time-to-value and predictability of cost. So the idea was always to expand a bit more the upper and large enterprise. Right now, we're more on the lower end of large enterprise on the initial customers. So you could say something between the 4,000 to the 7,000 to 8,000 employees, kind of what we are implementing it.
It can be across all verticals. Once you have basically the packetization of the full offering. And again, we'll provide both mainly both time-to-value and predictability of cost, sometimes on a fixed fee basis. And does it do anything to your market opportunity in terms of potentially accelerating adoption or reaching customers that you couldn't reach previously? It can definitely help on those customers that are looking for more proactive and predicted offering that will impact faster, quicker ROI, quicker time-to-value and also on those customers that are looking for a fixed cost, sometimes in terms of the offering of the implementation and have surprises. So definitely, it can be an accelerator on some of those markets we're applying. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Berg with Needman Company. Please proceed with your questions This is Ryan MacDonald on for Scott Berg. Congrats on a great quarter. Could you provide a little more color on Adaptive sales and the continued traction you see there compared maybe to the strong results you saw in Q1? And then also how pipeline is looking into the back half of the year for that? Tom, do you want to? Yes. So thanks for the question, Ryan. So we continue to make excellent progress with Adaptive. And I'd characterize it as, first, a lot of strength selling Workforce Planning into the Workday -- the broader Workday HCM customer base. I think that's an area that our teams have seen a lot of success. This environment really increases the importance of the criticality of doing effective workforce planning for many organizations, whether it be location, headcount planning, skills planning, training, diversity. I think those are all aspects that are important to our customers. But we've also seen a significant increase in interest in getting modern financial planning systems for organizations that -- I think we talked last time about the customer activity running multiple scenarios because of COVID. Perhaps not at the same levels, but that continues as customers think about their business and run combinatorics that are essential to understand what their businesses are doing going forward. So we've seen strong customer demand. As Aneel said, Adaptive and Scout both have rapid times to value, and that's important in this environment. Excellent. And then just as a follow-up for Robynne. Robynne, just wondering if you've seen requests for flexible payment or billing terms from customers persist throughout second quarter and I guess into early third quarter here at all? Yes. So we continue to do those requests. We got an initial wave when cover first hit, as you can imagine, but we do continue to see requests from customers. Some new customers, we see some request upon renewals. We continue to evaluate those on a case-by-case basis and to give relief where it makes to our hardest hit customers. And I do expect that, that will likely continue through the rest of this year. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri, our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez, our president and CFO, and Robynne Sisco, our vice president .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call.
And with that, I would now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Thank you operator. Welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEO; Robynne Sisco, our President and CFO; Tom Bogan, our Vice Chairman; and Pete Schlampp, our Executive Vice President of Product Development.
Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters.
These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic conditions.
Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.
Our fourth quarter quiet period begins on January 16th, 2020. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2020.
With that, let me hand it over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin and welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal ‘21 earnings conference call. I hope all of you joining us today are in good health and your families are doing well. We at Workday are encouraged by the recent news regarding vaccines coming to market early next year. We also know we can't lose sight of the fact that we find ourselves in a particularly difficult phase of this pandemic and the health and safety of all people is most important as we navigate these uncertain times.
I'm very proud of our team who continue to support our customers, despite the challenges that persist and remain very optimistic about Workday's post-pandemic future.
As we know, business leaders are facing a myriad of different challenges right now. Indeed, we're experiencing a health, economic, and social crisis simultaneously. There's a lot of uncertainty in the world that requires conversation and collaboration.
That's why in October, we gathered global change-makers together with our customer community for a virtual event we called Conversations for a Changing World. We heard inspiring talks for the likes of Serena Williams, Reese Witherspoon, David Cameron and Trevor Noah.
And I was personally excited to have my friends and fellow CEOs, including Adena Friedman of NASDAQ, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft joining our event to share their thoughts on leadership and how they are dealing with the challenges of today. We received excellent feedback on the event from our customers and prospects, many of whom mentioned some important takeaways.
First, we heard the call that business leaders simply cannot opt out of this moment. Companies have to lean in and be part of the solutions that address the most pressing issues that our society is facing today.
Many of the conversations also touched on diversity and inclusion and a growing commitment to reskilling the global workforce. At Workday, we need to continue to be a driving force for the creation of opportunities in this digital economy for everyone, not just a few.
And from a technology perspective, there was a common theme underpinning the conversations at our event, a view that a must-have ingredient for organizations going forward is to have a strong digital foundation and now it’s the time to accelerate that transition.
With this increased focus on digital acceleration we believe that the flexible foundation and solutions that Workday offer are uniquely suited to the needs of businesses in these times built natively for the cloud and with people at the center of all of our solutions. With that view as a backdrop, let’s jump into our Q3 results.
I’m pleased to report that Workday delivered a solid Q3 as organizations increasingly look to the cloud to drive change during these dynamic times. Indeed, our customers are using Workday solutions to digitally accelerate and move their businesses forward, while also serving as our biggest advocates to new customers helping others realize the power of Workday to navigate their organizations through any environment.
To that end, we had another strong quarter for Workday HCM with notable customer additions in the quarter, including Novartis, DraftKings, CTBC Bank, a Fortune 500 telecommunications company, and Tecnologias Rappi, our first notable win in Mexico since entering that market earlier this year.
We also celebrated several notable HCM go-lives this quarter including Walmart, who is now live across its 1.7 million employees globally and what we believe is the largest multi-tenant worldwide cloud HCM deployment.
Also our strategic partner Accenture went live with Workday HCM and is now serving its more than 0.5 million global employees. Other notable Q3 go-lives include UPS and General Electric.
Turning to Workday Financial Management, we saw continued momentum across our applications portfolio and I’m pleased to say we’ve reached 1,000 customers that have chosen Workday for core finance.
Q3 financial management wins include the State of Washington, University of Central Florida, Fifth Third Bank, The New York Times and Extendicare. Amongst the many core financials go-lives in the quarter, I would like to highlight Bon Secours Mercy Health and Progressive Insurance. We once again saw a solid demand for our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO and Chief Procurement Officer, including Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics and Spend Management.
I’m also happy to share that we now have fully integrated Scout RFP into the Workday organization and have re-branded as Workday Strategic Sourcing, which is part of our spend management pillar that is being led by Scout Co-Founder and CEO, Alex Yakubovich.
The team had a record quarter with several big wins at Fortune 500 accounts that included a biopharmaceutical company, a food distributor, and a large grocery store chain with over 100,000 employees.
Turning to product, we delivered our latest major update in September which included availability of Workday Talent Marketplace enabling employers with skills-based talent matching to connect people with relevant work and growth opportunities.
We also announced availability of Workday Accounting Center and more intelligent planning capabilities, both milestones in our continued investments for the Office of the CFO.
And lastly, with our focus on value, inclusion, belonging and equity or VIBE, we announced VIBE Central and VIBE Index; two solutions providing organizations with critical insights to drive positive change in building a workforce that’s as diverse as the world.
In closing, I would like to thank our employees, customers, and partners who continue to push us forward despite these extremely challenging times. As I look ahead to the other side of this pandemic, my optimism for Workday and our ecosystem couldn’t be higher.
With that, I’ll turn it over to my friend and Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel. Before providing my update, I would like to once again thank our field and broader services teams for another solid performance in Q3. I’m pleased with the continued progress that we have made this year, especially in the context of the ongoing uncertainty.
I know our workmates are anxious to get back in front of our customers and prospects when it is safe to do so in person. But in the meantime, we are focused on building a maturing pipeline, closing deals, and successfully implementing and supporting customers, all in a fully virtual way.
For the second quarter in a row, we saw conversion rates exceed our expectations as organizations continued to push forward with their HCM and financials, digital transformations. We had several strategic wins in the third quarter, including multiple global 2000 HCM win, a Fortune 500 core fins win, and Fifth Third Bank, with Accounting Center once again playing an important role, and notable HR fins platform wins in our education and government teams. The medium enterprise also had another strong quarter. And from a geographical perspective, the U.S. and the DACH regions were standouts.
We are now a few years into our focused go-to-market push within our installed base. I am very pleased with the success it has driven. For the fourth quarter in a row, our installed base team generated 50% plus growth in new ACV bookings, driven by strength across products, including core fins, financials and workforce planning, Prism Analytics, learning and Workday strategic sourcing.
Newer products including Accounting Center, Workday Extend, and People Analytics contributed to the performance. And although early, we are excited about their long-term prospects.
Our comparisons get tougher starting in Q4 and we don’t expect a 50%-plus growth to persist going forward. But we still see significant opportunity to drive meaningful growth from a winning installed-based sales team for many years to come.
As we head into Q4, we remain cautiously optimistic. We continue to face near-term impacts to the net new business, particularly in certain industries. So, we have seen a strength in the store-base team help partially offset this and we are encouraged by improvements in our pipeline.
As we prepare for next year, we are increasing the pace of our sales and marketing investment. We believe now is the time to do so because we see a meaningful opportunity on the other side of COVID and we are investing now to capitalize on that opportunity.
With that, I would turn it over to our President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks Chano. As Aneel and Chano both noted, we executed well in the third quarter driving strong results as many companies continued to pursue strategic HR and finance transformations despite the uncertain environment.
Subscription revenue in the third quarter was $969 million, up 21% year-over-year, with the outperformance driven by favorable linearity and strong retention which remained over 95% on a gross basis and over 100% on a net basis.
Professional services revenue was $137 million and total revenue was $1.106 billion. Revenue outside the U.S. was $272 million, 25% of the total. Subscription revenue backlog was $8.87 billion at the end of the third quarter, growth of 23% year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by better than expected bookings as strength in our installed-base team helped partially offset net new business headwinds.
In addition, backlog benefited from a year-over-year increase in contract duration, which we do not expect to persist in Q4. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $5.94 billion, growth of 21%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $268 million resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. The margin outperformance was driven by a combination of topline overachievement; continued COVID-related operating expense savings, and more back-end loaded hiring versus expectations.
Q3 operating cash flow was $294 million, growth of 14%. As a reminder, we continue to work with our hardest hit customers that require more flexible payment terms, which remains a near-term headwind to cash flow and unearned revenue though it has no impact on our subscription revenue, subscription revenue backlog, or long-term customer economics. We exited the third quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and marketable securities and have access to an additional $750 million through our unused revolving line of credit.
Our total workforce at the end of the quarter was approximately 12,400 employees. We expect our hiring to pick up in the fourth quarter and into FY 2022 across all areas, but primarily in sales and marketing and R&D as we invest for future growth.
We’re extremely pleased with our results and execution in Q3, particularly given the challenging environment and we see significant longer term opportunity ahead to support our growth aspirations.
Now, turning to guidance, which despite our outperformance in Q3 continues to incorporate the near-term uncertainty we see in the market. Our updated FY 2021 guidance is as follows.
We are raising our FY 2021 subscription revenue estimate to be in the range of $3.773 billion to $3.775 billion or a 22% growth. We expect our Q4 subscription revenue to be $991 million to $993 million, 18% growth. We continue to expect professional services revenue to be $525 million in fiscal 2021 and $121 million in Q4.
For Q4, we expect subscription revenue backlog growth of 14% to 16% as we face a very difficult comparison from a strong Q4 last year. We estimate Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 15% as we expect to increase both our pace of hiring and our marketing and brand investments.
For the full year we now expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 19%. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 26 percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Our FY 2021 capital investments guidance remains unchanged at $280 million. We are still in our planning process for FY 2022 and because the near-term uncertainty remains higher than normal, we plan to provide guidance after we get through our very important Q4.
Keep in mind, however, that while we have seen some recent stability in the underlying environment, headwinds due to COVID remains particularly to net new bookings. And given our subscription model, these headwinds that have impacted us all year will be more fully evident in next year’s subscription revenue weighing on our growth in the near-term.
From a margin standpoint, this year we have demonstrated the long-term scalability inherent in our model. Investing for growth remains priority number one, however, and in FY 2022, we expect to increase our pace of hiring across all areas, but with a focus on sales, marketing and product investments that are specifically targeted at accelerating pipeline growth.
In closing, I am incredibly proud of all our workmates who have remained focused on helping our customers allowing us to deliver strong results during these turbulent times.
With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Operator? At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question. Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter. Aneel and Chano I was kind of curious, you guys mentioned sort of, the bookings outlook is getting better, you feel good about pipeline build, your conversations started to get a little bit more upbeat, just about the long-term, meaning things are definitely still not normal today. But when people are making investments on your technology, they're making decade-long investments.
So, I was just kind of curious about how you feel about the confidence in sort of the pipeline build maybe versus three months ago? And what do you think needs to happen so that on the net new side that starts to pick up, meaning what are people talking to you about, like, hey, we just need to know is it another quarter, another six months, just kind of curious what you think needs to happen to kind of, get back to full guns blazing on that front? Thanks. So, the first comment I make is it really depends on which industry you're talking to. There are a number of companies that can weather the storm retailers, tech companies, and as much as possible, they're trying to get back to some level of normal even though we know we're in frankly probably in the worst part of the pandemic, it just seems like, we figured out how to work in the pandemic.
And those conversations are indeed very similar to what they were pre-pandemic and people are very focused on digital acceleration and getting to that that future state on the platform side, but then we do have customers who are really being impacted by COVID whether they're in hospitality or transportation, and for them, they're still on the sidelines. And I think there'll be a few outliers here or there, but I think the best way to look at it is the world is trying to get back to normal, but there's a couple of sectors that are having a hard time getting back to normal. And then maybe if I get a second one -- follow-on. Go ahead, Chano sorry. I was going to say Chano, you want to add anything? No, I think that's summarized it well. I think from a pipeline perspective, we continue to see improvements relative to the start of the pandemic. And while it's early, we're starting to see some of the newer products having a positive impact. So, we're feeling good about what we have in Q4 pipeline and the maturity of this pipeline.
And it's also quite balanced across products and geographies. But, of course, we will remain positively optimistic looking at well, what's going to happen in terms of -- with the second wave of COVID and how things are moving forward. If I could add one comment, though, Kirk. There just been some other companies that have talked about how there's been slowdown in the back office; I don't share that point of view. I think if you're a legacy provider, where most of your revenue is coming, I think people of anything are saying, like, I really got to get off those legacy platforms and so for us, there are definitely companies and their product lines for us that I think are actually being accelerated by the pandemic, where people just want to get off even faster than what they were planning on getting off before. That's helpful. And if I could ask just one quick follow-up for Chano, just around the sales and hiring comments, are there any particular product areas and/or geographies that you see could -- that there's a big opportunity where it's more of a function of just not having enough surf sales bandwidth, I was just wondering if any, maybe one or two either geographies and/or your product lines come up, I realize you're going to expand everywhere, but anything that stands out to you on that front? We're making investments, Kirk, in a number of areas within sales and marketing is more to help our growth efforts around the store base versus rest of the world markets, including our ME push in other countries, medium enterprise, some of the vertical markets as well, we’re moving forward with financials and then some of the newer areas like federal government.
So, it's a bit across the board, right, but clearly from the go-to-market perspective. And we think, as I said in my script that now is the time to do so. So, we kind of strengthen our pipeline for next year and maybe the year after, basically capitalize on those investments. Okay, great. Thank you all. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Yes, thank you and I'll add my congrats. Aneel, just on that last comment you made, I'm curious in a year or two, when we look back on the response to the pandemic, do you think it will have been a larger tailwind for the HCM side of the business because companies have to adjust to remote workforces and all the reskilling? Or do you see it more on the financial side because of a greater need to compress planning cycles and close the books remotely? In other words, where do you think the pain has been more acute, is it more on the HR side or more on the finance side? I think it's going to play out differently for the different product areas. So, for HR, everybody is worried about employee engagement and remote workforces right now. And so we continue to see very strong continued momentum in HR.
And finance, we had an excellent quarter selling finance, but I do believe there are some bigger projects that are being held off until post-pandemic and so the idea of starting a big project at a Fortune 500 company, we're getting those but probably not as much as I think we'll get post-pandemic. And I think I think when people come out of pandemic, they'll say I want to get rid of every legacy piece of technology I've got and I've got to move into the -- into this world of agile, flexible systems that, that support all different kinds of work environments and with our financial system, we've been able to close books remotely.
I would say the one area that continues to be very strong on the finance side is planning because people are under a lot of pressure to come up with new plans on a regular basis. I don't know how many times we've gone through a new planning cycle, since the pandemic started, but it's such a fluid, challenging environment that it's putting a lot of pressure on planning and I think that is driving that need for financials.
And then another area that we're seeing strong acceptance is actually in the area of scout and procurement because people are trying to get a handle on their supply chains and their costs during this environment, so. But I think core accounting is going to have a pop post-pandemic. Okay, great. And Robynne, if I can sneak in just a very quick one with the understanding that you're holding off on the guidance. Is this 14% to 16% subscription backlog growth guidance for Q4, arithmetically, I feel like perhaps that's a reasonable starting point on how we maybe could think about subscription revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 just given that'd be the glide path of exiting the year into pretty big bookings number, right, that that kind of waterfalls into the out year. I mean is there anything you would say to kind of dissuade us from at a high level thinking about it along those lines? Well, Mark, I would just say that, obviously, we'll be in a better position to talk about FY ‘22 subscription revenue after we get through Q4, particularly given how uncertain the environment is. The backlog guidance, as I mentioned before, considers a tough compare from Q4 of last year where we accelerated both net new bookings, growth and backlog growth. And we face that tough compare environment where we still see net new business headwinds. So, right now we're focused on continuing to execute well through Q4, we'll really have a better view in FY 2021 on our next earning call and we'll share that with you then. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord. You may proceed with your question. Yes. Hey, thanks, guys. So, Aneel, I think you hit on this a little bit last question, right, but the challenge that we're hearing from execs today is around, kind of employee engagement and preserving culture during the pandemic and look, I think a lot of that falls in the C suite, but some of it also to HR. So, I'm curious if there are opportunities, or considerations that kind of influence how you think about your HCM product roadmap, as you know, work from home or work from anywhere kind of becomes more permanent? Well, I've said this in the past, if there are trends that are beginning to take hold before an economic downturn, in many cases, they tend to get accelerated. And I talked about, like telemedicine, being one of those were telemedicine, they've been around for a long time, the pandemic hits and all of a sudden, it's exploding.
This idea of a talent marketplace, first internal and then external is one of those areas for us where if you're in a low hire mode, as a company, you're trying to get work done you really trying to understand the skills you have amongst employees, what skills do they need to add with reskilling and learning? And how can you source that work that needs to get done from your existing employee base. So, this idea of a talent marketplace has definitely gains traction and the idea of this gig worker project-based work, I think, is getting traction faster because of the environment we're in, I throw reskilling into that as well.
The other the other piece is much deeper understanding of trying to get a sense of how employees are feeling about their work environment, we all have heard mental health as an issue in the workforce today, given the remote work and so within Prism and within our People Analytics, we can do sentiment analysis and get a sense of with the polling questions that we do out of our HR system, get a sense of how people are doing.
I think you'll see more investment from us in a fairly significant way in employee engagement to really understand how we're doing as -- company-by-company, how we're doing -- or how they're doing relative to engaging their employees in a positive way.
And I probably one last thing is the big investment we're making in our -- in sharing our Vibe, our Vibe work, value, inclusion, belonging, and equity, creating an index, helping companies get a handle on their diversity and how they can be better. And that definitely has been accelerated by the environment we live in. So, actually quite a few changes as a result of this environment. Yes, yes. No, that makes sense. And if I could ask maybe one quick follow-up for Chano, any way to frame kind of what percent of new customer relationships land outside of core HR today and maybe you know how that compares to say two years ago or something when the product portfolio was narrower? I mean, clearly there is a -- David, there is a higher percentage slanting out there today and thus trend if anything is accelerating, both within net new customers as well within our installed base customers for some of those that were initially ASEAN customers are moving more to their financial.
And that is purely around core accounting systems or core financials where we announced we had hit 1,000 customers. But I think even most important as well that many of those are life unhappy and definitely, we have now many more levers to penetrate the office of the CFO with planning and procurement.
And those are really helping customers to navigate change these times. So, we've been talking about how many more planners, science, and experimental ourselves customer-ship doing today. So, clearly, those products are giving us a bigger and there are more landing in the area on the office of the CFO than there were before because our portfolio is broader. And certainly the interest is as well on the customers are moving off their legacy systems to then do simple things like closing their books remotely and having flexible and agile cloud systems that help them navigate these times has significantly increase.
And as we said before and what I see on the pipeline, we remain cautiously optimistic that there is going to be [Indiscernible] post-COVID on to that trend that we're seeing right now. Yes. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC. You may proceed with your question. Hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Maybe just the first one for you Aneel and Chano. If clearly the install base selling is inflecting this year 50% growth is quite an achievement, I guess where are we in that journey in terms of the -- as we look to Q4 and beyond how much room left is there in terms of install base monetization?
And if we think longer term, maybe Aneel, like when does that new ACV headwind start to turn? I know -- I'm not asking you to predict the course the pandemic, obviously, but just when you -- is it as easy as when you start pumping some of the COVID impacted quarters next year or do you see something changing before then? I'll address the product component. I hope the idea of install base selling just continues to get stronger and stronger because we're adding more and more SKUs to the portfolio that we can go back to our customers, they're happy. They made a bet on Workday, there are more things we can do for them.
And so you see it in the additional SKUs we're bringing to market most recent one being the talent marketplace, but also the Workday Accounting Center. So, we're constantly coming with SKUS to offer to our installed base.
In terms of the sales motion and how that works, I'll leave that to Chano. But you shouldn’t think of the product line is static, you should think of the product line is as ever growing, because there still is a lot of opportunity in HR for new modules and there's tons of opportunity in finance for new modules. Yes, I completely agree with Aneel, Alex, and hope you're doing well. I mean there are many, many new solutions that we've brought to market lately. I mean even -- of course, we've been talking Workday Strategic Sourcing, but if you think even products like learning or Prism Analytics or Workforce Planning, they're still far away in terms of the penetration ratios that we see a lot of areas like clearly payroll or cruising, or some of our more penetrated products these days. And we're adding new products like Health, People Analytics or Workday Extend. So, we had a great opportunity going forward there.
In terms of how do we see it in on the net new side? I mean, clearly, of course, next year, and especially H1, we have certainly better comps and easier comp the way has happened this year. Certainly, we'd see that some of the lockdowns, hopefully going away, will help us out, especially Rest of the World. And obviously, some of these new products even to penetrate new customers with some of the -- basically different levers that we do have today for HR or finance sales.
Definitely last but not least, if we -- some of the distress or more mostly heat verticals today, that hopefully will have a better -- there will be a better place clearly as we get into a world where there is a little bit more of the outside of the [Indiscernible]. So, those verticals will be opening up.
And then obviously some of the new markets that we're opening, right like federal, and so will be contributing. So, there are there are a number of levers I would say in rest of the world, that's what we found definitely more and more SKUs. Some of the new industries or let's say industries in terms being new -- in terms of that they not be much at play during the pandemic, but we'll be opening again, hopefully within the course of next year. Make sense. And then maybe just a quick one for Robynne, you talk about the kind of investing for growth strategy, which makes a lot of sense, given all the things that Chano just mentioned, but I guess from a -- I know we're not guiding, but if you look at the margin expansion this year, clearly, I don't think anybody is expecting anything close to that for next year. But is the guidance or the color that you're providing, is it fair to assume kind of a flat margins trajectory, dip in margins, or just a much smaller expansion? Yes, so Alex, investing for growth remains our top priority and we have a lot of opportunities ahead that we're excited about and we've been talking about how we're going to pick up the pace of investments in Q4 and through next year. And when you think about our 19% non-GAAP margin guidance for this year, it does almost 600 basis point improvement over FY 2020 and under normal circumstances that would take two to three years for us to have that kind of margin expansion. But obviously, this has been a very unique year.
So, we still need to get through Q4 and finalize our plan for next year, before we have a better view. But certainly, you can expect our pace of hiring to pick up in FY 2022. Some of the COVID benefits that we saw this year likely to subside, particularly in areas like travel and events.
And given all that it'd be reasonable to see our margins next year coming off of this year's level. You can see that investment starting to have an impact when you consider our Q4 margin guidance.
And then the last thing to keep in mind is that as we increase the pace of investment, you'll see an immediate impact on our expenses, while the resulting impact to revenue from those investments are going to take a little longer. Understood. Thank you so much and hope you guys are all staying safe and well. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. You may proceed with your question. Thank you and congratulations on a good quarter. I know it’s a lot of hard work went into it. So, two questions, if you don't mind. Chano with a worldwide lockdown continuing, how do you think about driving new deal generation? Do we need to see a return to traveling conferences to fill the top of the funnel? What do you replace the in-person meeting and conferences? Or is it just hiring more bodies and more advertising? I mean how's the business model from a sales point of view changing? And then a follow-up. Yes, no, it's a great question. I don't -- if I look at the pipeline, and again, remaining cautiously optimistic, we had not only a good Q3 in terms of execution, we had a very good Q3 in terms of pipeline creation, right?
We're kind of, again, shooting for kind of same dynamics into Q4, especially the focus around the pipeline and we're putting -- or we're doing these investments around sales and marketing, that they're not only the more and more feet on the street, clearly there is more feet on the street that we're planning on centers, and we see opportunity for growth. But obviously, it's also as well around marketing, investments, branding, and so on and so forth to support us in terms of our pipeline and demand generation efforts especially next year and year after, right?
Again, if I look at that strength, when I look pipeline creation, of course, you have net new customers, they are contributing and you have a course net new products or SKUs on to the installed base, right?
If I look at the trend I would say that the team has done a great job on managing it virtually up to this point and we got a lot of learnings. And clearly, if you would ask me the team will be anxious, and I would be anxious to get in front of customers, because I think that that plays better to what we do.
But I think we were fighting very nicely in that model and we're certainly learning on doing better and more efficiently. So, again, better to be in a pre-COVID world. If you ask me, I don't think we're going to be able to go back to similar levels of travel is going to be potentially more 30% to 50% less that people traveled before. But still that would be better than doing also remotely, but pipeline creation is being -- it has had a good performance on this environment Mark. Perfect, really helpful. Question, we focused more on deals often, but wanted to ask about the process of driving customers to go live. How is the lockdown change the complexity or the time it takes to drive customers to a live condition? Well, I would like to give a big shout out to Emily McEvilly and the team within Services because they've done a fantastic job with over 190 customers going live this quarter, but I thinks some of those are significantly relevant, right? When you think Walmart with 1.7 million employees going live during this period, or Accenture, with over 500,000 employees, or you think of UBS or GE, or you think Progressive Insurance, or financials -- core financials, all going live during this period.
Those have no minor accomplishment, right. So, I think that is a testament to the good work of the Services team of bringing them live fully remotely and we were doing pre-pandemic 80% and secondly, is a testament to our technology and the possibility to doing really flexible performance and scalability technology. So, and all those are happy to be honest, so that's a great place to be. Good. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Hi. This is Josh Baer on for Keith. With all of the conversation around pipeline and building pipeline and optimism there, I guess I’m wondering with the strength in results how should we think about the current pipeline today versus how it -- how compared to pre-COVID? Well, I think -- thank you, Josh for your question. This is Chano speaking. If the question is are we already at pre-COVID levels? We are not. We’d love to be there, but we are not yet at the pre-COVID levels. Of course, we -- let’s say that we are getting closer, but I think what you should think is we are cautiously optimism from our point of view in terms of what we’re seeing on demand generation and pipeline creation to help us deliver our growth or resources starting in Q4 and looking forward.
But then, obviously there is the second wave that’s well in front of us that is creating more near-term uncertainty for which we don’t know yet what is going to be the impact or how long it is going to take basically for all of us to get on the other side, right.
So, I guess there is this situation where we would like to know more as well in terms of how is the environment going to be evolving recognizing that we’re seeing gradual improvement, at least for our business and where we deliver and the stabilization and certainly we are in a much better place right now than we were at the beginning of the pandemic back in March, April timeframe. Great. And I’m just curious if you have any insights into what you’re seeing internationally as there is different COVID waves and lockdown government responses in different countries. Is there any difference in buying behavior that you’re seeing in different geographic locations? Thanks. Thank you, Josh. No, we still see a big opportunity ahead of us in the rest of the world market and we’re certainly optimistic around the opportunity. And that’s why we are making a big part of our investments that we’re making right now and planning to make because we -- as the contribution of the international revenue mix continues to grow higher and we see it continuing to growing higher over a medium and long-term, right.
Clearly, there are countries that have been going and suffering a lockdown and that has had some impact and some headwinds in terms of the net new business and maybe of course our installed base is not yet as large as it is in the U.S.
And I think we’re amazingly prepared to have a fantastic year in international ahead of the pandemic. The leadership is still there and it’s really driving in terms of this pipeline creation [Indiscernible] and we are really excited again as we are getting onto the other end. And some of those markets are opening in terms of being a significant growth contributor to our journey forward. Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Thank you. I’ve got two for Robynne. Robynne if you don’t mind can we go back to the 4Q subscription backlog guidance of 14% to 16%? So, that’s a seven to nine point decel from 3Q. But it’s actually only a one point tougher compare. So maybe you could elaborate on the compare comment you made. Maybe you meant on the net new ACV front.
And then also, is there any duration compression that might be impacting that 4Q number and if not just generally whether this reflects a demand backdrop that feels just incrementally tougher perhaps than what Workday saw in 2Q and 3Q? Thanks. Yes. So, the backlog while certainly an important forward-looking metric is not a precise gauge as you know. It’s impacted by things like duration, which -- and maybe I’ll go to your second question now, we did see increased duration in Q3 that we do not expect to repeat in Q4. So, that’s part of it. Also the timing of renewals have an impact, which can move around. And so, those are things that just to keep into account when you’re looking at our guide.
We have seen some stability in the environment over the past couple of quarters, which along with the strong execution has helped drive some of the backlog results in the past few quarters. But the guide does consider this tough compare. And when we look at last Q4, we did accelerate net new bookings and reaccelerate the backlog growth.
And so that’s the tough compare that we’re facing in an environment that remains very, very uncertain. And so we’ve taken all that into account in our guide and we’ll obviously be able to tell you more next quarter. But Q4 is a big quarter for us and we’re right now focused on executing against that quarter. Okay. That’s helpful, Robynne. Thanks for unpacking that a little bit. And then my second question is just on the go-lives that Aneel commented on earlier, kind of an amazing go-live quarter for Workday. Actually, if I cut them all, Walmart, Accenture, UPS, GE, that’s a lot of very large go-lives. Did any of those or collectively did they trigger any milestones that might have impacted the 3Q numbers in anyway? Thank you. I don’t know if they triggered any milestones in terms of the number. I leave that to you Robynne. Again as Chano mentioned just very appreciative and proud of Emily and our team and our -- and I’d say our business partners as well who figured out how to get these large customers live during this pandemic.
And one of those going live in the quarter would be terrific having four of them go live in the same time frame. That’s really remarkable from a services perspective and as far as I know they’re all so very happy. And maybe I’ll just add that as you know, most of our implementations are run by our partners and don’t result in professional services revenue to Workday. So, we do prime about 20% of them. And while we do have some revenues that can get driven by milestone on fixed fee contracts, there really wasn’t anything to call out in the quarter in terms of big milestones net driving revenue. Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Firstly, you mentioned Workday Accounting Center a few times which we’ve been hearing about more recently from the field. Can you help us understand what exactly is it, how do you see it impacting your competitive positioning and perhaps what is it replacing and why? Chano, do you want to take that one on? Why don't you take that one? Pete, why don’t you take that one? Yeah, Pete take it on and then maybe Chano just talk about where we’re competing. Yes. So, Accounting Center has been really important for us in being able to open up certain verticals, especially like the financial services vertical for Financials and you did hear us earlier talk about how it helped us in the Fifth Third Bank win this quarter and a few of the previous bank wins that we’ve had in previous quarters.
So, to answer your question what is it. Accounting Center is a way for our customers to bring in all of their operational data and bring it into Workday and secure it then do accounting on it and have that accounting roll up into their GL.
So, if you were, for instance, in the insurance industry and you wanted to take a look at something that is happening at the GL level, but you want to go all the way back and go back to the individual policies and claims, for instance, you’d be able to do that right inside of Workday.
This is replacing a lot of data management infrastructure that would otherwise have to be managed by the CFO and the CIO and our customers are finding its value of having it in a single system and being able to do all the analysis and get their answers right there in front of them. Cool. Thank you very much for that. Maybe if I could just ask a follow-up of Chano, another pipeline question. And I appreciate your comments which sound very encouraging. But maybe just to dig a little bit deeper as you analyze and scrub the pipeline and you look at opportunities that are pushing out versus maybe shrinking in size but still closing versus competitive losses, sorry to bring those up.
But if you break it down into various stages and consider things like time to close and forecast accuracy and how that’s all changing, what are some of the more detailed takeaways that you can share that tell the story of what’s actually happening in the field and in the environment right now and ultimately support your confidence? On this environment -- thank you for the question, Brad. On this environment the most sticky, let’s say, impact that we can see is kind of push opportunities more than any other thing a few quarters ahead. And that, of course, comes because of the uncertainty of the environment and basically some customers maybe net new customers in some industries especially with the hardest hit industries there is, yes, more uncertainty and they are more basically balancing out which are the projects that they should be starting if any at all and which ones that are not, right. So, I would say that the highest impact there potentially is as you know potential push opportunities going farther into a few quarters, more than any other change, right.
We haven’t seen any changes in terms of competitive and kind of momentum over there. Thank you for bringing it up. But that’s the one that, of course, is more depending on these uncertainties of environment than any other lines.
So, we remain very focused on the -- clearly on the pipeline creation efforts and maturing and we have had great conversion of rates and ratios on these last two quarters, Q2 and Q3. But when we look forward, and again, we are looking optimistically to Q4, we’ve got to be respectful in terms of how is the growth, this uncertainty and this second wave is going to be evolving. Thank you so much for the color and for taking the questions. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Robynne, not to dwell on the Q4 backlog guide, but I don’t think you’ve ever seen a 800 point decel at midpoint. So, I think I was just asking did something happen in Q3 where some of these deals got pulled into the backlog from Q4 or we realize obviously environment, but I think I was just trying to reconcile this? And I think we haven’t seen it in the model in the past. Yes. So, no, nothing happened to the backlog -- I’m sorry, the pipeline in Q4 still looks good where we continue to execute well. When you look at the combination of duration which helped us in Q3 and Q2, very, very tough compare from last year in pre-COVID days and all the uncertainty that we’re seeing and the law of large numbers. This is just our best view right now, Brent.
And so it’s obviously our biggest quarter of the year. A lot of uncertainties still out there, even though we have seen things stabilize. And so we’re just focused on execution. This is the best that we have so far in terms of our view in the backlog and we will obviously update you next quarter. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a bigger picture question on M&A. Scout has obviously done well; Adaptive has done well over time. Now that you’ve incorporated those businesses, how does that change how you think about inorganic activity, especially given the comments in the call today about sort of ramping investments into next year? Thanks. I don’t know if it changes our view. I think it just gives us confidence that if we find the right kind of company that is a good fit culturally, that is an innovative growth company and that’s complementary from a technology perspective not overlapping that that is something that we now feel very comfortable.
Tom Bogan has really led that effort that. We feel comfortable we can integrate those companies into Workday, but also with the commitment that over time we will harmonize the technologies so we don’t become a Frankenstein like some of our legacy competitors have become. It’s really important that we can maintain that unified view across our applications and so that’s -- and that’s key to driving it.
So, I think you’ll see more from us for sure coming down the pipe, but I also think they’re going to fit the -- they are going to fit the Adaptive and Scout models. It’s not going to be a -- I don’t see us doing a big acquisition that is overlapping technology wise. I think that’s just -- that actually slows us down. Great. Appreciate the color and best of luck in the fourth quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEO; Robynne Sisco, our president and CFO; Tom Bogan, our Vice Chairman; and Pete Schlampp, our executive vice president of product development .",0.0

And with that, I will now hand it over to Mr. Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Welcome to Workday's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Robynne Sisco, our President and CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Executive Vice President of Product Development. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our Web site where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic condition. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company Web site under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers’ page of our Web site includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our first quarter quiet period begins on April 16, 2021. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2020.
With that, I will turn it over to Chano to share go-to-market highlights in the quarter. He will then turn it over to Aneel, who will provide updates on the strategy and innovation front, and then Robynne will close with our financials and guiding. We will then open the line up for your questions. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Justin. I hope all of you joining us today are in good health and that your families are doing well. It has been a challenging few months of the pandemic, but there is significant cause for optimism. We had a very strong growth through the year as companies increasingly realize that HR and finance are the true backbone of their digital transformation. This realization is leading to significant pipeline improvement. And as we enter FY22, we are well positioned to drive accelerated new bookings growth. Our solid results were driven by another quarter of strong execution of high conversion rates. We once again drove strength in North America, with vertical standouts in education and government, healthcare and the professional services market. Both the large and medium enterprise teams outperformed, driven by continued momentum in our installed base efforts, as well as improving performance in our net new business.
The strength in our HCM solutions was a critical contributor to our Q4 performance with notable customer additions in the quarter, including Nike, ABB, Anthem, Cognizant Worldwide, Cox Enterprises, Ferrovial Corporacion, First Rank Bank, Laboratory Corporation of America and Peakon paid retailers. We also saw significant uptake across our newer solutions that support the office of the CHRO, including People Analytics, Alpine Journeys and Talent Marketplace. By leveraging these applications, organizations are addressing and fundamentally rethinking important questions like how to end institutional bias, how to reshape the workforce to meet today's demands and how to spot the engagement risk and execution line response.
The FINS plus solutions also had a strong quarter and continues to represent an increasing percentage of our new business mix. We have several strategic core FINS wins in Q4, including a Fortune 500 win of Franklin Tempesto, which included Accounting Center, Minnesota State Colleges and universities, Sentry Insurance, the University of Maryland, College Park, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We are excited by the accelerated pipeline of FINS opportunities, including emerging use cases with enterprise financing product based industries like retail and manufacturing, where recent wins include one of the nation's largest pizza chain, Zoomies and exporting goods retailer with over 1,000 stores. And we once again saw solid demand for our suite of products that support the office of the CFO and Chief Procurement Officer, including Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics as well as Workday Strategic Sourcing and our broader Spend Management solutions.
Our installed base team also had another solid performance with more than 40% growth in new ACV bookings in Q4 against a very difficult comparison, a more than 50% growth for full year FY21. This team's execution was critical in driving growth over the past year and we remain very optimistic that with an ever expanding product portfolio, we can continue to increase customer wallet share in the years ahead. Our customer success and services organization also executed incredibly well, taking more than 250 for HCM and FINS customers live in the quarter. Ensuring customer success has always been a core value for us at Workday and I'm incredibly proud of how our services team and our partners have responded in this environment, helping to take light, and virtually, I might add, a record number of workers on the Workday platform in FY21.
Personally, one of the Q4 highlights was around our pipeline efforts. As we have described over the last two earnings calls, our pipeline generation has been improving since the onset of the pandemic. And I am pleased to say that trends continue and meaningfully accelerated in Q4 with record pipeline generation across all three regions. We still see some pipeline impact from COVID impacted industries, but those headwinds appear to be lessening. The pipeline strength that we have seen along with the stabilization in new business demand drives our expectation that new business growth will accelerate in FY22.
On the personnel side, I wanted to congratulate my good friend Doug Robinson on his recent promotion to EVP of Global Sales. Doug has been incredibly impactful over his 10 years plus at Workday, most recently serving as Head of North America Sales with an impressive track record, where he not only played an instrumental role in helping us win some of the world's biggest brands, but he also established high levels of operational and sales excellence across our North America region that have been critical to Workday's growth. In his new role, Doug will lead our global sales efforts, reporting directly to me, helping us to accelerate our FINS momentum, while continuing to expand our international footprint. Congratulations Doug, and I look forward to our continued partnership. Finally, before handing it over to Aneel, and on behalf of the entire Workday leadership team, I would like to express thanks to all of our workmates across the globe. Your response to this challenging environment has been nothing short of amazing, and your resiliency has set us up for a strong year ahead.
With that, I will turn it over to our Co-Founder and CEO, Aneel Bhusri. Over to you, Aneel. Thanks, Chano, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. Last August, we shared the exciting news of Chano's promotion to Co-CEO. In six months in, I couldn't be happier with the positive impact of this change. Chano has always been at the center of our go to market and customer-facing activities, while allowing me more time to focus on our product strategy and innovation. This increased focus could not have come at a more important time. Our innovation cadence has accelerated and we're excited to continue to bring out market leading innovation to support our customers. Chano touched upon our successes in expanding our presence within our customer base. A big part of the success was driven by the introduction of new products. Indeed, in the last three years, we have delivered 50% more in terms of monetizable solutions as compared to the prior three years.
As the trends around digital transformation and acceleration continue unabated and with the increasing gap of what traditional legacy ERP can deliver and what our customers need, Workday finds itself in a unique position to not only help companies close this gap through a new class of enterprise management cloud but also to truly serve as the backbone of their digital transformation. We are enabling digital transformation journeys for more than 8,000 customers, including over 3,500 core HR and finance customers and we're excited to go further with them on this journey, and to embark on a new journey with our next wave of customers.
This concept of accelerated business change has been a core design principle since we founded the company. Workday enables organizations to turn transactional silos into a complete unified picture, hardwired processes into responsive automation and periodic into real time and continuous planning, execution and analysis. And our solutions aren't simply providing and accelerating existing processes but we're helping thousands of companies fundamentally rethink the way they run their business. Many of these customers have relied on Workday to help them transform their organizations, including hundreds of customers that went live in Q4, such as Caterpillar, Comcast Cable, Cisco Systems, PF Changs and Spectrum Health.
The world of finance is also being significantly impacted by the trends surrounding digital transformation. Listening to our customers and how they were dealing with all this change, we decided to design and build Accounting Center, one of our most exciting products in recent memory and one that is now generally available. Built on an analytics engine, Workday Accounting Center ingests, enriches and transforms operational transactions into accounting. Customers can gain insight into rich accounting detail with complete data lineage for drill back for source transactions, empowering them to report faster and reduce time to close. With this new offering as part of a broader suite of our enterprise finance solutions that includes Prism Analytics, Planning and Consolidations, we're now able to address a broader part of the finance market, including product based industries, such as retail and manufacturing. These industries must maintain their existing ERP and industry specific on-premise systems, but want to use Workday to bring corporate finance functions into the cloud. It's one of the several emerging and exciting opportunities that grows our addressable market within the financial management solutions marketplace.
On the ATM front, I'm proud to say that we are supporting customers in their efforts to prepare for a post pandemic world. In Q4, we announced a vaccine management solution that provides leaders with insights to create a healthier workforce and a safer workplace. We've also seen strong interest in other timely solutions, such as VIBE Index and VIBE Central, which we announced last year and we already have more than 500 customers live. These customers are now equipped to better view and analyze the diversity and representation of their workforce in one centralized place. One area in HCM that has accelerated during the pandemic is employee engagement. With so many companies dealing with remote workers, getting a sense of how employees are feeling about the organization, their manager and their work became paramount. While Workday had been focused on employee engagement for several years and had introduced capabilities, such as pulse surveys, we realized we had to offer more capabilities to our customers. That insight led us to Peakon, one of the acknowledged market leaders in this fast growing space and a company built around a machine learning first approach.
By bringing our product offerings together, Peakon will allow Workday to greatly enhance our capabilities across several key areas, including understanding the voice of the employee, providing more robust capability in agile performance management and becoming an engine to further our VIBE solutions as the most comprehensive on the market. I'm looking forward to welcoming the more than Peakon 250 employees, who will soon become workmates, including Co-Founder and CEO, Phil Chambers, who will continue as CEO of Peakon and will report directly to Tom Bogan. We're all excited about our future together. As we look forward to Workday's next chapter, I'm excited by the opportunity that is in front of us, and I'm very grateful to our employees for their dedication to innovation and customer success during these very challenging times.
With that, I'll turn it over to our President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Aneel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chano and Aneel mentioned, we executed incredibly well in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the strategic and mission critical nature of our solutions and the resiliency in our business during these unprecedented times. Subscription revenue was $1.01 billion in Q4, our first ever quarter over the $1 billion mark, representing growth of 20%. For the full year, subscription revenue was $3.79 billion, growth of 22%. Professional services revenue was $125 million for Q4 and $530 million for the full year.
Fourth quarter revenue outside the US was $283 million, representing 25% of total revenue. Subscription revenue backlog was $10.09 billion, growth of 22% and our first ever quarter above $10 billion in backlog. The outperformance was driven by better than expected new bookings against a very difficult comparison in addition to strong renewals, with gross and net retention rates over 95% and 100% respectively. Backlog also benefited from a notable lengthening of average contract duration for both new customers and renewals. Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next 24 months was $6.53 billion, growth of 19%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $211 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 19%. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was a record $867 million or 20% of total revenue, up more than 650 basis points from FY20. This expansion was driven by a continued scale in efficiencies, a reduced pace of hiring and other COVID related moderation of expenses, including reduced spend for travel and events. Operating cash flow for Q4 was $554 million, growth of 86%, bringing our full year operating cash flow to $1.27 billion, 47% growth. Record cash flow results were driven by strong cash collections as well as the substantial operating margin expansion. Our total workforce at the end of the year stood at more than 12,500 employees and we have begun to ramp up hiring for FY22. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong company wide execution in our seasonally most important quarter.
Turning now to guidance. Although the environment remains uncertain, we are encouraged by our momentum in recent quarters and have seen an improvement in both close rates and pipeline growth. We're cautiously optimistic that the environment will continue to improve as we move through FY22, driving a faster pace of digital transformation initiatives across HR and finance. We are focused on driving accelerated bookings growth this year, which we expect will ultimately result in a faster pace of future subscription revenue growth. When thinking about our subscription revenue growth for FY22, however, keep in mind that while we executed well this past year, we still experienced headwinds to new bookings. As I mentioned in last quarter, these headwinds have implications for this year's subscription revenue growth, given the lag effects caused by subscription revenue accounting rules inherent in SaaS businesses.
With that context, we expect FY22 subscription revenue to be in the range of $4.38 billion to $4.40 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes the pending Peakon acquisition, which we anticipate closing later this quarter and is expected to contribute less than 1 percentage point to our subscription revenue growth in FY22. For the first quarter of FY22, we expect subscription revenue to be between $1.018 billion and $1.020 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth at the high end. Keep in mind that because of the leap year in FY21, we have one less day of revenue recognition in Q1 than we did in the year ago period, representing a nearly $12 million impact to Q1 subscription revenue and affecting both our sequential and year-over-year growth rates. We expect subscription revenue to sequentially increase from the previous quarter by just under 6% in Q2 and approximately 4% in Q3 and 4.5% in Q4.
From a backlog perspective, last year, we saw a lengthening of overall contract duration, providing more predictability in our future revenue while also adding to total backlog growth during FY21. While we have historically guided to total backlog, given that variations in contract length are difficult to forecast and can impact total backlog growth by several percentage points in either direction, we now feel it's appropriate to guide to 24 month backlog, which will help isolate fluctuations and contract duration. When considering 24 month backlog, keep in mind that the two primary drivers of growth are net new bookings and the timing of renewals. For FY22, we believe net new bookings will have a positive impact on backlog growth given our expectation of new business reacceleration.
When we look at the historical impact of renewals on backlog growth, we have consistently seen growth each year in the amount of ACV up for renewal, making renewals a positive contributor to backlog growth. In FY22, however, the ACV up for renewal is relatively flat compared to FY21. This dynamic is purely a function of the mix of historical contract lengths but will serve as a headwind on both the 24 month and total backlog growth for this fiscal year. From what we see today, this headwind will not persist beyond FY22 and we expect the renewal base will grow again in FY23. With all this as context, we expect the 24 month backlog to grow approximately 18% in Q1 of FY22. We're expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $139 million in Q1 and $590 million for the full year. This represents a return to growth in professional services revenue, driven by our expectation of improved new business trends. We will continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.
From a margin standpoint, this past year, we demonstrated the long term scalability inherent in our model. Investing for growth remains priority number one, however, and in FY22, we expect to increase our pace of hiring across the company but with a focus on sales, marketing and product, specifically targeted at accelerating pipeline growth and advancing our strategic product roadmap. Included in these investments are increased marketing and brand campaigns as well as significant planned growth in quota carrying rep capacity. With this context and an estimated 100 basis point dilution from Peakon, we expect our FY22 non-GAAP operating margin to be 17%. We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 19% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process.
The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26 and 24 percentage points lower respectively than the non-GAAP margins. Further, we expect our stock based compensation expense as a percent of revenue will decline by approximately 1.5% this year, starting a multiyear trend of improvements in this metric. The FY22 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect operating cash flow in FY22 to be approximately $1.2 billion, down slightly from record levels in FY21, driven by the ramp in growth investments. We expect to invest approximately $170 million in Q1 of FY22 for owned real estate investments as we finalize the purchase of five buildings at our Pleasanton campus that we currently lease. This purchase is important to our headquarter strategy and affords us control of our core campus buildings.
We expect to spend roughly $270 million in FY22 to support all other capital needs. This includes investments in lease facilities, corporate IT infrastructure and customer data centers to support our continued business expansion. These data center investments, along with other investments we're making in our technology and platform, including our entrance into the federal market and our expanded use of the public cloud, are expected to reduce our non-GAAP subscription gross margins to slightly under 85% in FY22. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allows us to deliver great results during an unprecedented year. We are more confident than ever in the long term opportunity ahead and look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress throughout the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. I'm trying to reconcile the strength in the quarter. Congratulations, that's a fantastic quarter. You've seen accelerating backlog growth for the past four quarters, and you're talking about accelerating pipeline growth going forward. Yet, I can really understand the new business bookings were somewhat challenged. But I'm also trying to reconcile all the positives against the outlook of fiscal '22 subscription revenue growth here. Maybe if you could just shed a little bit finer light on how we should expect the shape of fiscal '22 to unfold? And obviously, the point is well taken that getting out of fiscal '22 into '23, we could see even better trends. So can you just paint the shape of the recovery? And where do we bottom out in terms of subscription revenue growth, when are we likely to see the acceleration based on all the good things we're hearing from you guys? Thank you so much, and congrats again. I'll take the first pass, which is the metric that we run the business on at Workday is growth in bookings. And we're really excited about what we see over the next 12 months. Subscription growth bookings is a derivative of that number. And as you know, subscription accounting is based on multiple years factoring into that. So I wouldn't look too much at subscription gross bookings. And I would try to figure out what we're actually doing in this next year, which is a reacceleration on the fiscal front. And then maybe I'll ask Chano and Robynne to add a few comments to that. So as you know, our subscription revenue this year is really a direct result of the headwinds to that new business that we experienced last year, and we've been previewing this the last couple of quarters. So that's an important point. I'd also point out that we've been saying for a while now that our goal has been to flatten the declining growth curve and then ultimately reaccelerate. And as you can tell by the fact that our Q1 revenue guide growth is the same as our full year, this is the year we expect to flatten that curve, which is a really positive thing. And then to Aneel's point, if we can reaccelerate the bookings growth, which we absolutely believe we can then that will ultimately lead potentially to subscription revenue acceleration. But there's a lag there, so it's going to take some time. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Great to hear all the positive news. I'm wondering if you can provide any insight into the internals of the financials business the last two to three quarters. Is it safe to assume that, that bookings mix of the core general ledger softened up a bit just because of macro uncertainty, and maybe that pivoted more toward planning and scout and those other areas? Just trying to understand the magnitude of any shift there. And then moving forward, what do you think is the main catalyst that a finance team is focused on to say, now we're looking at the right conditions to modernize the general ledger and maybe bite off a bigger chunk that would give you a tailwind? Let me just cite some Gartner data that we got a few months ago, and I think it's instructive for how the market is working today. So they let us know that core accounting or core finance inquiries were down 14%. Core planning inquiries were up, I think, close to 30%. And as the pandemic eases, what they also said was that while many of the core accounting projects were going to be delayed, the ones that were in '23 and '24 and '25 were getting suck forward, because people realized that they needed to start on that digital transformation journey for financials. And so while it's been a tough time for financials during the pandemic, I actually think from here on now it's going to get accelerated. But I really want to let Chano comment on this. FINS is certainly a key part of the reacceleration story, Mark, and we are seeing more of these opportunities coming to market. And not only did we see improvements in our FINS business in Q4, several strategic wins that we mentioned, but we also have solid FINS pipeline growth as well. But it is broader than core FINS, as you’ve highlighted. It is a broader solution set and we're selling into the office of the CFO, which also includes spend management, analytics and our planning solutions, as Aneel was highlighting. So we're really meeting our customers where they are in the journey. And there are emerging opportunities to our entire enterprise finance solution, which leverages Prism and Accounting Center, where we're now better positioned to go after product based industries like retail and manufacturing, and that opportunity we did to have before. So we're widening our addressable market. If I could just add one more thing that we had a business plan going into the year pre-COVID. And without going into the details -- I can't go into the details of how close we were, but we were in shouting distance of our original plan around our overall business. And if you would told me that in April of last year, I would not believed that. And so it's a great testament to our team. But also the fact that digital transformation is accelerating and the folks that were not on cloud platforms realize they needed to be. And so it's one of the drivers of our optimism going forward. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. It's good to hear the momentum is going back into the business. Chano, I guess this would probably be a question for you. This quarter you guys saw good durability in that upsell, brought that new ACV up over 40% on a year-on-year basis. And if I'm not mistaken, this is the first quarter that you're anniversary-ing a really tough comp. I think you guys told us it was like up 50% in the quarter ago. So how does that -- can you talk to us about sort of whether that type of strength is possible, or it could be durable into the year ahead? Can you continue to see that type of growth coming from the upsell motion? And any sense you could give us in terms of what percentage of the overall kind of new businesses that represent today? As we highlighted, we had another fantastic quarter with 40% plus growth in add-on sales, and that makes kind of 50% for the whole year. That it was really driven across a lot of different products, including core FINS, Financials, Workforce Planning, Prism Analytics, Learning and Workday Strategic Sourcing. But some of them were products as well as contributing, like Accounting Center, People Analytics, Extend and heath also contributed especially in the last quarter at those products were earlier in the year, meaning in the beginning of the year. So we see nice strength in pipeline build from our store based teams.
And there is a lot of momentum on this effort as we enter into FY22. And definitely, this is a certain area where we are strengthening our investments as well that Robynne is commenting in terms of our investments on what are carriers. So in terms of the mix, it is definitely becoming a much more significant contributor of our new business in FY21, the business that is coming from the upsell and the cross sell. And we expect that over the medium term, our growth will become increasingly more balanced between the new and installed base sales. But we have a lot of emerging opportunities believe that will accelerate this year, and we're seeing signs of that in the pipeline as well, Keith. And then maybe one for Robynne, just on the margin side of the equation. Definitely understand that there's some -- I mean, there's some inorganic pressures that you have on the operating margins going into the year ahead. And then there's also just a reacceleration in spend against a subscription revenue line that amortizes off the balance sheet versus kind of marks what's going on in real time. And then there's also some sort of T&E spending and the like that didn't take place in FY21 that take place in FY22. Can you help us -- on those last two, can you help us kind of foot like how much comes from the first versus the second or more pointedly, what's the overhang that you guys experienced from sort of T&E coming back? T&E, we don't expect it to really come back until near the end of the year, Keith. And even though we're not quite sure exactly, we don't believe it's going to come back 100%. So we expect that pace to continue to be slower. So we really are focusing more when you look at increases in the spending around headcount. We were relatively flat in hiring last year. We did some strategic hiring, we're relatively flat. We're going to be hiring now across all areas of the company with, as I mentioned, specific focus on investments and sales as well as in product to take advantage of the great opportunity that we see in front of us. We're going to spend more nonheadcount wise in marketing, which we think now is the time. We've seen great momentum in the pipeline generation. We think we can help that out by turning up the dial on operating spend. And then investments in infrastructure, technology, data centers, really just across the board that you see just amazing growth opportunity ahead of us, and now it's the time for us to invest towards that. So this is subscription model, right? The subscription line reflects what happened last year in terms of billings and deferred revenue buildup, but you need to invest this year for a better demand environment. And that mismatch, that's what's pressuring your margins in the year ahead? That's exactly right. Your investment always have to take place before you're going to see the impact in your subscription revenue line. And if you take out the impact of Peakon of 100 basis points, we're largely back on that trajectory we were before last year. And so we're just getting back to business and back to normal, and we feel really good that now is the time to make those investments. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Congrats on the result and that's great to hear about the pipeline builds going into this year. Along this line, Chano, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the international market opportunity. What you've seen in that theater or in those theaters, maybe also where you think core FINS is internationally? Obviously, the US saw HCM take off first and then since it’s been sort of trailing. I'm kind of curious whether or not core FINS can maybe land at more of -- at the same time, maybe not the same accounts, but at the same time or proportionally in some of these international markets that are a little bit smaller? Thanks. As you know, as you said, we are much earlier days in penetrating international markets relative to where we are in the US, but we see a big opportunity in the rest of the world. And we are very optimistic around this opportunity and what it means for us. I think we also saw a bit more impact from COVID in the rest of the world market that we have seen here in the US. And I think it's really when we get to the other side of COVID, we should see accelerated momentum that is fully reflected on the numbers. And why I believe so is because the good news is that the pipeline is certainly improving in the rest of the world markets, and I expect that there would be a key contributor to the acceleration this year too.
In terms of financials, I would say that I don't think the gap is as big in terms of lagging behind what we saw in HCM, Kirk. We're seeing good wins in international in similar verticals, mainly in financial services and professional services and some hospitality. And now with Enterprise Finance, we are expecting as well and with Accounting Center that we can see into broader industries and some product industries. But initially, we're more focused on the services industry and clearly some of the most mature countries like the UK, I would say, France and Germany, we're seeing and we have already a nice customer base of core FINS customers that are becoming basically happy and referenceable. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. I wanted to ask about the vertical pipeline. Obviously, you're seeing some real success in some of these key verticals for FINS. And as you know, financials is not a one size fits all, and you've done a tremendous job of adding more vertical functionality, and I think, seeing some of the traction in some of these verticals that you're citing with some of these wins here. I guess my question is, if you look across the verticals where you made investment for FINS, where do you feel best? Is there one that is ramping perhaps faster than others where perhaps the vertical functionality is ahead of the others, others that we should expect more in the future? Any commentary on just the vertical pipeline across the different key verticals for FINS. Brad, I think there are three I would highlight. One would be clearly financial services. The other one would be healthcare, and those are very significant deals for us. And the other one would be state and local and government not sad at all. And on those three where we made investments, we're seeing very good traction in terms of the maturity of the solution but in terms of our customer wins and our conversion ratios. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. For me, obviously, the success you're having upselling add-ons in the installed base is very encouraging here, which leads to my question on Peakon. I know it's still very early. But as you think about this employee experience market, it is moving fast. Microsoft made a big splash last month. SAP did a partial spin of Qualtrics. You're seeing new VC funding into Culture Amp, Lattice, next thing. What's been the early feedback so far on Peakon? How is it different? And how quickly could you scale the attach rate in the installed base? Thanks. I'll take the first two parts and let Chano address the third. This is a hot space. There's no question about it. We actually had good offerings in the space. And then COVID hit and the demand for more insight into how employees were feeling during this period of time just exploded. And Peakon, if you look at all the magic quadrants and analyst reports, they're the leader. They're the best. And we looked at what we were doing and said, we can get there, but not at a time that matters because the market is happening now, and these guys were the market leader. So we couldn't be more thrilled to have them as part of Workday. And it's become a super high priority item for every CEO, CHRO to understand employee sentiment. In terms of -- the other thing I'd add is, they were a very cool machine learning first application. They countered on that machine learning to drive them to better insights. And that's the way that we want to go as well. So we're super excited about that synergy on that front. And in terms of upsell opportunity, I'll turn it over to Chano. Brent, clearly it has not closed yet, right? So I just wanted to mention that. But we are really excited when the deal closes and we are cautiously optimistic that it's going to be a fantastic one. We have some great learnings out of Adaptive and Scout that certainly are going very well. But as Aneel is saying, this is such a hot space. They had a great solution. The majority of their presence is in Europe, but they already have some nice flagship logo in the US. And clearly, with our distribution channel in the US and again, cautiously optimistic that this is going to be fantastic, what we can do to better. Great. Well, sounds good and we’ll be watching this one closely. Thanks. And I would just like to add that, again, even though it has not closed, the initial customers' feedback is very good. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Robynne, I think you mentioned this a bit, but could you give a little additional color. Last quarter, you discussed the expectation of contract duration decreasing for billings both on the new contract side and on the renewal side. Can you give us a little more color on how big an impact did this really have and how do you see that in terms of the pipeline in terms of what you think those contracts are going to be? Are they going to be shorter? Are they going to be a return to what we've seen in the past? Thank you. Mark, when we were forecasting total backlog, it's really hard for us to forecast the duration and you saw that this past quarter in Q4. And the best way to really measure that impact is if you look at the 24 month backlog growth, it was 19% in Q4. The total backlog growth was 22%. So that differential in growth rate is due to increase in duration, which we had not been able to foresee when we first entered into the quarter and had our earnings call. So that's, frankly, one of the big reasons we decided to move forward guiding 24 month backlog is because that really takes a lot of that guess work around duration coming out.
We did see a lengthening on durations in Q4 across both net new contracts as well as renewals, which was a really interesting dynamic. Overall, we let our customers drive the length of contracts that they want but we see longer contracts as a positive for us as you don't have renewal risk as often. So if customers are entering the longer contracts and then renewing under longer contracts, then that takes away some of the risk to your revenue for nonrenewal. So we like that dynamic. We just are going to let our customers continue to drive that. So it's difficult to predict. And I don't know, Chano, if you want to add anything to what you're seeing? I would just say that -- as we said, we have to expand our guardrails in place for contracts, but we really don't incentivize our sales teams on total contract value. So it's really driven more by customers than any other thing. So I think that the fact that customers are signing longer and longer contracts, which sometimes can be five to seven years longer, I think it's rare in the enterprise software and really speaks to the strategic nature of Workday and the trust that customers place on us. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Chano, I have one question for you. It's just around the increase in the sales and hiring comments this fiscal year. I was just wondering if there's any particular product area or geography where you see that there's a big opportunity where it's more a function of just not having enough of the sales bandwidth. Does anything stand out to you as you increase your growth investments in this year's fiscal plan? Thanks. I mean, we're making investments in a number of areas within sales and marketing, helping support our growth efforts, because we see the opportunity is clearly there. And it is in the areas like installed base team, the rest of the world markets, our ongoing efforts in mid market to push in new countries, some of the vertical markets and then some new areas like the federal government. So it's clearly across the organization. So there will be marketing and presales, current securities and certain marketing and brand investments as well. So really, this is about driving the pipeline and bookings growth and basically chase the opportunity that we've been creating, and we have ahead of us to invest in capitalizing on our -- a bit across the board. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. As you guys think about the acceleration of the potential for acceleration in billings in fiscal '23 and beyond. Does that the underlying sort of foundation of that, the split between HCM and financials look different going forward or do you expect it to be similar to where we are today? Thanks. Well, I would just say, the HR world was already pre pandemic full into the mode of cloud first and almost every function in HR was moving to the cloud as clear as they could. Finance was not at that same place. And so during the pandemic, we saw companies that were moving to finance to the cloud, we saw other people saying, hey, let's just wait until we get out of the pandemic and then we want to move forward. The most optimistic thing that I learned over the last 12 months around finances, the ones that the customers that were using legacy finance systems were challenged to run their business and said, we need to move to a modern finance system. And if you look at all the Gartner data, that means that finance is going to be a pretty hot area over the next two to three years. Is there anything you want to add, Chano? Not much. I think we saw improvement on new ACV in Q4 across both of the areas. But even it's more encouraging, the pipeline signs across both HCM and FINS plus, both for new opportunities as well as the solid traction on the installed base. So I guess we see opportunities in both. And if I could add just one thing that we actually saw companies that were struggling with their legacy finance systems during the pandemic, just actually accelerate their requirements to go to a cloud based solution and it's a very lowly penetrated market right now. So we just have a lot of upside. I know I've been in the pied piper. I'm talking about finance for probably a decade at this point. But I really think that finance transformation is upon us. We will now take two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Robynne, you mentioned you're going to be leaning back into sales hiring this year. I'm just curious if you could just maybe give us the shape of the curve of hiring, specifically in sales this year versus kind of last year? I just want to clarify that I think you said hiring was pretty flat. Can you just give us any color around what you anticipate doing into this fiscal year? Thanks. So when you look back over our headcount growth in FY21, it was pretty flat. I think incremental hires were maybe a few hundred across the whole year. We'll do significantly more this year across all areas. And those are weighted heavily towards sales and product more so than any other organization. So we do expect to invest a lot there. And I'll hand it over to Chano to talk about where some of those investments will incur, but it will be a significant acceleration of hiring in FY22. I think we were mostly flat as you commented and is the area, as I said before. So installed base is rest of the world to support the new enterprise market efforts, some new areas like the federal government. And clearly, we are putting plans in place for accelerating there and bringing the people on board as soon as possible. And of course, there will be some growth compared to what we had last year. It's not like we're going to go into high double digit growth, but I guess some nice single digit growth and then hopefully continue that trend, with that acceleration investments in sales as we are leveraging that opportunity ahead and the pipeline that we've been creating. Your next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Aneel, in your prepared remarks, you quantified the increase in the number of SKUs you guys have made over the last three years. So I think you said it was up 50%. Do you have any data that says our average customers using this many modules and maybe how that might compare to your best customers? And I'm wondering if there's any way to kind of put that comparison with spend per employee? It would just be helpful to help think about the capacity for the cross sell opportunity. DJ, I don't have that exact data. What I do have is data, and I'll turn over to Chano about what percent of our new bookings in Q4 came from new products. Because I think that's a more telling data point on how are these new products doing within our customer base. So Chano, what do you think? Yes, that's the main data we track in terms of the growth. So a significant part of the growth that we've been commenting, 50% plus last year on installed base, is coming from that 50% of the new solutions that we've been delivering over the last three years to the market. So those are contributing significantly. When you look at the pipeline, it's kind of pretty similar. The conversion rates are also higher there. Clearly, we're knowing every customer, the wider space we do have. Clearly, usually we know that meeting enterprise customers tend to acquire a number higher SKUs, six or seven to start with through the launch deployment that we have for medium enterprise. But with the increased efforts in terms of both product innovation and the sales capacity that we’d be adding into installed base, those penetration ratios in terms of how the new SKUs are progressing, moving towards the best performance peers, is starting very nicely, and I hope can provide some much more detailed information on this on our upcoming financial Analyst Day. And I would add, Keith, that we have a lot of upside with Peakon. This area of employee engagement is one of the hottest areas in the market right now. We were already in that market with our own pulse surveys, but clearly the market wanted more. And this company during the pandemic grew far more rapidly than Workday did, and I'm excited to bring this great capability to our customers. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. This will conclude Workday's Fourth quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call.

I would now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Robynne Sisco, our President and CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Executive Vice President of Product Development. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2021.
With that, I will hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter fiscal year '22 earnings call. Before we jump into our quarterly results, first, a huge congratulations to Workday investor and my good friend, Phil Mickelson, on winning the PGA Championship over the weekend, an amazing accomplishment and proving once again that in addition to being a great person, Phil is one of the most talented golfers of all time.
I'm pleased to report that Workday had a strong quarter, starting the year with significant momentum and positioning us well for a great fiscal year '22. In Q1, we saw an increase in demand across all product areas while delivering strong non-GAAP operating margins of 25%, showing the strength inherent in our underlying business model. Our results support the acceleration in digital transformations across HR and finance, and Robynne will share more shortly on how we plan to invest behind this opportunity.
Let me share some highlights, starting with Workday HCM. We continue to be the market leader with our differentiated suite of products and continued innovation. We're seeing an increase in demand as more and more organizations prioritize transition their HCM systems to cloud to deliver a world-class employee experience. In Q1, we welcomed ASM Global, Las Vegas Sands Corp., Mattel, Five Below Inc. and Cost Plus World Market to the Workday family, along with many other new HCM customers. Even with all the sales momentum, we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production with notable go-lives in Q1, including Fielmann AG, University of Sydney and [Cornell University], to name a few.
Turning to Workday Financial Management. We saw momentum build in Q1 as companies increasingly prioritize digitalization within the office of the CFO. In addition to an acceleration in core financials bookings, we also saw strength across the portfolio with offerings such as Workday Adaptive Planning, Spend Management, including Workday Strategic Sourcing, formerly known as Scout, and our Enterprise Finance Solutions. New customers in Q1 included Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Saks and St. Francis Health System Incorporated. with add-on wins at FHI and Werner Enterprises.
Our focus on industry solutions was also a key contributor to our success during the quarter, where our PSA solution was a key driver to our broader HR FINS platform win in Q1, an accounting firm, RSM US. And our Accounting Center solution was part of a FINS first win at National Farmers Union Mutual Insurance.
Our strong position continues to get recognized by the market. For the fifth year in a row, Workday was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large and Global Enterprises published on May 1 of this year.
Taking a step back, we continue to focus on delivering a global solution that enables business leaders to plan, execute and analyze all in one system. And in this rapidly changing world, our value proposition only continues to grow as we make advances on the innovation front.
In Q1, we delivered our latest feature release, Workday 2021 and R1, with advancements across all product areas, including broadening the capabilities of Workday Extend, and greater functionality in spend and supplier management. We also continued our investment in a world-class user experience, smarter and more personalized search in Workday People Experience as well as extended capabilities in natural workspaces outside of Workday, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. And to further enable customers in optimizing the future of their employee experience in this ever-changing world, I'm proud to announce that we closed on the acquisition of Peakon, now a Workday company. Chano will add more color on Peakon in a few minutes, but we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity we’re seeing with the Peakon offerings and are excited to welcome the Peakon team to Workday.
In our history, innovation and empathy have always led to greater customer satisfaction, which is at the heart of everything we do at Workday. I continue to be so grateful to our teams who have all supported customers in entirely new ways to ensure their success during these challenging times.
Underscoring this dedication, I'm pleased to announce our latest customer satisfaction score of 97%. This survey is particularly meaningful as it provides us feedback from our named support contacts: those who are closest to engaging with the Workday experience on a daily basis.
Switching to the people front, as you all know, we believe a key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. As we look ahead, we see a tremendous opportunity in front of us to partner with more organizations across all industries and service the backbone of their digital transformation efforts in this changing world. And foundational to delivering on that opportunity will be a motivated and growing group of employees. So as we move forward on this growth path, we plan to increase our global workforce by more than 20% or 2,500 new hires in fiscal year 2022. In doing so, we'll have an even stronger foundation to scale and innovate on our path to $10 billion.
This quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year and set the stage for acceleration in our business. As I look ahead, my optimism for Workday's future couldn't be higher. We have a great team in place and a significant global opportunity in front of us as companies continue to embark on their HR and finance transformation journeys.
With that, I'll turn it over to my good friend and Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel. As Aneel mentioned, we're off to a strong start in FY '22 with meaningful new bookings acceleration in the first quarter as organizations increasingly position Workday as the backbone of their digital transformation. Our Q1 bookings outperformance, combined with continued strength in pipeline generation, provide us with increased confidence in driving accelerated new bookings growth in FY '22.
This quarter's results were once again driven by strong execution and high conversion rate. We saw a pickup in net new business as bookings from new HCM and financial customers improved along with the overall environment. And our installed base team had another outstanding quarter, sustaining the momentum we saw throughout last year, driven by solid renewal rates as well as strength across solutions.
As Aneel mentioned, we have notable outperformance from Planning, Core Financials, Analytics, Spend Management and our Talent portfolio.
From a geographic standpoint, we saw outperformance in North America and APJ while also driving healthy bookings growth across EMEA. Our medium enterprise team also had an exceptional start to the year as our investments in that market continue to pay off. And our strength continued in vertical markets, such as professional and financial services, healthcare and education and government, where industry-specific innovation and a dedicated go-to-market effort are critical to our success.
As Aneel previously said, we have significant hiring plans in FY '22. And the sales and marketing organization is one of the biggest areas of planned headcount additions as we look to accelerate and sustain long-term growth. The investments are broad-based and global in nature, including quota-carrying capacity, presales and business development. We're also investing in non-headcount areas, such as marketing and brand campaign, focused on the office of the CFO. During Q1, we began ramping up this investment and are very pleased with the healthy pipeline growth that they helped drive. Based on the initial returns we have seen, we expect to accelerate the pace of these investments in the coming quarters, and I look forward to updating you on our progress.
Organizationally, I'm pleased to say that we have successfully integrated the Peakon sales teams into Workday, with both our installed base and net new sales teams now actively selling this solution in the market. Although the acquisition just closed in March, we are very excited by the pipeline momentum. We had a number of meaningful Peakon upsell deals within our customer base in Q1, and the solution is already opening up doors for new significant customer relationships.
Ensuring customer success has always been a core value at Workday. I am delighted to say that our customer success and services organizations have performed incredibly well, taking hundreds of customers' live across our core HCM and Financial Management offerings as well as our portfolio of broader solutions targeting the CFO, CHRO and CIO.
Our partner ecosystem is also critical, not only helping take customer side but co-innovating on the Workday platform, enabling acceleration of our pace of innovation and engaging even more strategically with our partners.
Finally, on behalf of the entire Workday leadership team, I would like to say thanks to all of our workmates across the globe. Thank you for a terrific start to FY '22, and let's keep the momentum going.
With that, I will turn it over to our President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered a solid Q1 driven by strong execution against an improving market backdrop as organizations look to accelerate the pace of their digital transformations across HR and finance.
Subscription revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by strong new business sales, favorable in-quarter linearity and an overperformance on customer renewals. Professional services revenue was $143 million, and total revenue came in at $1.18 billion. Revenue outside the U.S. was $292 million, representing 25% of the total.
24-month backlog at the end of the first quarter was $6.59 billion, growth of 20%, driven by strong new bookings across both net new and add-on business. As I discussed on the last earnings call, the amount of ACV coming up for renewal in FY '22 is relatively flat from last year. This dynamic is purely a function of the mix of historical contract lengths that created a headwind to 24-month backlog growth in Q1 of a couple of percentage points, an impact that we expect will persist throughout this fiscal year before we return to a more normal level of renewals growth in FY '23.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q1 was $10.08 billion, growth of 23%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $289 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line overperformance and favorable expense variances. Specifically, it took longer to ramp up hiring and external resources, and we had lower-than-expected costs related to Peakon.
We have very ambitious investment targets for the remainder of the year in support of our growth aspirations and have confidence in our ability to continue to ramp these investments throughout the year. Operating cash flow in Q1 was $452 million, growth of 72%, driven by a combination of operating margin expansion and strong customer collections.
As Aneel mentioned, our biggest investment continues to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. During Q1, we began to ramp the pace of hiring, successfully adding and integrating roughly 600 net new employees, including over 250 from Peakon, bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to over 13,100 employees.
Overall, we are very pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1, and we're continuing to invest to support growth as the environment normalizes.
Turning now to guidance. Based on our over-performance in Q1, we are raising our FY '22 outlook and providing Q2 guidance as follows.
For subscription revenue, we're raising our full year estimate to be in the range of $4.425 billion to $4.440 billion, growth of 17%. As a reminder, Peakon is expected to add less than 1 percentage point to our overall subscription revenue growth in FY '22. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.095 billion to $1.097 billion, 18% year-over-year growth, with sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 of approximately 3% and 4.5%, respectively. We still expect professional services revenue to be $590 million in FY '22 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $145 million.
Taking into account the renewal headwinds I mentioned earlier, we expect 24-month backlog growth of 17% in Q2. Investing for growth remains our #1 priority. As Aneel mentioned, we expect an increased pace of hiring across the company in FY '22 as well as the ramp of non-head count spending with a focus on sales, marketing and product, specifically targeted at accelerating demand generation, enhancing our market position and advancing our strategic product road map. Given that, we expect margins to moderate throughout the year with a Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 20% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 18% to 19%.
The GAAP margins for the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 24 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. There is no change to our FY '22 operating cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion.
During Q1, we completed the $171 million purchase of 5 buildings at our Pleasanton campus. This purchase is important to our headquarter strategy and affords us control of our core campus buildings. We do not expect any further owned real estate investments for the remainder of the year, and we continue to expect $270 million of other capital investments to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. We're off to a great start for FY '22, and our focus remains on driving accelerated bookings growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes to the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Aneel, I want to go back to sort of your comments not only this quarter but actually last quarter about sort of the building pipeline and sort of the opportunity to accelerate bookings in the back half of the year. Just how are you feeling about that opportunity? You're obviously investing against that opportunity, so I assume you still feel good about it. But maybe how should we think about that playing out over the years? Is it going to be perhaps a little bit more back-end loaded? Just give us some more color on that idea because I think everybody hears your enthusiasm on the pipeline and the buildup, but obviously, the second quarter doesn't necessarily reflect that. So I just want to make sure there's no change in the longer-term thought process. Well, so just remember that subscription revenues lag bookings growth. And we accelerated bookings growth in Q1, and frankly, more than even I had expected in my usual optimism. So it takes a while for that accounting to catch up with the acceleration in net new business. But the net new business and better-than-expected performance across really all products leaves us with a lot of optimism. And then, of course, we had a great renewals quarter, too. I might turn it over to Chano. But I think that acceleration has already started. Yes. Thank you, Aneel. Hi, Kirk. We have healthy pipelines looking ahead for Q2 across both HCM and FINS, and across both net new and installed base teams. Based on where we stand today, we feel very confident how the rest of the year should be performing in terms of supporting our accelerated bookings and definitely having a strong second half, right?
As you know, we have increased seasonality in the second half of the year as it relates to new ACV bookings. And that's no different this year, with a meaningful part of the pipeline strength we've had the last few quarters targeted to close in the second half. So I would say, based on where we are today, I'm excited about both Q2 and the second half, and we expect strong results across both. That's great. And Chano, if I could ask just one follow-up. You mentioned on the head count additions, quota-bearing reps. International is still only 25% or so of your revenue. Can we expect that there'll be a pretty heavy investment in some of these international regions? And are they starting to perk up pretty nicely for you all at this point in time? Yes. You should be expecting that part of that quota-carrying reps that we are hiring would be certainly across net new international installed base, some of the verticals that we are playing. And we've seen already acceleration in Q2 in international in terms of booking. We should be expecting that with the strong pipeline performance we ended at last -- end of last year, again, it is for us now to execute. And of course, as the market is more recovering and opening after the COVID kind of headwinds that we saw last year, particularly net new, I would be expecting that net new should be performing better in our international markets going forward. Our next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. I'm going to ask a big-picture question. I don't know if it's better for Aneel or Chano. But one of the questions I sometimes get from investors that, if this business is going to double over the next 4 to 5 years, say, what do you think the mix of land versus expand looks like to get there? That's definitely a question for Chano. Yes. I would say if we just get much more balanced. Clearly, we've been talking traditionally that the installed base and some of the more land business was representing 20% of our new business bookings. It's clearly representing more today and definitely is balancing out as we see especially more landing products with PICO nowadays, Scout, Planning. So you should be that balancing out. Honestly, it's kind of still hard for me to say when it's exactly going to be equal but -- because we certainly want it to remain very strong on both fronts and we're very excited right now that net new bookings on net new logos is accelerating. But clearly as well, we're playing these days a land motion with some of these products when trying to meet customers where they are in the journey, when they're now ready to do as part of the transformation. The breadth of our portfolio today is significantly stronger and broader, and that is allowing us to play a significantly land motion, not only in our installed base but also some of the net new logos, too. Yes. Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And a follow-up to Kirk's question on the hiring. Look, I think the margin upside may -- and you guys alluded to this, that -- say that it's been a bit harder than expected to kind of ramp back up the HR engine. Like where would you say you are in terms of getting the pace of hiring back up to kind of pre-COVID or maybe faster levels? And what do you think -- what have been the biggest challenges there? So why don't I take that one? So as you can see... Yes. Take that one, Robynne, please. Sorry, Chano. When we look across the entire company, you saw us accelerate in Q1. We had over 600 net new hires. And while 250 came from Peakon, 350 were organic. And that compares to relatively flattish headcount last year. So we feel good that we are ramping, and we feel really good about the pace of hiring coming out of Q1. And you should expect it to accelerate across all areas in Q2 and then stay at that heightened pace for the rest of the year.
And Chano, I don't know if you want to add anything specific to sales to that. No. The only thing I would add maybe to sales is that is being already an important area of investment in terms of hiring in Q1, potentially the highest one we've been having across the company. And we -- our intent is just to keep ramping up as we go throughout the year. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Thank you guys for taking the question. And a really nice start to the year. It sounds like momentum is coming back in a really big really way. A question for Robynne because these subscription models are tricky and you've been warning us about the impacts of a weaker expiry base this year and gross dollar -- sort of the growth from that renewal base is basically flat from last year. Is that impact even across the year? Is that something that we're going to deal with each and every quarter? Or is there any kind of seasonality to that, that we should be thinking about? Yes. Keith, so that will impact every quarter throughout this year. And while the impact will bounce around a little bit, we do expect it will be a couple of points throughout the year. But keep in mind, when we look at historical renewal levels, there's a range of normal growth. So quantifying the exact impact, not -- it's difficult to be very precise that we wanted to give you a feeling for the magnitude. But we do expect that will persist every quarter throughout this year, and that will return to more normal levels next year. Got it. And then when you talk about a couple of points, is that a couple of points of bookings growth you're talking about? Or is it the RPO growth? Like a couple of points specific to which one? 24-month backlog growth. And then like underlying that, that's just about contracts up for renewal? Like the renewal rates themselves, those are staying pretty solid? Yes. That's correct. In fact, we had an overperformance of renewal rates in Q1, so we feel really good about that. This is just scheduled renewals, which is purely a factor of terms of previous deals. And again, just to reiterate, no impact on this flattened renewal base to subscription revenue, just backlog. Got it. Okay. So it sounds like the factors that you guys have in your control are all doing really well, are actually outperforming. It's just the timing on contract renewals that are creating a little bit of a drag. That's correct. On the 24-month backlog number, yes, and the total backlog number as well. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Robynne, I have a question for you. Just extending your logic with the renewal base being a little bit challenging this year, but your net new is starting to accelerate. So going into next year, probably '22, with a stronger renewal base, so what does that mean for backlog growth next year?
And also, I think Aneel or Chano, maybe on previous quarterly earnings conference call, we've talked about financial migrations being pulled in by a year or two. Can you just give us an update as to what you've seen so far with respect to customers’ intent to move a little quicker on core FINS migration? So Kash, as I've mentioned before, the impact from last year's new business headwinds is more fully felt this year across key metrics such as backlog. As Aneel talked about, we feel confident in our ability to accelerate new bookings growth this year, and Q1 results really underscore that. But keep in mind that the bookings acceleration this year will take time. It has to compound into the model to be able to offset the cumulative headwinds from last year. So as we execute against our bookings targets this year, the first thing you should expect to see is stabilization in the backlog number as we move through the year.
Now there will still be some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but stabilization is really the precursor to reaccelerated growth. A little too early to talk about whether that happens next year or not. We have to move through the year and see how we finish. Yes. In fact, on the FINS one, well, already FINS is a key part of the reacceleration story, and we are seeing more and more of these opportunities coming to market. And not only did we have several strategic FINS wins in Q1, as Aneel mentioned, we have solid FINS pipeline growth as well. There are also emerging opportunities through our enterprise finance solution, where we are now much better positioned to go after product-based industries like retail and manufacturing. And we have nice wins here in Q1, including burner tracking, for example.
I would like to highlight the momentum is limited just to core Financials, which I'm referring to. It is also a broader solution set that we are selling into the office of the CFO, as you know, includes Planning, which we had a very strong quarter in Q1. Spend Management had another fantastic quarter in Q1, Analytics. So we're really trying to make the best out of the product portfolio with both our installed base customers and many levels. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Perhaps for Chano or Aneel here. I wanted to go back to this acceleration in bookings here in Q1. I think we were thinking bookings would reaccelerate in the second half, in part on easier compares, but it came here in Q1. So walk me through the drivers of the acceleration. It sounds like FINS is part of it. But are you seeing just shortening sales cycles? Are you seeing enterprise appetite to kind of invest in the office of the CFO, pick up more than you anticipated? Can you just walk through other factors that kind of drove the unexpected acceleration here in Q1? I know the compare wasn't as easy as the compares are going forward. So just walk us through factors there that drove accelerated bookings. So maybe I'll give a high-level perspective from talking with a whole host of CEOs. And then I think a big part of it was also terrific execution by Chano's team. I think everybody is beginning to look forward now. I won't say everybody, but a lot of industries are looking forward now, including airlines, including travel companies. We seem to be putting the pandemic as much behind us as we can, and people are looking forward to the future. And when they do that, it bodes well for us. And I think that's what happened. It probably happened a quarter earlier than we expected, where the return to normalcy would begin to show up in not just the pipeline but actually in deals closed. Then I also think for Q1, it was terrific execution.
And I'll defer to Chano on that topic. Yes. Thank you, Aneel. I think, first of all, great execution by Doug Robinson and the team. So thank you, guys, for what you did. Clearly, the momentum is back. And we said last year, we were producing good pipeline generation during the second half last year and kind of already in Q2 last year. Some of that pipeline, of course, was mature to be closing already in Q1. I think the major factor, it came back significantly, net new logos, and that produced a big part of the acceleration. Financials, really both in our installed base and some net new logos, helped out with the acceleration. The breadth of the product portfolio, as I said, with some solutions, I mentioned they are Planning, Spend Management, among others. Peakon had a very good quarter as well, though, of course, we only had kind of 4 or 6 weeks that really were part of our quarter. So there were a number of different elements.
Rest of the World, both EMEA and APJ, I made my -- I commented in my prepared remarks that both of them saw accelerated bookings. So I think it was a balanced picture across solutions, Financials and HCM mainly on installed base, and I would say geographies as well. So it was around this quarter. I think companies are realizing that where there is really the true backbone to support the digital transformation, message here seems to be resonating, momentum is there, so we just need to keep executing upon that momentum. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Hey, Robynne, I'm just thinking about your third quarter and fourth quarter subscription revenue growth guidance. When I look back over the last 4 years, Workday has got a pattern where your 3Q sequential growth in subscription revenues is in line with or actually above 4Q. So the guidance that you gave us for 3% sequential growth in 3Q and 4.5% for 4Q implies a little bit more of a 4Q skew than we've seen in the past. I'm wondering if you could just address that. And does that imply that perhaps the total bookings acceleration that Aneel and Chano have been talking about is perhaps a little bit more of a 4Q phenomenon? Yes. Karl, so we're not seeing any massive changes in trends of seasonality. And as always, we expect Q4 to be our most significant quarter. A lot of the sequential growth has to do with linearity within the quarter. We saw strong in core linearity, for example, in Q2. And it's harder for us to predict the further out we are. So we're still early in the year. We'll give you better guidance around Q3 and Q4 at the next call, but we just wanted to make sure you guys saw what we were seeing. But we don't see anything massively different. But it will really be tied to the linearity of how the deals flow within the quarter. Okay. That makes sense. And if it's okay to ask a follow-up to you, Robynne, on cash flow. Workday has done, it looks like, about $1 billion of operating cash flow in the last 2 quarters. I don't think we've ever seen that. So you mentioned the higher margins and the good collections, but anything else funky going on, Robynne, around cash flow? And any thoughts you could provide us in terms of the relationship between cash flow and operating margins as we build out our models for the full fiscal year? Yes. So part of our flattish operating cash flow this year is due to the margin contraction that we expect to happen throughout the year. So that will become a headwind on cash flow growth year-over-year. We've done really well on cash. And certainly, I see some upside to our guide, but our biggest cash flow month is January, in fact, the last 2 weeks of January, where we have a very significant amount of annual invoices come due. And so we need to just take a wait-and-see attitude as we go through the year. But I certainly see some upside from our guide of $1.2 billion. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Congratulations on the strong start to the year. Hopefully, we see that continue to accelerate. So 2 questions. First, you're guiding up full year margins while guiding to strong employee hiring throughout the year, acceleration and then sustain of that. Is the margins due to a bit more -- a bit less T&E for the rest of the year? Or is it stronger revenue expectation? Or is there something else? And then I got a follow-up. Yes. There's actually several things in there, Mark. So as you know, 1% of our revenue -- our margin raise was tied to the increase in our revenue guidance raise as well. And then as I mentioned earlier, we have really ambitious investment plans. And we have strong confidence that we can reach our hiring goals for the year, but the timing of that hiring is going to cause some potential variability into the margins throughout the year.
And the last thing I'll mention is, as you said, we still are getting some COVID-related benefits in our expenses this year, particularly from travel as well as office-related expenses and the lull in the hiring we saw last year. So we expect that savings to significantly moderate as we get into the back half of the year. That makes sense. Going back to the question in terms of the cadence. When you -- last quarter, you called out the strength in the pipeline growth. And it sounded like there was -- the pipeline was more -- was less mature, but because of the fact it built later in the year versus earlier in the year. You've talked about how that pipeline has continued. But where are we in that maturation process? Is the maturation process online? Or is it accelerating in terms of -- because we saw a strong Q1? Does it have any effect in terms of when that should fall out? What are the -- what are you seeing in terms of the stuff that's in the pipeline and where it's driving toward close? That's you, Chano. Yes, Mark -- sorry. Mark, I wouldn't say there are any significant changes of notice in the pipeline. Clearly as we have more significant business with our installed base, and we have a higher land motion of SKUs and products, those tend to have faster sales cycles, and really they accelerate and mature faster than big transformational projects. So that can make -- skew a little bit, of course, that pipeline that we can be creating within the quarter. We can close even at the end of that quarter or maybe next quarter. That is clearly not the majority of our pipeline. The rest of the pipeline that we were creating last year and for some of our, let's say, most significant cycles will still take the 6 to 12 months. And we should be playing -- see some of those playing mostly during the second half of this year. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. I just have two shorter ones. First of all, probably for Chano. As you look at the deal composition this quarter, are there any difference maybe in terms of size or number of modules that customers are buying on your initial lands versus maybe what you saw pre-pandemic? Our work has seemed to show that you're adding maybe more modules on that upfront sale than previously. I would say the highest difference or the most significant difference is there is the highest composition from net new logos that, of course, that we didn't see in the pandemic. There is a higher composition from Financials and being some of the landing SKUs. Clearly, our medium enterprise team continues to execute really, really well. And they had another phenomenal quarter. And there usually customers tends to consume more SKUs to start with when they become the partnership with Workday, right? But other than that, I wouldn't say that there are other significant differences to highlight. Got it. And my follow-up question is for Robynne on the outperformance of the renewals that you called out. I guess as you called it out because it was significant enough to call out, but any additional color there may be on what the outperformance was like? Or anything that you noticed from the renewals this period that might be able to be carried forward, say, to future periods? Yes. Scott, so we were very pleased with the renewals in Q1 with gross retention once again over 95%. At the end over the past year, we saw some impacts from increased bankruptcies in the medium enterprise space as well as an increase in customers lowering worker counts, even as some other customers actually continued to increase worker counts. So as we approached this year, we assumed we'd see some improvements in the bankruptcies and workers trends, and we are really pleased to see overperformance in Q1 on this front. So we're off to a really good start and expect strong renewals to continue through the year. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. I wanted to ask the question on the FINS pipeline strength another way, if I could, please. It sounds like you're seeing wider lands coming into the pipeline for FINS. And I assume that's due to the progress you've made in all these add-on modules and in vertical applications, planning, sourcing, there's a lot in there. But are customers starting with more departmental wins still? Is this kind of -- any color on just where the -- what those pipeline deals look like for FINS in particular? Or are you seeing a move towards wider multi-department deals that are coming into the pipeline and customers going bigger initially across more organizations with FINS? Yes. Thanks for your question. I think not necessarily we're seeing more departmental wins. Clearly, on some large customers, we are playing some departmental starting point of view. But I think the -- what we're seeing in FINS is just the maturation of the pipeline that we've been working on right now. We're becoming a much more prominent and referenceable solution in the market with many more references and customers are really appreciating that Carta is a big player in the enterprise financials cloud offering right now. Then, of course, the broader offer that we have today in terms of the number of SKUs that we have around FINS that is much more complete than it was in the past.
And last but not least, I would say, enterprise finance helping us up to address the market that we -- certainly we could not address before. And then in some areas like financial services, clearly Accounting Center has been very strategic and very significant for us to have a very formidable FINS offering. So I would say it's a combination of different factors. I don't think it's just one single factor. Even I would say some of the investments that we've been starting to do around brand awareness and the office of the CFO are also helping out as well in some of our international markets with our FINS solution. So it's many different factors, not just one single theme. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. I just have one question for Chano. It's on the back to work. And I'm just wondering, in your conversations or maybe in the pipeline composition, do you sense businesses are still holding back on certain initiatives, whether it's either in HCM or FINS that could get prioritized when more and more employees return to the office later this year? Yes. Thank you, Brian, for your question. I think so. We'll need to see how it plays out. But we're certainly seeing -- and Aneel was commenting in some of our conversations with C-level executives of our customers. They've clearly been prioritizing employee engagements and back to work and kind of the HR offerings. But right now, we are seeing as well how they start to reconsider and there some sort of pent-up demand, I would say, in terms of overdue projects on the office of the CFO that should have been done that they're starting to get it done. So I think it's that what we're seeing in terms of that digital acceleration transformation as a whole, and we play very well on that one as the enterprise backbone of that transformation. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude today's Workday's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I will hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. I’m pleased to report that Q2 is one of our strongest quarters in company history. When combined with Q1, this was the best first half of the year in terms of ACV growth in over three years.
We came into the year expecting our business to accelerate but the pace of digital acceleration across HR and finance is exceeding even our own expectations. Our leadership position continues to strengthen driven by a broadening of our product portfolio and exceptional execution. The growing Workday customer community now includes 55 million users and 50% of the Fortune 500 of which approximately 90% are live on Workday. Chano will share more shortly on our go-to-market success and Robynne will provide specifics in our raised growth outlook for the second half of the year. But let me share first some of the highlights from Q2. Let’s start with Workday ACM.
Our position as an innovator and market leader with our differentiated suite of products has never been stronger. We continue to attract new customers and many of our current customers continue to grow their investments with us. In Q2, we welcomed CVS Health, Iberdrola, Mayo Management Services, California Pizza Kitchen and Heidelberg Cement AG to the Workday family along with many other new ACM customers. While these new wins are very important us to, we remain equally focused on delivering excellent service for our current customers and that includes delivering on our commitments to them. Amongst the many go lives of Q2, I would like to highlight Harman International Industries, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Old Dominion.
In addition to the strong growth from core ACM, this was our first full quarter with Peakon. I’m pleased to report we got off to a great start delivering the largest quarter in Peakon history with early success selling back into our install base, a true testament for the incredible Peakon product and even better Peakon team.
We also continue to see strong traction for our financial management suite of applications. We believe that a combination of our expanded set of offerings including planning, spend management, and accounting center and the acceleration of digital transformations by the office of the CFO are collectively driving broader adoption of our finance offerings. In fact, the highlight in Q2 was nearly 50% ACV growth in the Workday adaptive planning business, showcasing their strategy of meeting customers where they are continues to drive significant success.
In addition, we continue to see momentum build in our core financial deployments. New core financial customers in Q2 include Cinemark U.S.A., University of Wisconsin System and Wise Markets. Notable core friends go-lives included the University of Southern California, KeyBanc North America and Fox Corporation.
Moving on to the innovation front, we are focused on broadening our platform and extending our product capabilities to create additional levers for long-term growth. As a recent example, and to continue seizing on the great opportunity we have internationally, this quarter we announced our intention to deliver Workday Payroll for Australia and Germany. As you know, our country-specific payrolls are very compelling to customers, and we’re excited to deliver these solutions as levers of growth for these markets.
We also recently announced that Workday has achieved ready status for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management program, or FedRAMP, at a moderate impact level with full authority to operate estimated for spring 2022. With this achievement we materially advance our position to help federal agencies accelerate digital transformation in order to help them modernize their business systems and gain real-time insights to critical challenges across their organizations.
Switching to the people front, we continue to invest heavily in our company culture to sustain our belief that happy employees deliver the highest levels of satisfaction to our great customers. On that note, starting in Q4 this year, we’ll be extending a cash bonus plan companywide to further ensure our people feel valued, motivated, and properly recognized. Robynne will update you later on our margin expectations for the back half of the year. This is a direct reflection of our business momentum and the confidence we have in our work makes to grow the business to $10 billion in revenues and beyond.
With our outstanding first half of fiscal year 2022, we are seeing acceleration in our business. As I look ahead, my optimism for Workday’s future couldn’t be higher. We have a great team in place and a significant global opportunity in front of us as companies continue to embark on their HR and finance transformation journeys.
With that, I’ll turn it over to our co-CEO Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. As Aneel mentioned, we had a fantastic Q2, driven by very strong execution, which combined with a rapidly improving demand environment for enterprise management cloud solutions, is causing our menu business to accelerate at an even faster pace than we expected.
The strength in Q2 was broad-based, highlighted by large enterprise outperformance and solid growth in landing new core HR and FINS customers. We also saw a strength in landing new customers across our expanding portfolio solutions targeting the office of the CFO and CHRO. For example, our Planning and Workday businesses drove significantly strength in winning new large enterprise customers in Q2, including the largest planning for steel in our history. And we control significant new level of activity in EMEA, providing us a gateway into selling core HCM and FINS solutions over time.
In addition to solid performance from our LAN sales team, the momentum we’ve been seeing with our customer base being also continued in Q2 as companies look to Workday as a trusted and strategic partner. We had another quarter of strong renewed performance, and our customer base growth is strength across a number of solutions such as core FINS, Planning, spend management, health, PEAKON, expense and our talent portfolio.
For example, in Planning we signed on deals with Google with one of the world’s largest communication companies and a Fortune 100 distribution company. And in Spend Management we had a number of other wins with companies such as Loan Secures, Mercy Health, CME Group and Ralph Lauren. We also had a number of notable extended customer space wins in the quarter, including a Fortune 100 manufacturer, a Fortune 50 energy company and one of the world’s largest banks.
And Peakon isn’t just landing new logos. It is a powerful solution to sell back to our customers. We have notable other deals this quarter, including Uptake and PerkinElmer. From a geographic standpoint, our performance was strong globally with North America outperforming across all segments, including significant strength from our large and medium enterprise teams and from industries such as health care and higher education.
In international market, EMEA was a standout, driving healthy acceleration in new ACV bookings with particular outperform maintenance in continental Europe, including outstanding performance in France and in Spain. We are seeing improving market dynamics and pipeline momentum across our rest-of-world regions, and we expect those trends to continue as we move into the back half of the year.
As we’ve discussed over the last few quarters, we’re investing aggressively in our go-to-market exports. Our largest area of headcount investment in the first half of FY 2022 was in sales and marketing, as we added significant new global sales capacity across both our net new and install base teams, including doubling down in international markets. We’re also accelerating our spend across key brand and marketing initiatives. These investments, which we expect will continue the second half of the year, are focused on driving growth in FY 2023 and beyond. And we’re very pleased with the evolution we’re seeing in our pipeline which again saw solid growth in Q2.
In closing, I would like to thank the more than 13,000 global workmen who have enabled us to drive such a strong Q2 on the first half results. Our growth and differentiated suite of solutions is winning in the market, and we’re incredibly well positioned as we enter the second half of the year.
Let’s keep the momentum going, and now I will turn it over to our President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered an incredibly strong Q2, driven by exceptional execution against a rapidly improving market backdrop as organizations accelerate the pace of digital transformation across HR and Finance.
Subscription revenue in the second quarter was $1.11 billion, up 20% year-over-year, driven by very strong new business sales, favorable in-quarter linearity and an overperformance on customer renewals with gross retention, once again, over 95%. Professional Services revenue was $147 million, resulting in total revenue of $1.26 billion.
Revenue outside the U.S. was $318 million, up 24% year-over-year and representing 25% of the total. Twenty-four-month backlog at the end of the second quarter was $6.88 billion, growth of 19%. Total subscription revenue backlog was $10.58 billion, up 23%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $292 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line outperformance and favorable expense variances. Operating cash flow in Q2 was $198 million, growth of 26%.
In addition to strong profitability from our core operations, during Q2 we also recognized a nearly $100 million mark-to-market gain from the successful IPO of one of our venture’s portfolio companies. We will continue to see mark-to-market adjustments from our equity investments, but we expect gains of this magnitude will be extremely rare.
Our larger investments continue to be in our people and in attracting top talent to Workday. In the first half of the year, we successfully added and integrated more than 900 net new employees, bringing our total employee count to over 13,400 at the end of Q2. We’ve made important progress towards our full-year target of adding 2,500 employees and expect the pace of hiring to increase throughout the back half of FY 2022. Overall, we’re extremely pleased with the momentum we saw in Q2, and we’re very well-positioned as we enter the important back half of the year.
Now, turning to guidance. Based on our strong Q2 and the momentum we’re seeing in our business, we are raising our FY 2022 outlook and providing Q3 guidance as follows: For Subscription revenue, we’re raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $4.50 billion to $4.51 billion, 19% growth. For Q3, we expect Subscription revenue of $1.156 billion to $1.158 billion, 20% growth at the high end, and we expect 24-month backlog growth of 19%.
We still expect Professional Services revenue to be $590 million in FY 2022 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success. For Q3 we expect Professional Services revenue of $150 million.
Investing for growth remains our number 1 priority. In addition to the increased pace of hiring in the back half of FY 2022, we also expect to ramp non-headcount spending with investments specifically targeted at accelerating demand generation, enhancing our market position and advancing our strategic product roadmap. Additionally, the new bonus plan Aneel mentioned will take effect on November 1 and is expected to impact our Q4 margins by approximately 300 basis points.
Given that backdrop, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 21% in Q3, 16% in Q4 and 21% for the full year. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP margin by approximately 24 percentage points in Q3 and 25 percentage points in Q4 and for the full year. Given our strong performance, we are also raising our FY 2022 operating cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect $270 million of other capital investments to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.
I’ll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. We’re off to a very strong start in the first half of the year and our focus remains on driving accelerated bookings growth. We look forward to hosting our virtual analyst day on September 21 where we will share Insights on our strategic innovation and growth initiatives as we look ahead to FY 2023 and beyond.
With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Sure. Thanks very much. And congrats on a really good quarter. Great to see the acceleration in ACV growth. Aneel and Chano, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit more about what you’ve seen over the last six months? I know you’re both more upbeat about the pipeline heading into this quarter but when you talk about a quarter of this magnitude from a growth perspective.
Could you talk about maybe what happened in the quarter you weren’t expect whether it was deals coming in at a faster cadence, deal cycles getting shorter, deals growing perhaps the end of the deal meaning more add-ons, more multiproduct deals. I was wondering if you could add just a little bit more color to that. And why do you see that continuing in the back half of the year? What gives you confidence around the pipeline? Thanks? I’ll make a couple of comments about what I hear from other CEOs then I’ll turn it over to Chano. For the most part, CEOs are pretty optimistic about the future of their business. And they also realize they have to jump onboard of digital transformation for both HR and finance. Despite what’s been going on with the pandemic, the mind-set is back to business. And, so, we saw that in the pipeline and we saw it in people taking actions. They’re not sitting on the sidelines anymore. Maybe Chano can add to that. Hi, Kirk. Hope you’re well. I think to unpack a little bit the strength in Q2 was truly broad based, highlighted by solid growth in landing new core HR customers. We have significant strength across the business as we mentioned. But I would call out the large enterprise theme as a key outperformer. There was also a strong performance across regions, particularly with the healthy bounce back in EMEA and continue into Europe. We also saw good dynamic in terms of landing new products within the office of the CFO and splash were good contributors as well. Last, but not least, there was solid performance in our install-based themes and renewal.
So as a whole, it was right across the board very positive and I would just highlight what Aneel said about the acceleration of the digital transformation initiatives coming back to the table and really is coming back across the financials and ACM. That at least is what we’re seeing as reflected in the pipeline when we look at the second half. I could just have one follow up for Robynne. Robynne, obviously a really impressive quarter across the board. When we look at the CRPO growth of the 24-month backlog, I assume that still has some of that headwind from the expiry base on it. So if we’re going to apples-to-apples it back, that would probably have been above 20% on this quarter, if we tried to normalize for that. Is that fair? And I assume that expiry base headwind should dissipate a little bit as we go into fiscal 2023. Thanks. Yeah, Kirk. What we discussed last quarter still holds, which is that we’re seeing an impact of roughly a couple points to the 24-month backlog throughout FY 2022. And you’re correct that we don’t expect that dynamic in FY 2023 at all. And just as a reminder, this dynamic has no impact on new ACV bookings, subscription revenue or how we run the business. And our focus continues to be on accelerating new our ACV bookings. We’re really pleased with our progress on that front, and you’re seeing that show up in the backlog growth numbers, even despite the headwinds that we have this year on renewal. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Oh, great. Thanks so much for taking my question, and congratulations on a real nice Q2. I wanted to ask a question that kind of goes back to comments you’ve made last quarter, Aneel, around really the strategy within it to surround the account, surround the transactional system with some of these peripheral systems. You’re seeing real strength in planning. It sounds like procurement is really ramping.
At what point -- is there a potential migration that happens when you have one or two of these modules, they’re running for a year or more? Is there a certain tipping point when you might expect some of those conversions on the core transactional system over time? Thank you. Well, it definitely doesn’t hurt to have a combination of HCM, maybe a few financial modules in there. But I think that the more important dynamic is that, as we exit running the businesses for the pandemic and try to run business in a more normalized way, the demand for core financial systems is coming back. And we saw that this quarter. It was a strong quarter for core financial systems. We saw the entry point with planning being up over 50%, as a really strong indicator of what we might see over the next few quarters.
So it’s really -- it’s more than just one dynamic. It’s across the board. So we saw strength in the add-on modules. We also did see strength of core accounting as well. I’d like to highlight that accounting center has a really important product for some of the large-volume customers we have out there, in particular in areas like financial services, a product that continues to get great traction and great reviews, just opening up more doors for us for core accounting. That’s great to hear. And one more, if I may, please. In the past, about a year ago, you talked about some pandemic headwinds. But then, you’ve obviously seen those improve. What are you hearing from the office of the HR manager and the office of the CFO in terms of willingness to make investments now in digital transformation, now that we’re kind of exiting things? Clearly, your results are showing that those prices are coming back in the back office. Yeah. I think the mindset for companies that hadn’t gone through the transformation was that it was really hard to run their business with the remote workforce or a hybrid workforce, or whatever module they had to go to, without the flexibility and ability to work from home with that could systems like Workday offer. If you’re on legacy systems, it was a really hard time. And so, I think folks have said, Hey, even if we are still dealing with some of the issues around the pandemic, we got to get on with it. We got to move on to the modern system. And that’s been a real big driver for us. Great to hear. Thanks so much, Aneel. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And a very nice quarter. A couple of questions kind of -- multi-part question digging into kind of the nature of the strength that you guys have been seeing in this first half of the year. And it’s really in two parts. One, in terms of -- is what you’re seeing just kind of a release of pent-up demand? Like last year was -- your 2020 was very difficult year to get these big enterprise transactions across the line.
So I’m assuming a lot of it kind of ends up in the pipeline. Or is there more of a combination of sort of pent-up demand and sort of new business coming into the pipe or sort of a new digital transformation initiatives getting an extra boost, given what happened last year.
And then similarly, last year one of the real bright spots was how well the upsell motion, the base motion, propped up overall growth for the company. Has that sustained with new business ramping up? Have you been able to keep that good balance of new business in the door, as well as upsell, into FY 2022? Thank you. I’ll take the first part. I think it is bit of both. There’s no question there was some pent-up demand that’s impacted the first half of the year, but I really think the pandemic forced a key change and a change in mindset about how quickly people had to get into the cloud and move into the digital transformation project for HR and Finance. While it might have slowed down last year, I think it’s picked up, but now I think it’s going to be that way going forward. Even companies that had waited for a long time are now acting today. So a bit of pent-up demand, but I think more a positive change in the marketplace going forward. Tommy [ph], you want to add to that? I would just say that jointly we have healthy and new global activity. To your question, Keith, we’re seeing a very solid quarter with significant growth rates on our install base, and it is not just one single solution, right? When you look across accounting center or health or [indiscernible], people analytics, they are all contributing. So the upselling and cross selling, we think a satisfied customer base remains very healthy. So it’s really building the business, having good momentum on all engines. Excellent. Nice job, you guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Thank you, and I’ll add my congrats. So Robynne, our thinking was that the pipeline inflection that you saw a couple of quarters back would not convert to bookings, really, until later this year and into next year. So just given the upside, did you see a bit faster cycle of pipeline conversion than normal? Or did you kind of still see it lining up relatively more towards year-end? Yeah. Well as you know, we always have a really important and strong back half of the year, and that’s not changing this year. We did have very, very good pipeline conversion rates in Q2 and maybe, Chano, I’ll let you comment on that being on the frontline there. Hi, Mark. Clearly some of the land motions convert faster. The quarterly [indiscernible] seeing or some of the planning or Peakon motions. Those will convert faster than the core HCM and core financials products. But obviously, there’s strength coming already from the pipeline that it was built during the second half last year. It has already started to play out and will play out more given the second half this year. Okay. Understood. Thank you. Aneel, a quick follow up for you. I was wondering about the cadence of financing. We know they paused their spending during the pandemic, and now they’ve been wanting to accelerate their move to the cloud. Do you think that -- is the part of this remaining consistent where they might pull in some of the projects they had planned in 2024, 2025? I’m sort of wondering, with the delta variant headlines in the news, is that going to intensify that or defer that a bit or more of a zero issue from the delta variant? Time will tell. Right when we thought we were coming out of the pandemic, we get hit with the delta variant. It’s just such a changing, unpredictable world right now. The last data that I saw from Gartner suggested that projects from this year and for some of next year would be pushed out, and projects from 2024 would be pulled into 2023. And I think our pipeline suggests that the pipeline’s getting better for financials, and it should continue to get better. And I think going into next year more projects will get pulled into next year. Your next question comes from the line of c with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the nice start here for the first half of the year. I wanted to ask about the hiring environment in progress on that front. Two questions. Maybe one for Robynne and one for Chano. So, Robynne, you’re at 900 net new employees of I think you said 2,500 targeted. How does this seasonality, right, 35% in the first half, 65% in the second half, compare to kind of internal plans as well as prior years?
And then, Chano, just given the headcount ramp expected in the second half, if I gave you 10 new sales reps, how would you allocate them between hunters versus back-to-base reps? And maybe talk about maybe how that might be different than it would have been in a year or two ago? So on over our overall hiring, DJ, so as you know, we game the year with really, really aggressive hiring plans. I would have hoped it would have been further along than 900 at this point but it took us some time to really ramp the recruiting engine because as you know, we had paused hiring a lot of last year. So we had to get that going.
So it’s not surprising that we are going be back-end loaded. We feel really good about our recruiting engine right now. We feel good that we’re going to be able to accelerate hiring into the back half of the year and we’re still targeting those 2,500 hires that we feel good about where we are but maybe a little bit of a slower start than what we had hoped coming into the year. Okay. DJ, thank God Robynne is more generous than you and not giving me some more headcount that came. If I would be to play out with the team, I would say that the first thing kind of angle I will be looking at geographically, and clearly, we’re allocating more sales capacity today in international markets where we see a significant opportunity ahead. This is not just for second half this year but clearly it’s FY 2023 and beyond as well. So that would be first I mention.
The second one would be clearly, yes, between the balance between new logo on install base. But also you need to consider we have some of the land first motions across Peakon or planning or the strategic sourcing. So those plays into account as well. We see opportunity clearly across net new logo activity, across install base and some of the land motion. So balance picture across those and clearly with a more pivot investment within our international markets within North America today. Yes. Okay. Perfect. That’s helpful color. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks very much. If we think about the $1.1 billion of 24-month backlog increase year-over-year, are we at a point now where half of that’s from new customers versus growth at existing? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful. Yeah. Brad, so as you can imagine, the bigger we get and the longer we’ve been in business, it will shift that backlog component more towards renewals than net new so that shift has been something that has been in process for quite some time. This year is different as we pointed out earlier that we actually have flat renewals year-over-year. And so we’re getting a little bit more of a proportion towards net new this year but we expect that that trend will reverse again next year as we get back to more normalized renewals growth. Great. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Great. Congrats on the quarter. Very nice. Robynne, it’s a nice margin beat and a raise on the year. It seems like it’s more than just revenue upside. And this is despite what it has been very aggressive hiring and lots of discussions of investment. So is this a change at all in your operating philosophy or structure such that you’re able to get this margin upside and where accelerating revenue came? Well, good part of our margin race was the overperformance on the top line. So that’s a very big chunk of it. We had some expenses slip from Q2 into the back half of the year, some of our programmatic spend. And as I just mentioned before, we were hoping to do a little faster hiring so we have some savings from that as well.
As we look at next year, though, keep in mind that a lot of the hiring we’re doing this year is going have a full year impact next year. Some of the programs we’re going to put in place in the back half of this year will roll into next year. We also expect that certain costs will layer back in such as travel, return to office and hopefully in-person events that we can start doing again.
Additionally, the bonus program that Aneel talked about with about a 300 basis-point impact on margin, that will continue into next year and beyond. And so, it’s a performance-based plan, so it could vary with our results. But we expect that impact to remain fairly consistent through next year if we achieve our Targets. Keep in mind though that the impact from the plan on margins will vary over time based on top-line growth, hiring and performance against our goals. So just keep all of those things in mind when you think about longer-term margins. Great. That’s really helpful. Thanks. And then sounds like business is going very well. Can you give us some sense of where FINS ACV is coming in relative to HCM ACV? So we saw growth in both FINS and HCM ACV. And both contributed to overachievement in this year. Both contributed to our guidance raise, and we’re seeing really strong growth across both of those in our pipeline as well. I guess I didn’t mean a total. I’m not trying to pull that out of you. I’m just saying in terms of individual deals, is it coming in at larger levels than HCM for individual customers? In terms of pricing? We are still, in the world of HCM, we sell to absolutely the biggest companies in the world like a CVS health. And in finance, the bigger companies haven’t yet moved to the cloud, but they’re beginning to. So right now, I’d say the average HCM customer at the high end is bigger than the finance customer, but that’s changing. And they will equalize over time. Okay. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So I guess one element that seems interesting is there is a lot more of these new land motions around I think you mentioned planning. You mentioned Peakon, spend management. I want to get a better understanding. How much of the bookings is kind of this now coming are from this new land motion? Because it does feel like the opportunity for dollar-based bed expansion or expansion and going back into those customers is going be higher. And so you kind of are opening up this new--it’s a little bit different than historically when you had such a large land but the upsell was more difficult. Yeah. Clearly on the majority of the dollars that, of course, are still coming from the core HCM and the core FINS transformation as a whole. These land motions are clearly what they’re providing is much more significant volume, off-selling particularly on the install base but, as well, getting us into new customers that we’re expecting to cross sell later on to our core products. But, of course the majority of the ACV is obviously still from the bigger transformation projects. Understood. And then and, Robynne, maybe kind of dovetailing on Michael’s question, is it possible to get a little bit more color on some of the tailwinds on margins this year and how to think about them layering out of the model for next year particularly as we get back to some of those pre-COVID go-to-market motions in travel and with the bonus pool? Yeah. So in addition to my commentary answering Michael’s question, I guess the only thing I would add is that we still have six months to go until we’re into next year. Things like travel, how much it comes back, are still uncertain. So it’s a little hard to predict right now above and beyond the drivers that I mentioned earlier. But we’ll share more with you on FY 2023 margins at a later date when we get closer and we’ve closed another quarter or two? I would add that I do think travel and entertainment budgets, I think those will change going forward even when we get out of the pandemic. We’ve just learned how to work smarter without having to have people on-site everywhere. You can do a lot of work from your office or from at home. And then you can concentrate the few trips on really meaningful activities. So and I don’t think that’s specific to Workday. I think that’s specific to a lot of companies that were just used to spending a lot of money on travel that probably will not spend like that again. We will now take two more questions. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Chano, can you talk a little bit about the importance of the new payrolls that you announced I think Germany and Australia just in terms of the international buildout. We all agree that’s a big opportunity. The question is like, in terms of financial functionality, HR functionality, are you quite there yet, capitalize on that? And then I had one follow up. Yeah, Raimo, we really understand and acknowledge how important local payrolls are to our strategy and our customers. And if you look at payroll for your money and you know the country well, workforce management over there and the number of manufacturing companies, we are providing them solutions around HCM. Having payroll is of tremendous importance for us to capture a bigger part of the market. I can say the same out of Australia. So this is expansion really into this market. It’s very significant and critical to our strategic initiatives that we do have for growth within our international markets, so we feel very good about it.
Obviously, it’s going to take us a couple years to develop those, but even today customers knowing that that is our strategy, we think that is going to open more doors for consideration on some customers that are looking more for a provider [indiscernible] always we can close the loop, as well, in terms of the pay and the workforce management and time tracking and scheduling as a whole.
When it comes to financials, we just keep -- been doing an improvements in terms of our international capabilities. I think if you look at some of the analysts, they are highlighting those. Some of the customers, as well. They’re highlighting those, too, and we just keep becoming stronger in terms of our financials solution from an international perspective in terms of the local regulations, and basically, the localizations that are required.
So that, in some cases, right now is highlighted today more as a strength than many other things when some of our customers are becoming Workday customers. Honestly, it’s also a great point that many are going successfully live in EMEA with our financial solutions, and those are working very nicely and becoming preferential customers for us. Perfect. That’s very clear. Thank you. And then one follow up. When we talk with the system integrators, they are seeing a lot more activity of people sketching out, mapping out processes, et cetera, which is kind of the first step to towards changing the finance system. What are you seeing there in terms of how quickly those projects are evolving in terms of -- and also showing up for you guys?
Are we still in the same pre-pandemic cadence of six to nine months’ lead time or trying to sketch out what you want to do and how you want to do it, and then doing it, or do you see an acceleration there because people realize there’s a little bit more urgency here? Thank you and congrats from me, as well. Yeah, it’s a great question. What you’re seeing is more projects taking place. That is obvious. As you were saying, some customers are doing what they call kind of a place arrow, which is this mapping of the processes and understanding what would be the future compared with the assays kind of processes that they do have today, and they’re working with the system integrators.
But I think those A, are being worked faster because there is more urgency there for transformation being all the things that -- and difficult business that customers have been facing during the pandemic phase. And B, clearly, there are many more projects taking place, as well, around the financial transformation which is gradually improving is what we’re seeing there as more customers are more to the cloud. Your final question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question. Hi, everyone. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. So first off, you just announced the company achieved ready status for the Fed ramp program. How should we think about the sales opportunity in that segment, and what products do you expect those customers will adopt the most? Well, it’s already in motion. We already have customers in the Federal government. They’re more quasi Fed agencies than full Fed agencies that are using Workday. As we go through the cycle, it’s long sales cycle, but those sales cycles will begin, and we’re fully on the schedule middle of the next year. So I would start -- I would think you’ll start seeing the pipeline build and hopefully some good wins beginning to happen. Quasi agencies first, and then full agencies sometime next year.
In terms of HR and financials, there -- we’re a good fit. We’re going to find requirements that we’re going have to build specifically for Federal government, but we are, in general, a good fit for both solutions for the Federal government. Great. Thank you. And then just one more quick one. You mentioned it a little bit earlier, but talking about Australia and Germany and the expansion there with payroll, can you give us a little bit of color on how much further should we expect the company to take its payroll functionality after those two markets are complete? I’d expect that we’re going to continue to invest in payroll integration across the globe. We might add one or two more payrolls over the next few years. But you’re not going to see us add 10 unless we find a great company to acquire which we haven’t seen yet. What we are doing is going country by country and where we don’t have a payroll really trying to build a tighter integration. Great. Which is, honestly, what most of our customers do with their global payroll demands anyways. Awesome. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today’s conference. This will conclude Workday’s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call.

And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter fiscal year '22 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Workday had another strong quarter. As we highlighted at our Analyst Day in September, we continue to expand our addressable market with a broadening product portfolio and multiple go-to-market levers to drive sustainable growth on our path to $10 billion and beyond. As we've discussed throughout this year, our expectation has been for accelerating growth. While not every expectation comes to fruition, this one certainly has even faster than we expected. And we are optimistic on the momentum we see as we head into our all-important Q4 and prepare for a great year in fiscal year '23, Robynne will provide more details shortly, but we are pleased to provide a preliminary view of 20% subscription revenue growth for next year.
And with continued execution, we'd like to see opportunity grow even faster. Before I hand it off to Chano to provide details on our go-to-market success in Q3, I want to quickly touch on the highlights from the quarter. Starting out with our industry leading Workday HCM products, we had another strong quarter as we continue to attract new customers and also having strong success growing our relationship with our existing customers. In Q3, we added AS The Stores, Ltd., ConocoPhillips, Northern Trust, Toll Brothers, and Vishay Electronic, among many other new HCM customers [Indiscernible] lives in Q3 included the State of Iowa and Five Below to name a few. In addition to the strong growth from core HCM, our recently acquired Pecan Solutions, newly named Workday Pecan Employee Voice delivered another record quarter.
We're seeing the benefits having recently rolled-out Pecan globally across our own organization and we couldn't be more excited about the long-term potential to help our customers better listen to and engage with their own employees. We also continue to see strong traction across our financial management suite of applications. Our growing product portfolio, combined with digital acceleration in the office of the CFO is driving broader adoption of our financial management applications. To that end, new workday financial management customers in Q3 includes the City of Philadelphia, the World Health Organization, Wind Trust, Memorial Health Care, and Diversified Restaurant Group.
Of course, one of the big drivers behind our continued strong customer adoption is our relentless focus on innovation by staying at the forefront of large trends that are circular drivers of future growth. One trend that has been accelerated by the demands of the pandemic is the future of work, which requires new ways of thinking about workforce composition and how to manage different types of workers. We expect to accelerate our efforts in this area with the proposed acquisition of VNDLY, a leading next-generation cloud-based vendor management solution platform. Workday and VNDLY together will deliver a comprehensive total workforce optimization solution that brings an integrated approach to managing all types of workers.
We'll help customers bridge the gap between internal and external workforce management while enabling a holistic workforce strategy that delivers full visibility into entire workforce and managing and planning for labor needs, while also helping to control compliance and security risks. We look forward to expanding our efforts in this area, and we'll share more information after the deal closes, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal year '23 and beyond, we have an amazing growth opportunity in front of us, and we see unique opportunity to accelerate our path forward by further ensuring that our purpose, strategic vision, and pride roadmap are in lockstep with our go-to-market strategy.
To help us do that, we've announced a series of important organizational updates. The first 2 in late October and 2 more today that I'm excited to share with you. To help chart and further articulate Workday's strategic vision, Pete Schlampp has been appointed as our first ever Chief Strategy Officer. Pete has successfully led our industry-leading product organization for the past 2 years. During that time, he implemented a robust product portfolio strategy that's contributed to our current momentum, both in terms of delivered innovation and financial success. His ability to set a strategic vision and execute makes him the perfect fit for this new role, overseeing and evangelizing our growth strategy going forward. Second, we are creating tighter alignment across our product and technology organizations under the leadership of Sayan Chakraborty, who is now EVP of Product and Technology.
Under Sayan's leadership the past 2 years, the technology team has infused Workday with game changing innovations like machine learning, enable customers and partners to innovate in our platform with Workday Extend, build strategic cloud partnerships, and helps ensure that Workdays amongst the most reliable, scalable, and secure platforms in the industry. His long and successful track record in delivering industry-leading innovations, along with his deep understanding of customer needs, makes him the ideal leader to map out our combined product and technology path going forward. And earlier today, we announced a couple of more changes. First, we're pleased to share that Doug Robinson, EVP of Global Sales, as we promoted to co-president of Workday. Doug will serve as co-president alongside Robynne Sisco. As co-president, Doug will continue to lead our global sales organization, but also take on an expanded leadership role across the Company, helping to spearhead cross-functional initiatives that will hope Workday reach new heights.
And finally, we're also happy to share that Barbara Larson, SVP of accounting, tax and treasury, is being promoted to Chief Financial Officer effective February first of next year, reporting to Robynne. The transition of the CFO role from Robynne to Barbara is part of Workday 's strategic succession planning, an approach that focuses on developing leaders from within. Barbara has been a rising star since joining Workday more than 7 years ago. During the time, she has held several leadership positions across our finance and product organizations, providing her with the right foundation to step into the CFO role and lead our finance organization into the future. With Barbara's move to CFO, Robynne will now focus more on her Co-President responsibilities. This will include an increased emphasis on engaging with some of our most strategic FINS customers and prospects to increase Workday's footprint within the office of the CFO, in addition to continuing to lead her current organization.
It's an exciting time to be at Workday and we're looking forward to the impact Pete, Sayan, Barbara, Doug, and Robynne will continue to make as we all strive to aspire a brighter Workday for all. As I look ahead, my optimism for Workday's future couldn't be higher. We have a great team in place and a significant global opportunity in front of us as companies continue to embark on their HR and finance transformation journeys. With that, I'll turn it over to our Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you Aneel and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I want to start by offering my congratulations to Pete, Sayan, Barbara and Doug. You're all amazing leaders and fantastic colleagues who have worked tirelessly to push us forward as a Company, and your promotions to these roles is incredibly well deserved. As Aneel mentioned, we delivered a solid Q3, driven by a strong execution combined with healthy demand for financials and HCN solutions. The strong conversion rates that we experienced in the first half of the year continued in Q3, driving net new business acceleration that once again outpace our expectations. In addition, our pipeline generation remained very healthy, setting us up incredibly well to achieve our full-year acceleration targets and providing incremental confidence in our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.
Strength in Q3 was once again broad-based with solid growth in landing new core HR and FINS customers. Performance in North America remained strong across the large enterprise, while the medium enterprise and international markets both drove significant outperformance. EMEA was a highlight with outstanding results in the UK, Spain, and Switzerland. In addition to solid performance from our land sales team, the momentum within our customer base team continued in Q3, driving continued strength in net revenue retention. We once again saw a very strong renewal performance and our customer base team drove strength, cross selling a number of solutions aimed at the CHRO and CFO, including coffins, learning people analytics, planning and spend management.
We were also excited by the strength that we saw with Peakon, which has been part of Workday now for a couple of quarters and which drove record performance, including the signing of its largest ever deal. Customer base expansions with Peakon in Q3 included Banco Santander, [Indiscernible] North America, a new Peakon first customer, including Holland & Barrett and S3. [Indiscernible] had another fantastic quarter with wins Bristol Myers Squibb, Carbonell Health [Indiscernible] stores and U.S. Foods. Not only does the extensibility of our platform help us go deeper with our customers, but it also allows us to engage our partner ecosystem in very [Indiscernible] ways.
A great example of this is through our partnership with [Indiscernible] who built an emissions planning model in Workday adaptive planning to address critical sustainability objectives related to carbon reduction for governments in Asia-Pacific. This ESG solution has global applicability and is one of several examples of partners adding their IP to enhance the value of the Workday platform. Our industry approach is winning the market and strengthening our government vertical was one of the many highlights in Q3. As Aneel mentioned, we were selected by the City of Philadelphia for financial management in addition to planning [Indiscernible], spend management, and several other solutions.
We also signed platform HCM FINS deals with the City of Worcester, Massachusetts and the county of Mobile, Alabama. And we had wins across a number of other states, city, and local governments, both in the U.S. and internationally. Successes such as this highlight the importance of taking an industry approach. And we expect to continue to make significant investments across key industries from both a product and go-to-market standpoint. As we've discussed throughout this year, we're investing aggressively in our go-to-market effort. And we made continued progress on this front in Q3 adding global sales capacity across both our [Indiscernible] and customer base teams. We're also accelerating our investment across key brand marketing initiatives.
These investments, which we expect will continue in Q4 and into FY23, our focus on sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth. In closing, I would like to thank the more than 14,200 global workmates who have enabled us to drive such strong Q3 and year-to-date results. We are very well positioned as we enter all important fourth quarter. And we have our eyes set on record pipeline generation targets, as we look to lay the foundation for a strong FY23. And now I will turn it over to our Co-President and CFO, Robynne Sisco. Over to you, Robynne. Thanks, Chano and good afternoon, everyone. First, I'd like to say that I could not be more excited about the leadership changes and I'm incredibly proud to share the President title with Doug and to pass the CFO mantel to Barbara. I look forward to continuing to partner with both of them. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we reported a strong third quarter, once again accelerating subscription revenue growth as organizations across the globe look to Workday as their strategic partner in driving their HR and finance digital transformations. Subscription revenue in Q3 was $1.17 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by healthy new business sales and strong customer renewals with gross retention, once again, over 95%. Professional services revenue was $156 million, resulting in total revenue of $1.33 billion.
Revenue outside the U.S. was $336 million, up 23% year-over-year, and representing 25% of the total. 24 months backlog at the end of the third quarter was $7.12 billion growth of 20%. Total subscription revenue backlog was $10.97 billion, up 24%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $332 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. Margin over achievement was driven by a combination of top-line outperformance, some favorable expense variances, and significantly more back-end loaded hiring in the quarter than we anticipated. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $385 million, growth of 31%, driven by the margin strength combined with very strong collections.
Our largest investments continue to be in our people and then attracting top talent to Workday. In the third quarter, we meaningfully ramped up the pace of hiring, successfully adding and integrating approximately 800 net new employees, bringing our total employee count to over 14,200 at the end of Q3. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our results and execution in Q3, and we're very well positioned as we enter our final quarter of the year. Turning now to guidance. Based on our strong Q3 and the continued momentum we're seeing in our business, we are raising our FY '22 outlook and providing Q4 guidance as follows. For subscription revenue, we're raising our full-year estimate to be in the range of $4.533 billion to $4.535 billion, approximately 20% growth.
For Q4, we expect subscription revenue of $1.216 billion to $1.218 billion, 21% growth. And we project 24-month backlog growth of 19.5%. We still expect professional services revenue to be $590 million in FY22 with $145 million in Q4 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest levels of customer success. Based on our Q3 outperformance, we now expect full-year FY2022 non-GAAP operating margins of 22%. For Q4, we estimate non-GAAP operating margins of 16% as we continue the pace of hiring and growth investments and begin our new performance cash bonus program in Q4. The GAAP operating margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP operating margins by approximately 24 percentage points in Q4 and for the full year. We are updating our FY22 guidance for operating cash flow to $1.65 billion, growth of 30% and we still expect $270 million of other capital investments in FY2022 to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.
While we are early in our FY23 planning cycle and have an important Q4 to close, we'd like to provide a preliminary and high-level view of FY23. We currently expect subscription revenue of approximately $5.44 billion, growth of 20% year-over-year. We expect subscription revenue in Q1 of FY23 to increase approximately 2.5% sequentially from Q4, FY22. As we shared in our recent Analyst Day, we are focused on driving sustainable subscription revenue growth of 20% or higher on our path to $10 billion in revenue. Given the strength of our market position and the accelerating trends we see across HR and finance digital transformation, we expect to increase the pace of our top-line focused investments.
Taking into account these investments, our expectation of COVID -related cost-savings saving out, and the full-year impact of our new bonus program, we continue to expect FY23 non-GAAP operating margins of 18%. Investing for growth will remain our focus and we'll continuously evaluate gross margin trade-offs. But we currently expect to resume margin expansion after next year, putting us on a path to reach 25% margins at $10 billion in revenue. I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers, and partners for their continued support and hard work. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please limit yourself to one question. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter and congrats to everyone on their promotions. Aneel and Chano, first of all, thank you all for the preliminary look ahead to fiscal '23, but Aneel and Chano, could you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the pipeline today that gives you confidence in that 20% plus outlook for subscription revenue growth? Just curious if it's the volume of deals you're seeing in the pipeline pick up, the size of deals, and maybe if you could just add a little color on the core financial opportunities as well, that'd be great. Thanks so much. Chano? Yeah. And Kirk, thanks for your question. I think not only did we see a strengthening in Q3 new business, but the pipeline momentum that we have described the last several quarters continued as well, with the strength, I would say, across regions and solutions as well. And I think it's a much more balanced and predictable pipeline when compared to a few years ago, as our product portfolio has expanded, and as we have seen really healthy momentum across both motions, landing and expanding. So, we have our sights set on another record pipeline quarter in Q4 to help lay out the foundation for a solid FY23 and beyond. The trends, we're seeing our pipeline support our view that the momentum in the business is sustainable and support our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth. In terms of core things, it was really a contributor to the strong quarter. We have both core fins on the fins last category as a whole, Kirk. That's great. I guess just a quick follow-up for Robynne. Robynne, is the 24-month backlog number still being weighed down by a lower renewal cohort and can you just remind us of what that is and maybe when that normalizes, if that's still playing out right now? Yeah, Kirk. So, as you recall, coming into this year, we discussed a couple point headwind to 24-month backlog growth this entire year, stemming from the flattish renewal base that we saw coming into the year. For the most part, that's played out as we thought, although our really strong renewal rate s throughout the year have somewhat offset that dynamic to give us the results that we've been reporting to-date on this front. When we look ahead to FY23, we are expecting to return to a more normalized rate of growth in the renewal base and therefore, expect that that headwind goes away. Super. Thanks so much. Congrats. Our next question comes from the comes from the line of Kash Regan with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Hi. Thank you very much. It's great to see how you promote internal talent, starting with the -- Doug, it's a very long list, and it's great that you were able to create the next generation of management, including Chano, and Barbara, and Robynne, etc. And my question has to do with net new ACV back to the base. We've been on it for two years, and there's no stopping of any -- no slowing down of momentum in that business aspect. Can you talk, either Chano or Aneel, about the opportunities ahead? As the product portfolio continues to build -- And you still keep adding new customers, but again, the bass opportunity continues to be vibrant. Can you just expand a little bit more about how you plan to make it even more of a focus going forward? Thank you so much, and congrats on a very strong quarter. I might just touch on the new products and Chano can touch on the go-to-market piece. I think one of the great things we have had, both through internal development and through acquisition, most recently Peakon, and now Bentley, are products that we can sell back to our really broad-based financial HR customer base. And on the finance side, we do the same thing with Scout. And we hope to do that with Zimit, and planning's been across both product lines. That really has changed the game. We have these really powerful add-on products that are best-in-class, that are attractive to customers and maybe Chano can talk about how we're doing that. Yeah, thank you Kash, and thank you, Aneel. I think the value proposition of the innovation and the solutions that Sayan and Pete and the team are building is just fantastic, and I would say it's no single solution is the one driving the momentum, Kash. It is really broad base strength across the full portfolio of HR and financial solutions. And I think that drove strengths as well in the renewal rates and our customer base, which I believe it speaks to how strategic we are for our customers. So, we are expecting this momentum to continue, and we share with you on our Analyst Day that 10 billion opportunity that we see in our customer base and of course, expanding as we keep adding more customers. And we keep planning to keep adding some of the investments that we're doing across go-to-market, Kash, those going to customer base obviously, and as we've been highlighting, we are planning to strengthen for next year the land motions, clearly of solutions around Pico, and work the extra resourcing planning, and credibility, going forward as well. So, we are pretty excited by the opportunity ahead on the customer base. Bravo. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Yes. Thank you very much. And I'll add my congrats to everyone who is taking on a new role, Doug, Barbara, Pete, and Sayan. Much deserved. I wanted to ask Robynne, I'm looking at the sequential change in the 24 months subscription backlog for Q3. It's actually a bigger number than we've seen the last couple of years. So, I'm just curious if what we're seeing is the conversion of that pipeline build that, I think you've said was starting maybe 9 to 12 months ago as you expected or are you seeing something that's converting faster or in period from Peakon or other products, or is it maybe something else that's driving that sequential strength? Yeah, Mark. I will just point out a few things even though we really are seeing strength across all of our business in multiple different ways but the few things that I'll call out is our conversion rates have remained on the higher side. And so that has certainly helped us convert more pipeline. We also, as we strengthen our sales motion on some of our acquired companies are products that we can sell independently; those tend to have shorter cycles and so we're seeing an impact there as well. And then lastly, we just have seen really strong renewals. Really strong renewals had uplift to those renewals and so that has really helped us with sequential growth in backlog as well. Okay, so three different legs to the stool. Thank you, Robynne. And then just a very quick follow-up. You had announced a major new HCM logos. I think Aneel commented on ConocoPhillips, their trusted Toll Brothers, big companies. Any comments on who the incumbents were and just trying to -- You said the pipeline generation remained healthy. Should we infer that you see pretty strong indications among the Fortune 500 for Q4? I would say on your first question within [Indiscernible] where usually 80% of those are coming from our main two legacy competitors, and is no difference here, Mark. To your question on the pipeline expecting into Q4, I would just say that there is good strong pipeline, great momentum. Usually some of the largest logos tend to lean in our largest quarter, which is Q4. Understood. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Great. Thank you so much and I echo my congratulations as well on a strong performance in Q3. I wanted to follow up on Kirk's question on backlog and the flat renewal cohort this year and just how we should think about the growth in what's due to renew which Robynne, I know you characterized as being more normal. But even if not numerically, and I know the more exciting part of that equation is what you're going to -- the growth that you're able to add onto these renewal opportunities and expand them. But how should we think about the typical up-sell cadence, meaning how often might you see customers [Indiscernible] new modules and new features and capabilities when they're made available, maybe intracycle versus upon renewal. Like is the renewal itself more often than not the time that you'll see them expand versus co-terming mid-term. Thank you. Yeah. We're seeing that dynamic shifts a little, Brad, over the years as we focused more on building the customer-base team. They're having continuous conversations with those customers outside of the renewal cycle, so where if you go back several years, I think 3 to 4 years, most of the add-on business came during the renewal cycle, and we've really seen that change with the investments and the back-to-base go-to-market. And now those conversations are continual. So, we're seeing a lot less add-on just in the renewal cycle and more add-ons just as products become available or as customers need shift. But the renewal is still a great opportunity to engage in a conversation with those customers. So, it's still as an opportunity for us to sell, but less dependent on that renewal cycle to actually get add-on business. And I don't know, Chano, do you have anything you would add to that from a go-to-market side? That's exactly the dynamics we've been seeing and the shift we've been serving during these last few years. So, it's less depending on those renewals cycles when customers are on adding new solutions. Thank you. If I could maybe sneak in one quick follow-up for you, Robynne. Seeing the growth and total backlog exceeding that of 20 months for a month backlog, we actually had picked up from partners, just in general, beyond even Workday, customers looking to go longer and longer duration in anticipation of inflation and price increases. Just curious if you have any comments on duration that you're seeing from maybe commercial accounts, I know government tend to do larger deals. What, if anything, is there to comment on duration? Thank you. Yeah, you're absolutely right that when the total backlog growth exceeds the 24 months, it's because we've seen durations lengthen and we've seen this fairly consistently over the last several quarters, and even the last several years, where the total outpaces the 24 months so I do think that there is a trend there of inking larger contracts, but they do tend to move around by industry and by customer and as we've said before, we are happy to have a contract length that our customers are comfortable with. We won't do 1 under 3 years but any anything above that, we really leave to them. So, it's not something that we manage to, but we're certainly happy when customers want to commit to us for longer periods of time. Awesome. Thank you again. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Great. Thanks, guys. And I'll echo the congratulations on a nice Q3. I wanted to ask a question about just the general environment of the office of HR. It would seem that with the great resignation and a difficult hiring environment that you'd see an increased focus on digital transformation projects for more productivity in general for HR. So, I'm curious if that is manifesting in your pipeline, not just for core HR -- core HCM, but the productivity tools like learning, analytics, recruiting, Peakon. Is that reflected in your pipeline? Do you think that's something that might be coming based on what you're hearing in the office of HR? Thank you. Pete, you want to take that one up? Yeah. I think your question is spot on. What we are seeing, the trends towards, as you said, spurred by the great resignation happening with the pandemic. All of those things are generating trends that we're seeing in demand from our customers for our products like learning. I would also put -- I'd also call out our talent optimization skew, which is composed of the career hub and the talent marketplace to allow employees to move within the Company learning, as I said before. And also, I'll also mention the VNDLY intend to acquire that we announced today as well, which allows companies to be able to flex their workforce based upon these talent demands. So, we're definitely seeing that from a demand standpoint from our customers. And we've had great quarters -- a great quarter this last quarter as well with all those products. Yeah. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. You may proceed with your question. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe I could build off Pete's comments that you brought up VNDLY, so it seems like a god segue to ask a question there. The product seems to be kind of a crossover between HR and finance. So, can you talk a little bit about where the buying center resides there and really what the pain point is? How would organizations typically manage that process if they didn't have a platform like VNDLY? I'll start with the buying center. The buying center is -- has traditionally been in the procurement space but has more recently been trending towards the HR space. So actually, that was a great fit for us because we sell to both of those buyers. And it really, for us, looked like a nice piece of the puzzle between our human capital management, our financial management, and our spend management solutions. Traditionally, this has been solved -- the better management of systems have been around for a while. VNDLY is really a second-generation cloud-based vendor management system. Great focus on the user experience configurability. And the one thing I will also mention there is that it is deployed by Enterprises, but also about 50% of time deployed by managed service providers. And VNDLY happens to have a great relationship with managed service providers as well. And we see that as a channel for us to continue to use as we go forward. Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. And then Robynne, maybe a follow-up for you. I think coming into this year, we had talked about those new bookings acceleration this year leading to faster subscription growth next year. With the updated guide and view of next year, we're at 20% and 20%, and I realize it's a preliminary view of next year and any good preliminary view embeds some conservatism, but is it fair to assume that if Q4 ends up how you're planning, we could still see subscription acceleration next year? Yeah. DJ. We certainly see upside from the 20%. But to your point, Q4 is going to be a really important quarter for us in shaping the subscription revenue next year. So, we're really focused on executing against Q4, and we'll have a new look for all of you on the next earnings call when we see how we've close Q4. Yes. Of course. Makes perfect sense. Thank you, guys. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question. Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. You mentioned 800 net new hires during the quarter. Is there any further commentary you can add just on the pace of hiring into Q4? Are you finding able to stay on pace with that 2500 target to start off the year? And is there any difference between U.S. and international there to call out? Thank you. And we were super pleased with the hiring in the quarter. We've been really ramping our recruiting engine and our process throughout the year. It honestly took us a little longer than we had hoped given the market when we came into the year. But we're really excited to make such great progress in Q3, and it's certainly our hope and our goal to actually have similar hiring in Q4, so that we can get really close to that 2500 net new employees for the whole year. It's a challenging market, but we feel like we've got the momentum to do that and so we're really focused on executing. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Great. Thanks very much. Robynne, as we think about the renewal pool returning towards its normal growth cadence next year, is that linear over the course of the year or will that be somewhat more back -end loaded, understanding that 4Q always has seasonality, but just that year-over-year growth opportunity. Yeah, Brad, that's a really hard thing to predict because one of the things that we're seeing, one dynamic we're seeing as we have more add-on business outside renewal cycle is renewals moving around quarter-to-quarter. So, if somebody wants to add on several products, their renewal's 2 quarters away, it's highly likely that are just going to do an early renewal and wrap it all-in. So, we don't see anything unusual and any one quarter that I would call out, but it is a dynamic that's fairly difficult for us to predict, and we do expect some variation quarter-to-quarter. But overall, in terms of looking at the whole year, we're excited to return to a normal growth rate and obviously seeing the headwind that we faced this year. That's great. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question. Good afternoon and thank you. I wanted to go back to the '22 outlook and guide up here. I know you guys were clearly optimistic at the September Analyst Day, but if I just rewind nine months ago, I think you entered the year guiding to 16% subscription growth. You've now had two quarters of accelerating subscription growth, and you're raising the outlook for next year. It's a pretty big change in 9 months. Is the story here driving the optimism for next year all about the $10 billion cross-sell in the base? Or are there other factors that are really driving kind of the optimism here in the business? And I know some optimism to a couple of months ago but love to kind of understand the pace of change that you've seen here this year and momentum that your kind of looking forward to next year. Thanks. Well, I said the pandemic was a once in a lifetime event and in many ways, quite a bit obviously sad and negative. On the business side, it did change everything. Whether it's the shift to remote work or hybrid work, or as you look at the broader base of contingent workers and the great resignation as you call it. And I think what it forces d customers to do was to look at their platforms and say, are we ready for this new world? And in many cases, they weren't. And we were fortunate that the way that we built our cloud products and the solutions we have are a perfect fit for where the world is headed, and I think we're benefiting from that.
And increasingly in a labor constrained world, what we're doing with Peakon, what we're doing with VNDLY, what we're doing with our own products in terms of helping people optimize their human capital is huge. And also, during the pandemic we saw a lot of big financial projects being put on hold, and now those are slowly coming back. So, there's optimism that even more of the financial products are going to be coming back -- financial projects should be coming back next year. As you think about the role of competition here, do you think you're in a better position to gain share next year based on the moves that you've made here and that's part of the optimism, or do you think this is more of a broader industry recovery that you're expecting next year? That's all I had. Thanks. I think it's both. At the end of the day, we started out with 0 customers and our main competition had thousands of customers. So, every customer we've gotten has been at a competitor's expense. And we've now passed 50% market share on the HCM side of the Fortune 500. We're getting that same kind of momentum in financials. And I do think it's coming at the expense of what I would consider to still be legacy competitors. I don't think they've quite yet fully made the transition to the cloud. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just drill a little bit in the planning, and I think last quarter you mentioned 50% ACV growth. Any stat or any update there? And just directionally, it seems like with all the supply chain concerns, there's a tremendous opportunity for you to help a lot of companies out at this point. Any color around that business would be greatly appreciated. Planning continues to be a very meaningful growth driver for us. A lot of the bigger components [Indiscernible] and the acceleration we're seeing this quarter. While we you do not call out the specific growth rate this time, our momentum remains very strong. We feel really good how we are competing and winning in this market. And despite all the strength we have seen in planning over the last couple of years, we have significant long-term opportunity. We shared at our Analyst Day, only about 30% of our customers having attached financial planning, and about 10% attached work force planning. So, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. Thank you. We will now take two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Thank you. Maybe a couple for Robynne. Robynne, maybe you could elaborate on the 24-month backlog guide for 4Q. Really strong number, but it's a similar growth rate to 3Q, yet it's a 2-point easier compare. Anything else on your mind as you thought through the inputs to that 4Q guide. Yeah. I would just say that we're really pleased to be providing the preliminary view of 20% sub revenue growth for FY23. But keep in mind to achieve that, we need to sustain healthy bookings growth, which we fully expect to do in Q4. Backlog is going to move around; it's not a perfect measure for several reasons, including the renewal headwind this year. But we feel really good about the momentum in our business and in our outlook. And we certainly would hope to overachieve the backlog guide, but we'll have to see how Q4 goes. Okay, that sounds good. And then as a follow-up, congrats on a couple of what looks like relatively small acquisitions. Maybe I missed it, but Robynne, any financial impact from these 2 deals once they close that we should keep in mind with respect to either revs or margins or backlog to call out or immaterial? Yeah. These companies are both really early in their growth cycles and therefore, really minimal impact on our revenue guides for next year. We do, however, expect those to be high-growth markets. And so, we're therefore planning on investing in those spaces to support the growth opportunity and all those incremental investments, as well as transaction costs for VNDLY and existing expense basis for both have all been captured and our margin guidance for both Q4 and FY23. Got it. I figured that was the case. Thanks for the answers, Robynne. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Co. You may proceed with your question. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Some companies have talked about more accentuated summer seasonality. Just curious how linearity track for you in Q3. And then you keep hearing how Q4 is such an important quarter. Any color on linearity there and just any anecdotes to give around what you're seeing in terms of larger enterprise opportunities as you head into the end of the year? Chano. We haven't seen any particular shifts in terms of linearity. I mean, it was good, strong quarter. I mean, clearly, our first month is August. Usually, is more quiet, but it was good and solid if I compare it to last year and two years ago. I think we had a good September, overall, but I wouldn't say nothing, no special call out there. In Q4 -- I mean, there are always very large deals. In this case, in the pipeline, for both, I would say HCM on financials, and of course, there is a solid pipeline across a very deep number, different solutions, geographies and on the whole portfolio, on volume business across medium enterprise and customer base that we get the ability. But clearly for us that delivering a good, solid quarter is keeping with the same conversion ratios and execution on the great large opportunities that are lined up for Q4. So, we're excited about them, but of course we have to execute up on them and basically do as the teams know that they can do. If I could squeeze one more in. You talked about how you're pleased with your own hiring, even though it's a tough market. I want to ask about how you're feeling about your partners and how well staffed they are and to support your accelerating growth, and if you see any reason for them to be having any constraints on their own staffing? Yeah, can answer that one. We're pleased how the partners are progressing. They added around 800 resources to the ecosystem in Q3, and they continue to be ramping up new resources during Q4. So, we feel very happy as well how much they are investing on training and ramping up its resources at the CV opportunity. I will just remind to all of you that they keep deploying around 80% plus of our solution portfolio. We clearly are doing much more with [Indiscernible]. I mentioned this example of the ESC solution around planning for public sector basically in the Asia-Pacific region that I think is one that they can be deployed globally. So, the relationships we're building with our partners these days is -- beyond implementation, is building out new solutions on [Indiscernible] jointly, and they keep re-investing for most of the larger size where they say out of the top three kind of strategic practices, so we're pleased how they're doing, and they keep investing within Workday's future together. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call.

Thank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I want to spend a moment acknowledging the current situation in the Ukraine. Our thoughts are with all of those who are personally impacted by the devastating situation, including Workday contractors in Ukraine, Workmates across the western region in Europe and families of military personnel who have been deployed in the region. Turning now to our business results. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered an exceptional fourth quarter, which helped us achieve the fastest growth in full year new ACV bookings in over five years. This acceleration in our business, along with our relentless focus on employees, customers and innovation, is serving as a strong foundation for driving durable growth on our path to $10 billion in revenues and beyond. Our business success is enabling us to attract talent at a pace we have never seen before and is allowing us to continue to expand and support new customers across our broad suite of solutions aimed at the CHRO and CFO. Indeed, we now serve more than 60 million total users across 9,500 organizations, including more than 4,100 core HCM and finance customers. As our customer community continues to expand, so does our opportunity to serve them in more strategic ways. As Chano will soon share, we closed several significant transactions within our customer base sales team in Q4. Our continued commitment to our customer success is also reflected in our industry-leading gross retention rate of over 95%. Additionally, we are seeing customers increase their engagement and usage of our applications as evidenced by the over 440 billion transactions processed within Workday in fiscal year 2022, which is an increase of 67% over the previous year. Altogether, we now work with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and over 25% of the Global 2000. Before I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success; and Barbara Larson, our new CFO, who will provide specifics on our rate growth outlook for fiscal year 2023, I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights. First, momentum for our human capital management suite remains strong as organizations continue to transition their HR operations to the cloud. In Q4, we saw a healthy demand across all HCM product areas driven by our ability to attract new customers while strengthening and deepening our relationships with existing ones. New customers in Q4 included Allied Financial, DICK'S Sporting Goods, National Australia Bank Limited, RiteAid Corporation, Smith Hill Foods and 7-Eleven, to name a few, notable HCM go-lives in Q4 included Evonik Industries, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Wells Fargo Bank as we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production. Switching over to our financial management applications, Q4 was another solid quarter with several marquee wins, including Genpact Limited, Mass General Brigham, University of Melbourne and U.S. Bank. During the quarter, we doubled the number of add-on core financial management wins when compared to the same period a year ago and had several customers go live, including Bright Horizons Children Centers, Sharp Healthcare and SS&C Technologies. In addition to the strong growth from our core finance application, we saw continued momentum from our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO, including planning, analytics and spend management, where our strategic sourcing solution experienced roughly 50% new ACV growth and our procure-to-pay solution grew even faster. We continue to see very healthy attach rates for spend management solutions within our financial customers, illustrating health finances increasingly partnering with their procurement peers, drive visibility and bottom line impact for the single solution. As we head into fiscal year 2023, we are confident in the opportunity we have in front of us and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives on our path to $10 billion in revenues. As such, we expect fiscal year 2023 to be another strong year for us. Lastly, I'd like to share a couple of updates related to Workday's Board of Directors. First, Tom Bogan, who most recently served as Vice Chairman of Corporate Development, retired from Workday on January 31st. And while we're excited for Tom and his well-deserved retirement, we are thrilled to announce that he has joined our Board. Tom came to Workday in 2018 as part of the Adaptive Insights acquisition, a company he led as CEO for nearly four years. During his time at Workday, Tom has been a trusted adviser, a true culture champion and passionate leader who embodies Workday's values. We are fortunate that he will now lend his expertise and guidance to help us capitalize on new opportunities for the business and work to accelerate future growth. The second update I want to share is that Dave Duffield, my mentor, best friend and Workday's Co-Founder and former CEO and Chairman, has stepped down from our Board of Directors. I will now carry the honorary title of CEO Emeritus. While Dave will no longer be on the board, he remains our largest shareholder and will continue to provide his invaluable counsel as an adviser of Workday. When Dave and I started Workday nearly 17 years ago, our goal was to build a lasting multigenerational company with employees at the center and relentless focus on customer service and innovation. We wanted to have fun along the way. The growth we've experienced this past year in the face of a challenging macro environment has only solidified my belief in the foundation that we have built, thanks to the amazing group of employees and leaders who embraces our values and are committed to delivering the industry's best products and customer experience. I will end by saying that I'm quite optimistic about our future. With that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to start off by acknowledging the more than 15,200 Workmates across the globe, who helped drive our incredibly strong finish to the year. Amazing job. I can't wait to see what we accomplish together in FY 2023. I'm also looking forward to safely spending time with many of you this week at our sales kickoff here in Las Vegas, where we are taking great care to follow the safety measures in accordance with the CDC and local authority guidelines. As Aneel mentioned, we delivered an exceptional Q4 and growth reacceleration driven by a strong execution and healthy demand across solutions and regions. Our performance in North America was a standout, and we had another solid quarter internationally, where Asia Pacific markets such as Australia and New Zealand were a highlight, in addition to healthy growth in key EMEA market such as Germany. We had a solid quarter of landing net new core HCM and FINS customers, including several Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, along with healthy activity in the medium enterprise. Our expanding portfolio of landing solutions also experienced significant momentum, including Peakon, Workday Strategic Sourcing and Planning where new customers included Tony's Healthcare, Plastic Omnium and At Home Stores. And we couldn't be more excited to add VNDLY to our portfolio of strategic landing solution. Even though it's early, we're already seeing the results with Q4 wins including RSM, Leonardo UK and Guild Mortgage, among others. In addition to strength from our net new teams, our customer base sales teams drove outstanding performance across both add-on and renewals, once again demonstrating the strategic nature of our platform. Customer base expansions in Q4 included U.S. Bank who purchased core FINS, Accounting Center, Prism and Extend; FIS who purchased Workforce Planning, Extend and Canadian UK payroll; and Merck, BP, International and Advocate Aurora Health, who all added Extend. In Q4, we also expanded our relationship with Accenture, who is deploying Peakon to gain a real-time post on its employee base to help power its global talent strategy. As strategic partners of ours, Accenture is applying its innovation in this area to drive engagement and deep employee-related insights for our mutual customers. From an industry lens, we continue to see our differentiated value proposition winning in the market. In financial services, for example, we closed several strategic deals in Q4, including core FINS win at the aforementioned U.S. Bank, Junior Mutual and Pam Mutual Life Insurance; and core HCM wins at National Australia Bank, Allied Financial and Autoplot [ph] Group. In addition, we expanded our footprint with several financial services customers this quarter, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Kemper and Western Union. Industry-specific investments such as Accounting Center, along with our deep industry knowledge and our rapidly expanding reference base of customers, which now includes more than 70% of the financial services companies in the Fortune 500, are all key to our success. And it's not just the innovation we are driving that is enabling our success, but also that of our partners, such as PwC, who created a solution for multidimensional part planning and profitability by leveraging Workday Financials, Extend, Accounting Center, Prism and Adaptive Planning. Our partners are key to our industry approach, and we're excited by the innovation happening across our ecosystem. We enter FY 2023 with healthy pipelines and clear momentum in our business. In order to capitalize on that momentum, we plan to continue making significant investments within our go-to-market and service and support team with key focus areas, including customer base, international industry and emerging land motion, all of which are important growth vectors in achieving our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription growth well into the future. Part of this investment involves strengthening our leadership team as we continue to scale, to which I'm pleased to welcome Patrick Blair as our newly appointed President of the Americas. Patrick brings more than 25 years of enterprise software sales experience and not only is a proven leader, but he's a great person and a tremendous fit into the organization. I couldn't be more happy to have him join that and the team to lead our largest market. With that, I'm now pleased to hand it over to our newly minted CFO and a cool start within the Workday organization, Barbara Larson. Barbara, over to you. Thanks, Chano. I appreciate the kind words. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I look forward to working with all of you over the coming quarters and years, and I'm thrilled to be joining Aneel, Chano and Pete today to update you on our progress. I joined Workday seven years ago and have witnessed unbelievable growth in the company over that time. One observation I'd make is that our market position has never been stronger, and the broad-based momentum that we saw across the business in Q4 serves as a great validation of that. Now let's turn to our results. Subscription revenue was $1.23 billion in Q4, representing year-over-year growth of 22%. For the full year, subscription revenue was $4.55 billion, growth of 20%. Professional services revenue was $147 million for Q4 and $592 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. was $348 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.98 billion, growth of 22%. The strong result was driven by new bookings outperformance and continued strength in renewals with growth and net retention rate over 95% and 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.81 billion, growth of 27%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $237 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 17.2%. As expected, our non-GAAP operating margin declined from last quarter driven by an accelerated pace of hiring, the rollout of our previously mentioned cash-based performance bonus and other growth investments made across the business, including the recent VNDLY acquisition. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was a record $1.15 billion or 22.4% of total revenue, showcasing the strength of our business model. Operating cash flow for Q4 was $615 million, bringing our full year operating cash flow to $1.65 billion, growth of 30%. Record cash flow results were driven by solid operating income performance as well as strong cash collections throughout the year. Our largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. We successfully added and integrated roughly 1,000 net new employees in Q4, including over 140 from VNDLY, ending the year with more than 15,200 employees, growth of 21% and in line with our hiring aspirations when we entered FY 2022. The record hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong company-wide execution in our seasonally most important quarter. Turning now to guidance, we are encouraged by the significant momentum in our business, and we're optimistic that the environment will remain robust throughout FY 2023 as organizations continue to prioritize and invest in their strategic finance and HR transformation initiatives. With that context, we now expect FY 2023 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.53 billion to $5.55 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. For the first quarter of FY 2023, we expect subscription revenue to be between $1.263 billion and $1.265 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the high end. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 7% in Q2 and approximately 5.5% in Q3 and Q4. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 22% in Q1 of FY 2023. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $160 million in Q1 and $650 million for the full year. We will continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. From a margin standpoint, since the onset of COVID, we have demonstrated the scalability inherent in our model. As we've discussed, however, investing for growth remains our number one priority. In FY 2023, we plan to continue hiring across the company at a rapid pace with a focus on sales and products. We are also expecting a return to travel and in-person events. And as we have discussed, we've rolled out a performance-based cash bonus program across the company. Given this ramped level of investment and taking into account our increased revenue outlook, we are raising our FY 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.5%. Investing for growth remains our focus, and we will continuously evaluate gross margin trade-off. But we're currently expecting to resume margin expansion in FY 2024 and have continued confidence in reaching 25% margin at $10 billion in revenue. We estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 19% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 28 and 24 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY 2023 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect operating cash flow in FY 2023 to be approximately $1.65 billion, flat from record levels in FY 2022, driven by the ramp in growth investments, the corresponding decrease in margins and an estimated $80 million onetime tax payment related to the expected transfer of acquired intellectual property. We expect capital expenditures of roughly $475 million in FY 2023 to support continued business expansion and phased return to office with investments across our existing facilities, corporate IT infrastructure and customer data centers. This includes opportunistic data center investment that was previously planned for FY 2024 as we manage the supply chain and plan for future growth. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver exceptional results during yet another unprecedented year. We are more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Hi, thank you very much. What a finish to the fiscal year. Several metrics to that, but Aneel, I'm just curious to get your take, the number of transactions in fiscal 2022, up 67%. Your total subscription backlog, if I heard you right, was up 27%. And you're now close to 70% of Fortune 500. And I think the number was about 50% not too long ago, it's clearly an acceleration in your reported results and you're calling for acceleration in fiscal 2023. As you look at this, what is the best way to look at your longer-term targets? Are we tracking even quicker towards the longer-term target, just at a very high level? Thank you so much. Thank you for the question, Kash. This was a phenomenal year, the fastest growth we've had in several years from a new ACV bookings perspective. I first want to thank the team, Doug Robinson and Chano, for driving great results. I also think comes back to existing customer satisfaction and a growing product line. And that combination with the innovation that we're building into these products, I think, is really driving that growth. Also, I think for anybody that was going through the pandemic and was still on-premise, it’s really tough to run your business with those kind of applications and so as difficult as the pandemic was, I do think it was a forcing function to move to the cloud for the ability to run your business remotely or at least in a hybrid manner, and we benefited from that. And I also think the competitive landscape continues to be positive for Workday. So very optimistic going forward and we'll see where it goes, but we're very optimistic going forward. Chano, anything to add? Nothing to add, Aneel. Maybe the only clarification, Kash, the 70% is of the Fortune 500 within the financial services vertical. But we still, of course, have a great market share north of 55% on the growth Fortune 500. And Kash, when we say the transactions were up 67%, to me, that's just awesome. That means the customers are really using our product and getting value from our products. So while our growth rate revenue-wise is not 67%, the transaction numbers just say that people are – our customers are getting value from using the system and growing a lot faster than we are. Wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Yeah, thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on a nice end of the fiscal year. Chano, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the international opportunity as you look out to calendar 2022, fiscal 2023. Just where do you think you are in, say, APAC and EMEA in terms of getting into those bigger sort of core FINS deals or HCM? It's obviously a little bit more wide open for you all outside the U.S. So can you just give us an update on international and kind of what your plans are for the go-to-market in that area this year? Thanks. Thank you, Kirk. We saw a noticeable improvement on our international markets this last fiscal year, and we see great continued momentum, which is reflecting on the pipeline in FY 2023. We have a healthy growth across regions with significant wins at companies such as National Australia Bank, GenPact and the University of Melbourne, Power Leisure, among others. I would say as new customer base grows internationally, we are adding sales capacity in our customer-based teams internationally as well. And finally, Peakon has also helped open new customers and opportunities for us, and they had a really strong quarter in EMEA landing new customers. But just as a reminder, Kirk, international remains one of the largest opportunity for us, and we're really in the early innings of the journey but still having a great foundation and proof point with many referenceable customers across HCM and Financials at this point. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Yeah, thank you very much and I'll add my congrats on a great finish to the year. I wanted to ask you about the procurement opportunity because, Aneel, I believe you mentioned 50% new ACV growth in Strategic Sourcing. And I think you said it was faster growth in procure-to-pay. So I'm curious if there is any extra type of tailwind on the procurement side due to reopening or anything else and just whether those results increase your conviction to try to invest more aggressively into procurement as a major focus area. Well – so Mark, I'd first say, we're going to continue to invest aggressively on the procurement side. It's a big market opportunity. Our products are strong, but there are gaps that we still need to fill. I think the growth rate was attributable both to the interest in that space, but also the attach to financials, there's just a lot of companies that want to buy finance and procurement together from one vendor in a unified way. So people that want to buy best-of-breed or if they want to buy them a unified way and in the cloud, we are a great solution. And I think that's becoming more and more the case. So I think I would attribute a lot of that success to that unified view between procurement and finance, which historically worked close together anyways. Thank you. Chano or Doug, do you want to add anything? Well said, Aneel. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great end to FY 2022. I wanted to talk about the increase of the subscription revenue guide. Up in that subscription revenue guide by 2 percentage points is no small feat when you're talking about a revenue base as big as what you guys have and the momentum necessary to make those changes in such a big subscription base. Can you talk to us about what happened in Q4 that gave you guys the confidence to up the revenue guide in that fashion? And then on the backlog side of the equation, at the beginning of last year, we were talking about expiry base and how that was a headwind to growth on the 24-month backlog as you guys talked about a couple of percentage points. Does that become a tailwind now as we start to anniversary that? And can you talk to us about where does that tailwind – if it does exist, where do we see that? And how long into the year would that persist? Thank you. I'm going to make one very quick comment and hand it over to Chano. I would just say that we wouldn't up the guidance the way we did if it was just based on Q4. It was a super strong year throughout, Q1 to Q4. Every quarter was better than our plans. And so as we think about the future, I'm going to turn it over to Chano, but we would never up guidance just on one quarter. Got it. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you for your question – sorry, Aneel. Go ahead, Chano. Thank you for your question, Keith. I'll make a comment and then hand it over to Barbara. I think it's – first of all, it's the investments we've been doing from a go-to-market and product perspective. They're paying off with undeniable, let's say, positive trend that COVID is creating within the back office and the relevance of the solutions we bring to the market. The pipeline momentum that we have been seeing for several quarters now, Keith, continued in Q4. So we enter FY 2023 with healthy growth in pipeline. I would say this across both net new and customer base and also HCM and Financials. So healthy pipelines combined with favorable growth rates that we've been seeing is what is giving us the confidence and the momentum that we're seeing in the market. But Barbara anything to add? Yes. I'll just round it out with an answer to your question on backlog. So as both Aneel and Chano mentioned, we've got significant momentum entering FY 2023, and you see that reflected in our backlog guide for Q1. With respect to renewals, specifically, as we've said, we are expecting to return to a more normalized rate of growth for our renewal base in FY 2023. So therefore, that headwind that we faced over the last year to 24 months backlog does go away this year. Got it. Would it be correct to think of it as a tailwind now? Or is it just kind of neutral and it's just a normalized operating environment? It's best to think it's neutral, and it's kind of more of a normalized growth rate this year. Excellent. Great quarter guys. Thanks so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Hey, there. Thank you and congrats from me as well. Maybe one on margin. You set the stage for some of the impacts there a few months back. You're already bringing targets up there as well for fiscal 2023. You mentioned still some moving pieces with return to travel. We know it's a tight labor market. So maybe if you just add some more around what gives the confidence to bring those targets up here? And any additional color or commentary around the pace of hiring is also appreciated. Thank you. Yes. Absolutely. I'll give you some specifics on the margins. So we are planning to add more headcount this year than we did last year, again, with a focus on sales and product. If you think about hiring last year, it was weighted more towards the back half of the year. We've got that hiring engine ramped now, and we expect to add headcount relatively evenly throughout the rest of the year this year. We also are planning to layer back some of the costs back into the business. So return to office, travel, the in-person events, we're all here together today sitting at SKO. And then finally, just a reminder that our company-wide bonus program did roll out in Q4, and this has a full year impact of approximately 300 basis points in FY 2023. But if I were to start with the headline, the headline is our higher growth rate does cover some of it. And let's just start with that, that the higher growth rate gives us more ability to drive a higher margin in addition to everything that offset Barbara said. Helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Oh, great. I'll echo the congratulations on a really nice quarter, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Just one on verticals. I know this has been a big focus. And certainly for FINS and for ERP financials, it's not a one size fits all. Are there any industries where you're further along here are ones that we should expect to become more incremental contributors from here? Obviously, financials is a key one. You've got a lot of success there. Are there others like that where you can get to the kind of penetration you've seen in the near term? Thank you so much. Chano, do you want to take that? I'm happy to take it. Hi Brad, hope all is well. Clearly, financial services, and I think a very important and relevant as well, the core FINS win with accounting center and the rest of solutions from U.S. bank and some of the great customers going live within our financials vertical and what we mentioned in that 70%-plus of the Fortune 500 financial services companies being already customers. Healthcare as well outperforming Q4, Brad, including strategic wins at companies like [indiscernible] and WellStar Health and several others. I commented on my remark notes as well Extend solution in customers like Advocate Aurora and some others expanding our portfolio. Higher education that we've been mentioning, and we have some significant momentum, including as well some go-lives and some more customers joining our student solution as a whole. Last but not least, I think you are aware, this year, we will start with our authority to operate in the spring within the federal market, and that is more a long term one. So you should not expect significant impact this year. But clearly, you should expect that it will be a growth vector for us going forward. Great to hear. Thanks, Chano. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Hi. This is Strecker Backe on for Alex. Thanks for taking our questions. So when we talk to partners, there just seems to be an ever-increasing focus on the FINS side of the business. So can you talk about that FINS pipeline some more and then if you have seen or expect to see any bottlenecks related to a tougher hiring environment or tighter labor environment for the SIs? And then just a quick second one, does your guidance assume any increased conservatism coming out of Europe given the situation between Russia and Ukraine? Thank you. On the finance side and then I'll turn over to Chano. On the finance side, we feel very good where we are product-wise. I think the SIs are ready. Finance, definitely, the function took a hit during COVID because we were viewed as longer-term projects, but those projects are coming back online very quickly. It's not back to pre-COVID days, but it's coming back, and that's a very positive data point for us. And candidly, as it relates to finance, it really just is a two-horse race between us and Oracle, and there's plenty of room for both of us. Oracle is doing well. We're doing well. As the market comes back, there's a huge growth opportunity for both of us. And Chano, do you want to talk about Europe? Yes. I would comment on the partners and talk about Europe. I mean we are focused on ensuring that we don't have any bottlenecks on the partners in our ecosystem, and we feel good where we are. As a matter of fact, I'm having some discussions with partners this week, and it is quite exciting kind of the investments that they're planning within their finance programs. So that's great to see. Not sure what was the question regarding Europe was, I think, was more a macro one, if I understood correctly. Yes. It was related to the guidance. I can go ahead and answer that. We haven't built in any increased conservatism as a result of the geopolitical environment right now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for taking the question here. And good afternoon. Aneel, you had me at the fastest growth in new ACV bookings in five years. Wanted to walk through and drill down into the why now. Appreciate Doug's commentary around this big opportunity to sell into the installed base. Is that really resonating? Or are there other industry factors, be it labor shortages, driving a need to invest more in HCM and/or just a return to office that's also contributing to the acceleration here in new ACV bookings? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Honestly, you kind of answered the question. It's all of the above. I talked to so many CEOs during COVID who just wanted to know how their employees were doing and their engagement levels. Peakon has been a great acquisition that way, everything about comp, everything about engagement, retention, everything. And if they had a legacy system, they were struggling. And so that was a driver on the HR side. And we're returning back to work, all the things you mentioned matter. I'm going to – I'd like to answer it, but at the end of the day, it was Chano and Doug that really drove this great success over the three years. So I want to turn it over to Chano to give you his perspective. Perfect. I think you provided a great context, Aneel. If I may add, I believe there are undeniable market trends in our favor, the ones you mentioned: a significant amount of digital transformation happening across many businesses, in all industries. And we're truly the backbone to enable those transformations and really the only cloud-first solution doing so across HCM/finance, legacy systems that are built for the always of doing business and can support current business models and business agility. Aneel mentioned they need to engage better with employees. They're changing workforce and skills understanding. So just to name a few, these are all C levels and CEO discussions that we're having, and frankly, we are really well positioned to provide solutions to those challenges and partner and help our customers to transform. Helpful color. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks so much, and congrats, not only on the strong result but the breadth across geos, products, various segments, installed base and new ACV, I mean, it really sounds like a strong finish. And I know we've touched on verticals a few times in the call, and you've featured financial services, you called out retail as particularly strong in your press release. We've picked up strong things happening in education and SLED more broadly in other verticals. And I'd just be curious if maybe you can comment on some of the verticals and opportunities that we might be talking about a year from now and things that might be brewing and maybe even some of the concerns around service-based industries: hospitality, leisure, travel, the extent to which they are bouncing back. Thank you. I'll comment on higher ed and government, and then I'll let Chano talk about the future. But we've had a commitment to higher ed and state local government, not since we started the company, but not too far afterwards. That was a big focus of Dave's as it relates to higher ed, and a lot of the state and local stuff are intertwined with higher ed. So we continue to be very strong there. That was our first industry/vertical we went after. And as the student system that we're building gains more functionality, it's becoming more accessible to larger and larger universities. It's a great solution for a university. You buy the higher – you buy the student system and you get HR and finance along with that. And in the case of public sector, state local government, we have worked to build all their unique rules into the products. So you see it in cities, you see it in states quickly adopting Workday. So that is a market – that's probably our first vertical before financial services. And then Chano can talk about what comes next. Yes. I think what comes next is, I mentioned before the federal government. It remains as the large on-premise for – opportunity for HR and financials application, and we see really a great opportunity there to provide cloud solutions for a significant portion of the market. I mentioned before an authority to operate coming only spring game. I think you should also think about on the core services verticals because the wins that we have like in U.S. bank now and core financials and the momentum we see in the pipeline, hopefully, that will keep progressing, and you see us gaining traction there. And last but not least, Serota, let's say, core services verticals and our core financials and financial task category overall, applying are better. I think our land motions with Planning, Sourcing, Peakon and VNDLY will allow us to even penetrate further on those verticals, even outside of our more natural, let's say, ones where we – they are not – maybe nobody be ready yet to transform core HCM or core financials, but definitely, we'll be ready to land and take advantage of some of the solutions we provide there. Thanks very much for the color. Thank you. We will now take two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Chano, you mentioned healthy activity in medium enterprise. I'm curious if you could elaborate on what you're seeing there. The medium enterprise has been executing really well for quite some time now. We've been highlighting that one. And we see significant long-term opportunity within this segment, and this continues to be a significant investment focus for us. I think we've done a nice job of tapping into that market and figuring out a way to rightsize the deployment costs with our launch investments, and we are really well positioned with the broader platform solution. So honestly, the team has been doing extremely well, growing significantly fast, and we're excited by the momentum and the pipeline and the investments that we're doing to that market. And was there – as a quick follow-up, was there any follow-up on what you're seeing with planning uptake? I know that's been one of your stronger growth areas. Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Yes. Planning, as you know, is a core focus for us as part of our FINS+ approach. That has been again a solution that has benefited from the trends out of COVID, and we're pretty happy how we are doing regarding planning overall and the referenceable customers we do have. And we do have more investments coming on to that solution as part of our land motion and some more sales specialists just supporting those go-to-market efforts, particularly this year and going forward. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me. And congrats from me as well. Chano, I wanted to go back to a question I asked last quarter already and there – it's about the evolution of pipeline. Can you talk a little bit of what you're seeing there? Because if it all plays out well, then actually this quarter, the partner should have built more for the next year. And I guess, the increase in guidance showed the confidence as well. But then also how do we have to think about the increase in CapEx, where you pull forward '24 spending into next year? That all seems to suggest that the post-pandemic build-out of the pipeline and changes in the pipeline and continues there. But maybe a couple of words on that one. And congrats from me as well. Thank you. Thank you, Raimo. I think the way to think about the pipeline is that there is good momentum, as I said, that has been building during the last few quarters, and we also saw that in Q4. And I think it's broad-based. It's across net new. And Aneel mentioned some of the results in Q4 with the extraordinary performance of that team. It's around customer base. It's around HCM, financials. From a regions perspective, we see it balance as well in North America, but also the rest of the world. So I think that's the way we look at it and the right way to think about it going forward. So it's now more a question turning on to the execution and that the investments we are doing within the new go-to-market and sales folks that are joining, really enabling them properly to properly position the value proposition and keep our conversion ratios as we've been performing within the last – this last FY 2022. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's fourth quarter FY 2022 earnings call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Justin Furby, Vice President-Investor Relations. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday’s first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer.
Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic condition.
Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP results.
You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our Company website under the Investor Relations link.
Starting with this quarter and going forward, we will be posting a quarterly investor presentation on our Investor Relations website, following each quarter’s call. Also, the customers’ page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our second quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on July 16, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, we are heartbroken by the recent acts of violence and the census loss of life. There are no words to explain the pain, the parents, children, families, and loved ones of the victims must be feeling. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Uvalde, Texas; Buffalo, New York; Laguna Woods, California and every other community that has endured such tragedy. Everyone has a right to feel safe in the places where they learn, live, work, worship, do simple day errands.
Turning now to our business and coming off an exceptional fiscal year 2022 of acceleration in the business. Workday reported solid Q1 results, delivering subscription revenue growth of 23%. During the quarter, we continue to see companies across our target geographies and industries, select Workday as they move their finance and HR systems to the cloud.
At the same time, several key opportunities that we had expected to close in Q1 were pushed to later in the year, impacting backlog performance, Barbara will touch on later in the call. Continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about the year, we're mindful, however of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and the impact these conditions could have on businesses globally. That in mind, our focus remains on what we can control, which is to continue to drive innovation as we broaden our offering to become an even more strategic partner to our customers, deliver the industry's top levels of customer support and cultivate our culture, which remains foundational to all that we do.
Now, I'd like to share some of the business highlights from Q1, starting with Workday HCM, Barclays, Callaway Golf and West Tennessee Healthcare were just a few of the many new customers that we welcomed last quarter. While these new wins are very important to us, we remain equally focused on ensuring our customers successfully go live, critical to our ability to drive customer satisfaction, the go-lives in Q1 include Hy-Vee, Kyndryl and Royal Bank of Canada, better known as RBC, proven ability to support our customers large volumes of data and transactions, continues to be a significant differentiator in our success. It's not just our scalability that differentiates us. It's also our unique ability to innovate and deliver valuable insights to our customers across the office of the [Technical Difficulty].
Learning, for example, we recently crossed the 2,000 customer milestone. We now have over 3,100 recruiting customers. We're also opening new markets with solutions, [Technical Difficulty] analytics, which now is over 500 customers and Workday journeys, which has over 300 customers. We're a clear market leader in HCM. Something that we don't take for granted, we continue to find new ways to increase our strategic positioning within the office of the CHRO.
Turning to our offerings for the office of the CFO. We, once again saw continued strength across the board. Highlights included key full suite wins at American University, Lehigh Valley Hospital, and Mohegan Tribal Game Authority along with several core financial customer go-lives in the quarter, including Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare, name a few. Our strategy for many years now and one of our key differentiators is to provide the organizations with a unified solution to plan, execute, and analyze their businesses in real-time.
That strategy is clearly resonating in the market with Workday adaptive planning now being used by nearly 6,000 organizations globally, including nearly 75% of our core fins customers. Here's some analytics nearing 1,000 customers, including roughly 40% of our core financials customers.
As you know, Workday was found on a core set of values that help guide our decisions as we look to do what's right for our employees, the customers we serve and the world around us. Example of this approach can be seen through our increased focus on supporting our customers evolving ESG initiatives that have quickly become a top priority in the boardroom and for the office of the CFO, especially considering the most recent and upcoming SEC disclosure requirements.
Q1, we announced two new solutions that will be available this year to further help companies view their businesses through an ESG lens. First is social reporting for ESG. We'll help our customers more easily track progress against goals and identify areas for improvement within workforce composition, organizational health, diversity, and workforce investment. The second is supplier and sustainability, which help customers to improve the sustainability and resilience of their supply chains. Test Scope 3 emissions across their suppliers. And these two new solutions to our existing product portfolio further strengths our ability to be a strategic partner to our customers, shareholders on the [Technical Difficulty].
Switching to the people front, we continue to invest heavily in our company culture to sustain our belief that happy employees deliver the highest levels of satisfaction to our great customers. That note in early April, we announced exciting expansion plans for our European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. We intend to create 1,000 new jobs over the next two years, which will increase our overall Ireland based workforce by approximately 60%. In addition to breaking ground on a new European headquarters building.
Dublin site plays a critical role in our product development and customer service efforts, decided to build on the already incredible group of employees we have in Dublin. As we look forward, have been the backdrop of macro uncertainty, comforted by the fact that as a company we've been through these cycles before, most recently navigated the pandemic. And as a younger company, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, each time we've come out stronger and remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and our long-term strategy, believe that our leadership position will only strengthen.
We have a proven track record of growth at scale, a robust business model with strong cash flow generation, the values driven culture there attracts the best talent and [indiscernible] it’s always been a recipe for long-term success for us.
With that, I’ll turn over to our Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to begin by extending a special welcome to the more than 700 many workmates that joined the company during Q1. I’ve recently had the opportunity to travel across several of our global offices and meet with many of our new and long time workmates.
I must say the energy within the company is amazing. I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together in FY2023 and beyond. We delivered as solid first quarter as momentum across both our net new and customer based teams continued. And we once again drove very strong renewals, a testament to the strategic nature of our solutions and our commitment to customer satisfaction.
As Aneel mentioned, we did see the timing of several Q1 key deals push into future quarters. And we’re also seeing some Q2 pipeline opportunities move to the second half, but we’re confident in closing them later this year. More broadly, we see healthy overall pipeline positioning us to deliver a strong FY2023. As we remain focused on driving sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth.
From a geographic standpoint in Q1, we have solid growth across several international market highlighted by the UK where we have significant wins and companies such as Barclays and NatWest Banking Group. In France, where people drove strategic lands at Accor and Orange S.A. And in the Nordics and Netherlands, where we increased our footprint with companies such as Booking.com and standard hotels.
In the us, we saw a strength across multiple areas, including the medium enterprise where our broad portfolio of solutions across the CHRO and CFO is driving our success. In the large enterprise, in addition to some of the new core HR and financial management wins, we expanded our strategic footprint with several of our existing customers, such as Voya, advanced auto parts, and one of the world’s largest technology companies.
Our customer base motion continues to drive strong momentum and we’re very excited by the growth we see ahead. Industry is another area of significant opportunity, including emerging industries like the U.S. federal government, as well as established ones, such as healthcare, where we are the market leading provider for both cloud based HCN and financial solutions.
Some of our most strategic transactions and go-lives in Q1 came out of our healthcare team, including wins at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Health Research, Inc., and West Tennessee Healthcare, as well as [indiscernible] go-lives at Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare. And there is clear momentum looking forward as our significant base of reference customers, along with our targeted product investments in areas like supply chain are clearly paying off.
Another key growth opportunity is across our partner ecosystem, which from day one has been critical to our customers success. Not only do our partners help ensure successful deployments, but through the extensibility of our platform, they’re also accelerating our product roadmap. A great example is partners here and consulting who leverage the industry expertise and operational supply chain knowledge to develop a demand planning solution on Workday adaptive planning, work was built for the healthcare industry.
Using this solution Dayton Children’s Hospital is able to make data driven decisions and ensure critical supplies, resources, and space are available when patients need their most. This is just one of several areas of innovation we’ve seen from our ecosystem. Over the course of Q1, we depend our partnerships with multiple assistance integrators like Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC, to not only launch new partner built solutions, but to align our call innovation plans to scale and accelerate over the coming quarters. Helping us that drive this effort and our overall ecosystem strategy is our new Chief Partner Officer, some are correct, who brings more than two decades of experience to the role and who will report directly to me welcome Sam.
In closing, we enter Q2 with healthy pipelines and positioning across the offices of the CHRO and CFO that is as strategic as ever. We remain as quarterly focused on executing against our growth opportunities and in laying the foundation to support the durable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our past to $10 billion in revenue.
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara. Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we had a solid start to the year as organizations across the globe continue to choose Workday as their strategic partner in driving their finance and HR digital transformations. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.27 billion, up 23% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $163 million, up 14%.
Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $360 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the first quarter was $7.97 billion growth of 21%. Growth was driven by solid new ACV and strong renewals with growth and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100% respectively.
As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we saw the timing of several deals, including a few large ones, push from Q1 into future quarters and FY2023, which impacted our 24-month and total subscription revenue backlog growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.65 billion, up 26%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $289 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 20.1%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line over performance and the timing of certain expenses. As expected, we made significant investments across the business in Q1 and began to transition back to the office as well as resuming travel and in-person events.
We had a strong start to the year for cash flow with Q1 operating cash flow of $440 million. During the quarter, we raised $3 billion in cash through a public debt offering at attractive fixed interest rates, enabling us to repay existing debt while also providing additional flexibility as we plan for the future.
We prepaid our $694 million floating rate term loan in April and intend to pay the principle balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash when it comes due in October. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share account will decrease by roughly 8 million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.
Our largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added and integrated over 700 net new employees, ending Q1 with more than 15,900 employees. The strong hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead.
Overall, we are pleased with the solid company-wide execution in Q1, and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.
Turning now to guidance, which reflects continued momentum across our business, while also taking into account a more back end weighted year than we originally anticipated. We are raising our guidance for FY2023 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth.
We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.353 billion to $1.355 billion, 22% year-over-year growth with sequential growth in Q3 of approximately 4.5%. We still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY2023, as we continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.
For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of a $164 million. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2 of FY2023. We continue to expect FY2023 non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 17.5%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2. Investing for long-term growth remains our priority and will continuously evaluate growth margin trade-offs. But we have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margins at $10 billion in revenue.
The GAAP margins for the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 24 percentage points lower respectively than the non-GAAP margins. The FY2023 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. As a result of our recent debt IPO, we are lowering our FY2023 guidance for operating cash flows to $1.61 billion, which takes into account approximately $55 million of cash interest payments associated with the debt.
We continue to expect capital expenditures of $475 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion. And finally, I’ll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.
With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. Thank you very much and congrats on brazing the guidance for the year. I’m curious if there were any common characteristics across the opportunities that slipped, for instance, by geo or by vertical. And just at a higher level, how much of a spread do you see in terms of your customer’s business confidence or their willingness to invest or the pipeline build if you were to compare and contrast that in North America versus Europe today? Sure. Hi, Mark. I would not call one particular area, whether by product or region in terms of the deals that push in Q1. Though, as we mentioned, it include some of our larger opportunities. Each of these pushes were for different reasons, not necessarily macro related, and we are focused on closing them later in the year. We are definitely mindful that the environment, particularly in Europe remains uncertain and we could continue to monitor it, but we have solid results across regions in Q1, including several international markets. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Thank you so much for the clarity, Aneel and Chano. Aneel, question for you. What are the tactics that you’re pursuing to weather through this potential people call it downturn, maybe you call it something different, whether it’s GTM product investments, hiring. How are the tactics changing it? I guess, a question for Chano on the deals front, what are you hearing from customers as to what they’re looking for in order to get clarity so they could go forward and close these deals with Workday. Thank you so much. Well, in terms of tactics, pipeline is – cloud is continuing. We’re being smart about the way we hire and probably helping customers with ways to continue their think through value proposition, maybe in a way that we hadn’t do every downturn. You got to think through the value proposition in terms of payback. And it’s probably more important now. And so we’re just dusting off that playbook. Chano, anything you want to add there? What I would say in terms of what I’m hearing from customers, and I’m just coming back from doubles right now, I have many CEO conversations there is that digital transformation investments, Workday being at the core of those remain very strategic and a priority. And we’re suddenly monitor very close the deals that push some large ones. We are very confident that they’re going to closing in the second half. There are not really macro related reasons at this point in time. The other fact that I cannot Kash is like, to give Suncor remain – we really started a strong and our May seems to be a very good first month of the Q2 for us. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Chano, can I just follow-up on that last point you made, which was you feel confident in these deals closing later in the year, so they weren’t macro related. But there seems to be some concern from you all that the macros getting worse. So I’m just kind of – were these just deals that maybe should have been earmarked to close in the back half the year to begin with. And they just needed more time, but it’s – they’re not freaking out about the macro or things have deteriorated in terms of their confidence level in their business, and they need some time to get their cash in order, whatever it might be.
I just want to sort of separate sort of what you’re seeing or seeing from say customers getting concerned, because you just said, they’re still strategic deals versus maybe these particular deals that are now going to fall in the back half of the year. So I just think it’s an important point to make, because I think people are hearing conflicting things on the macro from different software companies right now. I understand, Kirk. Certainly, there is uncertainty in the macro as Aneel has highlighted that is one point we can’t control. What I was trying to clarify is that some of the large tiers that push they’re not really due to macro. For example, a C-level executive changes that happen in the last month. And some of those that are key decision makers just want to review the role process to feel comfortable, particularly through the implementation process as a whole.
So that is a typical reason on a couple of deals that really push. The confident comes having the discussion and remaining close to these deals in terms of the commitment from customers that they remain strategic and a priority on part of those being done in the second half of the year. Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Turits from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live. Thank you for taking the question. Appreciate it. Obviously you mentioned in the call, some of the deal delays that you’re seeing. We’ve been feeling a number of questions around downturn scenarios. One of the things that you had already previously started to focus in on is, is the back to the base selling motion and some of the additional product that you’ve brought under the portfolio. Is that something you feel can help if some of these delays extend? I’m just wondering if that helps you diversify at all from a sales perspective? And you had some useful customer adoption stats around some of the modules in the prepared remarks. So maybe we can point back to some of those as well. Thank you. Michael, we feel confident with our sales strategy and go-to-marketed strategy. As it happened at the onset of COVID, we adjusted to those motions that we felt that we’re stronger. For example, customer base, for example, medium enterprise and some others like planning. So we definitely will be watching and monitoring the situation very closely right now. And if we feel that we need to prioritize one area over another one, we will be doing the same. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you so much and apologize if there’s background noise, I’m just here in an airport. But following on the last question, as we think about that light space opportunity and the install base and the degree to which having done such a great job selling into the base the last couple of years. Just wondering, to what extent it might actually create a challenge if the backdrop is to deteriorate thinking that there’s perhaps a limit to just how much product the customer base can absorb? Is there any reason that we shouldn’t think that with additional product that you guys keep innovating and in some cases acquiring that there’s opportunity or limits perhaps even in the ability to sell back into the base? I would say from a product perspective still in the early days of going back to the base and a lot of our early customers are just running one or two modules. So there’s no – I don’t really see any constraint on the market size opportunity. Chano, if you want to add anything to that. I agree with what you said, Aneel. I think our solutions are incredibly important in enabling our customers to approach their business with agility and adaptability. And I believe that as far as we’re bringing value and they’re seeing that value because they remain very happy. We have a huge opportunity in our customer base that we even quantified on our last Analyst Day. And it just increased because there is so much innovation that has coming through. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I wanted to ask about planning, it’s an area that we keep hearing from the channel standing out as relatively strong. You’ve called it out now for a couple of quarters. If you could help us understand, what’s going on there? Is this just progress that you’ve made recently with integrating planning to core fins? What’s behind the strength in planning? Thank you. I would say at a product level, the product does continue to get better and it now works across multiple use cases, not just financial planning, but workforce planning. And I do think the pandemic and maybe this macroenvironment are causing companies to think a lot more about planning and replanning, and almost a mode of continuous planning. And that puts a lot of pressure in the legacy tools. And I think our products are really well suited for this environment of engine, a plan every few months, maybe even sooner to reflect pretty dynamic business environment out there. Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I want to maybe just disentangle a little bit first on the push deals. How many of those were kind of HCM versus financials? And then within the commentary about the deals in the quarter that pushed versus the pipeline commentary of maybe things taking longer. Is the pipeline commentary more geared towards what you’re seeing or hearing out of the macro and have you recalibrated your kind of thoughts around the year based on that? Chano? Yes. Hi, Alex. We commented, or I said that we didn’t see any particular difference in terms of product or region in terms of the deals that push in Q1, all we said is that there were a couple of large opportunities. What we said in terms of the pipeline is some pipeline from Q2 moved as well to the second half of the year. But that we still see a strong pipeline and good momentum, and we’ve been creating a good pace that give us confidence to deliver on the goals that we do have for FY 20223. Thank you. The next question is coming from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Maybe taking sort of the other side of the income statement and talking a little bit about margins. I think operating margins in Q1 were definitely a highlight exceeded expectations. Can you talk to us – I guess, for Barbara, can you talk to us a little bit about what enabled those better margins in Q1. The full year guide doesn’t really move? Why not? Why not sort of push more operating margins through into the full year guide? And then maybe you could help us just basically understand your guys’ stance and how you’re going to approach this year given the macro backdrop? As you could hear, we’re all very nervous about the economy. We’re all very nervous about the durability of growth. How nimble can you guys be with that OpEx line to protect those operating margins and protect that free cash flow throughout this year, if we do get into a more difficult macro climate? Thanks for the question, Keith. From a margin perspective in Q1, the over performance we saw there was really around the timing of certain expenses and those pushing out to later in the year, which is why you see us holding our full year guide. It’s still really early in the year. And then in terms of levers hiring is always going to be a lever for us. We continue to hire, but we’re continuing to monitor the environment around us. We’re remaining confident in terms of the long-term opportunity we have ahead of us. And that these type of environments could provide us with an opportunity to really leverage our brand, our strategic positioning and our model. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Scott Berg from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, given the environment that you’re seeing right now and some of the deals that are moving around for whatever the reasons are, have you changed your strategy around investing on the go-to-market side this year? Is there anything there to maybe tilt your hand one way or the other on a positive or a maybe less positive framework? Chano? Thank you, Scott. Yes. Thank you, Scott, for your question. As we said, we will remain very confident on the long-term opportunity. We are certainly going to be cautiously monitoring the environment. We are confident as well in our sales strategy from a go-to-market perspective, but we will be fine tuning that one as the situation is evolving and as the year is moving on, either in terms of the investments that it requires, or either in terms of balancing investments from one area of goodness, to an area that we may perceive, we have more strength and energy during this environment. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now live. Thank you. And I'm looking forward to more than HR system eventually. The question and Chano on, if you look, if the commentary is it's not macro related, then you kind of had a kind of odd quarter in terms of sales execution, because it looks like you got very unlucky in terms of how the different deals came together. Is there anything you're learning from when you did the root cause analysis? You're learning from, from what happened this quarter and does it kind of also maybe trigger for you like an approach to go kind of breakdown deals into smaller sizes, get it more sold by product et cetera, anything? Great question Raimo and thank you for becoming a customer. Thank you for the partnership. When some of the deals are because of C-level executive changes, there is no much we can do about it in terms of anticipating some of those. We certainly are here to partner with our customers on a long-term basis, and we want to ensure that they have the confidence in the new executives in terms of the overall implementations on deployment plans. And that's what we are doing, going through them with the cycles.
In terms of our ability to split or break those deals into a smaller ones, we fill down some of this, the value of the solution is really when it applies to the whole customer base of the customers. So clearly our medium enterprise motion is thriving Raimo, that is giving much more stability to having a smaller dear components that will better outcome overall in terms of the business out there. Thank you. Next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Thanks. Many are asking your confidence in giving these deal close in the back half of the year, when I think many economists are expecting the macro to get even a little bit stiffer in terms of the headwinds, what's giving you that confidence that these are going to push beyond from what you can tell right now? This is not our first – it's not our first rodeo through a downturn, go back to Dave and I weathered lot of storms at PeopleSoft, Chano has weathered a lot of storms, as long as you have the right value proposition, we weathered the storm in 2008, 2009 which is about the worst economic environment I've ever seen.
And while demand was somewhat suppressed during the first period of COVID we weathered that's storm too. And so we'll just figure out a way. Our products are not choices. I mean, you have to have world class HR, financial ERP systems to run your business. And so, I think demand goes forward and there'll be some companies that are cautious, and we just need to figure out where to spend our sales cycles. If I may add a Aneel bread, when we're talking on some of these large deal, it's not that we're talking those many. So what we are doing is to continue a few, to continue to work these deals through our sales process, and we're staying very, very close to our prospects. And what we are hearing directly from them is that these transformation projects remain strategic, a priority and are going to happen. So that's what's giving me confident. Thank your next question is coming from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. You mentioned before that this isn't your first rodeo and you've seen this before, and I recall you going through this before. For those who haven't been through it before, can you talk a little bit about the deals that get pushed out? Like how does it unfold in terms of them getting back on track, getting on schedule, how quickly does it typically take for this kind of short-term dislocation to ameliorate? Well, I would say the first thing is this Q1. So there's no forcing function to close deals on the customer's behalf for Q1. We'll know a lot more over the next three quarters. We'll know a lot more, that's not a great answer, but we'll know a lot more coming out of Q4 what real demand was like. When I look back at the COVID environment, it took one to two quarters before people got their arms around that environment. And then they kind of went back to business.
I suspect the same thing will happen here. It's going to take a little bit of time for companies to get their arms around the new environment. And then they'll get back to business. And I frankly think this new environment's not going to be as traumatic as COVID was that at least from my perspective was a lot more challenging. Chano you want to add anything? That’s fine. Thank you. We have time for two more questions. Our next question is coming from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. I appreciate you making some time for my questions. I'd like to ask on other macro issues specifically, are you seeing any impact or is there any effect on the results, reported results from FX? Are you seeing any issues either in pressure on salaries or ability to hire due to inflation pressure in the U.S.? Thank you. I'll take that one, Mark. In terms of FX, we actively hedge our balance sheet subscription revenue as well as certain expenses. In Q1, there was some impact due to FX, but it wasn't material given our hedging program. And then on the inflation perspective in terms of cost, it definitely continues to be a very competitive market for talent, but based on our strong hiring over the last couple of quarters, we feel really good about our ability to attract and retain talent globally. Yeah, I would actually be stronger on the second part, which is the funding environment for start-ups, early stage companies. If you're watching that market has really dried up and there's always a return to quality and stability during these environments. And so we have this boomerang program where we're actually recruiting people who might have left in the last couple years and gone to a start-up. Now that start-up doesn't look so good and we've been pretty successful getting people actually back to the company. Thank you. Your final question today is coming from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now live. Great. To follow-up on that commentary around the start-ups and the funding environment drying up, how are you feeling about potentially making some acquisitions with valuations coming in, there's specifically been a lot of funding over the past two years in the HR software space, anything that's interesting out there for you to plug into your platform? Thanks. There are a lot of things that are interesting, but I can't really talk about our M&A strategy in detail other than say that we're always going to be looking for companies that have a great product, a great team, cutting edge technology, but we're not looking for those massive transformational acquisitions that bet the ranch. That's not who we are.
So we look at the last couple years, whether it's Bentley or Peakon or Adaptive to the extent we can find those kinds of situations or scout, we will continue to pursue those. And maybe in this environment, they're more cost effective acquisitions. But we're not looking at some of the bigger ones that have really dropped in price. Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs .",0.0

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A please limit your questions to one.
And with that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.
Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on October 15, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered a strong second quarter, thanks to healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. Additionally, we closed on two of the larger deals that had pushed from Q1, which we referenced on last quarter's call. Our results, which outperformed across our key operating metrics underscore the continued importance of digital transformation for finance and HR. And even with the uncertainty in this environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects because Workday continues to serve as a mission-critical partner to our customers with a proven track record of success.
Before I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success, and Barbara who will provide specifics on our Q2 financial results and outlook, I'd like to share some second quarter highlights. We had another strong quarter for Workday HCM, where the migration to the cloud continues with notable customer additions, including Electrolux, First Student, Groupe Adeo, Korean Air and Raymond James, and as always, customer success remains a key differentiator for Workday. In Q2, we had several HCM go-lives, including Cox Enterprises, Southwest Airlines and United Overseas Bank.
Turning to Workday Financial Management. We saw very strong growth in the second quarter as we added two Fortune 500 core financial management customers, and I'm very excited to share that one of those was Salesforce, the global leader in CRM. Already a longtime Workday HCM customer and partner, Salesforce's expanded use of Workday now includes Workday Financial Management along with accounting center, Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics and more.
Our growing partnership reinforces the opportunity we have to help support customers in the cloud. With this broad relationship, Salesforce becomes more of an increasing number of high-profile customers to expand from Workday HCM to both HCM and financial management.
Other new financial management customers in Q2 included American Electric Power, which was the second of our Q2 Fortune 500 wins; Apex Fund Company; Dave & Busters, Express LLC; and the state of Vermont, while key go-lives in Q2 included Comerica Bank, RSM and the University of Virginia.
In addition to the strong growth from our core suite of HCM and finance applications, Q2 also saw notable momentum across our broader portfolio of solutions. Workday Adaptive Planning recently celebrated its four-year anniversary as part of Workday, and I'm happy to share that we now serve more than 6,000 planning customers, including over 20% of the Fortune 500. It was also our second full quarter with Bentley as part of Workday, and we're already seeing solid results as it's opening up new opportunities for us to expand our relationship with customers who want to embrace a more holistic workforce strategy.
We also continue to see strong adoption of Workday Extend and Prism Analytics as both solutions are providing organizations, including the office of the CIO, with the ability to adapt to today's changing world. With Extend, customers build apps that are tailored for their unique use cases, which can eliminate the need for other custom development tools. Over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of customers and now have more than 750 applications that have been developed on the Workday platform.
And Prism Analytics, with now more than 1,000 customers, is enabling organizations to bring operational data into Workday to drive real-time business insights. These solutions are not only critical to our customer community, but are enabling a new level of engagement with our partner community as well.
And speaking of our customer community, customer service has always been one of our core values. As a result, we strive to maintain a customer satisfaction rating of over 95%, and I'm pleased to announce that in 2022, we surpassed this rating again as we have for more than a decade. This achievement is a direct testament to the amazing work of our employees and their commitment to helping our customers thrive.
We look forward to sharing more about our product innovation, customer success and market opportunity in September at Workday Rising, our Annual Customer Conference. This will mark the first time since 2019 that we're able to hold Workday Rising in-person, and we are so excited to get more than 9,000 members of the Workday community together in Orlando with thousands attending virtually for what is always a special event.
In closing, we had a strong second quarter and the first half of the year. While we recognize that the current environment will likely moderate the pace of growth in the second half of the year, we firmly believe that the strong gets stronger during periods of economic uncertainty. And we will continue to manage the business with that mindset and expectation, all in support of driving enduring growth for many years to come.
With that, over to you, Chano. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to the entire global organization for an incredible Q2. Every one of our nearly 17,000 workmates really leaned in and drove this result, and I couldn't be prouder of our execution. Great job, team.
Our strong Q2 results were driven by momentum across several of our key growth initiatives, including customer base, international, medium enterprise and the office of the CFO, a testament to our strategy and the significant long-term opportunity that we have ahead.
In addition, as Aneel mentioned, we closed the two largest deals that slipped out of Q1. And while the near-term market environment remains uncertain and we are not immune to it, we continue to see organizations of all sizes prioritizing their investments with Workday to continue their digital backbone transformation and drive increased agility and flexibility.
From a geographic standpoint, we executed incredibly well across our global market. In the US, we saw healthy growth in the large enterprise, including five Fortune 500 core HCM or FINS wins. And in the medium enterprise, our suite approach continues to resonate, driving another quarter of very strong results.
International performance was again a highlight, as our investment in key regions and the ongoing journey to the cloud are resulting in significant growth. In EMEA, we had outperformance across a number of key countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. And finally, in APA, we had very solid performance in strategic markets like Japan and Australia.
As you know, we go to market with land-and-expand sales motions, and both things drove healthy growth in Q2. Aneel already mentioned several of our core HCM and FINS wins, many of which were new customers to Workday. We also closed several strategic deals across our emerging land motions, including planning first wins at ExxonMobil and major bank [ph] and have become first-led win at a 300,000-plus employee global organization headquarter in Europe.
In addition to strengthening our land motion, our customer base sales teams in Q2 once again drove very strong results, including solid renewals and meaningful acceleration in new ACV with broad-based strength across a number of solutions, including core FINS, Extend, Peakon, learning, payroll and talent optimization.
We're also seeing momentum built within our planning first customers, who are expanding their footprint by adding core HCM and financials. Carle Health is a great example of this. They started as a planning first relationship and expanded their footprint to include core FINS in Q2.
Industry is another area of significant opportunity and investment, and I am pleased to share that financial services is our first industry to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Some of our most strategic transactions and go-lives in Q2 came out of our financial services team, including new lanes that Aneel referenced at Raymond James and APEC stand, expansion deals at Bank of Montreal and Cushman & Wakefield and go-lives at United Overseas Bank and Comerica.
Other established industries, including healthcare and education and government also saw continued momentum and we are gaining steam in verticals such as retail, hospitality and technology media, where wins included Salesforce, Avalara and Gold Pass. Needless to say, we have several other industries that are on the path to $1 billion and beyond.
Our expanding partner ecosystem is becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth and industry success, and the excitement we're seeing opportunity in front of us was on full display recently at Altitude, our annual partner event.
Strategic system integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC are not only ensuring successful deployment, but also serving as an innovation engine addressing our customers' needs. Together, we're also targeting industry accelerators with specific solutions and use cases. We look forward to sharing a lot more on this at Workday Rising in a few weeks.
As we move through the second half of the year, we expect the environment to remain uncertain, and we see signs that in certain deal cycles, particularly some of our more strategic opportunities, there is increased scrutiny and potentially longer sales cycles. As buyers do extra work before making investment decisions during these uncertain times.
The good news is that when companies go through their due diligence, we typically come out on top, given the compelling return on investment and reduce total cost of ownership that our solutions provide. Our track record of successful deployments of scale and our reference base of thousands of customers who can speak to the meaningful business value that Workday delivers.
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara. Thanks Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered a strong Q2 as enterprises of all sizes increasingly realize the need for a flexible, modern finance and HR solutions to navigate their businesses and drive change during these uncertain times.
Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.37 billion, up 23% year-over-year, and Professional Services revenue was $168 million, up 15%. Total revenue outside of the US was $383 million, representing 25% of total revenue.
24-month backlog at the end of the second quarter was $8.37 billion, growth of 22%. The outperformance was driven by strong new ACV across both our land and expand sales motion along with solid renewals with growth and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q2 was $13.47 billion, up 27%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $302 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of topline overperformance, the timing of certain projects, and some favorable expense variances.
Q2 operating cash flow was $114 million, which reflects typical seasonality from our annual merit cycle increase. In addition, with the final two days of the quarter falling over a weekend, we saw roughly $40 million of collections shipped out of Q2 into early Q3, which will have a positive impact on our third quarter cash flow.
Our largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added approximately 1,000 net new employees, ending Q2 with a global workforce of more than 16,900. Our hiring was focused on adding key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market resources and product innovation roles.
Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q2 and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.
Turning now to guidance, which reflects the momentum in our business and the mission critical nature of our solutions, while also balancing an uncertain macro environment, which Aneel and Chano described.
With that context, we are maintaining our guidance for FY 2023 subscription revenue of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.418 billion to $1.420 billion, 21% year-over-year growth. We still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY 2023 as we continue to tightly align with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.
For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $164 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q3. We now expect FY 2023 non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, reflecting a more measured pace of hiring in the second half of the year as we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment.
Investing for long-term growth alongside ongoing expense discipline remains our priority. We continue to have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue.
For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 18%. GAAP margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 23 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY 2023 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We're raising our FY 2023 guidance for operating cash flow to $1.64 billion. We now expect capital expenditures of $450 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.
As a reminder, during the third quarter, we plan to pay off the principal balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share count will decrease by roughly eight million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. We look forward to seeing you on September 13th, either in-person or virtually, for our Financial Analyst Day, part of the broader Workday Rising program being held in Orlando, Florida, where we'll share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Hi. Thank you very much. What a delightful way to spend Thursday afternoon, listening to your earnings conference call. Aneel and Chano and the rest of the team, a couple of things in my mind. One is, previous quarter, you were one of the first companies to talk about deal slippage, et cetera. And how did that end up for this July quarter? What were the certain customer behaviors you saw in the month of July?
And also, a question philosophically, as we open up and you have your first in-person user conference in a few years, what are the opportunities that are afforded to Workday as you enter calendar 2023 as a result of doing all the in-person activities that couldn't do as we were all working through this pandemic, be it growth rate acceleration, new product adoption strategy, what not. Just curious to get your thoughts. Thanks and congratulations, again. So I'll answer the first part and then hand it over to Chano. We did not see a slowdown in July, Kash. We did have a few deals slipped from Q1 to Q2, but Doug Robinson and the team closed those deals. We are very cognizant of macro environment heading into the second half of the year, and so we are taking a cautious stance on hiring, but we didn't see any slowdown in July. It was about as strong a month as we could have hoped for.
Rising is a great opportunity for us. We always do better when we're in-person. It’s just that simple. It’s a chance to get reconnected with customers, make sure we’re doing a good job for them. But equally importantly, as the product portfolio has grown, it’s a chance to showcase some of the newer products and have that customer base motion continue to thrive. So Chano, anything you want to add? Hey, thank you, Aneel. Thank you, Kash. As Aneel commented, we saw strength across the whole quarter from beginning to end, but we're clearly seeing more uncertainty and excluding the pipeline going forward.
Regarding to Rising, we are very excited. After three years, certainly, and it's about, as you know, ensuring great relationship with the customer community and that bodes very well with Workday. And clearly, as customer base becomes a larger part of our business is a more opportunity and a great opportunity for us to build some good pipeline. Fabulous. Thank you. Congrats. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please, proceed. Thank you very much. It's impressive to see these two big Fortune 500 core financial wins. Do you get the sense that the COVID lockjam is somehow clearing up there, despite all the recession headlines, or do you see many finance teams still kind of lacking the smooth sailing they might need to do a cloud migration?
And perhaps, you would have a little extra core FINS pipeline building up that might get released at some point, if that's the case. And then, Barbara, just curious if there's any sense for the magnitude of change on the hiring pace that you're contemplating for the rest of the year? I'll ask Pete to answer the first question on financial side. I'm sure there was definitely some pent-up demand, but Pete, do you want to -- Hey, Mark, good to talk to you. Right now, from what we're seeing, we're not seeing any difference in demand for our HCM and financials from what we've been seeing in the past. And that's obviously good news as we saw here in Q2. But what we will say is, as we go into more uncertain economic environments, which are likely happening; then typically in those situations, buyers on the financial management side tend to delay those deals a little bit longer. So that's just based upon our experience being in this market for a while, and that's what we're expecting to have happen going forward. And then, hey, Mark, it's Barbara. On your question on the hires, I'm not providing a specific target other than to say, we expect fewer hires compared to the first half in the second half. So we'll continue to be flexible and disciplined based on the environment we see in the second half. Understood. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks very much. And I'll echo the congrats on the quarter. Actually, maybe this one, it sort of echoes Mark's question. But I was curious, when you look at the pipeline build right now relative to what's -- you guys can't control what happens at the end of the deal cycle necessarily. But I was just, kind of, curious if the macro is having any impact at the front-end of the funnel? Are you still seeing the same number of deals come in? When Doug's talking about companies may be taking a pause, is it just at the end? And I guess, is there anything you can do to make your products more modular in nature, so that they can continue through the process without getting stuck at one point within the sales funnel? Thanks. Chano Thank you, Kirk. We felt good about the new pipeline build that we saw in the quarter across solutions and across geographies and barring any meaningful changes in the macro, we feel good about the pipeline we have for the second half. Certainly, we are never satisfied and we are focused on continuing to build pipeline, particularly with some of the faster sales motions like our customer base motion and our land first motions, because we can certainly create new opportunities, and we can still close them within the fiscal. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about a comment you made earlier, Aneel, on a couple of the FINS wins being planning first customers. Is there another set of the installed base of other modules around FINS that's brewing here that we could also see some upgrades that could come from? And then just any commentary on that planning first pipeline as a leading indicator potentially for more FINS additions? Thank you. Yeah. Well, we're now up over 6,000 planning customers, and each one of those to me is an opportunity to sell our core financial products. And that is probably the one land product in the world of finance that we can go in with first and have it be meaningful. And it's played out that way, and it plays out the way more and more. The more we get into financial planning and we continue to workforce planning, but the more we do financial planning, it's a great way in. But that's probably the one app that's our lead into core financials. Thanks Aneel. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Hi there. Thanks and congrats on the results here from me as well. You started somewhat of an investment cycle ahead of all the uncertainty. I'm just wondering if there's anything you'd point back to that you're finding is able to provide a bit of a favorable offset. It sounds like you're not seeing as much of the shift in buying behavior as others across software pointing to?
And maybe as a second part of the question, if you do see demand signals start to slow, you did have some comments suggesting second half growth could still moderate. How quickly are you able to toggle towards expense control and dial back as needed? Thank you. What I'd say on the first part of the question, we know -- who knows how the future is going to play out. But I think one thing that's different about Workday and some of the other cloud companies is that we're still very lightly penetrated in our installed base. When I look at how much revenue we drive, it's not as high as some of our peers in the cloud, and so that's always a good place to sell during tough economic times.
Your customers are already committed to Workday. They're already happy, and there -- and so I would say, we're less about toggling about expenses, more about toggling to a different sales strategy. And then I think what we're also doing is, we're dusting off the TCO analysis that we used to do many years ago during the 2008, 2009 collapse where we had to prove out our TCO in order to even get invited to the game. This market has not been about TCO, it's been about digital transformation, but we do have a very compelling TCO story as well. Chano, Pete or Barbara, you want add anything? Do you want to talk about the expenses, Barbara? Yes, I think on the expenses, as we said, we're moderating the pace of hiring in the second half -- being cautious going into the second half, but we're going to continue to add resources. At the same time, we're going to be flexible based on the environment we see in the second half. So we feel confident, if we need to toggle some of that hiring down in the second half that we can do that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and really great quarter you guys put up. And I think you could probably see kind of in all our questions -- a lot of us are trying to figure out like how do you guys pull this off while a lot of other of your peers are struggling? And I think you're trying to get at it and you're talking a little bit about being more likely penetrated into the base. I was wondering if you could expand on that because a lot of us think of you guys as having a really good presence and a big presence in HCM, particularly in the US, maybe a little bit less so in Europe. Things are definitely on the come. What do you mean by lightly penetrated in the days? It's just that there's a lot more to upsell and a lot more product to give to your customers. Can you give -- and why is that such an advantage at a time like this? Well, I would just echo what I said in the previous answer. A happy customer is always an easier sale than a net new customer that doesn't have experience working with you. In terms of penetration, I'll turn that over to Chano to talk about where we are. Chano and Doug really were the drivers of our -- back to the base motion, and it's still relatively new for us. It's only a few years old versus, I think, other companies have had it more land and expand where we don't really have that opportunity. We land expanded and then we want to add more modules. Yes, that's correct, Keith. I would say first that our key growth drivers played out well during the quarter, both customer base, international office, the CFO, and media enterprise, they all behave pretty well across geographies and across different solutions. In terms of the penetration, as you know, we've been focusing more on the customer base because we've been heavily net new during a very long time, and we've been doing investments there that are paying off. And clearly, we've also been innovating and adding a significant number of solutions.
So as Aneel is saying, when customers are happy and seeing value and we are focusing on showing the return on investment on those solutions. They tend to buy more and that is exactly what is happening across the segments. And clearly there, our penetration is lower when you compare to other peers that have been more heavily focused on customer base for a longer period. But I would say, both of the net new logos and customers we've never done business with and customer base behaves very strong this quarter.
Having said all that, as we are saying, we're starting to see a bit more scrutiny, particularly on the larger deal cycles where customers will go a little bit more to another cycle of approval or a better reassurance of the full implementation projects or whatever that most likely will inventing or potentially some of the sales cycles on the larger transformational transactional deals around each financials. Got it. And if I could just sneak in a last one for Barbara. You guys have talked about more conservatism in the back half guidance. And I'm assuming the outperformance that you guys saw in Q2, particularly in like that 24-month backlog, would have normally translated into a raise of the guidance and you didn't raise the guidance. Can you give us some kind of sense of the magnitude of that conservatism in the back half now? Yeah. I'll just say, coming off a quarter as strong as Q2, we would have liked to have been able to raise our outlook for the full year. But while we outperformed and the business remains resilient, we also see evidence of increased scrutiny in certain sales cycle. So our outlook assumes a continuation of this in the second half. Got it. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Hey guys. Since Keith asked both of the exact question I was going to ask, I'll try to basically do it, kind of, go at it a different way. It feels like, Aneel, what you're saying is that there's a lot of surface area that you have left to go after inside of your client base. And based on the TCO analysis, I'm assuming there's also an opportunity for a lot of your customers to consolidate, particularly on the HCM side from many point solutions to a platform, how is that message resonating in your conversations? And how long before that type of a playbook can be run at the financials level? I realize, obviously, you're going in with the full suite right away. But just walk us through those dynamics, if you could? Well, I'll just offer up a high-level view that happy customers are the most important thing that we have, right? I mean, if you have a happy customer, they're just inclined to buy from you. And what we've seen, especially in large enterprises, they typically don't tie the HR and financials decision together. There are separate decisions, and a lot of these solutions like planning are also separate decisions.
So as long as we keep that base happy, when these customers look for new solutions, we do have quite a bit of surface area, especially in the HR base, where we've got over, I think, 4,000 HR customers and 1,400 finance customers so that you can just see where that gap is. But also every time we come out with a new module, that's either something we built or an acquisition, it's an opportunity to go back to that base. One thing I'd add there, Aneel, just to give everybody some perspective on it is we've got 22 SKUs in our HCM portfolio, and we've talked about the fact that 14 of them have been made generally available in the last four years, just to give you some perspective on that. What you can read into that is, you've got a large percentage of SKUs that are not penetrated into that base yet. It's what we've been working on for years, and we do -- just to repeat again what Aneel and Chano said, which is focusing on making our customers happy, delivering the value that we've been talking about delivering to them, makes them want to buy more things from us. And so that's a key part of that strategy. Perfect. And then maybe just as a follow-up. I want to clarify because I want to drill in on this. Aneel, it sounds like what you're saying is July has been really good, but then from what I think Chano and Barbara are saying is that, there is more scrutiny on sales cycles. There's more conservatism in the guide.
But, I guess, is that something you're actually seeing or you are preparing to see and adding a kind of heightened level of conservatism in the assumptions that you're making around close rates in pipeline generation, et cetera? I think Chano is best to answer that one. Yes. Alex, I will reassure June, July has been very strong. But in terms of the sales cycle moving forward, particularly in some of the larger ones around HCM and FINS, we are seeing some more scrutiny or grading in those sales cycles.
As you can imagine, some of those cycles are long. So we definitely have different stages that they move from one to another, we can get some milestones. And it's kind of easy for us to check on the pace that those deals are moving. And as you can see, that some things are clearly and lengthening or potentially lengthening on the sale cycle. Got it. Perfect. Thank you, guys. And the next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please proceed. Hi, everyone. Congrats on a good quarter, and I'll change it up from the macro questions at the moment, leave those for later. I had a question on the announcement during the quarter about your new FedRAMP status, in particular at the moderate security impact level. How should we think about that opportunity in Fed?
I know you guys had some general success in the government angle as a whole throughout the domestic United States, but is that something that can be meaningful over time, or is it really just kind of a maybe a smaller incremental opportunity? Thanks. It can be very meaningful over time, but it's going to take some time for it to develop. Those sales cycles are longer than commercial sales cycles. They always have been. And so, now as we have gotten that FedRAMP certification, now the sales cycles begin and they can be 12, 18, 24 month sales cycles. So -- but it's a meaningful opportunity.
There's a lot of ex-PeopleSoft customers still running PeopleSoft there. So it's one that we invested in, because we see it as a big opportunity, but also going to be patient in that, it takes a while for the pipeline to develop. Pete, do you want add anything? I think, you said it very well. It's a -- we see it as over $2 billion opportunity for the business, but -- and something that we've been investing in for a while. It will take us some time to see that pay off, because of these longer sales cycles. And we're -- I think also the government is -- should be a great customer for us, another customer that we can sell more things into than just core HCM over time. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please, proceed. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, with increased scrutiny around larger deals, I appreciate that. But we're also seeing belt tightening across the broader enterprise. My question here with your focus around cross-sell, what's the narrative around cost savings, vendor consolidation to bundle HCM and FINS.
With some of your larger customers, you're starting to get some high higher-profile Fortune 500 wins there. Love to hear if there's an appetite to further consolidate vendors from a cost savings perspective to bundle HCM and FINS, specifically with some large US customers. Well, that trend is definitely happening, and we saw it happen with a series of big financial wins in the second quarter, but I wouldn't underestimate the strength of our medium enterprise business. And I don't see the same belt tightening in the medium enterprise business, and they tend to buy the whole platform. So it's a pretty healthy market for us. It's kind of our run rate business, and they tend to want to have fewer vendors as possible because they don't want to spend all the money on best-of-breed and integration. Chano, anything you want to add? Very well said, Aneel. I would just say that some of the larger customers, they do retire double-digit number of legacy systems. So what we're trying to do right now, as Aneel was mentioning before, is ensuring that they understand very well the total cost of ownership and the benefits that our solutions will provide and the return on investments. And of course, we're getting in contact with other customers that have already implemented and really seen those become intangible. So that's the playbook we are putting in play. We've gone before some of these downturn cycles. Some of us are unfortunately old, but there is an advantage of that at times. And the whole management team, and we've seen that working before, as Aneel mentioned. So we're playing that playbook. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Great. Thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on a great set of results. I want to follow up on Keith and Alex's line of questioning about happy customers, but also maybe from a little bit of a different angle. As you presumably still have the large renewal cohort flowing through the model that we talked about last year, is the current environment in any way impeding the magnitude of expansion that you would otherwise expect upon renewal? And in fact that factoring into what appears to be a conservative backlog guide for Q3, understandably so, just given the environment. Thanks. Barbara? So for the backlog guide in Q3, our guidance takes into account the best view of the business that we see it today and that's reflected in our 24-month backlog guide for Q3. Keep in mind, the timing of renewals can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have an impact on that backlog growth. And if you recall at the beginning of the year, we did discuss our expectation for the renewal base to return to a more normalized rate of growth for the full year, which continues to be our view. Great. Any color, though, on just the expansion rate that you're seeing upon renewal? Chano? It remains very strong, Brad. I think it is a testament to the mission-critical of our applications and the customer satisfaction and the renewal ratios remain very, very good and very healthy across the board. Excellent. Fantastic to hear. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Please proceed. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the results. Just wanted to follow up on some of the Fortune 500 wins in the quarter. What do you think finally drove those to go over the goal line? And more broadly, what's the timeline you're thinking about for go-lives for those? And the reason I'm asking, just wondering when -- if and when you think there could be more of a halo effect from some of these higher profile wins? Thanks. I'm going to assume you mean on the finance side because on the HR side, we've always had a stream of Fortune 500 wins. And I think at this point, we're over 50% of that -- well over 50% of the Fortune 500 running us for HCM.
On the finance side, I think it's a combination of the systems aging. It's a combination of our product becoming more mature, new products like accounting center that are really strategic customers and Prism Analytics. So, now we've got the full suite, and people have to modernize. They really don't have a choice. But I don't -- I mean I think this is -- it's just a healthy run rate business as opposed to this moment in time where it's going to go through the roof or I don't -- it's not that kind of business.
But the more data points we have of customers choosing us than going live, obviously, the better we are. Coamerica went live this past quarter. That was -- that's a fantastic reference for us. A big regional bank going live is a great data point for us. Most of these projects are 12 months to 18 months. It all depends on the scope of what they're trying to do, and so it's a pretty reasonable timeframe to get these projects live. If it's a smaller scale implementation, just core accounting, it can be done implementation, just core accounting, it can be done of modules, 12 to 15 to 18 months is pretty reasonable. Thanks. We have time for one more question, and our final question will come from David Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed. Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter. Chano, when you talk about scrutiny on deals, we've heard that from a lot of companies now. For Workday, what exactly does that mean? I mean, is it haggling on price? Is it more reference checks? Is it about implementation timelines and processes? Like what's involved there? Any color would be interesting to me. Yes. Thank you for the question, DJ. It can vary, but you can think about it sometimes. It's just more scrutiny around the implementation timeframe and the readiness they have on their side or on the partner side or on our side in terms of resources. It also means many times prioritization on projects and which usually that happens, we typically come on top because we are missing-critical and because again, on the ROI and the TCO, but you are competing against your project.
It also means an additional level of approval or two additional levels of approvals of going up to the Board, depending on the level of approval. So, those are some of the things that it typically means around business case, around management approvals, around prioritization of projects, and around reinsurance in terms of success and implementations and availability of resources and cost of opportunities, impact on potentially other investments or opportunities they are managing or considering. Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Thank you for the question DJ. I will turn the call back over to management for closing comments. Everybody, have a good night. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's second quarter full year 2023 earnings call. Thank you again for joining us today and have a great day.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer . this call is being simultaneously webcast .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to one.
With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year financial results earnings call. I'm pleased to share that we delivered solid Q4 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which include a subscription revenue growth of 22% for the quarter and for full year fiscal year 2023.
While the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, Workday's value proposition is only getting stronger as more organizations turn to us to help them adapt and manage their two most important resources, their people and their finances. As a result, our thriving customer community continues to grow and feel our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond.
In fact, we achieved a significant milestone in Q4, as we surpassed the 10,000 customer mark with more than 4,750 of those being our core HCM and finance customers, a true testament to the power of the Workday platform and our ability to address the needs for the offices of the CHRO and CFO.
Additionally, approximately 629 billion transactions were processed with Workday in fiscal year 2023, an increase of 42% year-over-year and further proof of the scale that we had reached.
Before we share some Q4 highlights, I want to touch on several recent leadership moves and one organizational announcement that we made, all of which will help set us up for our next phase of growth.
The first is the appointment of Carl Eschenbach as Co-CEO, which we announced in December. Carl has been a Workday Board member since 2018, and for the past 35 years, has been one of the finest sales and operational leaders in enterprise technology. With his experience and commitment to our values and culture, Carl is a perfect fit to help Workday scale and lead us forward.
At the end of our fiscal year 2024, Carl is expected to assume sole CEO responsibilities, while I will stay involved with our product and technology teams and all of our employees as a full-time Executive Chair and Chair of the Board.
Carl's transition into the Co-CEO role has been seamless and I'm excited to work alongside him going forward as we continue to grow Workday and strengthen our position as the leader in cloud HR while building on our momentum in finance.
I also want to acknowledge the great work Chano Fernandez did during his nine years with Workday and for the last two years as Co-CEO. He played a significant role in helping to shape the company into who we are today, and I want to thank him for his contributions.
Additionally, Sayan Chakraborty, our EVP of Product and Technology, has been elevated to Co-President alongside Doug Robinson. Since joining Workday more than seven years ago, Sayan has been a driving force behind our evolving and expanding innovation strategy, led our efforts to scale the Workday platform to support and enable some of the world's largest organizations, and is one of the foremost experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning as it relates to the world of enterprise offerings. Sayan will continue to lead our product and technology organization, and we are pleased to recognize his leadership role across the organization now as Co-President.
With Sayan stepping into a Co-President role, Robynne Sisco, who was previously Co-President and before that CFO, will now assume the role of Vice Chair. In this role, Robynne will work closely with our global sales team to help us build on our momentum with the office of the CFO and further cement Workday as a leader in cloud finance.
The last leadership update is related to our Board of Directors. I'm pleased to share that we announced today that Mark Hawkins has been elected as the newest member of our Board. With more than 35 years of finance leadership experience at global software and technology companies, most recently at Salesforce, Mark will bring invaluable experience and perspective to Workday.
Final announcement I want to highlight, which we made at the end of January, was a restructuring and realignment of some teams across Workday that led to the elimination of roles impacting about 3% of our global workforce. While it's always difficult to see employees leave under those circumstances, we made this decision to align our resources and people against the most strategic areas of the business to help ensure that Workday is set up for continued growth for many years to come.
Throughout this process, we did our absolute best to treat the affected employees with compassion and offer them generous severance packages. This restructuring move was not a cost-cutting effort, and we will continue to hire in fiscal year 2024 for roles that support our strategic initiatives.
With that, I'd like to share some product and technology highlights from the quarter. From an innovation perspective, our continued focus on uniquely embedding AI and ML into the core of our platform is enabling us to drive the future of work for HR and finance customers and there are more than 60 million employees around the world.
On the HR front, the combination of our Workday Skills Cloud, which is powered by AI and ML and Workday Talent Optimization is supporting customers in their transition to a skills-first mindset.
To date, nearly 50% of all live Workday HCM customers are leveraging Workday Skills Cloud, while Talent Optimization is Workday's fastest-growing SKU with an attach rate on new deals of more than 85% in fiscal year 2023.
For Planning, we introduced new demand forecasting capabilities that leverage AI and ML to help retailers forecast business demand based on external data, such as sales and foot traffic history. Retail continues to be one of our target industries as more than 50% of the retail organizations in the Fortune 500 are Workday customers. And innovations like this will enable us to build on our momentum in this space.
We're also continuing to double down on AI and ML through our Workday Ventures Fund. We announced a $250 million expansion of the fund to focus on larger growth areas such as generative AI, all with an eye to embracing emerging technologies to help us further enable our customers in today's changing world of work.
Finally, I want to touch on how we're continuing to invest in our brand. Hopefully, you all saw our fun rock star-themed advertisement during the Super Bowl, which reached an estimated 110 million viewers. While finance and HR leaders are familiar with us, we saw the Super Bowl as the stage to help us become more well known to a broader audience. We firmly believe that our brand is strategic and investments in marketing drive awareness and demand for our products and services.
Going forward, we feel very confident in our ability to capitalize on the long-term growth opportunity in front of us, thanks to the strategy we have in place, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the amazing talents of our more than 17,700 Workmates around the globe. In fact, we are hosting today's call from our annual sales kickoff meeting and the excitement from all of our go-to-market teams here in Las Vegas about the incredible opportunity we have in front of us is palpable.
With that, I'll hand it over to our Co-CEO, my buddy, Carl Eschenbach. Carl, over to you. Thank you, Aneel, for those kind words, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me start by saying that I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to partner and work alongside Aneel and our Workmates across this amazing company. I'm truly energized by Workday's unique opportunity to be one of the largest and most profitable software companies in the world. This was my first quarterly call as co-CEO and I could not be more proud of our teams for their incredible execution.
Despite a macro environment that remains uncertain and that no one is immune from, we drove strong close rates in Q4 and built a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. Our team was prepared to respond to the extra scrutiny we knew would come with deals in this environment. And because of that, we are heading into our new fiscal year in a position of strength. I can tell you the excitement for the year is all around us as we are coming to you live from our annual sales kickoff conference in Las Vegas.
As a Board member for the last five years, I have been actively involved in Workday's growth journey. Today, more than two months in as Co-CEO, I have had the privilege of spending time with hundreds of Workmates, customers, partners and prospects around the world. Those meetings have given me an even greater appreciation of how compelling Workday's value proposition is and how differentiated we really are.
I have also gotten to know Aneel and the leadership team even better. And while I already considered Aneel, a partner and a friend, our co-CEO relationship is working really well as we have very complementary skill sets. It's a true one plus one equals three equation.
As I reflect upon my first couple of months, a few things in particular have stood out, starting with the culture and values of Workday. This, frankly, was the most important driver for me taking this role. I have long admired the culture that Dave and Aneel built and see as a true differentiator. We have six core values at Workday, and each of them are important. But to me, the one that I keep coming back to is integrity.
If you do the right thing, everything else falls into place. I have been blown away by the talent that sits across this company and by how ingrained our values are in everything we do. Another observation is around our land opportunity. With net new customers, I will tell you it's wide open. We have a footprint with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and more than 25% of the Global 2000, but we still see plenty of room to grow. Q4 was a great validation of this, with seven new Fortune 500 and 11 new Global 2000 customers.
New HCM customers we added in the quarter included Allstate, Camping World, Cracker Barrel, Delaware North Companies, Mercedes-Benz Group and Whataburger. And key go-live included Heidelberg Materials and Mitsui Chemicals. In addition, we once again added several full platform HCM and financial customers, including Fidelity National Title, Panda Restaurant Group, and the State of Georgia. And we had several FINS go live, including The New York Times and Sanford Health.
One of the exciting things about our land opportunity is that it's not limited to replacing outdated on-premises systems. In fact, three of our new Fortune 500 wins replaced cloud solutions from our legacy ERP competitors. And the land opportunity extends well beyond the upmarket as the medium enterprise has become an increasingly important driver of net new ACV and that team drove record performance in the quarter.
What's also important is the strength of our customer relationships and the strategic nature of what we do for them. This provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand our business with our installed base of customers who rely on Workday as their intelligent digital backbone to adapt and manage their people and money. This quarter, we once again drove very strong renewals along with solid new ACV bookings, including expansions at Belk, GE, Old Dominion Freight, Prudential and Truist. We saw momentum across our solutions portfolio, including Learning, Planning, Prism Analytics, Accounting Center and Candidate Engagement. And an increasing number of our expansion deals added core financials as we lean into our market leadership in HCM to drive increasing momentum with the office of the CFO.
Our opportunity is truly global. The US, which continues to be our largest market, had a solid Q4 and has a healthy runway going forward. We also have a tremendous international opportunity, which is only about a quarter of our revenue, but more than half of our TAM.
Our momentum is building in strategic markets like DACH and Nordics, where we had a number of important wins during Q4, including CCB Management Services, Mila and NorgesGruppen. Accelerating our international business is a strategic priority and we are investing in both talent and products to help drive that.
Our continued industry focus is gaining momentum, and it is a core part of our ongoing strategy. We had wins in a number of key verticals in Q4, including state and local government where in addition to the win at the State of Georgia, we had wins at the City of Boston, the City of Charlotte and New York City Housing Authority to name a few. In fact, new ACV from our state and local teams more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, and we expect our traction to continue in FY 2024.
Finally, our partner ecosystem will be critical to our next phase of growth. Our partners from the global system integrators to the boutiques have been incredibly important to get us to where we are today. They drive the vast majority of our customer deployments and serve as an important source of co-innovation. One of the ways they do this is through Workday Extend, which now has over 1,000 applications in production across our customer community. We expect our partners will play an even more important role in FY 2024 as we look for them to drive an increased number of new opportunities, while we strategically shift more customer deployments to our ecosystem.
We see this as a clear win-win. We are also focusing our efforts across our broader ecosystem of ISVs and technology partners. A great example is our recent partnership with AWS, which extends our infrastructure relationship to a more formal go-to-market motion. I am excited to work alongside our Chief Customer Officer, Sheri Rhodes, and our newly appointed SVP of Global Partners, Matt Brandt, and our entire ecosystem on this journey.
Heading into FY 2024, we have a clear strategy in place, which is rooted in strengthening our HCM market leadership and winning in FINS across our key industries. We are optimizing the business to double down in strategic growth areas such as investing in our customer base, focusing on key industries, evolving and investing in our partner ecosystem and relentlessly focusing on innovation, including shaping the future of work to our application of AI and machine learning.
Having the right strategy is only part of the equation, you also need the right people, which is why we plan to continue to add sales capacity in key engineering talent as we position Workday for the next wave of growth. We also made some recent changes to strengthen our leadership bench that will be critical to helping us execute on our strategy. Doug Robinson will continue in his role as Co-President and now has full responsibility for all go-to-market functions.
As Aneel mentioned, Sayan Chakraborty has also been elevated to Co-President, and I'm also excited to have Robynne Sisco serve as our Vice Chair, now squarely focused on helping us sell FINS. Patrick Blair, who joined a year ago to run North America sales, has been elevated to Head of Global Sales. His team across the regions is a talented mix of seasoned Workday veterans and proven recently added external talent, who will rally around our global opportunity.
It's an amazing time to be at Workday, and I'm so inspired and energized by the incredible journey ahead. While we continue to see certain sales cycles, primarily net new opportunities taking longer than normal to close, our FY 2024 subscription revenue guidance prudently factors this in. And we are positioning the business to return to 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves, while simultaneously delivering margin expansion. I look forward to meeting many of you on the road in the quarter ahead, and thank you for your support.
With that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you. Thanks, Carl, and welcome. I know I speak for the broader Workday organization when I say that I'm incredibly excited to partner with you on the next phase of our growth journey. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a solid close to the year, driven by strong execution across the company, combined with durable demand for our solutions as organizations of all sizes, prioritize finance and HR modernization during these uncertain times.
Subscription revenue in Q4 was $1.50 billion, up 22% year-over-year. For the full year, subscription revenue was $5.57 billion, also a growth of 22%. Professional services revenue was $151 million for Q4 and $649 million for the full year. Total revenue outside of the US was $396 million in Q4, representing 24% of total revenue.
24-month subscription revenue backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $9.68 billion, up 21%. The result was driven by solid new ACV bookings and strong renewals, with growth in net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. In addition, early renewals added roughly 1 percentage point of upside to 24-month backlog growth and roughly 2 percentage points to total backlog growth. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q4 was $16.45 billion, up 28%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $305 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue upside and continued cost discipline. The workforce realignment we announced at the end of January was a $34 million non-GAAP expense in the quarter, or a roughly 2 percentage point headwind to Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, most of which was factored into our guidance. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was $1.21 billion, representing a margin of 19.5%.
Q4 operating cash flow was $694 million, growth of 13%. As a reminder, the Q4 result was impacted by a roughly $70 million one-time IP transfer tax payment. Full year operating cash flow was $1.66 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $75 million in shares and have $425 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program. We ended the fourth quarter with more than 17,700 global workmates.
As Anil and Karl mentioned, we will continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology, but we are planning for fewer headcount additions in FY 2024 as compared to FY 2023. Overall, we're very proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q4, and we enter FY 2024 in a position of strength.
Now, turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business, while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. In addition, we recently completed an assessment of our server and network equipment.
And beginning in FY 2024, we are increasing the useful life assumption from three years to five years, reflecting advances in technology that we're benefiting from. This change will have a positive impact on our FY 2024 non-GAAP operating margin, which I will cover shortly.
Following a solid Q4, we are maintaining the midpoint of our preliminary FY 2024 subscription revenue guidance and narrowing the range to $6.525 billion to $6.575 billion, representing 17% to 18% year-over-year growth. We view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment. But as Carl mentioned, we're positioning to return to a 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves.
We expect Q1 FY 2024 subscription revenue to be $1.517 billion to $1.520 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 6% in Q2 and approximately 4% in Q3. We expect FY 2024 professional services revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $650 million.
As Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of ongoing investments we are making in the channel. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $148 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q1.
We currently expect FY 2024 non-GAAP operating margin of 23%. The expected margin expansion is primarily being driven by the scalability of our model, a moderation of hiring, and ongoing expense discipline.
In addition, we estimate the change in server and network equipment useful life will result in a roughly $100 million reduction to the GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY 2024, creating a benefit to operating margin of about 150 basis points this year.
Looking forward, the impact from this policy change is expected to trend down and result in an approximately $50 million reduction to GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY 2025.
We estimate Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 21.5% and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process.
GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26 and 22 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margins. The FY 2024 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.
We expect FY 2024 operating cash flow of approximately $2.05 billion, growth of 24%. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter cash flow will be impacted by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus plans, severance costs associated with the recent realignment and an interest payment that did not occur last Q1 due to the timing of our debt offering. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $340 million in FY 2024 to support our continued business expansion.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Thanks very much. And congrats on a strong finish to the year. Carl, since you have a relatively fresh pair of eyes looking at the business, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the close in 4Q and the pipeline that leads you to believe that getting back to 20% growth is achievable once we get into a more sort of normalized operating environment. Just some specifics around that or what you're seeing maybe be helpful on that front. And then I have a quick follow-up for Barbara. Sure. Well, first of all, thank you, Kirk, for the question. Let me start by just saying I want to thank all of our Workmates around the world for delivering a strong close to the year and setting us up for a strong FY 20.
As you know, Kirk, announcing a CEO transition in the middle of Q4, your biggest quarter, is probably not always optimal. And we talked about our priorities at that time was to finish the year strong, and we did just that.
As far as what we're seeing in the environment to think about getting back to a 20% growth, we see plenty of opportunity to continue to invest in the business, both on the go-to-market side with additional sales capacity in quota-carrying reps as well as continued investment in product and technology.
A couple of key insights early on, now, I guess, over 60 days into the role, is we see continued opportunity in our international business, both in EMEA and in APJ. Today, we have only 25% of our business coming from our international operation, yet it represents greater than 50% of our TAM. So we see a really big opportunity there. And what we did is we brought in strong leadership both in EMEA and APJ. And Doug and Patrick have actually brought in additional strength even under our top leaders in those respective markets.
We also think we're going to double down even further on our FINS opportunity, both to sell back into our customer base as well into net new. We see this as a rich opportunity. We did a nice job in Q4 selling back into our HCM base with our FINS solution, and we think that's something we can do a lot more of.
And then the last thing, although there's plenty more, Kirk, I'd highlight is we're going to continue to leverage our ecosystem. Our partners around the world are doing a great job, implementing our technology and driving deployment. But we're also going to work with them to build business plans so they can help us drive net new business, not just do implementations, but help us drive new business into the base as well as net new customers overall.
And then last thing on the ecosystem, we were excited to be able to announce today a partnership with AWS that allows us, for the first time, to sell our technology platform through their marketplace, allowing their customers to leverage the spend they have with AWS on Workday solutions. So that's an aggregate of why we think over time, depending on when the macro turns more favorable, we'll be able to get back to 20% growth on the subscription side. That's super. And just a real quick one for Barbara. Barbara, just in terms of margins -- thanks for the commentary on 1Q and 2Q, just we're thinking about it correctly. I assume because risings in 3Q, we should see the rest of sort of the margin expansion in 4Q, maybe more seasonally flat or sequentially flat between 2Q and 3Q? Yes, that sounds about right. Okay. That’s great. Thanks, all. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thank you so much. Congratulations, Aneel, Carl and Barbara. Carl, the question is targeted for you since I get only one or maybe 1.5. One is, as you speak with customers, what are the key themes that are emerging from your conversations with respect to how they're prioritizing investments in software, in particular, Workday, given inflation worries, rate worries, et cetera? And also everybody is conscious of the risk of a recession. I think our models are all increasingly building that. But since you've been through multiple cycles before in your very long career, as Aneel mentioned, what are the signs you're looking for in terms of a recovery, although it might be a little foolhardy to entertain the hopes of a recovery? But what are the things that could that you could be looking at that could increase your conviction that we go from high teens to 20-plus percent when environment gets better? Thank you so much. Yes. Thanks. I'll start off, and then I'll turn it over to our Co-President, Doug, who's joining us on the call here today. So first, Kash, I'd say, companies continue to prioritize both HCM and in their financials in driving a digital transformation. Everyone is looking to get more value out of both their people and their financial systems, and I think we're at the core of that.
So while it is true, customers are reprioritizing where they're going to make their investments. I think we move to the top of that list because we do drive true digital transformation, which is a term we've all talked about for probably the last five or 10 years, but it's in the midst of happening right now. And we're seeing early signs of us being a beneficiary of that transformation, including the seven Fortune 500 wins we had last quarter, we had 11 global wins in the Global 2000. And by the way, a number of those weren't just replacing legacy on-premise solutions, three of the Fortune 500 wins came with us, replacing our legacy competitors' cloud solutions. So that's another really good sign.
And then two other things is while it's true, people are moving to the cloud and they're doing it faster than ever, we have the opportunity to be at the forefront of that. When people move to the cloud, whether it's HCM or FINS, Kash, we are going to get a look. And when we get a look, when we look at our win rates just last quarter, they're improving, and we're not seeing any additional discount to actually win those opportunities.
So we think we're well positioned for the digital transformation that's happening. And it's interesting because with scarcity, all of a sudden, customers get clarity. And it's clear that we're in the middle of the opportunity here, unlike we've seen before to help them drive their digital transformation to focus on both their people and their financial systems. Yeah. Hi Kash, Doug here. Thanks for the question. There's a couple of things I'd highlight for you. The first and -- the question went to what are you hearing from customers and executives. The first is tight labor markets continue. And so you see CEOs increasingly turn back to how do I reskill, retain and get the company positioned for the jobs of tomorrow. And so it shows up, and it's showing up, I think, in those seven Fortune 500 wins, some familiar themes there, those 11 Global 2000.
And then really on the -- really driving the FINS side of it, there's talk at the CEO level about reinventing the entire business model. And, of course, Workday doesn't reinvent business models, but we give you an agile, enabling technology for you to be able to make those changes to your business over time.
And the last thing I'd say as it relates to your question about what signs do we look for when we're starting to come out of it. To me, it's sales cycle duration on the net new. And we track that, as you might guess, by industry, by size of company, by geography. And when we see that start to come down, I think we'll be in a position to go up and over 20%. And what we're seeing right now is solid pipeline build. So we're pleased with the pipeline build, but we're still dealing with some of those elongated cycles in the net new space. Yeah. One other thing to add there, Doug, is we see customers during times of tailwind, typically want to buy best-of-breed solutions. When there's headwinds, they buy best of suite. And today, we have the best platform for both FINS and core HCM. So we see more and more customers, to your point, of consolidating on our platform than we've ever seen before as they look to drive efficiencies in their own infrastructure. Thank you, Carl and Doug. Congratulations. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Thank you very much. So Carl, Workday's revenue growth really is not flowing very much. If we just look around and compare it to the rest of the software industry, there's so many companies suffering through this period where their growth has slowed by 10 or 15 or 20 points or more. Is Workday's resilience more driven by the ability to help companies navigate through this complex type of a labor market, or do you think it's more of a function of the diversification across verticals where I think you have a little less reliance on the tech industry, or is there some other factor that's kind of coming to the forefront for you? And I have a quick follow-up. Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Aneel to make some additional comments. So first, I think the diversity of our business is what allows us to be so differentiated from the rest of the companies out there in our peer group.
What I mean by that is we have a large installed base that we get to sell back into with high renewal rates. We're landing net new customers. We're selling across all industries and all verticals. So the diversity of our business is radically different than most people out there.
And also, I think -- the other thing is our business is quite predictable. When you have a renewal rate like we have on a quarterly basis, we can really dial in what we think we're going to deliver to all of you in the Street and hit that with consistency. So we are diverse in our business. We have durability in our business model with good operating margin and good solid growth and good cash flows. And I just think as compared to the rest of the industry, we can weather any potential headwinds we're seeing going forward, which is reflected in our FY 2024 guidance.
And Aneel, maybe you'd like to add some color around this question as well. Yes. I think the other part is, our applications are just -- they're just proven out to be mission-critical. And some of the apps that did well during the last few years when you have a downturn, they're just not -- they're not viewed as mission-critical. But a lot of companies are doubling down on becoming more efficient during a downturn, and I think we're a beneficiary of that, and it supports our business. And it's all based on those very sticky systems of record. Excellent. And just a quick follow-up for Barbara. Is the trend of seeing some of these very sizable planning deals in the pipeline, which I think you might have mentioned a quarter or two ago, seeming to continue here as you look forward into FY 2024. Do you want to take that one? It's about the plans in the pipeline. Yes, I'll take it. Yes. Planning was -- we had a really strong planning performance in Q4, and we do see more of it coming. In fact, there's -- two of the areas and changes we're making for this fiscal year is increasing sales capacity in two ways: one, with dedicated sellers to help convert the planning customers or those planning first customers into core financials, Accounting Center, Prism Analytics, some of the other solutions that are a nice follow-on to the office of the CFO.
And then the second is dedicated land sellers for the planning business for Adaptive. We're increasing sales capacity there. And that's not just a US phenomenon that we actually see that opportunity internationally as well, as Carl highlighted earlier. Thank you, very much. Our next question comes from DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thanks very much for taking the question. Curious if you're seeing any additional signs of large projects being put on hold. I think last quarter, we talked about some services revenue disruption, understand kind of the ecosystem handoff is influencing the numbers a bit in the guide. But curious if that was kind of a one-off event or something that's starting to show up a little bit more broadly with implementation cycles? Doug, why don't you take that one? Yes. They're not seeing -- if I understood your question correctly, wholesale stoppages of projects. It's more about round trips of approvals. And I do think companies are looking for -- CEOs are looking for productivity gains and operating margin leverage. And so, every investment is getting extra scrutiny.
And I think one of the things I'm really, frankly, quite proud of in this quarter and in this year is that, I think our sales team did a great job of anticipating that and really building solid business cases in conjunction with our customers to get those projects over the line. But no question, these cycles happen, take a longer bit of time to close on the pure net new large transformational projects. Yes. The only thing I'd like to add is just, thank Doug and Patrick and our teams around the world, we knew these deals would get extra scrutiny, and we were prepared for it. The level of deal inspection we had throughout Q4 was taken up a couple of notches -- and we saw the outcome of that in, if you will, the close rates in Q4, and we anticipate that going forward. Got it, got it. And then, Doug, maybe a more strategic question for you. Just as you talk with customers about evolving to become kind of a skills-based organization, right, adopting ML and AI strategies, like how much change management has to accompany the technology adoption, right? And I guess I'm curious, like, how deep we bought into this playbook or your partners? Is this something they're leading to or leading with in their go-to-market conversations? I think that's a great question, and the answer is a lot. And there is work to be done, more around strategy upfront, to really take advantage of the skills cloud, in and of itself, as an enabling technology. And so, you've heard us talk about how important partners are to our growth this year and beyond, we are partnering with some of the large global GSIs that you know all too well, who are really bringing that skill set, their IP around that change management and how to look at skills and through the lens of skills and anticipating skills needed five years from now or 10 years from now, as opposed to just job profile-based analysis of where to build out your teams. So yes, it goes hand-in-hand and both are needed to give a complete solution to the customer. Anything you guys want to add, Aneel? I'd say it's a one to two-year process. It's not a simple journey. But coming out the other end, it just enables you to do business the way everybody is looking forward to doing business in the skills-based world.
And I'd point to one of our biggest HCM customers, it's one of our biggest partners, Accenture, they have done this for their own organization, and so they're going around and using that learning to help our customers do it as well. But it's a big investment and I think the payoff -- but the payoff is huge. Yes, makes sense. Thank you, guys for the color. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Hey great. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question and nice job in closing out the year. Barbara, given the change in accounting, you mentioned the useful life policy brings the operating margin expectation up to 23% for the coming year. Does that impact how you're thinking about the longer term 25% margin target, $10 billion in scale, as we kind of trend line towards those, or anything you can add around just views and opportunities near-term for margin leverage versus longer term is helpful? Thank you. Yes, thanks so much for your question. So, there's no change to that 25% operating margin target at $10 billion. We haven't updated our medium term framework for that at this time. When we provided that outlook, we weren't factoring in this change in useful life assumptions. And while it has a near-term positive impact on our margins, the impact will reduce over time.
So, the focus remains on driving profitable long-term growth, and that's exactly what we described at our Analyst Day. And we definitely see opportunity to drive non-GAAP operating margin beyond 25% over the longer term. That’s all the questions from Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. A couple of kind of cleanup questions for Barbara. You mentioned 1 percentage point benefit to the 24-month backlog from early renewals. Can you talk to -- is that unusual? Because one of your peers talked about missing their guidance because they didn't get the early renewal. So, to what extent were those early renewals already kind of in your expectations, or to what extent were they unusual?
And then two, on the other side of that, how should we think about sort of the tightening of the range on the guidance from the 2017 to 2019 to the 2017 to 2018 after the outperformance that you saw in Q4? Is it adding more conservatism to the forecast, or was there some push and pulls of like the early renewals that we should be thinking about? Like is it a more conservative guide or are there other factors that we should be considering? So, let me go ahead and take that first question on early renewals. So, we had healthy customer base activity in Q4 as customers added new SKUs to their Workday footprint. And as part of that, many of the customers renewed early. And so we do see renewals move around from time-to-time, but just with the strength of customer base, we saw a larger impact this quarter and wanted to make sure we called that out.
On your second question around what's going into our guidance for subscription revenue next year. Really after a solid Q4, we have more visibility into our FY 2024 subscription revenue, allowing us to maintain the midpoint of $6.55 billion and narrow that $100 million range down to $50 million that we shared last quarter. So still very early in the year, and the guidance prudently accounts for the fact that the environment remains uncertain and consistent with what we've described over the last couple of quarters. Got it. That makes a ton of sense. And maybe one big picture question for Carl. A question I've been getting a lot from investors is, what changes should we expect from Carl or what big impacts can Carl have on Workday and the company on a go-forward basis? And I have my answers, obviously. But I'd love to hear from the horse's mouth, but I'd love to hear from you. When you look at this opportunity to take on the Co-CEO role, what are the big changes or sort of big improvements that you think you can make to Workday over the next year or three years or whatnot? Yes, sure. So a couple of things. So as you know, I had a front row seat to the last five years as a Board member, and I had a good understanding of Workday, the business model and the opportunity. And what I would say is now being on Board almost a full quarter, right, the opportunity is probably even bigger than I anticipated.
That being said, the company is doing a lot of things right. Just look at our results for the full year last year, our results for Q4. So with the executive team and our Workmates have done is pretty special.
That being said, there are opportunities for us to get back to that 20% growth going forward. I've mentioned a couple of them earlier. So first and foremost, I think one of the things we're doing around consolidating all go-to-market under Doug Robinson, who's been here for 11-plus years, was a good move. He now is responsible for everything from a go-to-market perspective, including sales, presales, partners, our industries and revenue operations were before that was broken up. So I am focused on driving operational efficiency across the company and across organizations. And we're starting to see that play out already.
The second thing I mentioned earlier is I just think we have a tremendous opportunity to grow the business internationally. Our performance internationally is I don't think where it should be, but we're going to really focus on it. We have new leadership in place, and we're going to drive a different level of execution both in EMEA and across APJ. And I think that's also important.
The last thing, as both Aneel highlighted and Barbara and myself, we are looking for ways to optimize our workforce. And one of the things we're doing here in Q1 is we're doubling down our efforts on product and technology. So we continue to focus on innovation. And we're also investing heavily in go-to-market, specifically around quota-carrying capacity. And it is our belief and my personal belief that those who can invest in innovation and technology and go-to-market when markets are potentially challenging like we're faced today will be the fastest to emerge on the other side and reaccelerate growth.
So I think there are just a couple of areas of focus for us, along with a number of other things, including the ecosystem what we spoke about and Doug mentioned earlier. So there are some of the things in the near term you can expect from us and I think they'll drive long-term durable growth that gets us back to that 20%. Outstanding. Thank you for the concept. If I can just add a couple of other things. Carl is definitely an innovator on the go-to-market side. And so we're all learning some new approaches on what we can do differently. And I'd frankly say, including myself, just raise the sense of urgency and energy level of the entire management team. And I think it's great, and I couldn't be happier that he's here. He's telling us all to have more giddyup. Outstanding. And we will now take two more questions. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Okay. Great. I've got two for Barbara. Barbara, the relationship between CRPO today and subscription revenue growth tomorrow is not perfect, but it's actually pretty good. Despite all the macro, your CRPO is hanging in there like a champ at like 20s or low 20s. But your guidance on the sub-rev growth implies a decel from 22% this most recent quarter, down to like 16%, 17% in the second half.
And I'm just curious, why would that be? At first blush, it makes your guidance for sub-revs growth looks somewhat conservative, but maybe I'm missing something in the relationship that might explain that maybe go-lives are getting extended but are still within the 24 months. Is there anything that you would flag? No, I mean I would just reiterate what you said at the beginning, which keep in mind that backlog isn't a perfect proxy for future subscription revenue growth due to many factors, including the timing of renewals. As we called out, early renewals had roughly 1 percentage point of upside to our 24-month Q4 backlog, though it does not impact the underlying subscription revenue growth. And the FY 2024 subscription revenue guidance is our best view at the time, and we think it prudently factors in a macro environment, which remains uncertain. Okay. That's helpful, Barbara. And then if -- I don't think anyone's asked on your cash flow guide, if I could, I think a quick calculation suggests that you're guiding to operating margin improvement or percentage increase year-over-year of about 30% but your operating cash flow guidance implies more like a modest -- more modest 25% growth. Is there anything going on in your operating cash flow guide? Any sort of one-time factors to highlight that might create a somewhat bigger spread between it and the operating margin expansion? Thanks a lot. Yes, you’re welcome. So the cash flow guidance does reflect the strong margin expansion that we are expecting in FY 2024. But when you're looking at it from a year-over-year standpoint, both Q1 and FY 2024 cash flows impacted by the first full year payout of our company-wide performance-based cash bonus, the severance costs associated with the recent realignment and then an interest payment that didn't occur last Q1 due to the timing of our debt offering. And then also keep in mind that the change in server and network equipment useful life has an impact on margin, but it does not impact cash flow. Yes. All that makes sense. Thanks a lot, Barbara. All right. Thank you. And our last question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess maybe one for Carl and Aneel, and then just a follow-up on the cash flow question. If you kind of stand back and you think about where we are right now from the macro environment, the demand environment, it does seem like things aren't getting progressively worse. They seem to have stabilized, at least based on commentary from some other companies. As you look at the current configuration, do you feel like we've rebased in terms of a net new sales cycle, a net new digestion phase or period? And what -- is this the trough basically is a question we get a lot. Do you have any signals or data points that give you a view one way or the other on that? I personally still think it's a very uncertain environment. It doesn't feel like the economy is falling off a cliff anymore. I don't think it ever really did feel like it was falling off a cliff. But there's conflicting signs as to whether the Fed is going to continue to slow down the economy and get inflation under control, and that continues to be a challenge. So I think it's still pretty much the same it's been for the last couple of quarters. I don't see it -- I definitely don't see it getting better anytime soon, but maybe not getting worse. So yeah, maybe we're in a stable. I don't know, what you think, Carl? Yeah, I agree with you. Actually, the commentary I always respond with people ask this question, I say there's -- it's consistently inconsistent depending on who you talk to out there. But what we do know is companies are continuing to invest in technology. And if you have a strong value proposition like we have around HCM and FINS, we should be able to navigate the choppy waters that we're faced with going forward. And I think that was reflected in both Q4 and our FY 2024 guide. So we're staying the course. We're prudent in our guidance. And we have a lot of confidence that our team will execute regardless of what we face in the future. So it's uncertain, but we're prepared for it as well. And then maybe just one on the ecosystem, specifically the GSI community. It does feel like they're getting a little bit even reinvigorated to some extent from some of the moves and changes that you're making around driving -- helping them continue to be also a driver of growth or enabling them to be a driver of growth for your business. What are the key dynamics we should be tuning to that could make that really a bit of a different growth driver this year or in the coming years than it's been in the past? Yeah, Doug, why don't you take that, and then I'll add any color. Yeah, it's a great question. A couple of things to think about or that you should be looking for. Where it really comes to life is when we can take -- I mentioned this before in another question, the IP from our partners and couple it with what we deliver and then give something more profound to our mutual customer, and so we loosely put that under umbrella called Industry Accelerators. And I think that's where you're going to see it show up with our partners, much more openness to drive industry specific solutions with their expertise partnered with our technology. And so that drives things like Prism and Extend, which we haven't talked about much on this earnings call, but really taking Workday and extending it beyond core capabilities. I think it's really well said, Doug, and that's specific to the GSIs, but we're also looking for alternate routes to market like the announcement we just made with AWS to be on our marketplace, which is a new distribution channel for us here at Workday. So we're looking at driving operating leverage on the go-to-market, both through GSIs and additional ecosystem partners going forward, which is really important, we haven't done that in the past. Perfect. Congrats guys. Thanks again. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude Workday's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President . this call is being simultaneously webcast .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to one.
With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.

Our second quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on July 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call.
I'm pleased to share that Workday reported strong Q1 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which include a subscription revenue growth of 20% for the quarter. While the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, we remain positive about our future growth prospects for a couple of reasons.
First, we got the year off to a strong start and have built a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which gives us better visibility into the rest of fiscal '24. And second, we're seeing the value proposition of the full Workday platform combined with our unique approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning, continue to gain momentum as more and more organizations across geographies and industries put their trust in us to help them drive the future of work.
When it comes to AI and ML, we think about implementing differently than any other enterprise software company in the world. And we've been at it for nearly a decade, while many of our competitors are scrambling to catch up. We approach AI and ML with a heavy emphasis on being human-centric, using these capabilities to augment people in organizations to make them more productive, better informed to make decisions, and to help them reduce business risk.
Several things set us apart. One, AI and ML are embedded into the very core of our platform, allowing us to rapidly deliver and sustain new ML infused capabilities into our products to drive more business value for our customers. Two, we have the quantity and quality of data that further differentiates us, meaning that we not only have access to an enormous amount of data due to the more than 60 million users representing more than 600 billion transactions over the last year. But we also have a unified data model that allows us to build and train models in a way our competitors simply cannot replicate. And three, we firmly believe that to deliver on the possibilities it offers AI and ML must be leveraged in a trustworthy, unethical way. Workday has always been a trusted partner to help companies keep their most critical assets, their people and money, safe, secure and private. This approach becomes even more essential when leveraging AI and ML.
As you know generative AI is driving the AI and ML discussion right now. Despite the recent hype around large language models, Workday has been delivering AI and ML including LLMs for several years. We believe we need to look past the hype cycle and identify the real ways our customers can extract business value from LLMs.
Today we're using generative AI tools behind the scenes to help power products like Workday search and skills cloud, while exploring a variety of generative AI use cases for our customers. For example, we're looking at many content generation use cases within our Workday talent management, recruiting, financial management, and core HCM applications.
Additionally, for years, we have taken a leading role in AI focused policy discussions at the federal state and local level in the U.S., while partnering with the European Union and other governments around the world to provide thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI. Simply put, we believe AI technology should be regulated. This is an area that you will continue to hear more from us in future quarters, and I look forward to sharing updates about how Workday is helping to drive AI policy globally.
Moving to our core set of applications, we continued our investment in Workday Peakon Employee Voice by recently unveiling semantic search capabilities, which leverages AI to analyze millions of employee comments and present the most meaningful insights.
While manual keyword searches take hours or days, semantic search can analyze employee comments in seconds to quickly provide leaders with the insights they need to address emerging workplace trends. Employee engagement is one of the biggest hot buttons for CEOs today, and we're continuing to see more organizations turn to Peakon to help them stay on top of and address employee sentiment. In fact, Peakon hit a significant milestone in Q1 as it surpassed more than 500 million total survey responses, and 70 million written comments, providing us with one of the world's largest standardized datasets on employee sentiment.
For the office of the CFO, we recently unveiled predictive forecaster, a capability within Workday adaptive planning, that creates ML-based forecasts with the ability to add additional regressors and datasets. The feature which is in limited availability today, supports our next evolution of Workday adaptive planning to produce increasingly predictive plans and enhance insights to help organizations more effectively navigate today's business landscape.
Another important innovation focus area for us is to be more open and connected. Whether that's by providing an open and extensible platform or by working closely with our partners to deliver added value to our customers.
For our Workday platform, we're continuing to deliver tools and capabilities that simplify and enhance application development with Workday Extend. For example, we introduced our first set of ML APIs in Q1 to enable our Extend customers to build extensions that leverage ML.
We also released low code no code development functionality with App Builder. enabling developers to create apps with Extend via a simple drag and drop user interface. And we built on our decade plus partnership with AWS to create a native integration from Extend to AWS. With this integration, developers can easily and securely leverage AWS services in their Extend applications. The integration is in early access with GA to follow later this year. Extend which surpassed 500 customers in Q1 continues to be a major differentiator for us with the office of the CIO.
Additionally, we held Workday DevCon, our third annual developers conference earlier this month. In person attendance for this year's event grew by nearly 200% over last year, which is a testament to the excitement we're seeing from our customers and partners to build on top of the Workday platform, not only with Extend, but with Prism, Adaptive Planning, Journeys and Integrations.
And on the partner front, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Alight to deliver an integrated payroll experience to customers across six key regions for us in Europe, Benelux, Germany, Italy, the Nordics, Spain and Switzerland.
As you know Workday's core values are foundational to everything we do, and guide the decisions we make. In recognition of our efforts to always strive to do what's right. I'm pleased to share that Workday for the third consecutive year, was named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Additionally, we continued our commitment to sustainability by joining Frontier, and advanced market commitment to accelerate carbon removal.
Finally, I want to note an organizational change that we will be making. After nearly nine years with Workday, Barbara Larson, our current CFO is stepping away to spend more time with her family. During her time with Workday, Barbara has served in several senior leadership roles across our finance and product organizations, has played an integral role in shaping Workday into the company we are today. I'm extremely grateful for her friendship and for the countless contributions she has made to the company. And I wish her nothing but the best in her next endeavor.
With Barbara leaving, I'm pleased to announce that Zane Rowe will be joining Workday as our new CFO. Zane comes to us from VMware, where he was CFO since 2016. And before that held CFO roles at EMC and United Airlines. Carl and Zane worked together at VMware, so I let Carl share more in a minute on what Zane's addition to our leadership team will mean for Workday.
In closing, we once again delivered a strong quarter and feel good about our growth prospects throughout the rest of fiscal year '24, despite what will continue to be a challenging macro and economic environment.
Innovation is core to who we are and fuels our continuing focus on infusing differentiative AI and ML across our entire product portfolio. Doing that will enable us to continue to serve as the digital backbone for organizations who want to thrive in today's changing world of work.
With that, I'll turn it over to our Co-CEO and my good friend, Carl Eschenbach to share our go-to-market highlights from the quarter. Carl, over to you? Thanks, Aneel. And thank you everyone for joining today.
I want to start by offering my sincere thanks to Barbara for all she has done for Workday in her nearly nine years here. As a Board Member and now as Co-CEO, I've had the opportunity to watch her grow and help drive Workday forward across her many leadership roles. Without question, Workday is a better company because of her. We will miss her and we wish her well.
As we searched for a leader to take over as CFO [indiscernible] and I cannot think of a better person than Zane Rowe. I had the privilege of working alongside him at VMware, and I believe he is one of the finest executives and CFOs in all of enterprise software. As we embark upon the next phase of our growth journey, Zane is the perfect person to guide us on our path of driving durable long-term growth and margin expansion. We are thrilled to welcome Zane to the team and expect a seamless transition over the next couple of months.
Ninety days ago at our global sales kickoff, we challenged our teams to deliver a strong start for FY '24. I'm proud to say that our workmates met that goal driving growth across key geographies, industries and solutions, leading to strong new ACB growth in Q1. Because of their efforts, we are well positioned as we head into Q2, despite a challenging macro environment, which continues to cause customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny, and in some cases, lightning sales cycles.
I joined workday as Co-CEO six months ago. And while I was excited about the possibilities then, I am even more excited now. Sharing the Co-CEO role with Aneel couldn't be going any better. Working alongside him, I've had the chance to witness the power of Aneel 30 years of product experience, which is unmatched in our industry. Our complementary skills make a tremendous partnership.
I've also spent a lot of time over the last few months meeting with our employees, customers and partners around the world. These visits have shown me the energy and innovation across the Workday community firsthand. They reinforced my belief that Workday has the potential to be one of the most enduring software businesses of our time.
There are two key themes I keep hearing that sets us apart. The first is that Workday is mission critical. Workday is the intelligent digital backbone for enterprises who are looking to consolidate their technology footprint and move from best-of-breed applications to best-in-suite or best-in-platform. Enterprises are clearly looking to benefit from the reduced total cost of ownership and a rapid pace of innovation that Workday delivers.
Second, as Aneel mentioned, Workday's approach to AI and ML is a clear differentiator for us. With over 60 million users all on a unified data model. We are uniquely positioned to be the secure steady hand to support our customers through this tectonic technology shift, same as we did with Cloud.
Turning to highlights for the quarter, I would like to focus on 5 key areas; land, expand, global, industries and partners. Our land motion with net new customers remains the primary driver of our growth. We had a strong performance landing new customers across our key buying centers, geographies and industries in Q1 and continue to see significant runway.
In HCM, where we are the clear market leader, we saw sustained momentum with several new customer wins, including Dollar Tree, Interpublic Group, Johor Corporation and McLean Company, along with notable HCM go-lives, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, J. Crew and Lexmark International. Increasingly, customers are looking to leverage the full power of Workday by purchasing both HCM and financial management.
New full platform wins in Q1 include IBEX Global Solutions, Pima County, The Rio and Stephens Transport. We also had several core Fins go-live, including Whole Foods, Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and Extendicare, which went live on both Financials and HCM.
Another way that we strategically bring new customers into the Workday community is through our planning-first motion, which drove healthy growth and had important wins in every major region this quarter, including Leonardo Hotels, LeoVegas and a significant expansion of our agreement with ExxonMobil.
Planning is an important first step on our customers' digital transformation journey. And once they are a Workday customer, we can partner with them to realize the full benefits of our platform. Several companies expanded from Planning first to full platform in Q1, including DJE Holdings and The Nature Conservancy.
Given this success, along with momentum, we are seeing within the office of the CFO, we are adding significant sales capacity this year focused on selling Fins. And while this is early, we are optimistic about the initial pipeline momentum from these resources.
Customers are increasingly leaning into Workday as their trusted platform across the board. This was reflected in strong renewals and healthy expansion activity across our installed base in Q1. Wins include Brown & Brown, IU Group, Nissan and Racetrack, to name a few. We are seeing expand to momentum across our product portfolio, including solutions that deliver faster time to value for customers such as Peakon, Planning, Health and Talent Optimization. This momentum is helping our sales teams create and close a healthy amount of pipeline all in the same quarter.
Global growth continues to be a massive untapped opportunity for us. We drove strong execution across a number of our major geographies this quarter, yet less than 5% of our TAM is penetrated. In the U.S., we saw strong traction, particularly within large enterprise. In EMEA, we're seeing early signs that our new leadership team is coming together with healthy growth across key markets, including Germany, Switzerland and the Nordics; and wins, including Equinor ASA and Clyde & Co. In APJ, Australia was a highlight with wins including Insignia Financial and the Australian arm of Tokio Marine.
Momentum is also clearly building within our investment in native payroll in the Australian market. While we still have work to do in APJ to capture the full market potential, after spending time in the region in Q1, the executive team and I continue to see a lot of opportunity.
Next, I want to highlight our industry-first approach, which is a critical part of winning the offices of the CFO and CHRO within our core services-based industries. In higher education, for example, we have led the market over the last 3 years in cloud-native HCM, financial and student systems according to the Tambellini Group. We saw continued momentum in Q1 with notable wins, including a Fins expansion at Northeastern University and new platform wins at the University of Richmond and Loyola University of Maryland.
In the professional services industry, the key wins I mentioned earlier include deals at DJE Holdings, IBEX and Interpublic Group. In financial services, we had several wins and expansions, including Absa Bank, Fannie Mae and First American.
In state and local government, we followed up a strong Q4 with another quarter of healthy growth. And in health care, we were pleased to be named the top-performing cloud ERP solution by Class Research. And we had important Q1 wins, including a significant expansion at Stanford Health Care.
Our ability to accelerate our momentum in these industries and across our business depends on our ability to maintain a vibrant and engaged partner ecosystem. While our partner ecosystem has always been critical to our success, we are shifting even more deployments to our partners. And in return, we are looking to work with our partners in increasingly strategic ways to drive more co-innovation and greater lead generation for the Workday.
As part of that effort, we rolled out our new partner referral program in May, which puts clear incentives in place for our ecosystem to drive lead generation. In addition, following our go-to-market partnership with AWS we announced last quarter, I'm pleased to share that we had our first AWS private marketplace transaction during Q1. And as Aneel mentioned, the recently announced payroll partnership with Alight expands our global payroll coverage.
In closing, we're off to a great start in FY '24 with strong new business bookings, healthy pipelines and continued progress towards our strategic growth initiatives. And while the macro remains uncertain, we are positioning the business to return to 20%-plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves and laying the foundation for driving durable growth and margin expansion for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you. Thanks, Carl.
I appreciate the kind words. It's been such a pleasure to work and grow alongside you, Aneel and this entire organization these last 9 years. But after much thought, I know this is the right time for me to step back and focus on my family. And I can't think of a better person to pass the CFO reins to than Zane. He's a remarkable leader, an incredible person and culture fit and the right person to take Workday on the next phase of its incredible growth journey. I look forward to working with him over the next couple of months to ensure a seamless transition.
As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year driven by solid execution and durable demand across our solutions as organizations continue their finance and HR modernization journey. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.53 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Professional services revenue in the quarter was $156 million. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $420 million in Q1, representing 25% of total revenue.
Twenty-four-month subscription revenue backlog was $9.79 billion, up 23% at the end of Q1, resulting from strong new ACV bookings and renewals with growth in net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. As Carl mentioned, we saw significant customer base expansion activity in the quarter. Many of the customers that expanded their strategic footprint elected to co-term and renew their existing contracts ahead of schedule. These early renewals in the quarter added roughly 1 percentage point to both 24-month and total backlog growth.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q1 was $16.65 billion, up 32%. In addition to the benefit from early renewals, we continue to see an increased average contract duration on both new deals and renewals, causing total backlog to grow significantly faster than 24-month backlog.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $396 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.5%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue upside, a slower-than-anticipated ramp in hiring and the timing of certain expenses.
Q1 operating cash flow was $277 million. As we discussed last quarter, the year-over-year decline was driven by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus program, a $55 million interest payment on our debt and payments associated with our January workforce realignment.
We ended the first quarter with more than 17,800 global workmates. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology, but we continue to plan for fewer head count additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q1, and we are focused on maintaining our momentum as we enter Q2.
Now turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum of our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. Following a strong Q1, we are raising the low end of our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance, resulting in a new range of $6.550 billion to $6.575 billion, an 18% year-over-year growth. We continue to view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment.
We expect Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.611 billion to $1.613 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we continue to expect sequential subscription revenue growth in Q3 of approximately 4%.
We are maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million. As Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $160 million. We expect the 24-month backlog to increase approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2.
We continue to expect FY '24 a non-GAAP operating margin of 23% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach to invest in long-term growth opportunities, while at the same time delivering healthy margin expansion. For Q2, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.
GAAP operating margins for both the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. We expect to achieve GAAP profitability on an operating income basis beginning in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year as we continue to drive margin expansion and reduce stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.
To align our compensation plan with our focus on speed of execution and results, we recently modified our cash bonus program from an annual to a semiannual payout structure, beginning with our FY '24 bonus plan. We expect to make the first semiannual payment in Q3 of this year, resulting in an additional bonus payment in FY '24 versus our initial expectations. As a result, we now expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year.
In addition, we are lowering our guidance for FY '24 capital expenditures to approximately $300 million driven by normalization we are seeing within our supply chain. We have $425 million in the remaining authorization under our buyback program and expect to resume buying back shares in Q2 after our trading window opens.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work as we move through FY '24 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Considering that it's a Q1 and macro headwinds are persistent, this is a significant outperformance in the backlog. So congratulations to the team Workday. One quick one for Aneel. With generative AI, what is your view on how Workday can potentially get paid? Is it to a new SKU or improvement in ARPU? And if I can slip one for Carl, any update on the net new business back-to-the-base initiative and how that's powering through these results would be useful. Thank you so much. So I think touch the part about ChatGPT and then or generative AI, and then what was the follow-on to that? How can you monetize it, Aneel, in terms of a new SKU or an ability to charge more for the productivity improvement that you can offer to your customers? Yes. I think in general; AI and ML are technologies that all customers should expect to be embedded in their products. The way we've thought about it is using it to enable products that couldn't have existed before. We announced some of them as new SKUs, but our big ones so far have been Skills Cloud. That just couldn't exist without AI/ML. You could say the same about Talent Optimization. As it relates to generative AI, by the way, those are based on generative AI maybe not ChatGPT, but generative AI. And Skills Cloud is a great example of a large language model as well.
There's other SKUs coming down the road. There's content generation. You could think about the one that everybody talks about, performance reviews as an example. There are ways to monetize it, but we want to make sure it's a brand-new product that couldn't be built without it. And I would just say stay tuned. You'll see us start rolling things out, but we're doing things around generative AI very carefully to make sure that we follow our path on ethics and security and doing it the right way. Yes. Kash, as it relates to the net new business, as you can see, we had a really strong start to the year here in Q1, and that includes our net new business or our new ACV business. And it was across all industries. It wasn't specific to one. It was across all industries. It was across all market segments. And geographically, we saw strong performance both in the U.S. and in EMEA as well. So our net new business is the lifeline of Workday. It gives us the customer installed base to sell back into. And we saw a strong performance in Q1, and that was reflected in our guide for both Q2 and the rest of the year. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Congrats on the great consistency. And Barbara, best wishes, and thank you for everything. Carl and Aneel, in this environment, are you better off spending the next incremental dollar on financials or on products that help to navigating this challenging labor market, like recruiting and skills cloud and talent marketplace. I'm just wondering where you see stronger prioritization and willingness to buy. And then, you did mention a significant expansion with ExxonMobil. I'm a little surprised because I recall that as a very large planning deal just announced last summer. Can you just clarify why the expansion is so rapid there? On the R&D side, they're long-term investments. And I feel very comfortable that they're all fully funded. I think in this environment, it's more of a question on how you allocate go-to-market resources. And that's really up to Carl. So Carl, how would you think about that? Yes. Sure. So we saw a really solid performance in financials this quarter. And as we talked about last quarter, we were doubling down on go-to-market around financials and hiring a significant number of quota-carrying capacity reps. And we're going to continue to do that because of the pipeline that we saw build specifically around financials. We also called out in our prepared remarks that we continue to see a lot of momentum in our land business, specifically around planning. We land customers with planning, and then they come right back in and buy both. Financials, obviously, but we're also seeing people buy HCM on the back of a planning land because of workforce planning.
In the example of Exxon, we only had a portion of their business for Planning, and they expanded it much more broadly across their entire business because they saw the value that they got from that platform that they started to use a year ago. So again, planning is a good lead-in for us, and we'll continue to invest in go-to-market around financials because of both the strength of financials and the planning land business we see today. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Very nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question really about the macro environment and what you're seeing out there. You referred to it as still uneven. But like the idea of customers co-terming and sort of pulling forward contracting seems a little bit more aggressive than what we saw, like this time last year when customers were delaying deals and shifting it out. So one, should we take that as any indication on kind of the overall macro environment?
And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about that state of Iowa contract that was in the news that got canceled. Did that have any impact on the quarter in terms of RPO or bookings or is that already out of there? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Keith, for the question. I think it's consistent from what we described last quarter. There's an uncertain environment out there which, in some cases, caused customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny. We're seeing the CFO be involved in a lot more deals. And in some cases, we're even seeing lengthening of sales cycles, but that's specific, if you will, more to net new opportunities. And even if they get pushed out, they don't go away. They just push out by a quarter or 2.
That being said, we couldn't be more proud of how we executed in Q1 with this backdrop. And one of the reasons we think that's the case is because companies continue to prioritize both HCM and financial transformations to support two of their most critical assets: their people and their money. And in an environment like this, we're starting to see our value proposition actually only become that much stronger. The reason for that is we think our platform is a consolidation play. And as people consolidate more on to a specific platform, there's a total cost of ownership benefit that they get.
And if you think about the headwinds most of our customers are facing specific to the HCM platform, they need to drive two things, they need to drive productivity gains and they also need to make sure their employee experience is at the highest level, and that's exactly what we do on the HCM side.
On the financial side, the value proposition also is resonating in this environment, why? Because finance role has continued to change in an environment like we're playing in today. They have to be agile and nimble. They have to be able to do forecast, and they have to make quick [indiscernible]. And we just see this as another example where our platform play on the financials only get that much stronger.
So I think overall, we're not immune to the environment that's out there, but our value proposition is resonating more than ever in a market like we're dealing with today. And then, Keith, this is Barbara on Iowa. We don't provide customer-specific revenue or backlog disclosures but do keep in mind that no single customer is material to our business. Keith, Doug Robinson here. I'd just say that the storyline for me of the quarter is the diversity of the business. And so you talk about the macro, it's sort of the core of your question. And there's enough diversity in that business that we're not seeing where there are pockets of weakness, we have lots of diverse lines of business where we do see industry a lot of strength.
And specific about like the early renewal comment, I think that's just a function of not a focus or any specific sales play that's being run, but I do think it's a function of we're getting a larger percentage of our revenue from our existing customer base doubling down and back to rationalizing a number of suppliers. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Congrats on the strong start and, Barbara, best of luck going forward. Aneel, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the unified data model and then the explosion of interest around AI. You guys, as you mentioned, have been investing in AI for a while. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of an advantage the unified data model is, as you bring in more generative AI into the product suite versus if you didn't have that?
And I was just curious do customers recognize this, meaning when they're making a bet on your long-term product portfolio, do they realize the benefits of this model even more so as we start talking about AI in a bigger way? Thanks. Well, I think it's a great question. I think it's our job to explain to them the benefits of the unified data model, and it's a huge advantage, right? We have a data model that we can run huge algorithms against that are not just all of HR, but it's all of HR and finance. And if you wanted to bring in third-party data, we can bring that in through Prism Analytics. If you think about a company that's been built through acquisition, the first thing they need to do is figure out how to get all the data and probably have to dump it into a data mart where you lose a lot of intelligence along the way, kind of lose the data model alongside. So it's huge.
But the other part that's huge for us is the amount of data we have in a normalized multi-tenant fashion. We have over 60 million employees in the system and hundreds of billions of transactions every year. We have a huge advantage on the data being in a way that makes it easy to run algorithms against, where I just think for almost everybody else, it's so hard just to get the data all in one place and then they don't have the data sets that we have. I would say, too, from a sales perspective, we see it now becoming part of the buying criteria and part of the decision-making, whereas a year ago, there wasn't perhaps the customer pushing it so much as the sales teams and the consulting teams trying to demonstrate the value of it and shine a spotlight on it.
Even within customer base now, we've always done, as Aneel mentioned before, predictions and recommendations based off of AI and ML, and customers have been using that for years. And there's now set an interest in understanding how we go about doing that in deeper detail. And one other piece architecturally, a lot of companies are approaching AI and ML as something brand new, so they're trying to attach AI and ML technologies to the applications. Our applications have that in their foundation through the technology set or the tool set. And that goes back really to 2014. We've always looked to the consumer Internet as a guiding light for where new technologies are first born, and then we apply them in a secure way, in a way that protects data privacy. So we've been at it for almost a decade now honing in. And I think ChatGPT, and conversational AI is an important next step, but we have all the foundational elements. And I would not forget about the value of more traditional AI and ML techniques because we haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg about what companies can do to make their businesses better. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Aneel and Carl, financial services, I believe, is one of your largest verticals. And many are curious ultimately what you saw post March. Have you seen any change in terms of appetite there? I'd just love to get your thoughts on the overall vertical. Yes. Sure. Thanks, Brent. Yes, it is one of our larger verticals. In fact, a few quarters ago, we talked about crossing $1 billion in ARR in this vertical. So it continues to be really important to us and strategic. It's important also to note though, Brent, when we talk about the financial services industries, it's inclusive of many things, including insurance, asset managers. We have investment banks there, commercial banks and regional banks. But as a whole, we were really pleased with our performance across the financial services segment this quarter. Specifically in the U.S., in our large enterprise segment, we saw probably the best quarter out of all the things I articulated there.
At the same time, the regional banks, the regional banks fall more into our medium enterprise business here in the States. And we did see a little bit of softness in that business. But I think that was to be expected considering what was going on with the banking crisis in those regional banks. But overall, we saw a really solid performance in financial services. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. My question here is on the momentum you're seeing with those expansion deals, it sounds like, from planning to fins. I know this has been an effort that's been underway for a number of years, but it really seems like you're hitting your momentum here. What would you attribute that to? Is this just planning is becoming more or less a system of record, just given the need for analytics and the development of the platform, the challenging macro that need to change for forecasting and run ad hoc forecasting? Or is this more of an emphasis on kind of selling back into the base in that particular segment? Just curious as to why you're seeing the momentum now. Thank you. I'll just answer the product piece. There's no question planning is a system of record. And I think if there was any question during the pandemic, it became very clear that companies that could plan and adjust faster and better were going to do better. And so it is now clearly a core system of record. So Doug and Carl will take it from there. I mean I'd definitely say the product investments have helped our sales effectiveness with financial and workforce planning. But frankly, it's a simple answer, which is adding more Fins-focused sellers who wake up every day really focused on that motion and then partnering them closely with the team that lands with the planning so that there's great collaboration between setting a vision starting with Planning but setting a vision for a full platform with Workday. Yes. I don't have anything to add. You said it well, Doug. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. So maybe just the first one around the way that macro evolved throughout the quarter, did you feel like it was kind of -- it's still tough, but it's not getting worse? And then kind of exiting the month of May, any commentary that you would kind of compare?
And then on a product point, a really interesting partnership around global payroll with Alight. As you look at customers that are increasingly wanting to consolidate functionality onto one platform, where does it make sense to partner versus -- build versus buy or partner versus buy functionality? And why was payroll, in this case global payroll, kind of the right one to partner on versus acquire? Well, let's start with your last question, and then I'll follow up on the quarter and what we're seeing. Aneel, why don't you take the payroll. Yes. So we have six of our own native payrolls. They're huge investments. And when you get to Europe and the works councils in particular, every country is very different. And it's always a trade-off about building a payroll versus HR Fins functionality that can be used in every country. There are great payroll solutions out there. Alight is a good partner. Frankly, ADP has been a very good partner almost since the start of the day of the Workday. And we have a good partnership in the field with them, a good partnership in the field. And really, what we want to do is provide choices to our customers and the more that we can do with integrations that work out of the box.
Frankly, what it does is it opens up market for us where companies in some of these geographies, they expect HR and payroll to come together as opposed to just HR. So when we don't have payroll, we're not able to access all that marketplace. So these are really important partnerships to us. Yes. And as it relates to the macro, the question was around whether we're seeing anything change throughout Q1 and the start of year Q2. And no, it's pretty consistent. It's very uncertain. And as I said earlier, we're clearly seeing deals go for another level or two of approval, including all the way up to the CFO office. And that hasn't changed throughout the last four months. In fact, it's pretty consistent with what we even saw at the end of last year. That being said, we're prepared for it. The teams understand this is going to happen. They're very prepared for these extra levels of approval. And I think we've navigated these choppy waters quite well.
I will say, we also mentioned in Q1, we were going to be prudent with our guide both in Q1 for the full year based on the choppy waters we see out there, and that's exactly what we're seeing. And it's playing out in the guidance. And as you saw in our guide for the full year, we maintained it because of the healthy pipeline we built coming out of Q1. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Maybe this is for Doug and/or Carl. But the HCM seat expansions can be harder to come by upon renewals in an environment where your customer base isn't hiring as aggressively. But it certainly doesn't appear from these numbers that was an issue for you guys at all. But I'd love to just comment on the seat expansion dynamic you're seeing upon renewals. Thank you. Yes. It's a great question and one that we purposefully built into the plan. We expect it as part of this year's plan for some moderation there. And in fact, that did play out. Now the customers that did renew in the aggregate added more employees at the end of the quarter than at the time at the end of their agreement, but it did moderate just as we planned. So to us, it's playing out as we had predicted. No deviation up or down from it. The only thing I'd add there, Doug, is if you look at the head count contraction in the market, I think it's much more acute in one industry versus others, and that's in hi-tech. So in a lot of our other customers where we did have renewals come up, they did expand their head count because not everyone is reducing their head count and doing risks out there in the market. It's much more acute in hi-tech. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Clearly seeing good momentum here with the planning-first sales motion. I want to pivot a little bit to Extend, particularly on the heels of Workday DevCon. You're crossing over 500 Extend customers now. What are the types of applications people are building with Extend to run on Workday? And as you think about exposing AI and large language models, does that potentially accelerate the app build opportunity with Extend? Thanks. Yes. I'd say most of the applications are basically, it's called Extend. They're usually apps that customers wanted to build that are either in HR or finance that are custom apps that they had before that they now want to move into the Workday environment. So it just helps them retire legacy applications and put everything in the same environment where they also get the benefit of those applications getting updated and move forward to the next version by Workday. So it's a very powerful opportunity. And exactly what you said around AI and ML is what we're doing. And if you think about the announcements, we made at DevCon, a lot of it was enabling AI and ML development. And of course, what we're doing with AWS was huge. That was probably one of the most exciting announcements we made at DevCon.
Now people can natively build on top of AWS and have it represent through Extend and tie into the rest of their Workday application suite. I think Extend is still one of our best-kept secrets. And it's hard for me to see how every customer shouldn't want to have at least some presence of Extend in their Workday footprint. We will take two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. You're talking about a return to 20% growth, but still above that number. So congrats on that. Maybe just one on margin, you drove 200 basis points of outperformance in the quarter, still holding on to the full year guide. I know Barb mentioned some items around timing of expenses, but anything we should be mindful of in modeling out expenses for the rest of the year? And maybe, Barb, just any further comment on how you ensure there's a seamless transition given some good transition through the management team thus far? Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question. You're right. We outperformed Q1 margins. Some of that was due to a slower-than-expected hiring ramp and also some timing of certain expenses. So it's really early in the year. We have a lot of strategic growth areas of the business where we're looking to invest and help sustain durable long-term growth, while also planning to deliver healthy margin expansion this year.
And in terms of the transition, I'm here through the end of July and focused on making this as smooth and as seamless as possible for Zane as well as for the team. And I couldn't think of a better person to hand the reins over to. Zane is an incredible person. I've known him personally. So Workday is in good hands. But I will add, you will be missed Barbara. Our last question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Congrats on the results. Maybe one on international. I don't think we've hit that yet. It sounds like you're happy with the leadership that's in place now. I think in the past, you've talked about some product gaps that need to be filled internationally. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about kind of where you are in that process and maybe in what markets you see the most opportunity to jump start international. You want to go? Yes, I'll start. So yes, thanks for the question. And it is a big focus for us here. We always talk about our TAM. And we talk about half of our TAM is outside the U.S., and only 25% of our revenues this quarter come from that market. And if you look at it globally, we're only penetrated 5% of our total TAM. And a lot of that's going to come going forward from our international expansion.
In Europe, specifically, last quarter, we talked about a number of new leadership changes we made, and we're starting to see really good traction in Europe. In fact, the leadership we talked about last quarter continued. Just last week, we brought in two new leaders, both in France and a new leader in the U.K., so that team has hit the ground and they're doing super well right now. A number of us in the leadership team spent time in APJ last quarter as well. And we saw a tremendous amount of opportunity there in those markets.
As it relates to the product, Aneel talked earlier about Alight, an example of us expanding our partnership with them to get more payroll in market. We've built out additional data centers over the last year in Singapore, in Germany, in Australia. And I think you can expect us also to look at the ecosystem, our partners going forward to expand our presence in international markets.
We just recently rolled out a referral program for our partners. So if they bring us net new opportunities, they'll get paid. We launched that and we see that across EMEA. And we're also going to do some of that in APJ. So we're really pleased with the early signs of some of the transformation we're going to in the international market and it's going to come across all functions of the business, both go-to-market, product and our ecosystem. Yes. And I would just add that the payroll is the big solution for a lot of those international markets. But there are capabilities required for Japan and Korea. They have a business process where thousands of people will change jobs once a year. And it's a very unique -- it's almost like a re-recruiting process. And it's been a chicken-and-egg thing, where without the pipeline, we haven't made the investments as the pipeline is building, we're making the investments in those capabilities. Japan is a country we should be doing a lot better in, and we have some product gaps that we can fill to make it better for the sales teams. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President.",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question only.
I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. [Technical Difficulty] Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.

Our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on October 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter, achieving subscription revenue growth of 19%, 24-month backlog growth of 23%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. While we continue to see deal scrutiny, our workmates around the world did a remarkable job, staying close to our customers in driving this quarter's result in positioning us for strength in the second-half of the year and beyond.
Workday continues to stand-out from the crowd for a few key reasons. First, the mission-critical nature of our platform. Our customers now representing more than 65 million users under contract are all in on Workday, because they trust us to manage their two most important assets, their people and their money. Trust is at the core of our customer relationships and we will always work to earn it.
Second, our value proposition is strengthening as businesses consolidate their technology footprint from best-of-breed solutions to a true platform. Workday is a trusted platform, they can turn to drive productivity gains, agility, skills-based talent strategies, and a great employee experience all at the same time. Third is our unique approach to AI and ML. Aneel will share more on our progress here shortly.
And finally, our winning culture and talent, which is only getting stronger as we continue to attract our industry's best talent. We recently welcomed Emma Chalwin as Chief Marketing Officer. Emma is not only a great culture fit, but she has extensive global experience across all facets of marketing at companies like Salesforce and Adobe. We also recently hired an incredible Head of our U.S. Federal Government team and a Senior Executive in sales operations, and another in our services organization to help us scale our go-to-market efforts.
And of course, you all know our CFO, Zane Rowe, who is joining us today for his first earnings call. I could not be more excited to welcome these leaders who along with our existing team will help us achieve our next phase of growth.
Turning to the highlights of the quarter. I will focus on five key areas, land, expand, global, industries, and partners. Starting with land, we see full financials in HCM platform wins on the rise, illustrating the trust customers have in Workday. Wins this quarter include ADVOCATE Health Assured Partners, Carillion Services for Tria, KinderCare and University of Florida. And we continue to build on our market leadership position in HCM, with new customer wins, including Fresenius, digital technologies, Stellantis, and Rio Tinto.
Once we land customers, we immediately turn our efforts to successful deployments. In Q2 notable HCM go lives include A1 Telekom Austria, Korean Airlines, Nike, and Rite Aid. Strategic financial go-lives include fitness international, multi-care health systems, Wintrust, and the University of Washington. We also celebrated our first FedRAMP go-live which was a full platform rollout at a well-known civilian agency. Expanding our existing business with customers is key to our growth strategy. In addition to strong renewals this quarter we had a number of expansions at companies such as Airbus, Dell Technologies, Lloyds Bank, those companies in 7-Eleven.
Our faster time-to-value solutions, which includes planning, Picon, Extend, health and talent optimization continue to gain traction with many deals created and closed within the quarter. This year we put increased focus on financials go-to-market and it's starting to bear fruit with healthy customer growth in Q2. Beyond the full platform deals I mentioned earlier, we had a number of financial expansion wins in the quarter, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Nordic Consulting, and Rakuten.
Given our momentum, we continue to invest in financials targeted sellers to lay the foundation for durable growth. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. continues to be our largest market, representing 75% of our revenue. The U.S. team drove solid results in Q2 with particular strength coming from our customer base in industry teams. We have a significant runway for growth in this market in a healthy pipeline looking-forward. Expanding our footprint globally is among our largest untapped opportunities and is a top priority.
During Q2, we held 20 Elevate customer events across EMEA and APJ, attracting over 5,000 attendees and generating hundreds of leads in net new opportunities. Not only are we building pipeline, we're starting to see more consistent execution in certain regions, notably EMEA.
We saw strength in key markets such as Germany, U.K. and France. Where wins included Renus assets, Symrise, National West Mr. Bank in ALD Automotive SA. Our industry-first approach is paying off. This quarter, retail and hospitality became our second industry joining Financial Services to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and we continue to have strong momentum in financial services which outperformed in Q2. The health care team also delivered another strong performance with 3 large hospital systems going all in on Workday's platform in Q2. A great example is ADVOCATE Health, which is part of their merger with Atrium Health selected Workday to replace a competitor's cloud HCM financials and supply chain management solution.
Workday supply chain continues to contribute to our traction in health care with more than 220 health care organizations investing in it to reduce costs, promote standardization and boost resiliency. Finally, our education and government team followed up a strong start to the year with an impressive Q2, with wins such as West Virginia University, the Paul University and Metropolitan Community College to name a view. The potential we have to accelerate our growth through our partner community is huge. We are seeing early signs that our partner referral program will positively impact new logos and our partnership with the AWS marketplace led to multiple strategic wins in Q2. In EMEA, our recently announced payroll partnership with ELI is beginning to drive pipeline.
And in APJ, our strategic partnership expansion with Samsung SDS is not only helping us drive overall business in South Korea. It also is enabling the development of region-specific applications built on Workday Extend. After spending time with many of our partners at our annual Altitude conference this past quarter, it is clear our momentum is building. We look forward to welcoming more than 15,000 members of our Workday community at our annual Workday Rising Conference next month in San Francisco. We hope to see many of you there.
As this quarter's results show the diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. We are the clear market leader for cloud HCM and finance and our value proposition has never been more relevant or powerful. We are investing across our product portfolio, geographies, industries and through partnerships to drive durable long-term growth. It is an incredible and exciting time to be a work made and I truly believe our future has never been brighter.
With that, I will turn it over to my Co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI and ML strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you. Thank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call and especially to our nearly 17,900 workmates around the world for helping deliver another solid quarter. I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that our future is extremely bright. I've been on the road a lot recently to meet with current and prospective customers, and one thing is abundantly clear.
More and more organizations are looking to Workday to be their trusted partner to help them navigate today's business landscape and thrive in this new world of work. Critical to our ability to be that trusted partner is our continued focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative AI. .
Last quarter, I highlighted Workday's unique approach to AI and ML, which began in earnest in 2014 with a focus on 3 key aspects. AI and ML are embedded into the core of our platform, we place an emphasis on being human-centric with our AI and ML strategy, and we continue to believe the true potential of AI and ML can only be met by ensuring that is leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way.
Looking ahead, Journal of AI will continue to be a major focus for us. Despite the recent hype cycle, Workday has been using large language models for years, and we're continuing to invest in a big way. What helps further set Workday apart is our unrivaled data set quality, which is fueled by our more than 65 million users under contract and $600 billion annual transactions to create data models that provide accurate, meaningful and most importantly, trustworthy results.
We're currently building product capabilities that leverage generative AI for a variety of tests. Examples include natural language generation, content search, content summarization, content augmentation and document understanding. And we're looking beyond those use cases at how we can also leverage copilots, agents and conversational UI. Each will help our customers redefine the way they work, and we look forward to previewing these new capabilities along with the rest of our latest AI developments at Workday Rising in September.
All told, our differentiated approach is working as we are seeing continued momentum across the board with our over 3,000 customers having opted into sharing their data with our ML models. And we know they are realizing value once they have opted in as we are processing more than 50 million ML inferences per day, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year.
Furthermore, we believe that the enhanced value that AI and generative AI provide to our customers will also create economic benefits to Workday by positively influencing competitive win rates, renewal rates and our already industry-leading customer satisfaction. We plan to offer most AI capabilities to our customers who opt in as part of their current product subscription with generous based usage entitlements. We also expect AI to open up new market opportunities with direct monetization that are wholly based on AI technologies, similar to our talent optimization solution that leverages Skills Cloud, one of our fastest-growing SKUs.
Last quarter, I also shared our perspective on the growing importance of AI safeguards and the active role we're playing in driving the development of smart regulations. Since then, the EU has entered final negotiations on its AI Act which we expect to shape AI regulation globally. We've worked closely with policymakers in Europe over the last two years, and we're pleased to see many of our suggestions accepted in the Parliaments version that was recently approved. In the U.S., under the leadership of Sayan Chakraborty, our Co-President, we played a leading role in helping develop the AI framework for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, which is a how to guide for organizations to develop and use trustworthy AI.
We are leading by example by implementing the NIST AI framework, and we're working with Congress to encourage adoption of it throughout the federal government. We are also helping to drive the conversation with lawmakers at the state level, including California as they look to find a path forward for new AI regulations. We're helping them develop legislative frameworks that build trust and AI tools while driving innovation across the enterprise. As we continue to drive thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI, you'll hear more from us on our work in the EU, the U.S. and around the world at this pivotal moment for AI policy.
On the application front, we're continuing to see our innovation story resonate with customers who are increasingly selecting Workday over the competition. According to Gartner Enterprise Application Software as a Service, market share research, which was published in Q2, Workday had the highest worldwide market share in 2022 for SaaS ERP at 21%. Additionally, we crossed another milestone in Q2 with more than 5,000 core HCM and finance customers, a testament to the power of the Workday platform. For the office of the CFO, we enhanced Workday Adaptive Planning with the next generation of our patented Elastic Hypercube technology.
Powered by new AI and performance improvements, Workday Adaptive Planning can now support our customers' most complex planning requirements. Scaling automatically without sacrificing speed or performance. Further proof to the continued momentum we are seeing with this application Workday Adaptive Planning was named Best Financial Management Solution in the 2023 SIIA CODI wards. Workday was also named a Customer's Choice in the 2023 Gartner Peer Insights voice of the customer for financial planning software report. Additionally, Workday Accounting Center is proving to be a true difference maker for the office of the CFO, as shown by the 70% year-over-year growth at experienced in Q2.
Today, accounting center is helping more than 150 customers across a dozen industries to pull from a larger, more diverse spectrum of operational data sources to deliver increased granular insights and allow them to better understand their profitability, all in one system. And for the office of the CHRO, Workday HCM was named a leader in the Forrester Wave Human Capital Management Q2 2023 report which highlighted our investments in Vetley and Workday Pecan employee voice as well as our use of embedded AI and ML to reduce user friction.
In closing, I'm confident that our continued focus on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform will not only position us for future growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue but also play an integral role in helping us continue to build the highest levels of trust with our more than 10,000 customers. I'm excited to see many of you next month for Workday Rising which is back in the Bay Area for 2023.
With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. As Carl pointed out earlier, Zane has been a perfect fit since joining Workday last quarter, and I'm thrilled to have him on board. Over to you, Zane.
Over to you, Zane. Thanks, Aneel. As this is my first earnings call as Workday's CFO, I want to start by saying how honored I am to partner alongside you Aneel, Carl and all of our fellow workmates around the globe. I joined Workday because I thought it was one of the most compelling opportunities in all of enterprise software. The continued strength we saw in Q2 further reinforces that belief.
Turning to the quarter. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.62 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $163 million, leading to total revenue of $1.79 billion growth of 16%.
From a geographic perspective, total revenue outside the U.S. was $442 million, representing 25% of total revenue and 15% growth in Q2. As Carl mentioned, we see significant long-term international growth opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful portion of our revenue mix. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.27 billion at the end of Q2, up 23%, driven by new ACV bookings and strong renewals with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively.
Early renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations and added roughly 1.5 points of growth to 24-month backlog. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.85 billion, up 32%. Early renewals in the quarter added roughly 3 points to the growth. In addition, we continue to see longer contract duration on both net new deals and renewals, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform and is causing our total backlog growth to significantly outpace growth in the 24-month backlog.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $421 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue out-performance and the timing of certain expenses. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, which benefited from the timing of collections in the quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased $139 million in shares at an average price of $218.33 per share. and we had $287 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, and we ended Q2 with nearly 17,900 global workmates. We are pleased with our financial performance in Q2 and focused on continuing to drive results in the second-half while investing to support longer-term growth.
Now turning to guidance. Following our momentum in the first-half of the year, we are raising our full-year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to a new range of $6.57 billion to $6.59 billion representing 18% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.678 billion to $1.68 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth.
We're maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million as we continue to strategically shift more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $165 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 21% year-over-year in Q3. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter.
We are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.5% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while we expand margins. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5%. GAAP operating margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively.
The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate making our first semiannual payment of our employee cash bonus plan in Q3, which impacts our annual cash flow and quarterly seasonality for FY '24.
In addition, we continue to expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. I'll close by thanking our terrific community of customers and partners for their continued support. And I look forward to seeing many of you in the investment community at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 27 in San Francisco.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thank you very much, and the energy on the call is just so palpable. It looks like there is a lot of new leadership changes. Congrats Zane on joining a great team here. I had one thing or maybe two things. The importance of data in the world of AI, you have data on 65 million professional workers. At a high level, how could you possibly monetize with AI, the value of this data in the years ahead, and therefore its implications for the pricing power of Workday?
And if you could, are there any pent-up areas within the portfolio that might have taken a bit of a seat-back because of the caution in the spending environment? If that caution goes away, where do you see maybe geographies or product segments that could do even better in the year ahead? Thank you so much and congratulations. So Kash, I'll take on the first part. Good to hear your voice. The data is really valuable because it lets us train the large language models. And what you'll see us do is have with the large data sets, we can only train the large language models. We can then do domain-specific large language models, and those are smaller and less expensive. And we turn around and use those models to either make our products more competitive or they're the basis of new SKUs like the Skills Cloud.
I think you see us more in the mode of new SKUs like Skills Cloud rather than actually charging for any insight from the data -- that it's the customer's data. They allow us to use it in an anonymized way and we give them the results back. But I think what it allows us to do is train these large language models and then domain specific ones that will create new SKUs. Yes. And just one quick add-on then we'll talk about some of the other questions Kash, great to hear your voice. And I think it's important to know that Aneel and Dave did from the beginning is they built this platform and they built AI and ML deep into the platform. So it's been built in, and we've already seen a positive economic impact to Workday through our industry-leading customer set, our renewal rates and competitive win rates still remain strong because of AI and ML and it's built in from the beginning. So I think that's a differentiator for us against those 65 million users and $600 billion, transactions that we get on the platform a year.
As it relates to your second question, maybe I'll start, Doug, and then you can jump in. we haven't seen any pullback due to the -- any macro headwinds in any of the things we're selling into the market. If anything, I think our value proposition is only resonating more cash as people look to consolidate multiple products who are sometimes called best-of-breed onto best of suite platforms. and they're consolidating on top of Workday for both their financials and their HCM and the wrapping our adaptive planning product around both. So we continue to see strong momentum across the board.
And you mentioned geographies -- our European team continues to do quite well. We've talked about it the last couple of quarters and our focus on international, and they continue to deliver for us. They're much more predictable and they're driving strong pipeline in EMEA -- and then we'll still continue to work on APJ to grow that business out. Doug, do you want to add any additional color? I think that's -- some of that I was -- echo as well. I think just as you coined it sort of the lift in caution, cash. I think that caution is still out there, and that still shows up in the additional deal scrutiny. But I would say, just to give you a little more insight, we were really pleased with the performance of U.S. large enterprise -- and Carl mentioned to me, the -- I attribute that to execution as much as maybe a lift in caution, but it's been really nice execution across Europe in the first-half. Thanks, Doug. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. And congrats on absolutely stellar performance. Zane, I'm wondering if you can dimensionalize at all the FINS quota capacity increase that you're bringing on board? Or how much you could bring on just relative to the demand signals that you're seeing out there? And then for Carl or Aneel, I'm curious if you see more opportunities out there in the mid-market. Or perhaps sensing an inflection up at the Global 2000 level for some of the customers that might need to handle complicated currencies or legal entities, minority interest, country localizations, that type of an arrangement? Sure, Mark. I'm happy to start and then hand over to Carl. As you point out, we're bringing on some significant amount of thin sellers as we see that opportunity, I'd say, both on the domestic side and on the international side. I'd say it's still early days there as we bring them on. Obviously, it will take some time for us to all of those benefits, but it's clearly a focus area for us. I will tell you that the unit growth in FINS this quarter was tremendous and exceeded our expectations. So we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing and optimistic about what we can do in the future there on FINS with the additional go-to-market capacity. Yes, Zane, thanks for that color. Yes, Mark, as you know, six months ago, we decided to put a big investment in the go-to-market side, specifically around FINS. And while it takes six to 12 months to get your reps up and ramped, we're seeing early indications of it providing significant leverage in the business. One of the ways it's turned up here this quarter, as Zane just talked about, is we saw a really good growth in a number of new FINS units sold on a year-over-year basis into the market. But it's more than just selling FINS. We're also seeing the knowledge set that we have across the field now with financials is actually impacting our full platform sales. our full platform sales are only accelerating as we sell both HCM and FINS into the market at the same time.
And we saw that specifically kind of into your next question, in the medium enterprise business. The medium enterprise, we see full platform sales very regularly at this point. And I think that's attributed to the build-out of our FINS sales force. And then the last thing I talk about is the FIN sales force helps us continue to drive a land sale with planning. Planning continues to be a good product for us. We're landing with it, and it opens up the door for us to go back and sell both FINS and full platform into those customers that we landed with planning. So there is no doubt at this time that the FINS build-out of the sales force is paying dividends.
As it relates to the medium enterprise, we had a really solid quarter in what we described the medium enterprise segment. And I think the highlight there was specifically we're seeing more and more full platform sales into that market segment. And we're very pleased with their performance, specifically here in the U.S., and we're going to replicate that internationally as we build out the medium enterprise globally. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Oh, wonderful. Thanks and great to see the great results here. I wanted to ask one on the expand success that you're seeing here. I know Carl has been an initiative here to go back to the base here. Is there any color you could provide as to where you're seeing particular strength? There's so many modules within HCM and FINS that I would love to get some color from you as to where you're seeing success there. And then the second question would just be on the macro, you mentioned that deal scrutiny is still there. Is that outsized in office of HR versus office of CFO, where might we see some potential acceleration coming out of the macro and any differences there? Thank you. Yes, sure. So yes, we -- one of the things we really like about our business model is what we describe as both the diversity and the durability of our business. From a diversity perspective, we're still landing a significant portion of our business on net new deals, which is really exciting to see. And when you land net new deals, what that provides you is a platform to sell back into your customer base, and we have two different selling motions there.
In this quarter when we had a really balanced performance across selling back to the customer base and landing net new -- and that's a motion that we're going to keep leaning into. And by the way, we talked about FINS when we're adding FINS sellers, we're separating them into selling net new FINS and back into the customer base. So this motion is clearly working for us.
As it relates to macro, maybe I'll just do a high level and then ask Doug to chime in and see what he's seeing since he's with customers daily. Nothing has changed over the last few quarters. And because of that, we continue to perform quite well because I think our sales force is very skilled at navigating the extra scrutiny they're going to get. As well as they're doing really well at understanding the sales process and their closing deals and they're getting them across the finish line.
That's both a tribute to our sales force globally, but I also think it comes back to the strong value proposition we're providing customers as we continue to be the platform they're choosing to support both their people and their finances, their two most precious assets. So it's a combination of good execution, understanding the sales cycle and us continuing to have a strong value proposition for our customers and prospects.
And I'll ask Doug to call or add any additional color on the macro. Yes. Thank you, Carl, and nice to talk to you, Brad. From a macro perspective, you asked the question whether it shows up in one area or the other, I think you meant between HCM or FINS, and I'd say not really. I think it's fair to say that the extra scrutiny is on any dollar spent in corporate America or across the globe is getting that scrutiny. So it is sort of across the board. I would say perhaps more pronounced, I don't know if scrutiny is the right way to describe it in net new versus customer base, which is why the customer base has been such an important part of our motion over the last two years at the company. Which was your first question around expand. So in that motion, we really sort of see two key things.
One is this notion of create and close or what we call speed SKUs or speed solutions. So just to highlight there, Peakon planning, talent optimization, those tend to go quick time to value and tend to be really strong in quarter sort of create opportunities and close. But at the same time, we have our customers or the customer base doing larger, what I would describe as more strategic enterprise type agreements. We talked about the expansions across Airbus, Lloyds Bank, Lowe's, 7-Eleven this quarter.
Those are already big customers committed to the platform but have taken on an even more strategic approach with us as they look to consolidate vendors and standardize on our platform. Wonderful to hear. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Thank you very much. And I'll echo the welcome to Zane. Good to hear from you again. Carl, I was wondering if you could just double-click a little bit on international. And what you're seeing in that region, maybe across some of the products. And I was wondering if you could also just talk about the investments that you're making today and sort of the opportunity for those to kind of come to fruition from a bookings perspective next year? I guess just a little bit more color on international would be helpful. Yes. So I'll talk specifically about EMEA, which both Doug and I already mentioned -- but this is an area that we -- I think you are aware, over the last couple of quarters, we've shared that we brought in a lot of new leadership across the region, both in the U.K. at the entire EMEA level. In dock in France. So we've really built out their leadership team there, and they're actually bringing in more and more talent underneath them, and it is starting to clearly pay dividends. We are seeing early signs of solid pipeline build that's much more predictable than we've seen in the past. We see more predictability in the business, because they have their arms around it. And they are selling both HCM and FINS successfully.
The other thing we're seeing, which is a little bit of replication from what we're seeing here in the U.S., as you know, the EMEA market as a whole is very much a medium enterprise business. And they're doing really well at selling full platforms into the EMEA market where customers see the true value of combining both HCM and financials and again, wrapping planning around it for that full platform sale. So we definitely are seeing the momentum there. And we do have some big competitors in our backyard there, but when we look at our competitive win rates across the market, including in the backyard of some of our big competitors, our competitive win rates are holding up, our discounts are holding up. So they're really executing well and taking a really strong approach to the market. So we couldn't be more pleased with what's happening in EMEA.
Internationally, if you go into APJ, we had an okay quarter. We still have some work to do there. We think there's tremendous upside in the APJ market, and we will continue to add resources both on the go-to-market and continue to internationalize and localize our products so we can have a better fit in some of the emerging markets we're going after in APJ. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Carl, maybe the first one for you and then a quick one for Zane. You mentioned a couple of really interesting deals in a number of different verticals, including state and local. You talked about a FedRAMP deal. I guess maybe -- can you dimensionalize the growth of some of these verticals relative to financial services and retail hospitality, when do we think that the kind of the state local, the federal, the health and life sciences, the education verticals can start to rival that type of scale that you're seeing with FINS serve and retail and opticality? And then a quick follow-up for Zane. Yes. So thanks for the question, Alex. And as you know, we don't break out or share specifically or percentages on any given market segment or industry. But in the case -- this time, we did highlight our second $1 billion in annual recurring revenue business in retail and hospitality, which continues to be quite strong and growing. And we had another really solid quarter in industries as a whole and specifically in higher ed, we called out health care and financial services.
In the government business, listen, we're still in the very early days of state and local government. I think there's only 15 states at this point who have decided to do a full platform replacement, which leaves 35 or 36 states up for opportunity for us going forward. And we think we have a really good solution for that market. And on the federal side, listen, we're just starting.
We have FedRAMP moderate. We said we were excited to see our first customer civilian agency, do a full platform rollout on our FedRAMP Cloud. And we also said we were bringing in a new leader, right, a really seasoned leader to help us lead federal going forward. So this is an area we'll continue to lean into. We do see opportunity in federal even without having FedRAMP high on the cloud, we do have a lot of opportunity with the existing agencies, and we see that as a rich market for us going forward. Around the early renewal dynamic that you guys are seeing this year. Clearly, a solid benefit for Q2, 24 months description backlog, it sounds like there's also some benefit in the guide for Q3. Maybe just dimensionalize it and remind us like what's the customer activity? Is it an incentive that you're giving? Is it the macro? Like what's driving this? And like do we think about this as a future headwind? Do we think about this as an opportunity for code perming at upsell? Like what's the right way to think about this? Alex. Yes, I'll start and then let Carl chime in as well. As you point out, we're very pleased with the RPO growth on the 24-month side this quarter was 22.7% growth. But as we pointed out for all the reasons Karl and Doug mentioned, we saw about 1.5 points of that be early renewals coming into the quarter, which is a terrific opportunity for us to interact and interface with our customers, as well as upsell them as well. So we're very pleased with the outcome in Q2.
As we look to Q3, what we've done is taken a look at where our expectations are for Q3, which is included in that 21% increase as part of our guide. I'd say approximately 1 point of that as we look out to the next quarter right now is included in that 21%. So we believe that activity will continue. Again, we're thrilled with the activity. It means our customers are doubling down on us. They're leaning into that platform, and we couldn't be more pleased with that.
As you point out, obviously, we've been running ahead of subscription revenue for some time on RPO. So we would expect some variability related to subscription revenue in the future, but we welcome the early renewals, and we think it's a terrific opportunity for customers to continue to buy into the platform. Carl, I'll let you add to that. Yes. Thanks, Zane. Yes, Alex, we did have another really good quarter of selling back into our customer base. We talked about that earlier. And that is what drives a lot of the early renewals. But I want to make sure it's clear to everyone, we don't incent our teams to drive early renewals. We incent our teams to work with our customers to add additional SKUs as they look to consolidate more and more on top of the HCM or the financials platform. So the demand is being driven by our customers and then we go and we work with them in some cases, they add new SKUs. And when they do so, they actually do early renewal and they've co-term their agreements, which drives the uplift that Zane talked about in our 24-month RPO.
So we're not incenting people to do it. It's customer demand. They're looking to add more and more modules. And as we continue to innovate and bring new SKUs to market, we would expect this to continue going forward. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I wanted to sort of extend on Brad Sills earlier question about kind of the upsell motion. It seems like you guys are having a lot of success there. Carl, when I think back to your guys' time at VMware, VMware was a machine in terms of packaging and mechanisms for selling more solution into existing customers, and there's a huge kind of successful part of that business?
Are there sort of learnings or sort of mechanisms or improvements that you guys can make in that hub cell motion that you could bring on board that could turbocharge this upsell effort even further from what we've been seeing thus far? Yes, I'll take that, and thanks for the question, Keith. I hope you're well. Listen, the teams are doing really good already selling back into the customer base. I think it has to do with the motion that Doug and Patrick are driving with two different, if you will, sales forces, one selling only to customer base and the other selling net new. And because we have that focus on customer-based sales, I think the teams are driving these new SKUs back into our customers.
Specifically as it relates, can we do things differently. Potentially -- we are looking at different ways to price and package our products in the future to make it easier and more consumable for our customers and make it easier for our sales reps to sell -- but right now, we don't have any, if you will, new plays that we're running. I think the team is executing well. Our customers clearly see the value of the additional SKUs that we have in the market. and clearly see a total cost of ownership play by consolidating on top of our platform.
So I don't think you'll see any short-term change here, Keith. But we're always looking for ways to innovate on go-to-market and one of them would be through some type of pricing and packaging in the future. Keith, I would just add, we continue to obviously invest in this area. It's one of tremendous opportunity for us. and we spend a fair amount of time looking at it and thinking about what's the next best opportunity for the customer to recognize value and, of course, in turn for us to do the same. So it's an area that we continue to see good progress on. Excellent. It’s very helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Carl, earlier in the year, you unveiled a new partner referral program. Maybe too early to see the fruits of this new program, but curious if what you're seeing and ultimately what over the next six to nine months with this partner program? Yes, sure. Thanks, Brent. Good to hear from you. We did launch a new partner program. There's many facets to it. including technology arrangements and collaboration on the technology front, including co-sell, including resell. And also, we rolled out a referral program. And I will say we're seeing early signs of the customers really leaning into this new program. And they're also getting value because they're innovating on top of Workday, leveraging things like Extend to expand their market opportunity with us as well. So the resell program, that's Phase 2, but the co-sell and referral program has kicked off, and we're seeing a nice uplift in referrals from our partners on a global basis.
Another thing we did is we launched a partnership, if you recall, Brent, with AWS, and we're selling to the marketplace. And we have seen a number of opportunities in Q2 that were driven from that partnership with AWS as people are looking to burn down the credits they have with AWS today. So Overall, we're very excited about the partner program. We had a big partner conference just last month. We had over 3,000 people joining us at our Altitude conference where we spent more time articulating our new program. and sharing with them how they can both monetize the Workday platform to sell more services and innovative solutions and also help us drive net new outcomes and get paid for it. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Welcome aboard Zane, I'll direct this one to you. As you just alluded to, the gap between the 24-month backlog and the sub revs growth has historically been pretty narrow, but it's widened out a lot in recent quarters to 3 to 4 points. I'm just curious -- why is that? And over what time frame do you think that gap will close? Maybe it's partly due to the early renewals you mentioned, but maybe there are other factors. Thanks for unpacking that for us. Yes, of course, Karl, great to hear from you. As we mentioned, we're really pleased with the program we have behind that and the additional backlog and the performance we've seen on RPO has even exceeded our expectations over the last number of quarters. And it's driven by a number of variables. I think both Carl and Doug talked about the relationship with the customer, as well as our opportunity to expand those SKUs and that relevance with our customers. So we're pleased with the performance there.
Now some of the variability we talked about education and gov we tend to see longer duration with those contracts. So that will have a natural extension. And in many cases, especially if you look at the top line growth of backlog and RPO we see significant increases driven by that mix shift.
And then the other dynamic is, of course, the early renewal that we talked about, where it's another opportunity to engage with the customer to go deeper into the platform, as well as sell more of our SKUs. So it's -- as I pointed out in the third quarter, we feel like the second quarter was higher, at least our current expectations at the second quarter and the activity we saw there would be higher than what we see in the third quarter.
Part of it is also Doug's team and just where they spend their energy, and we've obviously leading up to a seasonally strong fourth quarter. So we like the motion. We encourage the motion. It's an opportunity for us to lean in and have a longer and more durable relationship with our customer base. And we believe you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But to your point, it may create a little bit of variability if you looked at backlog and the variance between backlog and subscription revenue. But we're solely focused on driving continued growth in the business and particularly focused on that subscription -- that long-term subscription revenue line. Hopefully, that helps. Yes, it does Zane. Thank you. Great. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks very much for taking my question. There's a lot of goodness in the results and the message. So I'll echo my welcome to Zane and congrats to you all. My question actually for you, Zane, is in your comments, you've said that Workday plans on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while expanding margins, which I think is music to everyone's ears. But can you expand on what that means to you? And if there's any sort of framework or even rule of thumb that we should consider in the years ahead? Thanks. Yes, it's good to hear from you. I'd say, generally, we're at a unique opportunity here at the company to do exactly that, which is to lean in and to make smart investments Carl has highlighted a number of those, whether it's partners, whether it's international defense product. We're at a point where I think this is an opportunity to really lean in on our TAM opportunity and that growth that we can see across the platform. So from the finance side, I think we benefit because we can make thoughtful investments and help the business grow both on the product side.
Obviously, we talk about AI ML and the tremendous opportunity we have there. But then also on the go-to-market side, when I look at that balance between 75% domestic and 25% international, I just think it's ripe with opportunity to grow on the international side, but do it in a thoughtful way, as Carl alluded to, on the EMEA side, with an uncertain backdrop, we've seen great opportunities there, and we've seen good growth there. So I'm just pleased when I look at the opportunity to be here to leverage the finance side and to lean in on where we make these investments -- and then we continue to see top line growth.
And as I just mentioned on the RPO side, we can see significant RPO growth, but along with that, we have investments in interesting areas that create longer-term revenue growth and subscription revenue growth as well around the globe. Carl, that you add a few. Yes. No, I think you said it well, Zane. We continue to invest on the go-to-market side, but I want to make sure everyone knows we're investing heavily on the product and technology front as well. And Neil's leading that charge with [Indiscernible] -- we continue to invest to drive innovation here at Workday, and we're leaning into the AI ML opportunity. which we think will bear fruit in the future.
The other thing to think about is how do we get operating leverage from AI and ML internally. We think by using these technologies, we can actually drive better operating margin, which allows us to reinvest in go-to-market and products in the future. So there is kind of a flywheel effect we can get from the benefit of AI and ML. Great, stuff. Thanks so much guys. Thank you. We have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Hey, great. Thanks, congrats from me as well on the results. You're getting a number of questions on the backlog metrics, but it's really the consistency of those metrics that continues to impress. You're guiding for low-20s growth again next quarter. So maybe you can expand on just what's helping sustain such a consistent growth profile in an inconsistent environment?
And then going back to the international side, there were some encouraging commentary around EMEA, but the growth rate there still lagging a bit. So just wondering if there are signs you're seeing that can help the growth rate there and maybe pick back up and take some of the load off of the U.S. strength you're seeing? Thanks. Sure. Yes, I'll start and then hand over to Carl. As we point out with backlog it's really that relationship with the customer and the diversity of the business and the contract lengths that have helped support that. And it's been Doug's team interacting, interfacing with those customers. and leaning in more on the platform. And that's what you see reflected in those RPO numbers. Our success that we've seen on the renewals has clearly helped our customers engage more, create more uplift as well as extend the duration of our relationship with them. So I think it's that compounding effect.
That you've seen over the last number of quarters. And again, I would highlight that not only do we lean in there, but we wouldn't always expect as we look out for the remainder of the year or even into next year, it's not that we're pushing the backlog. We're focused on subscription revenue and continued subscription revenue growth -- and the backlog just happens to be in that big RPO increase just happens to be a byproduct of the interaction and interface that we have with those customers in the long-term relationship that we've developed with them. Carl, that you maybe give a little bit more detail. I think you're asking specifically on the first question about how do we continue to do this. And I think it's just the strength of the platform we have. And I think with some headwinds in the market that everyone continues to face, people are looking to do more with less. And by doing so, they're looking for a total cost of ownership play. And I think we provide that both on the HCM side and the financials as people consolidate what I said earlier, from best-of-breed to best of suite. And it's also driving a different level of employee experience. We're helping drive productivity gains for our customers.
We're helping them upskill and rescale the folks. We're delivering a new level of employee experience. And by doing all of those, people just continue to put more and more on top of our platform. And even if it is our own SKU, they're leveraging things like extend to build other solutions on top of the Workday platform. So I think this motion of selling back into the base is going to continue as people consolidate more and more on top of us.
As it relates to the international growth, again, we're highlighting we saw really good performance out of our team in EMEA, specifically and we're encouraged by both the consistency and predictability of their performance and the strong pipeline that we're building over there as we head into the second-half of the year. Let me say, though, on the flip side, if I can, Michael, right? Our U.S. team just continues to drive really solid performance as well, and they're outperforming in a number of key areas like large enterprise and across some of those industries that we spoke about today.
Our education business, health care and financials. So we're aiming to keep driving, right, our U.S. business and watching them continue to perform and outperform and at the same time, try to drive international growth. And it's always important to remember, the international growth from bookings doesn't actually get shown in -- right in the same quarter, you'll see it in the out quarters as we look to continue to drive that growth. We'll see a slight shift over the coming years from 75-25 to something that we get more impact and more performance from the international teams. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Wonderful. Thank you guys, so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued strength and resilience in the business. I want to go back to talking about generative AI and your opportunity there. Clearly, a big opportunity to leverage the data you have and use it to make the product and platform better. But I want to talk about the opportunity to maybe utilize generative AI, both to accelerate migrations from legacy on-premise solutions in terms of making it easier for custom applications to migrate, as well as making it easier for that data to transform and maintain -- transfer and maintain data fidelity?
And maybe at the same time, even on your end, utilize generative AI to reduce the services attach rate and bring down that services mix a little bit over time. Any way you could help me kind of understand the way you can utilize it on that would be very helpful? Thank you so much. Yes. On the first part, we are definitely looking at generative AI to do a better job of data transfer and transformation from legacy systems. And I think over time, it will be increasingly automated with AI. So that's already in motion. On the second one, it's definitely something we're exploring and how we bring AI into our services organization to speed up implementations. Stay tuned on that part. We're very focused on the products that we deliver to our customers. And one thing to think about is actually how we build AI into the products to make them easier to implement. But that's a work in progress at this point. It's a great question. That is all the time we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments. Thank you, operator, and thank you for everyone joining today's call. And a special thanks to our workmates customers and partners around the globe that continue to fuel Workday's success. Q2 was another solid quarter, highlighted by the diversity and mission critical nature of our business. We have an exciting opportunity ahead, and we are all well positioned as we think about the second-half of the year and beyond.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Rising Conference and Financial Analyst Day in San Francisco. With that, I will hand the call back over to the operator to close today's call. And I hope everyone has a great evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call . on the call, we have aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President .",1.0

With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. I'm happy to report that we had a solid Q3 as we once again outperformed across our key operating metrics. There is no question that the macro environment presents increased uncertainty. But as we've said before, we are well-positioned in this type of environment because our cloud finance and HR solutions are truly mission-critical. As our Q3 results showed, more and more organizations are selecting Workday as their trusted partner to help them successfully navigate today's changing world.
We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity ahead and are pleased to announce our first ever share repurchase program and up to $500 million under authorization. This program will help reduce the rate of our share dilution going forward and is driven by our belief that our share price is undervalued given the long-term growth opportunity ahead. Barbara will share details shortly, but know that we feel confident that we reach a scale where we can roll-out this repurchase program, while continuing to prioritize investing for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'd like to share some highlights from the quarter. In Q3, we further solidified our position as a leader in Cloud HR with notable new HCM customers, including Intermountain Health, SGS and Texas Roadhouse. In addition, we had several key HCM go-lives, including Best Buy, Canadian Tire Corporation and the State of Oklahoma.
For Workday Financial Management, we continue to see strong demand and momentum in Q3. Key new wins included a Fortune 200 provider of information technology solutions, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, EZCorp and Thomas Jefferson University. It's important to note that each of these customers have also selected us for HCM, reinforcing the power of the full Workday platform providing further evidence that companies are going all in with us.
Key financial management go-lives during the quarter included City of Baltimore and Medical University of South Carolina. Q3 also saw us get back in person for Workday Rising, our annual customer conference for the first time since 2019. We had nearly 16,000 in-person and virtual attendees and it was great to experience the energy and see firsthand our community is growing and evolving. This was highlighted by the fact that this year's event has a large percentage of senior leaders, finance and IT attendees ever.
One big takeaway from Rising is that our innovation story is resonating with customers as we evolve to be more open and connected. While we've traditionally targeted the offices as CHRO and CFO, we have placed increased focus recently on the office of the CIO, which presents another growth opportunity for us.
One solution in particular, that was a popular topic among IT attendees was where to Workday Extend. Workday Extend lets customers and partners build their own unique solutions on top of Workday, which is a huge point of emphasis for CIOs and in their eyes, positions us even more as a true platform player.
While we announced several availability at Workday Extend in 2020 we've continued to see accelerated demand for it over the last year as the need for organizations to quickly innovate and adapt in today's business environment increases. We also announced new more personalized UX enhancements that meet every type of work they use and the natural flow of their work such as mobile devices, Microsoft Teams and Slack, which helps us to address another CIO priority as they are more focused than ever on driving increased employee engagement.
And finally, we further reinforced our leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning with the announcement of next-generation skills technology that allows customers to more easily and securely bring skills data in and out of Workday. This helps customers leverage the full power of machine learning to gain deeper insights into their workforce skills and deliver more personalized employee experiences.
In closing, we once again delivered a solid quarter with strength across a number of key growth initiatives, showcasing why Workday is the backbone of digital business. And while we expect that the macro uncertainty will cause our growth to moderate in the near-term, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to navigate this environment and emerge even stronger.
Driving constant innovation to address our customers' evolving needs has always been key to our success and will continue to be our focus in this environment.
With that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Chano, over to you. Thank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to start off by offering my sincere thanks to the more than 17,500 workmates that help us deliver another solid quarter. Your relentless focus on the customer continues to push us and the broader Workday community forward. Great job, team. I've been on the road a lot the last few months, including Workday Rising in Europe, which has wrapped up in Stockholm and Workday Rising in US back in September. I've had the opportunity to spend time with hundreds of customers and prospects, and there are a couple of key themes emerging.
First, despite all the challenges that companies are facing today, they increasingly realize the present need to modernize their HR and financial systems. The executives that I speak with have different viewpoints on what the macroeconomic climate will look like in the year ahead. But one thing they agree on is that the change is constant and it's nearly impossible to navigate with legacy systems.
Second, there is a clear desire to consolidate and prioritize spend across a new organization's more strategic technology vendors. Given our positioning as the backbone of digital business across HR and finance, this trend has led to more and more companies going all in with Workday as they look to harness the power of their data across the enterprise.
And when I look at our solid Q3 results across both the large and medium enterprise is a direct validation of these themes being seen across organizations of all sizes. From a geographic standpoint, we saw solid results across North America, with a number of CoreHR and FINS wins that Aneel mentioned, in addition to several strategic expansions across the Fortune 500. APA also outperformed with wins at Bank of Queensland, Fletcher Building, Ono Pharmaceutical and Trip.com, to name a few. And in EMEA, we had a number of important wins and expansions, including SGS, Alliance Medical Group and Equiniti.
Our customer base sales team once again saw outstanding growth, a direct reflection of the trust that customers are placing in us and a validation of our strategy. We drove very strong renewal rates in Q3, and we closed a number of strategic expansions at companies such as Accenture, University of Maryland, the state of Nebraska, Pick n Pay, Puma and VF Corporation.
As we shared at our recent Analyst Day, our customer base momentum is being driven by our broad portfolio. Solutions such as journeys, help and talent optimization, for example, are seeing strong adoption as customers look to support employee experience. While our scheduling, time tracking and payroll solutions are all resonating as customers increasingly focused on labor optimization and other products such as Planning, Extend, Accounting Center, VNDLY and our Spend Management solutions are all contributed to this quarter's strength across the customer base.
Our industry focus continues to pay off. In Q3, nowhere was this more evident than the health care vertical where we had a strong growth in new ACV and where we surpassed $0.5 billion in annual recurring revenue. By far, the two largest costs for health care organizations are labor and materials. And by leveraging our full suite of HCM, FINS and supply chain solutions, they are able to help optimize spend across these critical areas.
In fact, all of our larger Q3 health care wins were full suite, and including Workday's supply chain management. We also saw healthy momentum within the professional services industry, highlighted by the aforementioned expansion at Accenture, as we continue to co-innovate across the quality platform, including significant new developments in the skills cloud, public cloud and accessibility.
Other strategic wins in the professional services industry included KNOWSCIENCE [ph] and REIT Global [ph], which was a full suite win. Our expanding partner ecosystem is also becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth.
Key to our strategy is driving core innovation across the platform, which increases the differentiation of our solutions, enables even faster innovation to address real-time customer challenges and allows our partners to leverage their deep industry and solution insights to differentiate in the market.
Examples of recent partner-driven innovation built on the Workday platform include Accenture's digital revenue operations solution, which integrates CPQ capabilities with Workday's billing and revenue automation, to enable seamless quote-to-cash functionality for software and technology companies.
Another great example is employee document management, built by partner Kainos on Workday Extend, which provides our customers with advanced document generation, access control storage and finally, tuned document retention rules. These are just a few several solutions that were recently released by our partner ecosystem, and we have those and more on the road map.
As we move into our fourth quarter, the environment remains uncertain, which has led to increased scrutiny and the lengthening of certain sales cycles, particularly with the net new opportunities. While we aren’t immune to these and see signs that it will persist into next year, we are confident in our diverse pipeline and are focused on executing in Q4 and laying a strong foundation for FY 2024 and beyond.
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara. Thanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered solid Q3 results in the face of continued economic uncertainty, a testament to strong execution across the company, as well as the strategic and mission-critical nature of our solutions.
Subscription revenue in Q3 was $1.43 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $167 million, up 7%. Total revenue outside of the US was $394 million, representing 25% of total revenue.
24-month backlog at the end of the third quarter was $8.62 billion, growth of 21%. The result was driven by solid new business sales and strong renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q3 was $14.10 billion, up 28%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $314 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.7%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue outperformance, favorable cost variances across the business and the timing of certain expenses shifting into Q4.
Q3 operating cash flow was $409 million, growth of 6%. Our cash flow this quarter was impacted by a $55 million semiannual interest payment associated with our Q1 debt offering. We also paid off the principal balance on our $1.15 billion convertible debt with cash in October, resulting in a reduction to our non-GAAP diluted share count of roughly 8 million shares. Given the late Q3 timing, this share count reduction will be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count in Q4.
During the quarter, we successfully added approximately 600 net new employees, ending Q3 with a global workforce of more than 17,500. We expect a strong moderation of hiring as we move into Q4, but we'll continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology. Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide performance in Q3, and we're focused on executing in Q4, our seasonally strongest quarter of the year.
Now, turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business, while also balancing an uncertain macro environment. With that context, our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue is now $5.555 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4 subscription revenue to be $1.483 billion to $1.485 billion, 21% year-over-year growth.
We now expect professional services revenue to be $645 million in FY '23, with the slight reduction driven by the delay of a large project. For Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $147 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q4. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17.5%, which includes some expenses that shifted out of Q3. Our FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now 19.2%.
GAAP operating margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 23 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. This includes a change to our employee stock plan that will take effect in Q4 to provide more flexibility to our employees during the open trading window each quarter. Our vesting date will move from the 15th to the 5th of each month for all outstanding grants, resulting in an acceleration of stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million in Q4. This change will result in reduced stock-based compensation expense by the same amount over the next few years and has no impact on our dilution.
The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We are maintaining our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flow of $1.64 billion, but are reducing our capital expenditures outlook to approximately $375 million, reflecting the timing of certain data center and real estate investments being pushed out to future periods. And as Aneel mentioned, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase program with authority to repurchase up to $500 million in shares over an 18-month period.
We will continue to prioritize allocating capital towards organic innovation, followed by targeted M&A, but given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we intend to use a portion of our capital towards the repurchase of shares, enabling us to partially offset future dilution from employee stock programs. This repurchase program is a direct reflection of our confidence in the business and our view that our shares are currently undervalued.
While we are early in our planning cycle for next year and have an important Q4 ahead, we'd like to provide a preliminary view of FY 2024. As discussed at our Financial Analyst Day, we have a significant long-term opportunity and multiple growth levers that drive our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.
While this remains our multiyear goal, given the continued macro uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to provide a preliminary FY 2024 subscription revenue range of approximately $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion or 17% to 19% year-over-year growth. This outlook takes into account the lengthening of sales cycles that we're currently seeing impact our net new business.
From a margin standpoint, we currently expect FY 2024 non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 150 to 200 basis points from FY 2023 levels, placing us firmly on track to our target of 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue.
The expected margin expansion is driven by the scalability of our model, a strong moderation of hiring, and ongoing expense discipline. We plan to operate the business with agility, and we'll continue to appropriately balance growth investments based on what we see in the underlying market environment.
And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers, and partners for their continued support and hard work.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thank you so much and fabulous, fabulous quarter given the macroeconomic conditions. I was wondering if you could give us some perspective. In some sense, this is a recession that everybody has been expecting, nobody's going to be surprised. I was wondering if you could offer some insights into how Workday has been able to execute so well during a tough time and other software companies are facing headwinds.
And to the extent we get some relief next year, if the economy does improve, could you do even better considering that your results are actually quite impressive? Thank you so much. Well, I don't think we'll comment next year just quite yet, Kash, but thank you for the kind comments. I think the value proposition of our products works in a downturn just as it does in a good market just like we did in 2008, 2009 and every other downturn. Chano, do you want to add anything? No, I think I agree with what you said, Aneel. I believe the mission-critical applications of our solutions really resonates with our customers as they are modernized in their HR and finance solution. And as I said in my comments as well, Kash, there is a consolidation of spend across strategic vendors, and we clearly are being one of those these days. Thank you so much. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Thanks very much and I'll echo the congrats on a really nice quarter in a tough environment. I guess, Chano, you talked about some deal cycles extending. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing at the top of the funnel. Obviously, you guys sort of came out perhaps of the COVID recession a little bit later than some others. I think there's a fear out there that once we get through this current wave of deals in your pipeline that there might be some sort of cliff in terms of net new billings. But it sounds like you guys feel pretty good about your pipeline. So I was wondering if you could just sort of expand on that? Thanks. Thank you for your question, Kirk. Overall, companies continue to prioritize HCM and financials transformations, and we see ongoing momentum in important growth areas like our customer base team. What is a clear market trend, as I said, towards consolidation of vendors and as well the medium enterprise. There's good pipeline momentum, but maybe, Doug, you can add some color in terms of pipeline and deal dynamics overall? Yes. I think well, you captured two of it, which is I described, Kirk, as -- we've got a diversity of revenue streams. So as Chano mentioned, medium enterprise performed well. We’ve got the customer base motion. And that was a theme that I certainly heard at our customer conference is our large customers wanting to consolidate rationalize number of suppliers and expand their footprint with us. So I think that certainly helps.
In terms of like top of the funnel sort of the core of your question, it's really interesting in that our Q3 pipeline build, so the pipe we're building now, which is largely about next year, met our internal targets. So we're seeing project formation. At the same time, we're seeing some projects elongate. So I think Chano mentioned this, but they tend to be large enterprise net new. Those projects have extra steps to complete. At the same time, at the top end, the starting of projects is meeting the goals that we've established internally. Thank you all. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Thank you very much and I'll add my congrats. I'm interested in whether it's possible that the volatility of this type of environment where you have so many vectors moving around inflation, interest rates, FX, supply chain issues. Is it possible that it's coming together in a way that really elevates the Workday value prop with integrated planning, cloud-based, maybe more so than in the smooth sailing environment that we had in the last decade, because as Kash mentioned, you're navigating your way through this very well. I'm just wondering if you see any effect of that. Maybe it's increasing some of your win rates and maybe it builds up a little pent-up demand for some time in the future when the environment starts to improve? Well, I guess, I'd start with I wish that was the case across the Board. We definitely see some -- you see in a downturn, you see some movement to -- well, I got to get on the right stuff to help me manage through these volatile environments. At the same time, there are other customers that are just cautious in making new decisions. And so I think they tend to balance each other out.
I'm not sure there's a -- I'm not sure it's a big boost for us or a big negative for us. We're all seeing the same environment. But there are definitely customers who are behind on making the transition. I feel like this is a catalyst to make that transition. And then there are others who already made the transition that maybe think, 'Hey, let's be cautious on follow-on purchases. Chano, anything to add? Nothing to add. Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. This is Josh Baer on for Keith. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the macro assumptions that are embedded in that FY 2024 subscription revenue guidance range. Just wondering what areas get worse? What stays the same when thinking about different geographies as well as new business from new logos or expansion and renewals from existing customers? Thanks. Hi, Josh, thanks for your question. So the guidance range that we provided is our best view at this time. It takes into account the continued momentum across important growth areas such as customer base, medium enterprise, but also balancing that with lengthening sales cycles that we're seeing impact our business, particularly our net new opportunities. So given the uncertain environment, we provided an estimated subscription revenue range with that low-end of the range, assuming a larger impact to sales cycles than we're currently seeing today. That’s really helpful. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Operator, can we go to the next question please. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll extend my congratulations not only on the quarter, but on the prescriptiveness of the guide, both on top and bottom line in what is clearly a very uncertain and tenuous environment. So I guess maybe just the first one, if we look at the patterns emerging in the sales cycles in the business, I guess, Aneel or Chano, can you guys compare and contrast this with -- from a pipeline perspective going into 4Q, what are you expecting the impact to be in your biggest quarter on bookings on new ACV growth on -- and maybe FINS versus HCM specifically where you feel a little bit better or compare and contrast that, I think would be super helpful. Well, let me just offer a high-level commentary. I spent a lot of time with other CEOs and this is not 2008, 2009. No one sees the world coming to an end like they did at that time. I think right now, we're in a world of caution, where no one's quite sure what's going to happen, but things don't feel really bad. And so -- but caution and stopping can sometimes look the same. And so it's kind of hard to predict right now. Every CEO I talked to is still relatively feeling positive about their business, but worried about the economic underpinnings of what the Fed is doing and the potential recession. And so, I think, the word that I keep coming back to is everybody is cautious. And I don't know how that -- Chano, how do you think that reflects in the pipeline in Q4 and other quarters, but it's -- this is not an end-of-the-world scenario, not at least yet, like 2008, 2009. Yes. Thank you, Alex, for your question. I would say, first, when it comes to HCM or FINS, we don't see any significant difference between one or the other. So they're proportionally impacted given the macro environment. When it comes to Q4, I would say we had the pipeline to execute on the quarter. Of course, that usually will not manifest as a prioritization because those projects have been already prioritized, but it may happen some lengthening of sales cycles as we said before, particularly on net new deals and opportunities that they're more scrutinized on those, right? And Doug already commented on the growth pipeline for next year. Perfect. And then, I guess, if I think about what you're saying around net new and how well I think you're doing on renewals and selling into the base specifically, is it fair to assume that in the near term, there could be a bit more bookings concentration coming from existing customers? And kind of how well -- how important is that dynamic that informs some of your margin commentary for next year, given it should be a little bit easier, it should be a little bit more predictable to sell into the base? Yes, Alex, it is fair to assume that there will be more concentration on the customer base and areas like medium enterprise, as we said before. And then hence, we'll put more focus on both marketing environments and sales go-to-market environment into those areas, of course, that will potentially provide higher yield on these times. Perfect. Congrats, guys. Thanks, again. Our next question is from DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thanks guys. Maybe building off Alex's last question there. I mean there's lots of interesting partner commentary in the script. I'm curious about the level of collaboration you have with partners on what they're working on with Extend or an industry accelerators. And assuming you have visibility there, maybe you could talk a bit about like where you draw the line on what Workday might own or build directly versus what you let go to partners? Pete, do you want to talk about the product side first? And then Chano can talk about the partner side. Sure. Thanks again for that question. As you heard us talk about the momentum with Extend that we've seen recently has been great. We talked about that a lot, both in Stockholm and in Orlando at our user conferences this year, now over 750 applications in production. When it comes to where that momentum is coming from, it is customers and it is partners as well.
Partners are beginning to build on the Extend platform and Extend Workday applications as well as build net new applications that connect with HCM and financials. So far, the -- our customers have been getting value through both of those. The question of where do we draw the line between what is ours and what is our partners, I'll hand over to Chano. Yes, I think, as we commented on some of my prepared remarks, I mean clearly driving co-innovation with our partners across the platform is very critically important. You would say, where you draw the line when something is kind of would define or I would define the last mile in a particular industry or we need some more content-driven specific understanding of that value-add in that industry with a partner, there's where we see an opportunity to collaborate with our partners.
I mentioned some of these solutions that we're building with -- for different industries, like the revenue operation solution, again, that is very critical to the software and technology companies. There are others that would be a bit more, let's say, across industries like the document management -- employee document management that I provided on.
But honestly, we don't see that as a core, let's say, value add from us in terms of building that solution. But of course, it's adding value to our customers there and partners take just advantage of the maturity of Extend to bring that value add that is resonating with our customers. So, we're really pleased, as you can imagine, that customer partners can differentiate and bring additional offering to our customers. Yes, makes sense. And then, Barbara, maybe I could sneak in a follow-up for you. The buyback is great to see us analysts always ask for more. Why not be more aggressive given where the stock is, the strength of the balance sheet, expected cash generation next year? Like what were the considerations there? I'll answer that one because I think Barbara probably wanted to do more. You just don't know what you're going into a tough economic environment and cash is king. And so we wanted to be conservative. And if we come out in a good market environment in the next six to nine months, you definitely could see more, but there's just a balance of risk. Yes, perfect. Okay. Thank you guys. Congrats. Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thank you. Congrats from me as well. Chano, the one thing that we're seeing in the industry at the moment is that there seems to be more money in HR post-pandemic with a great reshuffle, et cetera. Could that -- are you seeing that in terms of like interest of pockets over customers are? And do you think that's kind of more a short-term thing and we're at the back part of that trend, or do you think HR HCM strategically is having a new position in the enterprise? Thank you. Thank you, Raimo for your question. I think both of them to be ones has some good tailwind out of the pandemic. But clearly, of course, that nets out of balance out with the macro environment we are living into. But I would say that now the financial transformations we see those in the market, and they are taking place as we speak.
As a dynamic of companies having a tough time to just navigate through their finance modernization or honestly doing simple things like closing their books online in terms of many legacy platforms and in terms of a lot of manual processes that could just not happen once you were not in the office.
Clearly, employee engagement as a whole in HCM, the skills area, all the machine learning and AI that we're bringing to those processes are obviously value-add to the companies to see and want to take advantage of and continue to be a great tailwind for the HCM value proposition as a whole. Yes. And then one follow-up is if you think about selling in this kind of slightly more tougher environment, can you talk a little bit maybe about the steps you're taking in terms of sales execution to kind of make sure you continue to deliver in this market.
I'm thinking about higher pipeline coverage kind of making sure you kind of -- you time the deals better, et cetera. Like where are we on that journey of implementing these kind of recession handbook kind of selling kind of policies that we used to take out in the older days? Yeah. Doug, do you want to add some color there on the sales strategy in the market? Yeah, sure. I think Aneel or you, Chano, might have mentioned it after Q1, but we pivoted to our ROI-based and TCO-based way to engage with customers right at Q1. Of course, we've always done business cases with our customers. But entering a tougher environments, it comes down to TCO, hard dollars that you can take out, system rationalization productivity. So I think it's showing up really focusing with our customers on the HR side. So there's no doubt, tight labor markets. And so that's driving, I think, the TCO on that side of it.
And it was touched on earlier by Aneel. We had a really good Q3 as it relates to financials. So FINS plus performed well. And those are ROI-driven as well. And those are companies looking for sure, it might start with an aging -- retiring older systems, but it pivots pretty quickly when they engage with us to that plan, execute, analyze and offering up more business agility in an uncertain environment. So those are the things from a go-to-market, from a field deployed resources standpoint that we're spending a lot of time with customers on the business case. Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around backlog for next year. I think, Chano, you made some comments that you feel good about Q4 pipelines heading into Q4. And the question on everyone's mind is really what about next year. There's a lot of moving parts. In your conversations with office of CFO, office of HR, what are they saying with regard to budgets for next year? Do you feel pretty confident that you can sustain this kind of growth into next year as well? Well, Brad, thank you for your question. Right now, we're exactly on those discussions, right, where companies are going through their planning and budgeting cycles, and it is a question of prioritization of projects. And we're having those discussions that, that was commenting on that are really TCO and ROI-based, right? So clearly, here where you see some different scenarios on our guidance, particularly depending on what happens on some of the new local sales cycles that might put some lengthening.
And clearly, even though they might be building right now, maybe fall outside of next year or some of them that just may be pushing forward. But right now, we're having most of those discussions. Overall, we feel good given the momentum we have and given the momentum on the new pipeline build and the conversations we're engaging with the strength of our customer base, our medium enterprise and the diversity of our business, as Doug has commented. But clearly, we are cautiously monitoring what's going on in the environment. Thanks, Chano. And then one more, if I may, please. Just on the verticals. You called out some strength in financials, healthcare. Is there a case to be made that perhaps you guys have more exposure to more resilient verticals with those in particular public sector education kind of less affected by perhaps the macro? We're pretty diversified across all the industries and some have held up better than others. When I look at what's happening in Silicon Valley, we definitely have a bunch of tech companies, but we're not exposed to tech the way maybe a newer company might be where they got a huge amount of exposure to just tech companies. So, -- and our tech companies tend to be the mature large company. So, I don't think there's any particular sector that's held us up. I would say financial services is strong, though. The one beneficiary of rising interest rates is the financial services sector and they continue to grow, and we have a very strong presence there. Thanks Aneel. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Aneel, just to follow-up on the verticals. A number of the partners have been talking about strength in state and local government and higher ed. I'm curious if you could drill in on those two, give us a sense of what you're seeing right now in both those sectors. I may turn that one over to Doug to talk about. Doug, are you there? Yes, sorry about that. I was on mute. The question was around education, government. Is that correct? State and local and higher ed. Yes. So both performed well in the quarter. We had a number of students or student deals, which for a while there, we were doing a number of financials, HCM on the higher ed side, but we took down some student deals in the quarter and showed really nice growth in Q3. And so we feel good about both of those verticals right now. Barbara, can I just follow-up real quick on international? It was the lowest growth in five quarters. Is there anything to point out in Europe versus the US, kind of, just the classic still over what we've been hearing, or is there anything specific on an execution? Can you just compare and contrast what you're seeing? I would say, clearly, the environment is more uncertain in Europe. Obviously, on top of everything else going on in the world, we have energy as a big challenge. And where we see, let's say, an increase signs of deals and sell cycles lengthening that things to happen in Europe. And I would say, in general, we are more cautious overall what's going there in the near relative terms than in other markets and other segments. Great. Thanks. We have time for one final question from Scott Berg with Needham. Please proceed with your question. Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and I guess this one will be relatively straightforward as you all called out slowness in the enterprise segment, a couple of different times. We talked about the mid-market being, I guess, relatively untouched. Can you help us kind of understand maybe what's going on in the mid-market to not really see any weakness today? I think that's an interesting kind of a change, at least relative to what we're seeing out there.
And then as we think about the guidance within the mid-market, is the slowness or maybe additional macro uncertainty that's impacting the low end of the guidance, do you have some sort of conservatism baked into any potential slowdown in the mid-market also impacting that guidance? Thank you. Yes, I guess we've not said that the mid-market is not impacted. What we said is that, of course, we had overall more strength in the medium enterprise and in the customer base. If you look at what it tends to happen more scrutiny around either the business case or additional approvals. Clearly, those are on the larger deals and larger companies that we usually -- we tend to see it more.
Our value proposition is strong and resonates and quicker time to value fixed cost of implementations, very predictive ones across HCM and finance in the mid-market, brings good ROI, brings good total cost of ownership in terms of the financials and main transformation as a whole, and that is a value proposition that mid-market is taking the same on a faster clip as they are modernizing and they're assisting on their platforms. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This will conclude Workday's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thank you again for joining us.","we will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call .

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Aneel Bhusri, our Executive Chair; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.
Our first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on April 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl. Thank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered a solid Q4, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. These results were driven by momentum across the business and capped off a year of strong execution by our nearly 19,000 Workmates across the globe. Over the course of the last year, we've made key investments across our leadership team, go-to-market, and partner ecosystem and our platform, positioning us to drive enduring growth in FY '25 and beyond.
I couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished over the last year, particularly in an environment where deal scrutiny remains high. I'd like to thank our customers, partners, and especially my fellow Workmates for making these results possible. My belief in the opportunity ahead for Workday and our value proposition has only gotten stronger in the 14 months since I've joined. With the emergence of AI, shifting talent landscape and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, leaders are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to manage their most critical assets, their people and their money.
Customers have come to trust us with helping them navigate these huge transformations from the cloud to AI. In fact, the theme of building trust took center stage at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos last month. Throughout my conversations, it was clear to me that leaders see the business benefits of implementing AI, but they also recognize building trust is key. Workday stands apart in our commitment to the responsible development of AI technologies, its responsible deployment within our own company and our advocacy for its regulation. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade, building AI into the core of our platform, and we're making significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area.
Workday Skills Cloud, for example, uses AI to gain insights into an organization's current skills and identifies skills needed for the future, allowing for smarter decisions about talent across the company. In our upcoming R1 release, many of the generative AI use cases we showcased at Rising will be put into the hands of early adopters, including job descriptions and knowledge articles. To further accelerate our AI road map, today, we're excited to announce our planned acquisition of HiredScore, which provides AI-powered talent orchestration solutions. HiredScore's technology delivers data-driven insights to help improve recruiting and internal mobility processes.
The combination of our data set in Workday Skills Cloud with HiredScore's solution will provide customers with a transparent AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Not only is it technology compelling but HiredScore and Workday share a commitment to responsible AI development, including a focus on explainability and transparency. We are absolutely thrilled about the potential of what we can do together.
Now let's move into the performance from the quarter, which reflects the diversity and durability of Workday's business. As we shared at our Financial Analyst Day, our net new business is driven by a balanced mix of new customer wins and expansions within our installed base, which speaks to the significant opportunity that we have ahead. From a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like Australian Stock Exchange, Boyd Gaming Corporation, HHS, Randstad, UHS of Delaware and VXI Global Solutions as full platform HCM and Financials customers. And new HCM customers this quarter included Crane Company, El Corte Inglés, Hitachi Astemo, Hungry Jacks, Polar Co, and Swisscom.
Alongside healthy net new customer activity, our customer base team again delivered in Q4. We had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including BJ's, Goodyear, and Greystar Global Enterprise. And we had a number of core Financial Management expansions across our HCM customer base, including Ally Financial, Huntington Bank, Intermountain Health, and Stewart Title Guaranty. Our create and motion also had another great quarter and is becoming an important driver of our customer-based sales team's growth.
From a solutions perspective, we saw healthy uptake across our portfolio, including Extend, where new ACV doubled year-over-year in Q4. We now have more than 850 Extend customers, and I'm pleased to share that roughly 1/3 of our Extend new ACV signed in Q4 was from our new professional SKU which includes AI Gateway as well as Workday Developer Copilot launching later this year. Beyond the wins we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform and I'm pleased to share that in FY '24, over 95% of our deployments went live on time. In Q4, we had several strategic HCM deployments, including AT&T, Northern Trust, and Whataburger, alongside notable Financial Management go-lives, including American University, Sagility Operations, and UMass Memorial Healthcare.
To propel our land and expand business, we continue to invest in several growth areas, I'll share a few highlights from those areas now, starting with international. Today, international represents over half of our addressable opportunity yet is 1/4 of our revenues. We're working to change that and we're seeing early signs of progress. In EMEA, our leadership additions continue to drive improved and more consistent results. I spent a couple of weeks visiting our teams in Europe this past quarter, and I have to tell you, I am fired up by the momentum we're building.
In Q4, our teams once again delivered healthy new ACV growth across key markets such as the U.K., Spain, and France. We also closed our first deal in EMEA with our Alight co-sell partnership, and we continue to build pipeline with important partnerships alongside ADP and Alight in addition to our broader referral and co-sell ecosystem. In the Asia Pacific region, Australia delivered once again, and I'm pleased to share that Japan, which is a key investment priority, drove strong new ACV growth in Q4. While it's still early days for us in this market, we're focused on growing it. To help lead the way, I'm delighted to welcome Chikara Furuichi as our new leader of the Japanese market to help us win in one of the world's largest economies. Chikara brings over 25 years of experience in both SaaS security and cloud services from across Japan and APAC. He reports directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales.
Moving to financials. We're seeing continued proof that our go-to-market and platform investments are paying off, with healthy growth in core financials customers and new ACV and a robust pipeline looking forward. We drove a record number of new full platform wins in both Q4 and FY '24, and our industry approach is a clear driver of this momentum. Health care, for example, again grew new ACV over 50% in Q4, capping off a fantastic FY '24. Our innovation in key areas such as supply chain is differentiating us in the market and is driving industry awards such as the recent recognition in best-of-class in enterprise resource planning for the seventh year in a row.
We're also pleased to share that Gartner named Workday a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software for the second time since the category's inception last year. Our education and government teams also drove continued success in FY '24, and higher ed was a standout in Q4 with a number of full platform wins, including Oregon State University, Portland Community College and the College of William and Mary.
And to help accelerate our trajectory in the U.S. Federal business, I'm delighted to welcome Lynn Martin as our new federal leader. Lynn has more than 30 years' experience in the public sector, most recently running Google's U.S. federal business and before that, running VMware's public sector team for close to a decade. Supporting our progress around many of these investment areas is our partner ecosystem where our focus is delivering customer outcomes, growing our business through referrals, and co-selling and building differentiated solutions.
During Q4, we announced a strategic partnership with Insperity that delivers on all 3 of these priorities. Through this partnership, Workday will become the platform powering Insperity's PEO service for SMB organizations, effectively opening up a new market opportunity for us. It's a terrific example of how we're innovating our go-to-market strategy to drive growth. Another great example is the Spark and Grow offering, which we launched with Kainos. It helps our emerging and medium enterprise customers to go live on Workday in less than 4 weeks. We've seen incredible demand for this offering and we're just getting started.
These are 2 great examples of momentum that is building across our ecosystem, which I'm pleased to share now includes more than 200 partners that have been onboarded to refer new sales leads and co-sell with us. We launched this pilot program last May and we've seen momentum building throughout the year with a nice uptick in Q4 partner-driven pipeline generation.
In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's strong execution throughout FY '24, all while navigating a dynamic environment and embracing important changes we've rolled out across the business. We enter FY '25 with a strong foundation and a clear strategy to support durable growth while at the same time continuing to drive efficiencies across the business. As I said on my first Workday earnings call 1 year ago, we have the opportunity to be one of the largest, most enduring and profitable software businesses of our time. I've never been more convinced in that belief.
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Aneel, who recently moved into a new role as Executive Chair. Aneel, it has been an incredible 14 months, and I'm truly grateful for your partnership and the trust you put in me to lead what you and Dave started nearly 19 years ago. Your technology vision and your commitment to work a special culture and values have put this company in an incredible position. I am excited for what we'll achieve together next. Thank you for continuing to be in my corner not just in guiding the applications and platform development but also as a friend. Aneel, over to you. Thank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As Carl highlighted, we are continuing to see solid momentum across the business, fueled in large part by our ability to deliver the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's fast-paced and dynamic environment. There is no doubt that more and more organizations, spanning midsize to large enterprises, are seeing the increasing value in building their businesses upon the Workday platform with AI at its core.
Earlier this month, we officially named Carl sole CEO of Workday while I assumed the role of Executive Chair. As I've said before, there is no better person than Carl to lead Workday through this next chapter of growth. He has already made a tremendous impact on the business from day 1. And thanks to his leadership, we are already successfully executing on several key growth initiatives and strategies that he put in place. Furthermore, and most importantly, Carl perfectly aligns with our values-driven approach, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us with him at the helm.
As Executive Chair, I'll remain actively involved but with an emphasis on my true passion as a technologist. Together with our Co-President, Sayan Chakraborty and the rest of our amazing product and technology organization, I will focus on guiding the future direction of Workday's applications and technology platform while staying close to our Workmates and our customers.
How we evolve and expand the Workday platform in the coming years will be critical to our continued growth and scale. To help us do that, we have identified several core elements of our innovation strategy that we plan on building out over the next 12 to 18 months. The first is a continued focus on evolving our Financial Management and HCM applications so that we can further empower the offices of finance and HR to optimize their 2 most important assets, their people and their money.
Next is AI. Fueled by our 10-year head start and unique approach to building AI directly into the core, we will continue to responsibly deliver new ML models that solve real business problems for our customers and enable their employees. We'll also incorporate high-value generative AI capabilities to enhance search, understand historical context, make recommendations and create content. Additionally, I'm incredibly excited about bringing HiredScore into the fold and how we'll further strengthen our overall AI capabilities.
Third is industry, with an emphasis on deepening our offerings in retail and hospitality, education and government along with financial services, health care, professional services and tech and media. Extensibility is another important focus area so that we can enable IT teams to build and maintain integrations between Workday and third-party systems, ultimately extending the value of our platform. Our new Extend AI Gateway, which we announced at Rising last year, is a perfect example of the type of work we are focused on here.
Fifth is experiences. Delivering persona-tailored experiences empowers high-performing employees and teams for maximum productivity. Manager Insights Hub and Flex Teams, which we also unveiled at Rising, are just a few of the ways we've already been delivering enhanced experiences for managers. The final area of investment is security and resiliency, which is foundational to everything we do. With more than 10,000 organizations depending on Workday to help run their businesses, it's essential that we design to protect the resilience and performance of critical processes, safeguard against the growing number of global cyber security threats, and increase our investment in public cloud offerings to drive greater performance, scalability and security for our customers.
We're also investing in our long-term innovation strategy by continuing to strengthen our product and technology leadership team. I'm pleased to share that David Summers has been appointed as our new Chief Product Officer and will lead development across our full suite of products. David, who will continue to report into Sayan, has been instrumental in leading our HR product strategy and development in the last few years, and I'm excited that he will be helping to lead our efforts to build out the capabilities of Workday's full product portfolio.
As I think back to our early days, it's incredible to see the growth and scale we've been able to achieve. When our customers first went live in 2007, we offered a few different products. Today, we offer a full platform that helps our customers transform how they manage their people and their money. Additionally, we now have more than 5,400 core HCM and Finance customers, more than 65 million users under contract and process over 800 billion transactions per year. I'm proud of the company we've built and the continued value and impact that we deliver for our customers.
In closing, I want to extend my deepest thanks to our nearly 19,000 Workmates around the world for finishing our fiscal year 2024 in such a strong fashion. Workday's future is incredibly bright, and I'm energized to work alongside them, Carl and the rest of our leadership team to help drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane. Over to you, Zane. Thanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q4 marked a solid close to FY '24 with momentum building across our key investment initiatives. We enter FY '25 well positioned to deliver another year of durable subscription revenue growth, coupled with expanding margins.
Turning to results. Subscription revenue in Q4 was $1.76 billion, up 18%, and full year FY '24 subscription revenue was $6.6 billion, growing 19%. Professional services revenue was $162 million in the quarter and $656 million for the year. Total revenue in Q4 was $1.92 billion and for the full year was $7.26 billion, both growing 17%. U.S. revenue in Q4 totaled $1.44 billion, up 16%, and international revenue totaled $478 million, growth of 21%. For the year, U.S. revenue was $5.46 billion and international revenue was $1.8 billion, both growing 17%.
As we have highlighted, we see significant long-term international market opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $6.62 billion at the end of Q4, representing growth of 20% with the outperformance driven by higher-than-anticipated early renewals. Gross and net revenue retention rates remain over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.92 billion, up 27%.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $461 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $1.74 billion, reflecting a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. Q4 GAAP net income benefited from a onetime $1.1 billion valuation allowance release related to our U.S. deferred tax assets. Q4 operating cash flow was $996 million, with approximately $100 million of the outperformance driven by strong in-quarter collections and earlier-than-expected payments. Full year operating cash flow was $2.15 billion, growth of 30%.
During Q4, we repurchased $136 million of our shares at an average price of $253.85 per share. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas of the business, and we ended January with over 18,800 Workmates around the globe.
Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%, which aligns with the preliminary outlook we provided last quarter. This guidance reflects our Q4 performance and our expectation for current macro conditions to persist throughout FY '25. We expect Q1 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.81 billion, representing 18% growth. I will highlight that Q1 benefits from an extra day of revenue recognition, given the leap year. Normalized for this, our guided subscription revenue growth in Q1 is approximately 17%. For Q2, we expect subscription revenue to increase approximately 5% sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality in the business when considering the leap year impact of Q1. We anticipate FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $630 million to $640 million as we further leverage our partner ecosystem. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $163 million.
Turning to backlog. As we've highlighted, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume, which can impact its growth in any particular quarter. In FY '25, we expect CRPO growth to come off the elevated levels we experienced in FY '24 as we lap periods of strong scheduled and early renewals. Given this variability, we expect CRPO to increase between 17.5% and 18.5% in Q1. We expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 24.5%. Our outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%.
GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 24 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate is 19%. We expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion, which is impacted by the $100 million of Q4 collections I called out as well as an extra payroll payment we expect to make in FY '25, given the leap year. In addition, we expect FY '25 capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.
Our FY '25 outlook takes into account the acquisition of HiredScore, which is expected to close later this quarter. We're pleased with our execution in FY '24, thanks to the support of our customers, partners and Workmates. With momentum building across our strategic growth areas, we enter FY '25 focused on continuing to invest to drive long-term growth while also expanding margins. Let me turn it back over to Aneel before we begin Q&A. Thanks, Zane. Given my new role, this will be my last regularly scheduled earnings call as I fully hand over the reins to the great Carl and Zane. It's been a pleasure getting to know so many of you over the years, and I wanted to give a special thank you to Mark Murphy, Brent Thill, Pat Walravens, Kirk Materne and John DiFucci, who have all been covering Workday since our IPO in 2012, and also to Kash Rangan, who I'm sure wanted to cover us back then but couldn't because his wife was a Workmate at the time. Okay. With that, operator, let's go to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. I am almost fighting tears in my eyes, Aneel. I was glad to be a part of the family, and now I'm part of the extended family since my wife is no longer a Workmate, but we're still here with you guys. One question for Carl and team, maybe. You gave guidance for next year back in September at Rising. The economic environment, the outlook has generally gotten better, right, or seemingly out of the fear of a recession. And you've got a slew of new products, you've got an expanded partnership strategy. You've got a reseller partnership strategy as well.
So with all these new dimensions what is getting the growth rate of the company because the guidance is roughly the same as it was? I'm just trying to understand the level of conservatism vis-à-vis the levers that you have today, macro and micro included, that are definitely putting the company in a better position. Kash, thanks for the question. Before I answer it, I just want to start by thanking our Workmates, partners, and customers around the world for delivering a solid Q4 and an outstanding full FY '24 performance. I could not be prouder of our execution, especially given the uncertainties of the environment at the start of FY '24, and while embracing important changes we've put in place here at Workday. The value proposition of our Workday platform continues to grow, which is evident from our results. The durability and diversity of our business delivers consistent solid growth while also driving operating leverage. I am grateful to Aneel for this incredible partnership that we have, and we can't wait to see what we're going to do together with the rest of our Workmates this year. We are just getting started.
Kash, to answer your question, as you know, we have really put in place a number of strategic growth initiatives starting last year, and all of them are taken into account when we think about our guidance for this full year. When you think about what we announced at the Financial Analyst Day, we announced a 3-year growth strategy that maintained pretty consistent growth over the next 3 years as we got larger and we continue to expand our operating margin.
Then at the end of Q3, we delivered a preliminary guidance for FY '25, which we reiterated here on this call today. Our growth initiatives are paying off. We have really solid growth. We continue to expand margins, and we will continue to lean into those growth initiatives as we think about the rest of this year. So we're pretty proud that we're maintaining the growth rate we have and still expanding margins. And it's because of those strategic initiatives that you mentioned that we are leaning into. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. First off, Aneel, I wanted to thank you for everything over so many years and that -- to let you know that I'm incredibly grateful. Carl, I wanted to ask you, it feels -- you and/or Aneel, I should say. It feels like Workday has been quietly gaining a reputation as a lighthouse for AI, and you're focusing on the safe handling of all this data and not overcharging.
As you introduce these products in the upcoming release that you mentioned, what type of productivity boosts are you expecting to achieve for an HR practitioner? And I'm just wondering, is it strongest in the talent areas of skills and hiring, which I think you're mentioning more? Or do you think it's going to be more broadly applicable in other areas like budgeting and supply chain and so on and so forth? Maybe I'll just take the high level and I'll turn it over to Carl. AI is going to be important across all those applications. But the first area that we've seen quite a bit of interest and traction has been on the talent management side, both through our Talent Optimization and Skills Cloud products and now through the acquisition of HiredScore, it's a natural area for AI to showcase. But as you think about an area like budgeting, huge power to think about effectively a Copilot driving smarter and smarter plans automatically for you and being able to replan on an almost instantaneous basis. And the world is so dynamic right now, it's really what you need. So in terms of productivity, I'll let Carl talk about it. Yes. Thanks, Aneel. Yes, Mark, I do think the first place we're seeing true productivity gains is around what I would just describe as talent acquisition. And when you think about the addition of HiredScore, that we just acquired, along with our recruiting platform, our Talent Optimization platform and our candidate engagement platform, it gives us the ability to deliver a full suite for talent acquisition around how we identify talent, how we engage with them, how we source or recruit them and then how we retain them for internal mobility.
So I am really confident in our ability to deliver a strong RI to the recruiting and talent organizations, with us having what I think now is one of the best full platform suite for talent acquisition going forward. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Aneel, congratulations on the new responsibilities and great job on building a great company. My question is for Zane actually, and it's, I think, more about sort of guidance. This quarter, subscription revenues was about $5 million ahead of your guidance. I think this is probably the smallest beat that we've ever seen from Workday in terms of subscription revenues. It seems like there's a lot of dynamics going on with early renewals and like how that impacts the RPO. Was there any impact on subscription revenues? Or anything that can help us understand sort of the skinnier-than-typical beat in terms of subscription revenues that we saw in the current quarter. Sure, Keith. Yes, I mean, subscription revenues came in obviously ahead of our guide and as you point out, still ahead of where the Street was. I'll point out, fourth quarter is a big quarter for us and we had a really busy January. So some of that may have been reflected in the quarter as far as if you think about just linearity throughout the quarter. So there was some impact into the quarter. But as we look to FY '25 and we think about the buildup heading into FY '25, as you pointed out, we've seen good CRPO growth through all of last year.
And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we don't necessarily anticipate that level of growth above the subscription revenue growth that we've seen just because of the renewal activity on both the scheduled side as well as the early renewal activity. So there's some of that built into the guide. There's nothing that I would point out in the fourth quarter other than it was a solid fourth quarter. We feel really good about the momentum we have in the business. We feel good about the outlook. As Carl pointed out, it's consistent with the outlook and the guide that we gave a quarter ago.
So we feel great about where we're sitting right now. I will also point out the aggregate level of CRPO. If you look at that versus the upcoming guide for the year, we're actually at a slightly higher level than where we were for the same time of the prior year, so the same time last year. So again, we feel like we're very well positioned heading into the year. It was a good fourth quarter and we're all ready to execute into FY '25. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. And Aneel, I'll echo my thanks and best wishes on your new role. I think my question is for Carl. Carl, obviously, platform deals this year seem to have been a pretty big lever for you all, especially in the mid-market. Can you just talk about your confidence level in the pipeline around platform deals as we go into fiscal '25 and just sort of what that looks like? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Kirk. As we've said for the last year, we are focusing on delivering a full platform solution to our customers, both HCM and Financials, and we have seen a nice uptick in our selling motion there. In the medium enterprise, we're seeing a big uptick, so our full platform sales are going up, but we're also seeing in the upmarket as well in large enterprise. And then there are certain industries where we see it like state and local government. We see it in health care. Our health care business had a really big quarter, a 50% growth year-over-year. So it is definitely a selling motion we're leaning into.
And I think, quite frankly, we're just getting started. Our financials platform continues to gain momentum in the market. We're able to sell FINS back into our existing HCM customers, so they become full platform customers. And net new sales, a lot of them are full platform from day 1. So the full platform approach we're taking is clearly paying dividends and driving our growth. We will also be -- starting next week, we'll be transitioning. In the past, we've talked about some pricing and packaging where we'll be selling more suites and bundles. That's something we'll be educating our field on next week. It's been in pilot. It's -- the pilot has gone well. And we're quite hopeful about how we're going to change pricing and packaging to encourage customers to have an easier way to buy a full platform from Workday. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Aneel, I'm glad you had that meal at the Truckee Diner. I'm sure you're thankful for that. Thanks again for everything. Carl, I think just back to Keith's question, when we see 22% backlog in Q3 going to 20% in Q4 and down to 18% in Q1 on the guide, I think everyone appreciates the steps and initiatives you're taking, but the growth numbers are kind of working in the wrong direction relative to the initiatives that you're taking.
And I realize that perhaps this takes some time to play out, but I think everyone is trying to understand the environment is getting better, yet the backlog numbers seem to be declining quarter-over-quarter and then in Q1. So I'm just curious if you can help bridge what's going on. Brent, yes, I'll start. This is Zane. We are very pleased with the backlog build. And as we pointed out, we focused primarily on subscription revenue build, and backlog is influenced by not only scheduled renewals but also this early renewal activity, which we now lapped. If you recall, we started talking about that a year ago. So again, the 20% backlog growth that we saw this quarter actually came in, if you recall, about 1 point higher than even our expectations. And a big contributor of that was the pull-in that we saw through this early renewal activity.
And we would expect backlog to have some variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis as you think about how you build backlog and how it's aligned with not only new ACV growth but the scheduled renewal growth. So it's coming in, I'd say, very close to our expectation. As we point out and as I mentioned over the last number of calls, we don't expect to see, in particular with CRPO, the sustained growth level coming in higher than subscription revenue growth in perpetuity. And we feel really good about the aggregate. If you look at the aggregate CRPO level as a percent of the guide, you can see it's actually at a higher level than what it was last year. So we feel really good about the build. But as I caution, there will be some variability as we expect on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes. Also, Zane, I just wanted to touch on the renewals dynamic. It's a conversation we've had now, I guess, for our fifth earnings call in a row here, but it is, again, early renewals is an output of customer demand. And when customers want to buy product from us and consolidate onto our best-of-breed platform as opposed to having all these -- our best-of-suite platform versus all these best-of-breed solutions, it drives early renewals.
So our teams don't get paid on early renewals. It's basically customer demand and early renewals is an output, right? It's not something we go out and focus on. So we're very pleased with the demand we see from customers, both net new and our customer base and selling back into them, which does drive early renewals. But that can vary, Zane, as you know, right, in any given quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Congratulations, Aneel, on your new role here. I wanted to ask 1 on the verticals here. It's a big focus. You've been talking about this for a couple of years now. I know government, higher ed, health care, those have been relatively strong for quite some time. Can you give us a sense for which one in the other list, retail, hospitality, financials, tech and media where you see some of the fruits of the efforts that you've been making here to build on the product and go-to-market where we could see some incremental strength in any of those verticals? Yes. Maybe I'll start, Doug, and then you can add, if you don't mind. I think the industry strategy or the vertical strategy we have here at Workday plays nicely with, if you will, our segment strategy. That's why we talk a lot about the diversity of our business. But to your point, health care continues to be a very large segment for us. We talked about retail and hospitality last quarter was the second, if you will, vertical that crossed $1 billion in ARR. We talked about the continued momentum around higher ed and full platform sales there.
And then also around financial services, we didn't call it out and specifically in the earnings call as a vertical, but we had a number of very significant financial sales back into existing HCM customers around financial services. So that was a great indicator that full platform is resonating around financial services as well. So our industry strategy is playing out, and we saw another really strong quarter across those key markets. Doug, I don't know, maybe you have some additional color you'd like to add. Sure. Brad, nice to speak with you. So in addition to the usual suspects of sort of those top industries that you excluded from the question, 2 that stand out: professional services. I think we even highlighted the Randstad win. But we're seeing industries like professional services or business services where you bring people and money together are the perfect sort of scenario for a full platform opportunity for Workday. So we saw really good performance there in Q4.
And then the second, which doesn't really sort of capture maybe the attention it deserves at times, which is medium enterprise platform deals, cuts across all of the industries you mentioned and includes the ones that, again, are the health care, FSI, public sector that you know well from us. So those are the 2 that I'd call out, Carl. Thanks, Doug. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I wanted to maybe ask just the [indiscernible] quarter. First, maybe in terms of the quarter itself, the fourth quarter, if you kind of dissect the large enterprise traction and activity versus kind of your traction activity in the mid-market, how would you say this fourth quarter trended versus previous? And then maybe Zane on the guide, is there any way to dimensionalize how much hired source -- or HiredScore, sorry, revenue you're including for the full year, just given you're reiterating a prior guide now with some acquired revenue? Sure. Yes, I'll start on the inclusion. It's considered part of the prior guide. It's not a meaningful part of the total revenue guide, and we obviously include it in our cost base as well. So not meaningful when you think about the guide for this year but obviously very strategic for us, and we're very excited about what it will contribute beyond FY '25. Yes. And on the versus the medium enterprise, I'll let Doug start and then I'll add some color. Yes. So I'd say that Q4 was very similar to Q3 in terms of ME, LE both hitting really solid growth rates. And I'd draw the distinction between Q3 and Q4 where ME really snapped back. The first half of the year, I think we had even called this out in previous earnings calls, we saw certain industries within medium enterprise have some softness. But in Q3, and this held true in Q4 as well, medium enterprise, particularly medium enterprise net new, snapped back, so we saw really good growth dynamics in both ME and LE for Q4. Yes. And on the LE side, Doug, as we said in my prepared remarks and just we answered in the prior question, we had a really strong quarter again in health care, a good state and local government as well and then higher ed. They're 3 strong categories, right, that actually fall into our large enterprise business that once again had really strong performance in the quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Maybe 1 for Zane on margin. You're up to 24% operating margin here, guiding for 24.5% as a starting point for next year, so within striking distance at the low end of that longer-term target range you framed out. I just would love to hear you spend some more time on how you're approaching the balance between growth and margin from here. And then on free cash flow, appreciate the Q4 commentary and the outperformance there. It looks like the initial fiscal '25 free cash flow outlook is relatively consistent with fiscal '24. So outside of that 4Q, kind of just anything else you can add on what might be the puts and takes on free cash flow is helpful. Sure, Michael. Happy to talk a little bit about margin. I'd say it's consistent with the conversation we've had, candidly, through all of FY '24. But as we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day, Carl and the team have really taken, I think, a thoughtful approach across those investment buckets that we've highlighted to everyone, including our international expansion, the focus on FINS, on AI, and leaning into partnerships, and obviously, as we've highlighted this quarter, also highlighting organic growth and M&A growth.
And we've really balanced the investments that we're making and contemplated that with the outlook and the buildup for FY '21 -- sorry, FY '25, but also aligning for our longer-term outlook and continue to focus on not only investing in the right areas, but obviously, that driving long-term growth and contributing to a margin expansion over that period of time. So it's a balance that we continue to focus on. The team here are looking at each of those investment areas and categories and thinking about how to adjust those dynamically where we see opportunities around the globe, quite frankly, and leaning in where we can.
And at the same time, as you would expect, as we continue to focus on being more efficient as an organization and thinking about our global presence and focusing on those efficiencies so that we can not only scale the organization but reinvest in some of these key areas. And that's, I think, represented in the outlook that we have, both the top line growth and then the margin expansion coming in nicely aligned with the midterm outlook that we provided at Financial Analyst Day.
And I would say operating cash flow and then free cash flow aligns with that. I highlighted the fact that in FY '24, we clearly benefited from some strong collections and early collections. We don't necessarily anticipate that reoccurring next year, and we factored that into the guide, into our OCF guide for FY '25. So we're pleased with the growth there. If you adjust for the $100 million as well as the extra pay period that just so happens to align because of the leap year, you get back to OCF growth that I believe is in line with the business growth. So we feel really good about the cash growth in the business and obviously feel very good about the top line growth and the margin expansion that we're seeing. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Maybe I'll direct this to Zane, and Zane, back on the CRPO, so a 2-parter. For the 20% CRPO growth that you put up for the January quarter, are you able to disclose what the early renewal impact was? I think 3 months ago, you had mentioned that it was a little bit more than 1 point. Curious what it was for January. And then when we look forward, just to clarify, is the guidance for 18% CRPO growth for April, have you now fully lapped this early renewal dynamic such that we should think about that being more of a normalized or clean compare? Or does this dynamic still represent a headwind that maybe in a couple of quarters, you work through and you get a bit of a recovery in the year-over-year growth. I'd love to understand that without obviously asking for specific guidance. Sure. Yes, of course, Karl. Yes, as you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, the 20% included about 1.5 points of early renewal activity, some of which we expected. But with the growth that we saw, obviously, just in ACV growth as well as that early renewal activity that came in ahead of our guide, I mentioned it came in, I believe, 1 point ahead of our guide. So we were very pleased with the CRPO growth in the quarter. But I'll also point out, we're still focused on subscription revenue. We are lapping a period of higher than traditional growth tied to these early renewals.
And as I mentioned, I believe at our Financial Analyst Day where I gave an example, at times, duration and the level of renewal activity, both scheduled and early, can have a fairly significant impact on that CRPO growth. So as we look at our scheduled renewals from FY '24 to FY '25, we actually continue to see nice growth, if you look at it on an annualized basis. But I'll point out, you do get some variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which is why we're now actually even including a range into our expectation heading into Q1. So you do -- you lap some of that early renewal activity that we've clearly benefited from, but we don't necessarily anticipate that growth that we've seen in at least the prior number of quarters to continue at that rate.
And candidly, we're thrilled with the increase that we see in CRPO, but again, that's not the only driver to our forecasted subscription revenue growth, which is the key area that we focus on. So netting it out, we feel good about our CRPO aggregate levels, and we would expect to see some variability, which is included in our first quarter guide. We will now take 2 more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Carl, you guys hired a lot of sales reps focused on selling core FINS over the last few quarters. Can you just give us a sense of how you're feeling about ramp to productivity times? How we should be thinking about kind of where we are in year-over-year growth and fully ramped sales capacity into the new year? And just how you're thinking about sales hiring plans through fiscal '25? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Derrick. So you are right. Last year at this time, we announced we were doubling down our efforts on the go-to-market side around financials, and that included hiring out a whole bunch of new sales reps, which we did, and that continued throughout Q4. And what we do is every quarter, we look at our key metrics on how we're performing against that investment. We look at the pipeline. We look at new logo wins. We said it was up pretty significantly here in Q4. We look at our competitive win rates, which continued to tick up throughout the year on financials. We also take a look at new ACV, which we said was up year-over-year on financials.
And then the drag effect on all of that is full platform sales, which were also up in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. So we are pleased with the investments we've made on the go-to-market side around financials, and we will continue to lean into that as these people become more and more productive. If you think about it, a lot of them have been on board only 6 or 9 or even 3 months, so we haven't seen the impact of the full investment at this time.
It's also important to note that we're investing in financials, not just directly in our own sales force but how we partner with our ecosystem. And also, we continue to invest in the product side of the business around financials so that we have a much more global and localized platform around the world because we see that as a big opportunity as well. So net-net, we're very happy with the investment. We'll continue to lean in. We think it's a huge market opportunity. We've said many times, only 20% or 25% of workloads have moved to the cloud. And then if you combine that with our competition pushing customers to a new platform, it's a rich opportunity for us going forward. And our last question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. I get the noise here and renewal timing issues impacting CRPO. Wanted to double-click into subscription revenue growth. We've seen 6 quarters of slowing growth in the subscription business. You're actually guiding to growth to accelerate for the first time here into Q1. What is driving the optimism around this reacceleration of subscription growth? And maybe you could provide a little color around the pipeline visibility this year versus going into last year. Sure. I'll start and then let Carl give a little more insight into the pipeline. I did point out that subscription revenue growth heading into Q1 does benefit from the additional day tied to the leap year. And as you would expect, heading into the next quarter, we have good visibility into the pipeline. We also have good visibility into the aggregate level of CRPO. So we feel good about what we've presented for not only the quarter but also the subscription revenue guide that we've given for the year, which aligns with our overall midterm outlook. So we believe that between the pipeline and the CRPO, we feel good about that revenue guide. Yes. And on us being cautiously optimistic on the year and why we provided the type of guidance we did for both Q1 and the full year FY '25, it's because the investments that we put in place last year are really coming to fruition for us, whether it's in the financials platform that I just articulated. The partners are really starting to bring us new opportunities, and we're leveraging them for co-innovation. Our international focus, we talked about it over the last year and all the new talent we brought. We're seeing consistent and predictable results out of Europe, and we had a great quarter in APAC, and even Japan did a really nice performance for us.
And then on AI, we think we got the most compelling AI platform in our market, and we continue to organically innovate there, and we're doing inorganic innovation like we did with HiredScore. So all of that gives us cautious optimism as we think about both Q1 and FY '25. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments. Thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call, and a special thanks to our Workmates, customers, and partners around the globe that continue to fuel Workday's success. Q4 was another solid quarter, highlighted by the durable mission-critical nature of our business and reinforcing the exciting growth opportunity we have ahead. We are well positioned and focused on getting off to a good start here in FY '25. With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator to close today's call. And I hope everyone has a great evening. And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.","we will hand the call over to aneel Bhusri, our executive chair, and Zane Rowe, our co-President . unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023 .",0.0

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Welcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; Doug Robinson, our Co-President; and David Somers, our Chief Product Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2024 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2024. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl. Thank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our solid financial performance for the quarter, including 19% subscription revenue growth, 18% 12-month backlog growth, and non-GAAP operating margin of 26%. Over the past 6 quarters, we've made several key investments across the business as well as important organizational changes to set the foundation for durable growth and continued margin expansion.
In Q1, we continued to build on a number of important growth initiatives, including go-to-market changes that will help us further expand our total addressable market. And in the quarter, we closed several strategic deals, including a landmark federal win at the Defense Intelligence Agency. We also held our annual Innovation Summit, where we hosted 25 industry analysts and showcased our organic innovation engine, which continues to be one of the key strengths of our company. We already are seeing tremendous feedback from the event with lots of positive industry analyst coverage on the product road maps and the future of Workday.
Our first quarter is always our seasonally slowest. We had clear areas of outperformance, including health care, public sector and continued strength in financials and full platform wins, but we also closed fewer large deals than last Q1, notably in EMEA. When purchase decisions are being made, our win rates remain strong. But within the quarter, we experienced increased deal scrutiny as compared to prior quarters, and we are seeing customers committing to lower headcount levels on renewals compared to what we had expected. We expect these dynamics to persist in the near term, which is reflected in our revised FY '25 subscription revenue guidance. While we can't control the macro, we are focusing on what's in our control, and that is innovation, scaling our go-to-market and partner ecosystem and delivering customer value.
We remain confident we're doing the right things to build a long-term durable business with balanced growth and margin expansion. With the emergence of AI, the shifting talent landscape, and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, organizations across geographies and industries are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to elevate humans and supercharge work. We made several key developments in Q1 that strengthen our position, and I'll share a few highlights.
Let's start with customers. Our customers truly bring the power of Workday to life. A great example is our new partnership with the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA is the key intelligent agency for national defense in the United States. Workday will support the DIA on its mission to rapidly accelerate recruitment and onboarding efforts and create a diverse, trusted, and agile workforce. With Workday, they'll be able to identify, integrate, and direct skills and expertise to solve emerging intelligence problems when and where they are most needed.
Not only is this a significant new win, but more importantly, it unlocks an incredible market opportunity for Workday in the federal government, and we expect it to increase our pipeline over the coming quarters. In fact, the DIA was on stage at our Federal Forum event in Washington, D.C. yesterday discussing digital transformation in the government. Now in its second year, the forum drew a record crowd of over 600 decision-makers across more than 70 agencies from the world of government and policy. This is up 100% from our Federal Forum last year, and the momentum we are building here is exciting.
And speaking of momentum, we continue to take share in financials, bolstered by our go-to-market and platform investments combined with our compelling value proposition of having a single secure platform to manage both your people and money. In Q1, new Financial Management customers and full platform customers both increased more than 20% over Q1 of last year. And more than 90% of our nearly 2,000 FINS customers are now leveraging the power of our HCM platform as well.
In Q1, we added several full platform HCM and FINS customers, including Baptist Health, Covenant Health Systems, the City of Milwaukee, and Owning Group, the largest privately held staffing company in the U.S. We also had a number of expansions within the office of the CFO, including Alliance Bernstein, Hospital Sisters Health System and John Muir Health. During Q1, we also expanded our leadership in HCM, adding new relationships with organizations, including ALS Group USA, Carhartt, and one of the largest P&C insurers in the world, which expanded its core financials footprint to add HCM.
And we had several strategic HCM expansions and renewals, including ING Bank, Sandvik AB, and Valeo Management Services. Beyond the wins, we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform. In Q1, Asda, Electrolux, Topgolf, county of Richland, Apex Group, and LVHN all successfully went live on Workday.
Customers trust Workday to help them navigate huge transformations. They did so with the cloud, and now they're turning to us to help them responsibly leverage AI to drive productivity, efficiency, and cost savings. Workday gives them the ultimate advantage. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade. We fill AI into the core of our platform, which means AI features and functionality are embedded natively in all of our applications.
And with more than 65 million users generating more than 800 billion transactions per year on our platform, the volume of clean, trusted data that Workday and our ecosystem can leverage for AI is truly unmatched. We continue to make significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area and deliver trusted and responsible AI innovations that drive meaningful business results. We now have more than 50 AI use cases live in production and 25 generative AI use cases on our road map to help our customers make confident decisions faster, increase efficiencies, and make their people more productive.
In Q1, several new innovations went live for early access customers, including AI-powered content generation capabilities with growth plans, job descriptions, and knowledge-based articles. These automate repetitive tasks and put information in the hands of the right people faster. We also released AI-enabled Payroll Insights, which help payroll professionals detect anomalies faster and more accurately to save money and reduce risk. Perhaps the best example here is our talent optimization solution, which leverages Workday Skills Cloud. This is an AI-first SKU where we have seen strong attach rates on new deals and have significant momentum selling back to our customer base as well. I'm pleased to share that over half of our core customer base has now licensed this product, making it one of our fastest-growing ever.
Continuing to accelerate our AI road map, we closed the acquisition of HiredScore in Q1, giving us a comprehensive AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Our shared customers are realizing a 25% increase in recruiter capacity with AI, one of the many reasons we're so excited about this combination. We closed our first joint deal this quarter and we're rapidly building pipeline, particularly across our base of more than 4,000 recruiting customers.
The power of Workday is our platform, and that gives us a ton of flexibility to fuel growth, for example, in industries. This is a key foundational element and a major differentiator for us. We've been focusing on deepening our purpose-built offerings in key verticals, including health care, public sector, financial services, and professional services. As you can see in the logos from this quarter, health care once again performed very well with new ACV growth exceeding 50% in Q1. At the same time, our professional and business services vertical is already well on its way to eclipsing $1 billion in annual recurring revenue.
In Q1, we released a natively-built configure price quote solution for services businesses, which integrates with CRM platforms to streamline the quoting process. Our research shows that for 95% of our customers, quoting is still happening in spreadsheets today so this is going to significantly increase their efficiencies.
Public sector was another highlight in Q1. In addition to the DIA, we continued to excel in state and local government, closing full platform wins with the cities of north Las Vegas, Milwaukee, and Palm Bay and Monroe and Washington counties. And in education, we had a record number of Workday Student go-lives in Q1 and now have taken 20 new customers live so far this year, including Iowa State University, University of Arkansas System, and Wake Forest University.
Global expansion continues to be a key growth driver for Workday. We're focused on investing at all levels to build our regional businesses with local leadership, go-to-market, and product enhancements. For instance, this quarter, our native payroll solution for customers in Australia became generally available. And our global payroll platform is now available for early adopters as we extend the power of Workday with strategic partners like ADP, Alight, and more. On the go-to-market side, we began holding Workday Elevate events across APAC, Japan, and EMEA in Q1 and will continue throughout Q2. These events bring together thousands of prospects and customers, generating new pipeline and deepening our existing relationships.
And just last week, we announced our plans to invest more than GBP 550 million in our U.K. operations over the next 3 years. We also announced that in early 2025, our customers will be able to access our core HCM financials and adapt the planning solutions locally on the AWS Cloud in the U.K. Not only are we enabling compliance with data residency requirements, we're also boosting performance and helping businesses scale for the future. So as you can see, we're continuing to invest for our growth, and I'm energized by how we'll be able to empower more U.K. organizations with the power of our platform.
And while it was a more challenging quarter in some of our international markets, we saw strength in France, the Netherlands, and Japan. Key international wins in Q1 included OCP Group, Knight Frank, and Aman Resorts. Our partner ecosystem is a powerful driver of customer success, and it continues to grow in both breadth and depth. Across the board, we're seeing continued growth in our referral and co-selling efforts, with our partner sourcing more pipeline and closing more ACV in Q1 than all of FY '24 through our sales program. This points to increasing ecosystem-led growth, which is a key priority.
We have over 200 co-sell and referral partnerships that are helping expand our routes to market. One of the partners that we signed in Q1 that I'm particularly excited about is Google. Under our new partnership, GCP customers will have access to Workday products through the Google Cloud Marketplace. We're off to a fast start and we expect to have our first transaction via the Marketplace this month.
We also recently expanded our relationship with AWS to include co-innovation across industries and enhance go-to-market investments. We bill over $75 million of active ACV pipeline with AWS and the expanded partnership should only accelerate that. And in Q1, we formed a new reseller agreement with Kyriba that enables Workday customers to integrate with a network of over 1,000 global banks. This dramatically reduces the time, complexity, and costs needed to integrate and adapt with changing banking requirements.
Partners are critical to helping us accelerate and broaden our innovation footprint. In 2 weeks, we'll welcome 1,200 partners and customers to Las Vegas for DevCon, our annual Developer Conference. DevCon, as well as our developer ecosystem, has grown by more than 50% since last year, which is a testament to the momentum we're building across our platform. At the event, we'll be announcing new ways for partners to build, distribute, and monetize their applications on the Workday platform. We are also launching several other components of the program to enable us to embed partner solutions within Workday in ways we've never done before.
With our cloud-native platform in Workday Extend, we are enabling AI innovation not just from Workday but our customers and partners as well. We now have more than 900 Extend customers and 1,600 apps delivering significant value across our ecosystem of customers and partners. Workday Extend Pro, which includes AI Gateway as well as Developer Copilot launching later this year, enables our customers and partners to build AI-first apps that leverage the power of our platform.
There is clearly an appetite to build AI-first apps on top of Workday. More than 50% of our Q1 Extend ACV was from Extend Pro, making it another one of our fastest-growing SKUs. And our AI Marketplace, which is going live next month, gives our customers access to the best of Workday AI and solutions from third-party partners together in 1 place. These are just a few of the latest examples of the breadth of our innovation and the reach of our platform.
Now to close, as I've said many times, we have a durable business with multiple levers to drive long-term growth. With our leadership and investment in AI, our unique ability to address organizations' most critical challenges and the deep relationships we have with our customers and partners, Workday remains well positioned to extend our market leadership. This is exactly what drew me to Workday and what continues to excite me.
We also have a diverse business serving more than 10,500 customers across industries, which now includes more than 60% of the Fortune 500, an incredible milestone and a testament to the strategic nature of our platform. And yet, we're just getting started, with more than 40,000 organizations in our addressable market and a continued opportunity to expand our footprint and deliver even more value within our existing customer base. Moving into Q2, we are well positioned to achieve our objectives in the near term while continuing to build for the long term. I'd like to thank our customers who put their trust in us, our partners, and especially my 19,400 Workmates around the world for helping drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane. Thanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations across our key financial metrics. Subscription revenue in the first quarter was $1.815 billion, up 19%, including a 1 point benefit from the leap year. Professional services revenue was $175 million in the quarter, leading to total revenue in Q1 of $1.99 billion, growing 18%. U.S. revenue in Q1 totaled $1.49 billion, and international revenue totaled $497 million, both growing 18%.
12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $6.6 billion at the end of Q1, representing growth of 18%. Renewal volume in the quarter, including early renewals, was in line with our expectations. Gross and net revenue retention rates remained strong at over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.68 billion, up 24%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $515 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.9%. Margin strength was driven by moderate revenue outperformance and lower expenses.
Q1 operating cash flow was $372 million, growth of 34%. During Q1, we repurchased $134 million of our shares at an average price of $267.09 per share. In addition, starting in April, we began to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share withholding. This reduced our dilution by 1 million shares in the quarter relative to our prior sell-to-cover method and impacted our cash flow from financing by $239 million in Q1. We ended the quarter with $7.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.
As of April 30, headcount stood at over 19,400 Workmates around the globe. We were pleased to see the continued progress across our key growth initiatives, including momentum in full platform wins and continued ramping of our partner ecosystem, which we expect to support growth in the coming years. At the same time, we experienced elevated scrutiny in our sales cycle, particularly in EMEA. Within our customer base, we continue to see expansion, primarily through product add-ons versus customer headcount growth, which has slowed relative to our expectations.
Taking these factors into account, we are updating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.725 billion, representing growth of approximately 17% compared to our previous guided range of 17% to 18%. We expect Q2 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.895 billion, representing 17% growth. We now expect FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $650 million to $660 million, reflecting the Q1 outperformance and our Q2 expectations along with our strategy of further leveraging our partner ecosystem. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $175 million.
Turning to backlog. As we've highlighted previously, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume and new business bookings. The strength in overall renewal activity in FY '24, including early renewals, caused our CRPO growth to outpace subscription revenue growth throughout last year. This aggregate effect is impacting our backlog growth this year. In Q2, as we saw in Q1, we expect CRPO growth to be below subscription revenue growth impacted by the cumulative headwind from last year's strong renewal activity. In Q2, we expect CRPO to increase between 15% and 16%.
We continue to see momentum across our core growth areas and are continuing to invest for future growth while driving increased efficiencies across the company. We now expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 25%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%, which reflects our typical seasonality. GAAP operating margins for the second quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We continue to expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.
In closing, I want to reiterate our commitment to investing to support long-term growth while expanding margins. We continue to see strong customer demand and engagement across our platform, supporting our financial targets and helping drive our strategic growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarification. You talked about the extended sales cycles and also smaller customer growth, headcount growth. Was that primarily restricted to EMEA or did you see some of that in the U.S., too? And as a follow-up, if I could, if the partner generation of new business, which seems to have outstripped all of this in '24, if that momentum continues, would you be compelled to consider getting the guidance back on track? In other words, do we have enough of other factors at play that could get you back on track as the fiscal year progresses? Kash, thanks for the question. Let me just, before I answer your question, take a quick moment to thank our Workmates, customers, and partners around the world for helping to get off to a solid start to the year. And as you can see, Kash, by our results in Q1, it was a solid quarter but we did see a few dynamics change. And specifically, you mentioned 2 of them. Number one, I think for the last 1, 1.5 years, we've talked about -- we haven't seen any material change to the macro, meaning we haven't seen any additional scrutiny one way or the other. In fact, it's been rather consistent.
But this quarter, we did. We did see a bit more scrutiny, specifically on large deals and net new deals. And that wasn't just something in the U.S. It was truly around the world we saw that. I would also say that some of that may be because we're talking to our customers about full platform deals. We're no longer just talking about HCM deals. And when we sell full platform, particularly in the large enterprise market, we are selling to multiple buyers. We're telling them to sell into the CHRO, we're selling to the CIO and the CFO, which makes it a little bit more of a complex deal for us, which makes some of these sales cycles a bit longer.
That being said, when customers do make decisions, we're clearly winning our fair share of both HCM, Financials and full platform deals. So definitely some more scrutiny than we've seen in the past. And on the headcount trends, that was something that was globally. We saw less headcount expansion at time of renewals across the world. That wasn't just something in 1 region versus the other.
And on the partners, yes, to your point, we continue to lean into the investments we're making around our partners. In Q1, specifically in my prepared remarks, we called out a couple of highlights, including that we built more pipeline in Q1 than we did all of last year. And the second thing we called out is we closed more business to our partners than we did all of last year. This is just evidence that the investment we're making in the partners, in the partner ecosystem is coming to fruition, and we're super excited about the potential impact it can have on us going forward. Kash, I would just add, as we think about that growth in partners, we would expect it to ramp through the year, and as Carl alluded to, we see great progress there. As it relates to subscription revenue, the bulk of that would probably then enter into the next fiscal year more so than this fiscal year. But obviously, we're excited about the progress we're making on the partner front. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Just following on Kash's question, the aspect of the lower customer headcount growth, we can see that nonfarm payrolls were growing 5% just a couple of years ago. It has fallen to about 1.8% recently. I'm curious if that roughly aligns with the slower headcount growth you're seeing across the base. In other words, could you be renewing contracts from 2 to 3 years ago and seeing that type of a headwind perhaps a few points' worth? And then secondarily, I'm just wondering if it's more pronounced at HCM than FINS because it would touch the entire employee base on the HCM side. Mark, I'm happy to start that and then maybe have Carl give more color. I'd say generally, what we see is that the increase over our baseline has come down. So we still are fortunate to see increase in net headcount growth on a year-over-year basis. But what we've seen is a slowdown and candidly just below our expectations. So I think  some of what you referenced earlier on nonfarm pools probably does align with what we're seeing. And the other part is just a subset of our cohort and our customer base just being impacted with how they're seeing it and the increase over the baseline amount coming in. Yes. Go ahead, Doug. You have some color? Yes. I'd just add to that, Mark, that we see that in both renewals that shows up, but also, as you know, we have a sort of true-up mechanism that happens on an annual basis. So customers, while they're still adding employees and headcount to the system, are doing it at a more moderated rate than we had anticipated in Q1. Yes. Mark, I do think as both Zane and Doug alluded to, we did kind of expect a slowdown in headcount growth as compared to last year. But in Q1, it was even lower than our forecast. And we don't necessarily see that changing throughout the rest of the year, and we took that into account as we thought about the full year guidance. And does that impact HCM more than FINS? Equally, equally. I think it's equally. It's not 1 versus the other. Obviously, we have a much larger installed base of HCM customers so it would be more pronounced around HCM because of our customer base. But I think it's consistent across both HCM and FINS when we have both deployed. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. I want to maybe just continue on that question Mark was asking, which is I think one of the questions coming out of this will be, we understand some of the headwind of business. I guess what, I guess, buffers have you put into the guidance or have you changed sort of your thought process pipeline close rates or conversion rates so that we have a little bit more confidence in the full year guide? I realize the macro moves around a little bit. But can you just give us a little color on what you guys have done to make sure that the guide we have in front of us is appropriate, given some of the headwinds we've -- that have come up over the last quarter. Yes, Kirk, this is Zane. I'll start and then let Carl finish the answer. We've been thoughtful as far as projecting out for the year and how we've looked at each of these dynamics. And Carl touched on the impact on the pipeline, the fact that these companies haven't necessarily moved out. It's just been a slowing effect and that's the part that's impacted us more so than actually losing deals. In fact, our win rates have come in nicely aligned with where we've seen them historically.
So our forecast methodology hasn't changed. We feel good about the forecast. I'll point out, we've obviously moved the midpoint of our guide down $35 million for the full year. And we factored these 2 elements into account, and we are making adjustments accordingly for the year. But we believe that given what we see today, that the updated guidance accounts for the factors that we've mentioned here. Yes. And I'd just add, Kirk, that as we looked at our pipeline for the remainder of the year, we have a solid number of large opportunities in front of us. These opportunities, while there is more scrutiny, we think we have a really good chance to close them throughout the rest of the year. We've taken that into account in our guidance. And as you know, in any given quarter, these larger transactions can be pushed out, sometimes pushed out 1 or 2 quarters. And in some cases, we pull them in.
But I think what's really important to know is none of the larger opportunities that didn't close in Q1 moved out of our pipeline. When a customer makes a decision to go to a big transformation of a platform like Workday and HCM or Financials, it's not if they're going to do it, it's when they're going to do it. And all of these remain in our pipeline, which is what gives us confidence on the guide going forward. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Carl, on EMEA, I guess when you talk about lower wins, I know you've made a lot of changes in your players. Do you think some of this may be just a player swap-out in the short term where you're having some maybe internal execution versus an external? Or are you focused more that this is more of an external force that has nothing to do with some of the changes you've implemented over the last year? Yes. Thanks for the question, Brent. I absolutely don't think it has to do with anything we're doing internally. In fact, if you recall, for the last number of quarters, one of the things we've highlighted probably for the last 4 to 6 quarters, we've highlighted the execution that we've seen out of EMEA. We have new leaders. We're going to market differently with pricing and packaging. We're going to market differently with partners over there. We've added a lot of capacity. So everything we're doing in Europe, and for that matter, the rest of the world, I think, are all positive things.
I don't think this is an execution issue at all. This is just a pocket of softness we saw outside of the U.S., and it was because of the factors we talked about. And specifically, in EMEA, last Q1, we closed a large number of bigger deals. We didn't have that same close rate this Q1 so the year-over-year compare was a bit tougher. But I don't think this has anything to do with what we're doing or how we're executing. In fact, I'm really bullish on the leadership team and how we're going to market and the changes we've made outside the U.S. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Maybe if I could just ask 1 more on some of the impacts you've seen during the quarter. We certainly understand if some of these bigger platform deals where there's both FINS and HCM involved are going to take longer to push over the finish line. We're certainly hearing that from the channel that you're seeing more of those deals. How much of this would you attribute to that move? It seems like something you're seeing increasingly. And I guess a related question to that is, was this largely limited to some of those newer platform deals as opposed to renewal deals? How did renewals in EMEA track this quarter? Yes. Thanks for the question, Brad. I actually -- your question actually is part of my answer. So most of the deals that we see getting more scrutiny are net new deals, it's not renewals. And a lot of them are full platform when we're selling both HCM and we're selling FINS. When we're just selling HCM, we don't see as much scrutiny. That being said it, if it's a very large HCM transformational or platform deal, there is some additional scrutiny that does take place, but we absolutely are seeing more when it's full platform.
The other thing I would say on the other side of that is full platform deals in the medium enterprise are accelerating. The reason for that is we can find a company who has a buyer and decision maker that are one and the same and then make a decision around both HCM and Financials at once. So we talked about our Financials business and full platform business being up greater than 20% year-over-year. A lot of that is in the medium enterprise. But in the large enterprise, there is more scrutiny. Brad, this is Zane, I'll just add. As you look at that forecast for the year, the $35 million, we'd attribute roughly half of that to the deal scrutiny that Carl just alluded to and then the other half to the headcount impact that we've seen. So net -- if you net it out through the year, it's about 50-50 mix. Just wanted to -- this is Doug. Just 1 nuance I'd add to that. On large enterprise net new, as Carl was describing, there's actually pockets of strength, too. So there is an industry element to this. So within our health care segment and as well as our public sector, we are seeing that market continue to move and they continued to perform really strong in Q1. In fact, I think health care was up another 50% in ACV growth in the quarter. So it's not to say there's a dearth, there's an absence of large deals getting done. It's just a tougher environment for most industries that we saw on a global basis, particularly Europe. Doug, when you talk about the public sector, it's not just state and local. Now we're seeing some big wins like we saw in federal with the Department of Intelligent Agency (sic) [ Defense Intelligence Agency ]. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Touched on it just briefly a little bit a moment ago, but how about some clarity in terms of what you're seeing in the mid-market? Sounds like full platform deals are fine, but are you seeing some of the same scrutiny around sales cycles, some of the regional pressure there? Any additional color there would be helpful. Yes, sure. So in the medium enterprise, we were really pleased with our performance, specifically in the U.S., where we've been selling into that market and built out the go-to-market engine a lot quicker than we did in Europe. We're building that out now in Europe. But in the U.S., our medium enterprise business was quite solid. The reason for that is now that we were pushing hard on Financials, we are absolutely seeing the Financials have an impact on full platform sales in the medium enterprise.
Also, we've changed some of our pricing and packaging as we serve that market with Workday Accelerate, which now gives us the opportunity to sell a bundle or a suite, and it's easier to sell, and for customers, it's easier to consume. And we backed that up with some rapid delivery capabilities on the services side that actually allows customers to get value quicker. So across the board, we're really excited about what's happening in the medium enterprise.
I'd also say when it comes to our partners, while yes, our partners are very impactful on the large enterprise, we talked about the pipeline build in Q1. A lot of that partner pipeline build came into medium enterprise. So overall, the medium enterprise continues to perform well. And actually, it's allowed us to even go down market quite even further. What we now call the emerging enterprise where we're able to sell because of the pricing and packaging and accelerated deployment, we can now address a market that's even further down than we've served in the past. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Maybe I'll pivot to margins so I'll direct this at you, Zane. Typically, you don't get a margin raise alongside a revenue cut. So maybe a 2-parter. Where did you find those efficiencies to create that outcome? And then secondly, maybe just a bigger picture question. Would you and the leadership team consider effectively running Workday for a mid-teens growth and just leaning, cranking more on the margin upside? Is that on the table? Karl, yes. First off, I'll point out that as we've said for a number of quarters now, we continue to balance margin with revenue growth. And we've been fortunate to see outperformance on the top line for a number of quarters. And obviously, as I've also said, we'll invest very thoughtfully in a number of these growth areas and investment areas. And we've been doing that but we've been doing it judiciously.
And we've also been focused across the company with our people, our processes and our systems and how we think about scale and just really being mindful about where we spend and where we invest across the business. So I would say no adjustment to that line of thinking. We're still very focused on growing this business. We think we've got tremendous TAM and tremendous opportunities around the globe.
On the top line, we're pleased with the performance and with our over 19,000 Workmates that have been leaning in how to be more productive and how to be more efficient as we continue to scale this business. So I'm pleased there. Candidly, I think there's more to come on both fronts and excited about the opportunity but we'll continue to balance that. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. If I'm reading the comments right, it doesn't sound competitive on the sales cycle elongation. It sounds more concentrated in Europe. I guess, is there this dynamic where maybe some deals that you were expecting to get into Q1 actually got pulled into Q4 from some of the early renewal activity? Or was this concentrated in some vertical and geography are a couple of deals that pushed late in the quarter? Just give us a sense for that linearity of how it developed and kind of where you came out. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Alex. So first, we don't think it's anything to do with our competitors or our competitive win rates. In fact, they've remained quite stable. And when customers do decide to make a decision and move forward, our win rates are very good. That being said, as you know, in any given quarter, deals can come in or come out. In Q4, we had a solid quarter, delivered above our guidance in Q4, and we were able to pull in some deals.
At the same time, we saw some deals in Q1 push out into the rest of the year. But our pipeline of big deals remains extremely solid. Has nothing at all to do with the competitive nature. In fact, I think we would say our competitors are helping us by pushing customers to migrate off their current and existing platforms, pushing them to the cloud. And when that happens, it opens up more opportunity for us. So I think our win rates are solid, our discount rates have remained consistent. And when customers ultimately make a decision on a big platform transformation, they're coming to Workday. Perfect. And then Zane, maybe just a follow-up on the headcount element on these renewals. I guess, how should we think about that as a persistent headwind across your renewal cohorts or your renewal base? Have you reflected that at least either in the revenue guide or your thinking in backlog for the back half of the year? Is there a way to quantify how much of a persistent headwind if there's kind of lower employee headcount, that renewal dynamic persists? What are we thinking here? Yes, it's a good call out. We're assuming it remains consistent throughout the year. And to your point and I think where you're alluding to, it actually didn't impact us as much on the revenue side in Q1. But we expect it to persist through the year, which is why I mentioned that half of the change we made in our subscription revenue forecast for the year was attributable to this headcount dynamic that we're seeing with our customers. But we're assuming no change from the current environment as we look at the remainder of the year. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Q1 is generally lighter seasonally for Workday, but the commentary throughout the call suggests you're seeing more than just seasonal. So maybe I was hoping you could just level set how you assess how much is seasonal versus persistent. And to Alex's prior question, if we are in a world of lower headcount for longer, maybe speak to any offsets you see on the product side, whether it's consolidation, some of the AI-related product efforts you're working on or something else you have in your playbook just to potentially help offset some of that. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes, Q1 obviously is always a more seasonally challenged quarter for us. That being said, we mentioned a couple of factors that changed in the quarter and those dynamics were around the deal scrutiny. As we mentioned, we had lower performance internationally, specifically in EMEA. And then those headcount trends coming in lower than our forecast, and all of that led to us adjusting our guidance for the full year.
As it relates to products and specifically AI, we're really encouraged by some of the things we're seeing as early and leading indicators around AI. On my prepared remarks, we talked about a couple of AI SKUs that are growing quite quickly, including talent optimization. We talked about Extend and now Extend Pro, which has our AI Gateway as part of it, growing very quickly, one of our fastest-growing SKUs ever.
And we're also really excited around what we see with HiredScore, the acquisition for talent -- an AI-driven talent acquisition platform that we closed in the quarter. The pipeline there is building nicely. And then lastly, I would say there's a couple of other dynamics out there that we're seeing in the market. When we spend time talking to our customers, they are always asking us, ""What are you guys doing around AI? And how can we leverage the massive data set that you have for both us and your broader customer base to leverage AI?"" Because they are not looking to go spend money on another AI platform or some thin veneer solution that says they're AI. We are seeing quite a bit of activity within our customer base, and they're focused on leveraging all the AI capabilities we have. And where we see fit, we're monetizing it like the examples I just articulated. All very helpful. And actually, Michael, one other thing I think was in my prepared remarks. We're launching the AI Marketplace this quarter, and we launched and spoke about it at Rising last year. It's actually going and will be up and running in production, and we'll be able to monetize our partners who will be part of the AI Marketplace starting this quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. I wanted to maybe double back on to the philosophical debate on margin versus growth. So look, you're guiding to about 15.5% subscription growth in the back half of the year. I understand all the macro pieces. At the same time, you're raising margin guide. I'd have to wonder with kind of initiatives around AI, with using the partner channel, innovating on product, I'd have to imagine that it would maybe make sense that at some point, macro is going to turn better, right? That this is not sales execution, this is not competition, and maybe the market starts to grow faster.
I guess, why not kind of keep your foot on the accelerator when it comes to investments, especially given all these opportunities and how expensive AI workloads are to position yourself better for when macro eventually does turn better, and you're not going to kind of get caught underinvested? Help me kind of understand that philosophy. Yes, Rishi, you've pointed out a number of areas that we continue to invest in. And obviously, we're encouraged, as I mentioned, by the returns we're getting on those investments. We're also being thoughtful on the pace of those investments and as we build up those investments over time. So we feel like we're in a great position where we can continue to grow the top line, and then also as we scale this business, just be thoughtful around all the areas where we can benefit from internally, whether it's using AI internally. It's just being more productive internally, having a workforce around the globe as we become more international ourselves.
So there are a number of areas, and we don't want to put -- let our foot off the accelerator on the top line. And then candidly, we just want to be very thoughtful in where we make those investments and how we can leverage those. So we feel like we're well positioned to take advantage when things do turn around and with all the progress we've made in a number of the key areas that we've highlighted previously. Yes. And I would just add, listen, our philosophy and strategy has been consistent. We want to build a company that has durable long-term growth while expanding operating margins, and we're doing exactly that. We're finding operational efficiencies across the company while continuing to lean into our key investment areas like Financials. Our Financials business, as we articulated, has been really solid again this quarter.
Our units are up 20% year-over-year and it's pulling through full platform sales. We're leaning into the partner ecosystem, and we talked about all the goodness that's happening with our partners. We're not going to pull back on our partner investment. In fact, if anything, I want to lean deeper into it.
Internationally, while we had an air pocket in Q1 from a bookings perspective, let's not forget that greater than 50% of the TAM associated with our total market is outside the U.S. So we're going to continue to lean into the international opportunity. On the product side, we continued to invest in business quite deeply. We have a whole bunch of things that we showcased recently at our Innovation Summit. We have 50 different AI solutions in the market with 25 more coming out later this year. So we're investing in the business. What we're doing slightly better is we're more prudent internally on where we're investing those dollars. And that is paying off in sustained long-term growth and expanding operating margin simultaneously. Next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Carl, you guys called out health care and public as strong verticals. Are there certain verticals you'd call out that are seeing slower-than-expected headcount growth? And I know investors are going to poke in on this topic. But do you think that anything that's kind of AI productivity gains related and that's leading to slower headcount growth? Or what would you flag as causing this delta versus what you guys thought about entering the year? Yes, thanks for the question. Specifically on headcount growth, there are some industries, and I think you've seen it out there where we do see a bit slower headcount growth. Media and technology, to be specific, is definitely lower headcount growth than we anticipated from the past. Okay. And just on the -- just in terms of what do you think caused the delta versus what you guys were thinking at the beginning of the year? Is it macro-related? Is there anything AI-related that you'd call out? Yes. So as we indicated, we did reset our forecast for the full year on headcount growth. And it was down over last year and it came in under what we had actually forecasted. I think it's macro-related. Is that macro relation coming from AI? I don't think we're in a position to say that we see that yet. I just think in general, we're seeing people not expand their headcount growth. And in some cases, like you've seen in the high-tech market, which is a big vertical for us, they've actually had layoffs. And when it comes to time of renewal, we have to reset our numbers. And our final question will come from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Carl and Doug, just 1 question I had on the scrutinizing of larger deals that you're seeing. Is that at all reflecting that business cost optimization cycle could be slowing, that reducing vendors is less of a priority out there in budgets? I guess, are you seeing any changes in the number of products that you're replacing in deals that you want in the first quarter? Do you want to start with that, Doug? Yes. I mean, I guess the counter to that is that we're still seeing optimization in our customer base, meaning there's this rationalization of vendors and standardizing on our platform that we are seeing in customer base. This was uniquely 2 transformational large projects where they don't do any business with us today. And what that -- what comes with that is a large business transformation. There's more cautiousness. There's more roundtrips, there's more approvals is where we saw that. So I don't know that I'm prepared to say that, that era is over because of what we're seeing specifically within our customer base. Yes. Doug, I don't know if I have much to add other than our customer base is looking for Workday to consolidate their footprint around HR IT, no doubt. And we think we can do that because we have the platform and the extensibility to bring more and more applications on top of us. It's really the new deals, net new specifically in large enterprise on a global basis that we're seeing the scrutiny pick up. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments. Thank you, operator. I just want to take a few minutes to say something to the broader audience, and thank everyone. First, I would like to thank all the analysts for joining us today. And I'd also like to send a special thanks out to our Workmates, customers, and partners around the globe who continue to help fuel Workday's success.
As you heard from my prepared remarks, we continue to lean into our key growth areas, and I'm excited by the momentum we're building, including the full platform wins, Financials and industry wins and the growth of our partner ecosystem. And we're driving efficiencies across the business at the same time. We can optimize for investments we want to make by being much more smart about what we're doing internally, and we are committed to delivering a balance of growth and margin expansion. With that, I'd like to hand it back over to you, Ms. Operator to close today's call. And I wish everyone a great day, great evening, and a good summer. This concludes today's teleconference.

I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered another solid quarter, highlighted by 17% subscription revenue growth, 16% 12-month backlog growth and 25% non-GAAP operating margin. Though we continue to experience still scrutiny and moderated headcount growth within our customer base, our win rates remain high and our teams delivered a very solid Q2. I couldn't be prouder of our workmates and our partners for their continued focus on driving customer value and success. Right now, companies are focusing their investments on the areas that will help them increase productivity and improve their operations.
Workday gives them the ultimate advantage, we help them manage their 2 most fundamental elements of their business, their people and their money, all on a unified AI-powered platform. Workday empowers businesses to increase productivity deliver incredible employee experience and drive greater efficiencies across finance and because all our products are built on the foundation of our platform, our customers can unlock value faster and reduce total cost of ownership.
This is evident in the healthy growth we're seeing in full suite wins and in our balance of net new relationships and customer expansions. It's also contributing to our momentum which helped us debut in the prestigious Fortune 500 list in Q2. We couldn't be prouder to be amongst the largest, most influential companies in the U.S. with more than 60% of them being Workday customers. Businesses of all sizes, industries and geographies increasingly turn to Workday as their trusted partner. In Q2, we expanded with J.B. Hunt, Nissan, Target and Trinity Health, and we formed new relationships with Lam Research, the City of Cleveland, Colorado State University System and Johns Hopkins, among many others.
We strengthened our leadership in the HCM market globally with key wins including GE Venova, First Bus, Sunrise Senior Living, along with several notable wins in EMEA and APAC. And our continued investment in financials is helping us drive momentum across the platform.
In Q2, we officially crossed the 2,000 customer milestone in Workday Financial Management and Workday was ranked the market share leader for worldwide SaaS ERP revenue in 2023 by Gartner Research. From an industry perspective, we had a banner quarter in our longest-standing vertical, higher education, leading institutions, including Florida A&M, the University of Mississippi and [indiscernible] University, all selected Workday's full suite in Q2. [indiscernible] started as a Workday Adaptive Planning customer and added HCM in financial management in the quarter.
The partnership with Workday represents a significant milestone in their transformation journey to modernize systems and improve experiences for faculty, staff and students. We once again had strong momentum in health care with full suite wins at Grady Health System, Read Health and Children's National Medical Center. Our success in state and local government continued in Q2 as well with wins at Delaware County, County of San Joaquin and Santa Cruz County.
I also want to call out the expansion momentum we're seeing with Vinli and our ability to deliver a complete workforce management solution, spanning salaried employees to hourly, contingent, freelance and outsourced workers. Cushman & Wakefield Lowe's in Ryder truck, all added Banley in Q2. Beyond the wins, we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform. AutoNation, Barclays, CDW, Cross Country Mortgage, Forbis Mazars and Texas Roadhouse all successfully deployed on Workday in Q2.
Global growth continues to be a massive opportunity for Workday, and we had a strong performance in APAC and Japan regions in Q2, along with several strategic wins in EMEA. In Australia, Workday was accepted to the government's digital transformation agency software marketplace for ERP, opening new opportunities with federal agencies. We also expanded our business with a ministry in New Zealand and had a full suite win at [indiscernible] Group Ltd. We're setting a strong foundation for our business in Japan, which performed very well in Q2. We formed new relationships with Terumo Corporation and Shizen Energy and expanded our business with Tokyo Electron.
In Europe, we experienced the same deal scrutiny I discussed in Q1, but the team was able to deliver more large deals in last quarter, including MAEs, St. Gobain and Group Atlantic synergy. Additionally, our Elevate events across the region in Q2 outperformed our pipeline expectations and our partner momentum is building in key markets across EMEA. In fact, two of the largest deals we closed in the region were sourced from partners. We innovate to drive customer success and deliver true business value and that's why customers are coming to Workday for our AI innovation.
They want to partner and they're looking to us to lead them into the future. Workday AI is fueled by the quality and quantity of our data set in Workday's understanding of our customers' HR and finance processes. We now have more than 70 million users under contract, conducting more than 800 billion transactions on the Workday platform annually. This data and the context behind it gives us the ability to unlock productivity in a way no other company can. In Q2, we announced new AI innovations to help our customers hire the right talent, better and faster than ever before. For instance, our new AI capabilities in our HCM product identify emerging skills and simplify job profile management to accelerate skills-based talent strategies. Just one quarter after closing the HiredScore acquisition, we made HiredScore AI for recruiting and HiredScore AI for talent mobility available for purchase under 1 unified contract. The HiredScore team is off to a great start, and we're continuing to build pipeline across our recruiting customers. And what better validation than this quote from our customer as Southwest Airlines who called HiredScore, a game changer that's setting new standards in talent management.
Through the power of our platform, we're enabling AI innovation not only from Workday, but from our customers and partners as well. In Q2, at our annual developer conference, we launched new APIs in our AI gateway. We also introduced Workday Extend Developer CoPilot, leveraging Gen AI to help developers to build custom applications on our platform faster than ever before. Xtend remains one of our fastest-growing SKUs. New ACV increased more than 75% in Q2, driven by Xtend Pro, which taps into the power of Workday AI. Many of our customers are already realizing incredible value from Workday AI. For example, a HiredScore for talent mobility customer saw a 40% increase in internal application rates. For one of our entertainment customers, invoice automation is driving 70% plus increase in processing capabilities. And for another customer, our talent optimization product, which is one of our fastest-growing SKUs helped reduce turnover by 39%, and the list goes on, but we're just scratching the surface.
The industry has been focusing on fitting AI into how we work now, not on what work should look like next. We see an opportunity to exponentially increase the value to our customers by reimagining end-to-end HR and finance processes through the power of AI. At Workday Rising, we will introduce the next generation of AI to illuminate the future of work. For the past 10 years, we've been building towards this vision and we're excited to showcase Workday innovations that will not only accelerate how work gets done, but ultimately transform how customers run their businesses. We're expecting more than 30,000 virtual and in-person attendees at Rising this year, our biggest event yet, in addition to unveiling our AI vision will also showcase due innovations across our applications, platform and user experience.
I mentioned before that our partner ecosystem is a powerful driver of customer success and it continues to grow in both breadth and depth. In Q2, partner contributions to new ACV more than doubled from last quarter and partners had another record quarter of pipeline generation, and we're just getting started. In the quarter, we launched build on Workday to make it easy for our partners to build, distribute and monetize their applications on the Workday platform.
Our long-standing partner, Kainos, was among the first to lean into this new program with several more partners already active early adopters. We continue to open the aperture to our partners as a driver of both sales and innovation. And in Q2, we announced new partnerships that will help us deliver even greater value.
Our partnership with Salesforce is a perfect example, whether it's accelerating employee onboarding, enabling continuous financial planning or closing deals faster, our partnership is bringing humans and AI together to drive success for employees and customers, and it's all made possible by bringing together the most important data sets in the enterprise. And today, we are announcing a new employment verification connector for Equifax, making it easier for customers to transmit data for employment verification requests.
As you can see, it was a big quarter for our ecosystem, and we are looking forward to continuing this momentum in partner-led growth. Before I turn it over to Zane, I'd like to update you on how we're planning for the medium term. We continue to build Workday as a durable business with balanced growth and margin expansion, something I've been saying since I joined the company nearly 2 years ago. Our key growth areas are already paying off and creating momentum for our future. They amplify our opportunity to bring in new customers and to expand our footprint with existing customers.
Over the past year, we've been able to see how our growth areas are developing particularly in the current selling environment, and we've identified opportunities to drive efficiencies across the business. In light of this, we're making some adjustments to our medium-term plans including a slightly moderated pace of subscription revenue growth balanced with accelerated margin expansion. Our revised medium-term outlook reflects the confidence we have to drive durable, profitable growth at scale. We're focused on continuing to gain share in our core markets of HR and finance, while delivering strong operating income growth and continuing to innovate for our customers and partners. I couldn't be more excited and energized about the opportunity ahead, and we are thrilled to have you on the ride with us. With that, I'll turn it over to Zane. Thanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call.
Our Q2 performance was slightly ahead of our expectations across all key metrics. Subscription revenue in the second quarter was $1.903 billion, up 17%. Professional services revenue was $182 million in the quarter, leading to total revenue in Q2 of $2.085 billion, also a growth of 17%. U.S. revenue in Q2 totaled $1.56 billion, up 16% and international revenue totaled $524 million, growing 18%. 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $6.8 billion at the end of Q2, representing growth of 16%. The year-over-year growth rate was impacted by the strength in last year's renewal activity, including early renewals. Gross and net revenue retention rates remained strong at over 95% and over 100%, respectively.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $21.58 billion, up 21%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $518 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24.9%. Q2 operating cash flow was $571 million, growing 34% driven by strong collections. We accelerated the pace of our buyback in Q2, repurchasing $309 million of our shares at an average price of $223.10 per share. With our existing $500 million buyback authorization nearing completion, our Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.
We remain committed to investing in organic growth, pursuing strategic M&A opportunities and managing dilution while returning excess capital to shareholders via share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of July 31, headcount stood at over 19,900 workmates around the globe.
Now turning to guidance. As Carl indicated, we continue to see the macro environment consistent with our last quarter including moderated headcount growth within our customer base. And as we discussed last quarter, we expect these trends to continue. We are reiterating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance of $7.7 billion to $7.725 billion, growth of approximately 17%. We expect Q3 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.955 billion, growth of 16%. We expect FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $680 million to $690 million, driven by customer demand. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $175 million.
Turning to backlog. In Q3, we expect CRPO growth also to be impacted by last year's strong early renewal activity. As a reminder, last year, the gap between CRPO growth and subscription revenue growth was roughly 4 percentage points in Q3. As we lap the strong renewal activity from last year, we expect CRPO growth of 14% to 15% for Q3. While the growth rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, the aggregate CRP level supports our view of subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% for the second half of the year. We continue to balance both targeted investments in key growth areas with increased focus on end-to-end company-wide efficiencies and transformation. We now expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margin of 25.25%. For Q3, we also expect non-GAAP operating margin of 25.25%. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 19 and 20 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively.
The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We're increasing our FY '25 operating cash flow expectations to $2.350 billion, and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $330 million. Over the past year, we've made good progress across our key growth areas. While a number of these initiatives are still in their early development, they are already supporting growth in FY '25 as well as for future years as they scale across our products and geographies. Our focus areas have been ramping over the past year, providing us better insight into how their growth trajectories augment our core business. As we incorporate this into our planning, along with the current environment, we now expect subscription revenue growth in the mid-teens for both FY '26 and FY '27. We're seeing success across full suite opportunities, the partner ecosystem and international markets, along with emerging areas like federal and bolt-on Workday, which helped reinforce our conviction in enduring growth as we strengthen our market leadership in cloud ERP. In addition, we now expect to deliver greater margin expansion than previously planned. Investing to support durable growth remains a core focus and at the same time, we've made progress driving efficiencies as we continue to scale the business globally.
We are relentlessly focused on scaling all of our processes across the company as we review our product and go-to-market initiatives. We're also becoming increasingly more targeted in our growth investments, balancing product developments with go-to-market resources. With this, we are driving to enhance ROI across our portfolio, while we continue to execute on opportunities to drive growth in the business. With that context and assuming M&A levels consistent with recent history, our updated expectations for FY '26 and FY '27 of our annual subscription revenue growth of approximately 15%, while expanding non-GAAP operating margin to 30% over the same period.
This updated framework also increases our expected FY '27 cash flow. Our focus remains leveraging the power of the platform to deliver durable, long-term top and bottom line growth. We look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 17. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore. And I appreciate the early update on the midterm outlook as we look forward to seeing you guys out in Vegas in a few weeks. But Carl, can you just talk about where you think you can get some additional efficiency at scale while still investing obviously in places like international. I'm sure you go through this a little bit at the Analyst Day. But I was just kind of curious where are some places that you guys can continue to get that efficiency because I know you're not going to want to stop investing in some of these green shoots that you're seeing right now? Yes. Thanks, Kirk, for the question. And by the way, thanks for your preview note. I thought it was really well written. And as you can see, a lot of the things you highlighted in your preview note, we actually spoke about in our prepared remarks. And part of it is what you just asked. I want to start by just reinforcing our thesis for long-term profitable growth at scale at Workday. We remain very excited about the opportunity we have ahead and we think we'll continue to take share in our core markets around HR and finance, while at the same time continuing to innovate and drive additional operating efficiencies as we think about the broader market.
As far as where we think we can get efficiencies, let me start and remind people by saying, over the last 2.5 years, we've expanded our operating margin by 500 basis points and now we're talking about moving it up another 500 basis points over the next few years. So we are finding efficiencies. Some examples of where we'll find efficiencies is in our global workforce strategy, which includes leveraging our current global workforce as well as some of the new offices we brought online in the last 6 to 12 months, like India and Costa Rica.
We're also being smart and prudent about what we're hiring going forward. And specifically, we're focusing on quota carrying capacity as well as continuing to invest in software development on our product and technology side of the business. We also are finding operating efficiencies internally across our systems and our technology. We're using AI in our finance organization, we're using AI in our call centers and our support organization. And we're also using AI like copilots and software development to drive efficiencies.
And the last thing I'd say, Kirk, to kind of combine your questions here is: number one, some of the investment areas we've leaned into over the last 2 years are actually starting to drive operating efficiencies and scale for us. For example, we spent a lot of time talking about partners. We've highlighted once again our partners today continue to drive a significant portion of our pipeline. And actually, we're responsible for a 2x growth in new ACV from what they participated or drove in Q1. We're actually starting to see scale now with the big build-out we did in our financial sales force. They're all starting to ramp, and we're seeing better productivity going forward.
So there are a number of different areas that we're investing in, and it's actually not only helping us maintain this durable growth over the next 2 years, but it's also giving us operational efficiencies at the same time. Kirk, I'll just add, this is Zane. We look at all of these investments with an ROI mentality and as you've seen over the last number of years where we've outperformed and really leaned in, we've been able to drive bottom line growth and increase our operating margin even versus our expectation. So should expect to hear a little more in this area in 3.5 weeks in Vegas, but we're pleased with the progress, have a lot of work to do. We feel like we're never done on just coming up with more efficiencies across the business. Our next question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Good to see that you guys have taken a more balanced approach to growth and margin. One short-term question, one long term, if I could. Short term, the impact of elections and potentially lower rates, how do you see this playing out, Carl? I know that you were not here 8 years ago, but Aneel famously warned about volatility in the upcoming Q4 back then and ended up surprising us on the upside as contract activity and renewal activity happened on the upside. So what is your take on the short term?
And then one for you, Zane. Longer term, the expansion in margin, how comfortable can we get that it's not coming at the expense of the ability to reinvigorate growth if you do see that opportunity to open up if we get a better spending environment. Yes. Thanks, Kash. I'll take the first one. Listen, I can't predict the future and the impact of the election one way or the other. But what I do know is the current macro environment we're selling into hasn't changed at all from what we saw in Q1. In fact, we think the current environment of IT spending in the environment we're selling into isn't something that's just been here the last couple of quarters. We think it's the new norm going forward. We're prepared because we have a great product. We provide a tremendous value proposition to both customers and prospects. And regardless of what we're dealing with in the macro or the elections, we're going to continue to grow our business over the short term and long term because of that powerful value proposition we have. Yes. And Kash, just to add your question on longer term, I mean we've done a good job investing and measuring those investments when it's opportunity for us to increase that investment level depending upon growth or where it comes from, we'll be agile and quick to adjust accordingly. But we feel good that we can grow both the top line and the bottom line in this business and make sure that we're investing sufficiently to continue that growth and innovation across the company. So we feel like we've got a good balance here. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Carl, how would you characterize the cross currency of AI on the software landscape in Workday itself at the moment. The reason I ask is you're sitting on this wealth of of data. You have the sole ability to unlock it. You're not overcharging for AI services like others are, and I'm wondering if that is giving you some type of advantage in the actual AI product adoption and usage somehow under the radar. But then on the other side of the ledger, as you do retweak the growth in margin, the midterm target, do you sense any customers pausing to digest application purchases broadly, just as they're trying to understand the GPU landscape, the AI landscape at the infrastructure layer. Yes. So I think there was two questions in there, Mark. So I'll try to answer both of them. First, I'll talk about our approach to monetization. So first, we've said we're going to take a very measured multipronged approach to how we monetize AI. First and foremost, we're monetizing it to our competitive win rates that are up once again this quarter. Our renewal rates remain very high and our customer satisfaction remains very strong. We are also, at the same time, not rushing to market and saying to our customers, we're going to have an uplift on our pricing just because we have now had more than 50, for example, AI use cases in the platform. We think they're entitled to that innovation.
We will, though, when we see opportunity to do so, Mark, we will bring new SKUs to market where we can help our customers justify spending incremental dollars on AI from Workday. For example, power optimization, talent optimization is one of our fastest-growing SKUs, extend and now Xtend Pro. Xtend Pro is an AI platform that allows people to develop and build new applications on top of us. There's a new AI API Gateway associated. We have a copilot to help people develop software faster, leveraging the AI API. And we also, as you know, last quarter talked about HiredScore. HiredScore is something we're very excited about. We're in the very early days of this going into the market, but we're seeing a rapid build of the pipeline as people are trying to reduce their recruiting spend because it's one of the biggest spends they have across their platform today when it comes to recruiting.
And now let me address what we're seeing because we get asked this question all the time, Mark, are we seeing people spend on AI and not spend, for example, in our case, on Workday. We see just the opposite. What we see and we hear from our customers, our customers believe and new prospects as we engage with them, they are investing in AI when they invest and partner with Workday. The reason for that is because of what you said. I think customers are now recognizing the value of AI in Gen AI is only as good as the data you're using to train and we have one of the most clean, highly curated data sets around HR and finance to drive value for our customers, and we think that's a huge differentiator for us both today and going forward, and we can't wait to share more of the AI innovation with everyone, including the entire world at Rising in September. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Carl, many have asked your confidence in mid-teens growth. What is giving you that underpinning of that the market is going to be there versus continuing to ratchet that number down, which you have lowered that growth rate a bit. What is still giving you the confidence that, that market is still still in place? Well, there's a number of reasons, I think, not just myself, but all of us here at work, they are confident in that 15% growth rate for the foreseeable future. And that's as we scale beyond $10 billion. Number one, the investments we've made, for example, in our partner community and the ecosystem are paying off. They're building pipeline, they're innovating on top of the platform. They're co-selling with us, they're reselling with us, and we see them continuing to lean into the Workday opportunity more than we've ever seen in the past. We still believe we have a tremendous opportunity internationally. We've hired some amazing talent across Europe.
In the last 6 months, we talked about new leadership in APAC and in Japan, and we highlighted some of the success I had here this quarter and we continue to believe that more than 50% of our addressable market opportunity is outside the U.S. that we can go attack. We also continue to believe in the opportunity around financials. As all of you know, for the last couple of years, we've leaned in heavily to the financials opportunity because we still see greater than 75% of workloads on-premises and they're moving to the cloud. It's not if, it's when. And
when they move to the cloud, we see competitive run rates on our financial platform and full suite or full platform financial solutions with Workday and HCM continuing to rise. And the last thing that gives us confidence is innovation. We are driving so much innovation on the Workday platform, leveraging AI and Gen AI. We also continue to believe that the ecosystem will innovate on top of us leveraging a powerful platform called Xtend. And then finally, M&A, we are -- I'd say we're inquisitive. We continue to believe there's assets out there that we can look at to help us continue or maintain our growth, but we're going to be smart and prudent as we think about it. So that's the reason that gives us confidence to be able to drive this profitable growth at scale for the next few years. Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America. I wanted to ask a question, Carl, on some of the comments you made earlier. It sounds like you took a hard look at some of the growth initiatives to determine which ones are going well and which ones perhaps could be sources of upside that they're now backing that 15% -- or sorry, the mid-teens rather growth outlook. Just curious for some color, if you will, on what were some of the puts and takes? What were some of those growth initiatives that you felt more bullish about after having gone through the 1-year review process, which are ones that could perhaps be potential sources of incremental growth future. Yes. Thanks for the question, Brad. We did pause and we looked at all of our growth initiatives. Some of them I just articulated answering the prior question from Brent. And I must admit, as we sat and looked at them and as we sit here today, we think the growth initiatives we lean into are the right ones, the opportunity around financials, the international opportunity. We thought very hard about the investment we've made in financials, and we think that's the right one. The partner community is clearly paying off. So I don't think at this time when we look at those growth initiatives, we would have pulled back on any of them. We're moderating how we're thinking about it going forward. But I think we have the right investments in the growth opportunities, and that's what gives us confidence and conviction to go attack this big market opportunity we have globally. So again, I wouldn't pull back on any of them the right investments. They've already started to pay dividends throughout last year and this year, and we think we'll be able to lean into them even more as we go forward. One of the things that's really important as we think about driving operating margin expansion by doing so and becoming more efficient, it allows us to continue to invest back in the business across both technology go-to-market and potential acquisitions. It all comes together through this durable growth that we're mapping out over the next few years. Brad, I would just add, Carl talked about the M&A component. We remain curious in the market. But for the last year, you haven't seen significant M&A on our side driving any incremental growth either as you contemplate the updated outlook. So that's a component of it as well. Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. I was hoping to go back to what drove the change in town towards more margin here. I think it's what investors been hoping for, but maybe you could speak to the thought process there and confidence you have in managing the trade-offs and giving a bit more margin here, but making sure you're still well positioned for any rebound. I think there's a couple of things. The current environment that we're selling into. We actually think that's the normal IT spend environment that we'll be seeing going forward. It's not something every quarter we're going to say, how does it compare to last quarter? How does it compare one quarter to next year or year-over-year. We think this is now a normalized and the new norm of IT spend. That on the back of some of the growth initiatives that we just talked about, we think this is what gives us conviction and confidence in this 15% growth profile going forward. We also think by driving more operating margin, it gives us more OpEx dollars to invest in these key growth initiatives as well.
So we take a look at the market. We take a look at the opportunity. We take a look at how we're driving the business, our growth initiatives and all of this came together for us to think about, you know what, we can drive really durable growth over a long period of time, and we can do it profitably while all investing in the business. Yes, I would just add, we've come to a better understanding as far as each of these areas of growth, what they cost, how we think about those returns over a multiyear period. Carl mentioned some that require some upfront cost, but we're able to actually ramp a number of those initial investments over this multiyear period. And then there's just increased focus and discipline around spend across the company. We recognize we need to focus on efficiencies, systems, people and process and we're heavily involved in looking at all of those as we scale the business. So we're excited about the future. We believe we can truly invest and innovate and yet still drive margin improvement, and you've seen us do it over the last number of years. So we just want to continue that momentum. Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Thank you for the long-term outlook for me as well. Carl, if you think about the growth in the market, and I get it that you kind of -- what we see now is what [indiscernible] happen there. if you compare the current times and what you're assuming your planning assumption to, what we've seen in the past in terms of spending behaviors and the take bubbles the way, is this kind of what you think is kind of also long term, something that will continue like this? Or is this like for the foreseeable future, let's kind of work with the planning assumptions that there could be a better market at some point in the future.
We don't know when, but at some point. Just trying to understand like has the market changed towards kind of a different growth trajectory? Or is it just like what we see in the economy at the moment? Yes. As I said earlier, we think the current environment is the new norm, and that's what we're basing our medium-term outlook on. That being said, things could change in one direction or the other. We could get tailwinds and we could get employment and headcount growth. We've taken a moderated approach when we look at headcount. We think people who are doing large transformations of their HR and their finance systems today, at times, they pause and they think about it and they sweat their existing asset a bit longer. And when they do so, oh, by the way, those opportunities don't leave our pipeline at all. And in fact, a lot of times the customer chooses Workday and they just push it out a quarter or 2. Things like that could reaccelerate.
So we think it is a new norm. Do we think things can change in the future. They potentially can. And if so, and we get more tailwind, we'll update our model as we think about the next few years. But right now, we do think the current environment is consistent in what we'll see going forward. Perfect. And then a question for Zane. If you think about like Workday historically has been probably over-indexing on R&D and probably indexing a little bit of sales and marketing. As we think about the efficiencies going forward, et cetera, how do you think about that mix between those 2 major drivers. Sure. Yes. Broadly, I would say it is a mix, and there's always opportunity. We've looked at both innovation, R&D spend and how AI can actually help those efforts. And we've got a terrific team. We're doing a lot of innovating, a lot of building out the product and a lot of growing. So I would say, look, it's balanced across all areas. Even on the G&A side, we all believe we can continue to not only innovate, but be more efficient and really think about as we grow around the globe, how we balance that growth with a workforce that's better represented around the globe as well. So I'd say, generally speaking, opportunities on both sides, but we're leveraging those investments we are making. We're also excited about road maps and all the investments that we're making for the future as well. Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. So you set your midterm free cash flow margin target at 25%, which was pretty well right on top of your non-GAAP operating margin target. So given that you're raising the latter by 500 bps to 30%, I can imagine some people on the call will just raise the free cash flow margin up to 35 to keep that relationship solid. I don't know whether you want to comment on that or maybe punt to the Investor Day. But just on this call, is there any reason why that correlation between those two metrics might be different than what you were thinking a year ago? Sure, Karl. Yes, broadly speaking, I would say, yes, but I don't want to give you all the answers because I'd still want to see you at Investor Day in 3.5 weeks. I mean I would point out that we're still ramping a number of industries where the payments don't initially correlate with the revenue. These are industries like Edge and other industries like federal, where we've seen good growth there. We're also a taxpayer in the U.S. now. So stay tuned for what we'll disclose in 3.5 weeks. I don't want to get ahead of myself, at least some material for then. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I guess maybe for me, you talked about, a little bit about the vertical, what you're seeing from a pipeline perspective? Should we expect kind of the same vertical strength that we saw in the first half to drive the bookings strength in the second half? And then on the midterm targets, particularly on margins, should we expect that to be linear? Should we expect that to be more back-end loaded and M&A in the context, it sounds like there's no change to the kind of M&A strategy that you guys have conducted. I just want to be sure that's what you're implying in the midterm target setting. Zane, why don't you start to take the last question and I'll jump in. Sure. Yes, as we think about that growth, I'd say, evenly balanced, similar to what I mentioned to Carl will give you a little bit more detail on that in 3.5 weeks. But generally speaking, evenly balanced, maybe a little more skewed towards FY '27. But we've got a number of initiatives, and obviously, we're pleased to see the growth that we've seen even this year. So more to come on that front. I'll hand it over to Carl for... Yes. And on the industry verticals, we highlighted some in the script, but I'd ask Doug to give a little bit more color on what we're seeing there. Alex, Doug here. My ears perked up when you asked about pipeline. So at pipeline growth in the industry, as you know us to be strong and is where we're seeing continued strength. So that includes health care, of course, but also higher education and we think both health care and higher education are multiyear opportunities for Workday for full suite. In addition to that, state and local, and increasingly, the federal business and hope to share more good news around the Fed business in the second half of the year with you as it progresses. Perfect. And then maybe just if I sneak one more in. If I think about the construction of the growth curve over the next couple of years when we think about your success going down market, versus some of the trends we're seeing in large enterprise. What percentage of -- how do we think about that balance? We used to ask that question about financials versus HCM. But if we actually recast it more to the lower end of the market versus the higher end of the market? How would -- how would you characterize it? Yes. So let me answer that question. As you know, we've had historically had a lot of success in large enterprise and in industries and verticals like Doug just mentioned, and we've been pushing down into what we call the medium enterprise or the emerging enterprise quite aggressively. One of the reasons we're doing that is because we're having a lot of success selling full suite or full platform deals, which is a combination of both financials as well as HCM.
And we continue to see that as an area of strength for us going forward. We've modified our pricing and our packaging for those markets. We've also now have new delivery capabilities to accelerate deployment. So customers get better and faster value from the medium enterprise market. And our partners are also leaning in and helping us drive faster adoption in that market as well.
So the media enterprise, both here in the U.S. We've taken the playbook from the U.S. We're pushing it globally. It's in the U.K., and it's spreading throughout Europe, and we'll be doing the same in APAC. So it's an area of strength. It's an area of opportunity and it's something we'll continue to lean into on the go-to-market side as well as the product side as we think about pricing and packaging. We will now be taking two more questions. Our next question is from Derek Wood with TD Cowen. I guess for Zane, I know you called out pockets of slower headcount growth during renewals in Q1. So I'd be curious: a, are you seeing this broaden out to more verticals aside from the ones you called out last quarter in tech and retail; and b, are you able to quantify what the degree of change is? Like what was the average headcount growth historically? And what do you think in the new normal is? And did you adjust for these assumptions in your new medium-term growth outlook? Derek, yes, this is Zane. If we look quarter-to-quarter, our assumptions have been very similar to what they were in the first quarter that we extrapolated for the year. We've seen consistency there. We made the adjustment for the year. If you recall, last time, I think I mentioned it was approximately $17 million over the extent of the year. So no significant change there, if anything, on a quarter-to-quarter level, we believe the baseline has been about the same. So it's been consistent. We consider it the new norm. It's contemplated in both our FY '25 guide as well as our midterm guide. It's not a significant impact on revenue or bookings as we think about it today. Our last question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. My question is for Carl or perhaps Doug. Curious if there are specific areas within fins that you're particularly excited about because we still keep hearing great things about accounting center, not just in financial services but across verticals and even down market. But what would you call out as particularly exciting that can compel customers to adopt and maybe even drive upside ahead. Yes, Doug, do you want to take that. Yes, I'll go first. Brad, nice to hear from you. You hit the first one, I'd hit, which is accounting center. And increasingly, as we've dedicated teams to vertical organizations and vertical selling by industry, each of them with solution consulting have come up with really interesting and innovative use cases for accounting center across industry. So while the original thesis of accounting center go back 5 years or so, 5 plus years, was for FSI and to support that vertical, it now is selling across industry, as you point out.
The second one I'd point out is student, and so student changes the game in higher ed and can drive sort of not just full suite opportunities, but pull through that, what you would consider operational ERP in that particular industry. So as I answered the earlier question around industries where we see strong pipeline growth, and I mentioned a multiyear opportunity for both health care and higher education. Those are two that get me excited. Another one, Doug, might be workforce planning. We think there's a tight correlation between our HCM platform and financials and workforce planning is something we continue to see momentum, which is an adaptive product that we got a few years ago. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Eschenbach for closing comments. Thank you, operator, and thank you again to everyone on the call today. Before we go, I'd like to give a special thanks to our workmates, customers and partners around the world who continue to fuel Workday's growth and success. We're heading into the second half of our fiscal year with strong customer momentum and exciting innovation on our road map, and we clearly have a strategy to support our durable growth at scale. Workday's value proposition, I believe, and all of my workmates believe, has never been stronger. Organizations of all sizes, geographies and industries are turning to us to manage their most precious and most important assets. That's their people and their money, and it's all on an AI-powered platform. And with the new innovations we're launching at Rising, we've never been better positioned to lead them into the future. I look forward to seeing you at Rising and Financial Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. Operator, we can now close the call, and thank you again for everyone attending. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.","we will hand the call over to Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; Doug Robinson, our co-President; and David Somers, our Chief Product Officer . this call is being simultaneously webcast .",1.0
