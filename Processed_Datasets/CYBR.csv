At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today's call Ms. Erica Smith, you may begin. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Udi Mokady. Udi. Thanks, Erica, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. CyberArk kicked off 2018 with a great quarter and we are very happy with our results. We exceeded our guidance growing revenue by 22% to $72 million, generating $13 million in operating income representing an operating margin of 18% and $33 million in cash flow. We are off to a strong start which puts us in a great position for the remainder of the year.
Before we dive into the details from the quarter, I wanted to recap discussions I had with customers and prospects at the RSA Conference a couple weeks ago. We are all facing similar challenges. Hackers are innovating at light speed and organizations require protection against major impact factors such as the floatation of cryptocurrency, the evolution of ransomware and the tax on critical infrastructure.
The regulatory environment is becoming more rigorous, particularly with the GDPR compliance deadline looming. Automated processes inherent in cloud and DevOps are not only driving improved efficiency and productivity but are also creating privileged accounts and secrets faster than at any time in history.
This is exponentially expanding the attack surface. However, our Global Advanced Threat Landscape Report indicated that 50% of organizations have no privileged active security strategy for the cloud, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Almost every discussion at RSA emphasized the need for measurable security solutions across cloud, hybrid, and on premise, more collaboration among vendors and empowerment, in this new world, Chief Security Officers are demanding the security enabled business operations.
These customer trends certainly contributed to our results in the first quarter. The DevOps revolution is in full swing and security is an enabler for digital transformation. Organizations are leveraging faster code development as a key competitive advantage. They recognize securing credentials and machine identities is a critical component to the long-term success of these strategic initiatives.
During the first quarter, we were pleased to see that eight of our top 10 deals included Application Identity Manager or Conjur and that more than 10% of our business came from this product family. As a reminder, Application Identity Manager is securing production applications, primarily running on premise, while Conjur is protecting high velocity applications and the DevOps pipeline.
In one of our largest new business deals during the quarter, a Global 500 Transportation company chose CyberArk to secure its hybrid environment across AWS, Azure and private cloud infrastructure as well as its DevOps pipeline. The customer will deploy Conjur, Application Identity Manager, Core Privileged Account Security and Endpoint Privilege Manager in the cloud.
The cloud and DevOps methodology are empowering this organization to drive more productivity and agility into its business. This global company is also an example of a Greenfield customer. During the first quarter, we continued to see the vast majority of our engagements are Greenfield opportunities, even in large global organizations.
We were thrilled to see the government vertical gaining momentum around the globe with major deals across geographies contributing to our success in the first quarter. We want a state government in the Americas for Core Privileged Account Security and Endpoint Privilege Manager.
We signed our largest ever government customer in APJ to protect both human and machine identities for our healthcare system in the region and we want our largest UK government customer who will secure privilege credentials across the entire agency. In each of these seven figure deals the customer recognize that unsecure, unmanaged privileged accounts are a top security and business risk.
One of our key initiatives for 2018 is to maximize the effectiveness of our global sales and marketing engine across both new and existing customers. We were pleased with the strong new business momentum and we ended the first quarter with more than 3800 customers.
In the mid market, we continue to see traction with law firms, universities and hospitals, among other organizations. In early April, we rolled out our first multitenant offering from managed security service providers, which can be licensed based on construction pricing. Our partners can now further extend privileged access security through organizations of all sizes, including deeper into the mid market.
Add on business was also robust in Q1. Existing customers continue to take a strategic approach to privileged access security, rolling out multiphase CyberArk programs. We are on pace for third of our customers to expand their CyberArk employment again this year. Examples of expanded relationships during the first quarter includes seven figure deals with the top 20 pharmaceutical company, a top five manufacturing company and two of the world's top 15 banks.
As we discussed in detail in our investor day in March, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our customer base across parameters like geography, vertical market and customer size. Our analysis of customers spent indicates that we have penetrated only about 20% of our customers potential, representing tremendous run way for growth just within our base.
Geographically all of our regions performed well. The Americas and APJ delivered record quarters for revenue, which we are very pleased to see in the first quarter of the year. With the organizational changes we made in the EMEA the region grew 29% in first quarter, Rich Turner joined CyberArk in Q1 EMEA he is working closely with the entire team on delivering consistent performance in 2018. They are off to a great start.
Another important component of our go to market strategy is extending our reach through our global ecosystem of channel and technology partners. During the quarter, our global channel business represented more than 60% of the business.
In addition, advisory firms like PWC and Deloitte continued to invest and build out their CyberArk practices as they recognize that securing privileged accounts is critical to a comprehensive security strategy. We saw nearly 60% increase in business influenced by the advisory firms in the first quarter of 2018 compared to last year.
Our C³ Alliance continues to be a key differentiator with prospects and customers who are looking to simplify the implementation of their best of breed security strategies. With the C³ marketplace we expect our partner program to continue to drive business for CyberArk and just as importantly improve the security fabric across our customers environment.
The marketplace dramatically simplifies and extends the value of the Privileged Access Security to our more than 80 alliance partners. We are seeing strong tractions from customers across identity, business automation, cloud, orchestration and vulnerability management, among other segment.
During the quarter examples of C³ integrations that influence deals include OKTA, Sailpoint, Ping, ServiceNow, Rapid7, Tenable, AWS, Chef, Puppet and Ansible. Building an enduring cyber security leader requires multiple dimensions, including establishing and nurturing relationships with customers and partners, as well as an ongoing commitment to innovation.
The major enhancements to our solutions that we delivered in the fourth quarter contributed to our strong results in Q1. The new functionality focused on simplification, automation and risk reduction across cloud on premise and DevOps pipelines.
The response from our customers and prospects has been overwhelmingly positive. In addition, because of the investments we made in cloud automation last year, an increasing number of customers are deploying CyberArk in the cloud, including key wins in the first quarter by two leading SaaS application vendors and a global media company.
As we look at the evolution of the threat landscape, our innovation ensures our customers IT environments are better protected. The rate of cryptocurrency attacks is staggering, and only increasing making protecting cryptographic keys top of mind for many customers. Today, we are not only securing their IT infrastructure we are helping customers secure and manage the access keys themselves for cryptocurrency.
We are very excited about the acquisition of Vaultive in March. Customers were asking for CyberArk to secure access and implement proactive security controls for administrators of SaaS applications and infrastructure as a service as well as privileged business users, which are frequent targets for cyber attacks. We will leverage this technology, which can be delivered as a mobile or native experience to seamlessly extend our solution to the highly privileged users.
Vaultive’s cloud native technology platform was purpose built for mission-critical applications that require the highest level of availability, performance and control. Early customer response to the acquisition has been extremely positive. We are thrilled to have the team join CyberArk as their in-depth cloud experience, and state-of-the-art technology furthers our leadership in securing cloud infrastructure and applications.
It was a great quarter and we are off to a strong start for 2018. Our results reflect the momentum in the market, our investments in innovation, and the healthy demand for privileged access security across all geographies. Our execution in the first quarter, robust pipeline and industry leadership position us well to execute our strategy for the remainder of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh. Josh? Thanks, Udi. Before we begin reviewing the quarter I wanted to remind everyone that our first quarter results are in line with the new accounting standard 606 and we will be using what is referred to as the modified retrospective approach to disclosure.
So we are pleased to exceed our outlook across all the guiding metrics, including revenue, operating income and EPS. Total revenue increased by 22%, year-on-year to $71.8 million. License revenue reached 38.5 million increasing 17% over the first quarter last year and representing 54% of total revenue.
Our growth was driven by both add-on business as well as new customers who recognize the importance of privileged access security with new customers representing more than 40% of license revenue in the first quarter. Maintenance and professional services revenue was $33.3 million, increasing 28% over the prior year period and representing 46% of revenue.
Geographically, the Americas delivered another quarter of consistent results, increasing revenue by 18% year-on-year and reaching a record $44.1 million or 62% of total revenue, EMEA had a strong quarter, increasing revenue, 29% to $21.8 million or 30% of total revenue and APJ revenue grew 28% and also a record of $5.9 million for the region, or 8% of total revenue.
The business was also well diversified across verticals, energy, pharmaceuticals, global government, retail and transportation and travel all grew faster than 50% during the quarter. In fact, global government represented more than 15% of our overall business and that was driven by demand form national agencies in Europe and APJ as well as state and local governments in the Americas.
As I move through the P&L, all financial results will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our first quarter gross profit was $62.4 million, or 86.9% gross margin, compared to 86.5% gross margin in the same period last year.
We continue to invest in the business to capitalize on our significant market opportunity and scale our operations. R&D expense grew 45% year-on-year to $11.5 million as a result of a number of factors, including R&D headcount increasing by 27%, the weakening dollar as a vast majority of R&D employees that based on Israel, and the acquisition of Conjur in May last year and of Vaultive in March of this year, both now in the Q1 comparables of last year.
Sales and marketing increased 24% to $32 million, as we expanded our sales organization across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales. G&A increased 34% year-on-year to $6.3 million, as we scale the business to support our growth.
In total, operating expenses for the quarter increased 30% to $49.8 million compared with $38.3 million for the first quarter of last year. Operating income was ahead of our guidance at $12.6 million or 18% operating margin. This compared to operating income of $12.7 million or 22% operating margin in the year ago period.
Our overall expense growth is primarily related to headcount. We ended the first quarter with 1053 employees around the world up from 1015 at year-end and compared with 867 at the end of the first quarter of 2017. To scale the business, we moved into new global headquarters in Israel during the third quarter last year, as well as new offices in London and Singapore earlier this year in the first quarter.
These increased expenses are also not in the comparable period last year. Net income was $11.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter, we were pleased to generate $33.1 million in cash from operations or 46% cash flow margin.
The strong cash flow was driven by our strong results in the fourth quarter, as well as collections from our higher maintenance renewal activity. We ended the quarter with $344.2 million in cash and investments and this is after the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Vaultive during the first quarter. This compares to $330.3 million at year-end.
Turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect total revenue of $72 million to $73.5 million or 27% growth year-on-year at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $10.2 million to $11.4 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.23 to $0.25. This assumes 36.9 million weighted average diluted shares at a tax rate of 21% for the second quarter.
Our second quarter guidance reflects the full run rate of the people we hired in the first quarter, increased expenses related to the acquisition of Vaultive, as well as the RSA conference which occurred in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
For the full-year of 2018, we are increasing our guidance with total revenue to be in the range of $315 million to $319 million or a growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $57.5 million to $60.5 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of a $1.31 to a $1.37 this assumes 36.8 million weighted average diluted shares.
Our guidance for the full-year assumes effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2018 and that takes into account the lower tax rate in Israel as well as in the U.S. For the full-year our guidance assumes approximately $2.5 million in operating expenses, related to the acquisition of Vaultive.
As we think about the remainder of 2018, we wanted to point out that we expect to have a seasonal step up in expenses related to marketing events and other programs from the second quarter to the third quarter, which will be similar to what we experienced last year in 2017. We were pleased with our results in the first quarter, Privileged access security remains a top priority for organizations, and we are continuing to see strong demand for our solution.
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of us and I will now turn the call over to the operator for our Q&A. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Josh could you talk a little bit about some of the new pricing schemes and how you have changed them for the Core Privileged Account Security kind of portfolio and maybe what impact that might have had on deal sizes in the quarter? So just to quickly review, as you know, we have already had a big increase of customers buying EPV and PSM together for new business deals, as they take more and more of risk-based approach to Privileged Account Security. And so to simplify the pricing and strengthen our customer security posture, we have decided to enter a new pricing technique model which has EPV, PSM, PTM, and PTA for the new business deals, and based on pricing of per user, and we call this now the Core Privileged Account Security products and that’s been priced per user and our AM Conjur and our EPM continues to be priced on a per target system.
So, when we kind of look at the first quarter, actually a much of the business in the first quarter was still really off of closed, and deal cycles that were coming from last year, so there was still most of it coming off of the old price model with only a small sample with the new pricing model.
So it's still I think a bit early to tell, the impact on deal sizes, but what we are seeing is definitely a very positive reception by our customers for the simplicity that we have offered in the pricing model and some of the few deals that we did do in the first quarter were on the high-end of our new customer range, compared to what we have seen in the past. Got it, that’s really helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for perhaps for Josh and Udi. Udi I think you mentioned a large customer that deployed frankly it sounded like the whole portfolio including core PAS in the cloud, I guess I just wanted to make sure we understood how that worked, are they purchasing a cloud subscription for core PAS. And maybe Josh a related question for you is how is that perhaps being reflected in the financials if differently at all? No, actually it's very much based on our standard pricing and as a perpetual our license models our customers are able to deploy in cloud and for cloud and that’s how we have decided to deploy it. It’s a very exciting customer really because it really shows the expense of how DevOps is important and how its seen as part of really a deep privileged account, Privileged Access Securities strategy. That’s right, so being continuing to be mostly a perpetual license pricing it hasn't really changed in terms of our P&L model. That’s really helpful. Thanks very much guys. Nice quarter. Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to expand more on Saket's first question. So, would you mention that you rolled out like the multitenant for Managed Service offering for mid market. So how is this different from a pricing [Technical Difficulty] that you just laid out to Saket? How does the economics change in terms of consider a midmarket customer who was using the traditional pricing now shift to this consumption pricing model? How does that affect your revenue or billings number? I will start, so the MSSP we just introduced that and we are working now on actually the first partnerships with the providers. The pricing that we will be offering is based on the term based license pricing for those MSSPs in year contracts or they can also do as pay as you go pricing in terms of further consumption.
And so obviously on the term based pricing will be reflecting that in revenue in accordance with the new 606 under 606 for a term based pricing where the majority of it will be recognized upfront with the contract. And the same as you go as we see with the UCHS. But for that mid market customer that works with this MSSP partners, it really gives them the fixed flexibility as they engage with the partners who relative to pay as they as go as well and have a subscription base model. And as a follow-up, Josh for you. Seeing the movement in the Israeli shekel both the first quarter how much of FX deals wins are baked into your guidance for 2018 in terms of the EPS upside? What is your expectations that you had been you had given the guidance back in February? The guidance that we gave back in February and also the guidance that we are giving is pretty much reflecting the same as the same exchange rate because we were already have set our exchange rate for this year and a hedging program. But that exchange rate is causing more R&D expenses this year compared to last year because this year that shekel has been between the 340 and 360 range where last year it was quite a bit higher. So the reflection in the guidance that I gave in February and now the guidance that I’m giving now for the full-year is reflecting pretty much the same exchange rate on shekel. Perfect thanks. I appreciate it. Thank you Ugam. Thank you. And our next question comes from Melissa Franchi of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open Melissa. Hi, this is [Angelo Ostria] (Ph) in for Melissa, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on cash flow, do you might elaborating on your comments, you mentioned hybrid maintenance activity, is this something we should expect going forward and exactly what happened there? So, our cash flow is seasonal because and also as our maintenance renewals are seasonal, it’s tied into when we do more licenses, is when the increased number of contract start, so obviously Q4 is our biggest quarter for licenses, and so therefore we started a lot of new contracts in Q4 last year in the November, December timeframe, and so that’s why Q1 certainly this Q1 had a seasonally nice uptick.
And it’s not necessarily that our renewal rate is higher than it’s been in the past, we have been experienced over a 90% renewal rate now for many years, and so it just continues to be very high. I think going forward again it will track with our contracts.
The reason we don't give quarterly on this is because it's actually we are not always certain when they renew in the quarter whether it would be for which length contract it will be, if it will be for one year or longer, and so we kind of stick to looking at our cash flow on an annual basis on and so far we are very much on track to be probably in the upper half of our range that we have guided to. Great. Thank you very much that’s grateful. Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Owens of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Hey guys its Mike Casado on for Rob Owens. Udi a months ago, AWS released a solution called Secrets Manager, that I believe addresses embedded credentials and applications and services, and I know it seems solution is more addressable to lower end of the market, but I wanted to get your take on any implications both competitively and on the broader industry demand trends? Absolutely, AWS is a partner of ours and we have been investing a lot in integrations there, and we were also aware of this ahead of time, we actually see it as validations that managing Secrets is a critical risk and we have seen this kind of secret stores across the variety of solutions, but Privileged Accounts Security is broader than that, it shows up in multi-cloud environments, hybrid environments, private cloud of course on premise, containers, orchestration tools.
And so therefore these islands of secrets and credentials and as a security player our role is to be the holistic solutions for enterprises and so again, we don't see it as a competitive today and we see this as an opportunity to be the player that provides the holistic solution. The example I gave earlier of the Global 500 Transportation Companies is exactly that where they have enterprise type environment and expect a security solution. And then Udi, last quarter you discussed GDPR shaping up as a tailwind. How much would you attribute GDPR drive demand to the result in EMEA now that we are just three weeks away? We are beginning to see a sense of urgency with capital being deployed on solutions and we did see activity specifically referencing GDPR during the first quarter, but I wouldn’t attribute the great success EMEA has had the last three quarters of strong performance. I see it as a additional tailwind but the opportunity was there and we are seeing a better execution.
What we do expect is that GDPR will continue into 2018 and beyond the this coming May deadline and that will have until that extent beyond 2018 and into 2019 especially with the mandatory breach disclosures, because when you start disclosing breaches you discover that the infection may have happened in a very mundane way.
But the progression of the attack is privileged credentials and you can’t really secure the environment without Privileged Access Security. So we see ourselves as a seller of any enterprise that wants to be secure and therefore compliant but I would still label it as a tailwind. Much helpful. Thanks Udi. Thank you. And your next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. And your line is open. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the strong quarter as well as the guidance. Udi, I want to start with the high end question. I believe everyone participating at RSA this year let the conference with the feeling that identity and access management really seeing its lowing days as we speak. And yes, it has been around for the past 15 years even more than that maybe in different forms of shape. What is that that has changed over the course of the past few quarters, maybe even year or 18 months that is pushing identity and access management into the limelight? Thanks Shaul for the warm words and on the quarter. I think what we are seeing is become very clear for organizations that the layers the design to keep just the bad guys out and just trading and that thing of parameters securities for so many years or just trying to curtail the next nowhere are important, but the attacker makes it into the environment a sophisticated determined attacker. And it used to be perceived this oh, this was the retailer who didn’t have strong, didn’t have security but you see financial services in the past and you have seen governments.
So a focused attacker makes it in. and therefore two security officers are taking a different view with the working assumption that sophisticated attacker will come in or will start from within as in the cases of insider threat. And when you look there you look at okay, once in, how do you progress an attack and what you try to do, you're trying to behave like an employee, you are trying to behave like an insider.
And then our role obviously is you are not going to get very far as a regular employee, you want to be the strongest and to have the strongest access and have that really pop up privilege account security in the priority and also our partner in the identity governments and in access. Thank you for that Udi. And maybe on Vaultive, so you acquired it just a few weeks before, completed in the quarter, strategically speaking and I’m using an analogy here by acquiring Conjur you are addressing the DevOp arena what arena are you covering with Vaultive specifically as it relates to your cloud activities, seems to be another small tuck in acquisitions as you guys have done in the past in a very sound way? Yes, it’s a great question. And I think you can feel my excitement about this acquisition because it really just as you said, just like our Conjur helps us really extend applications side of our business to the cloud and to modern infrastructure. Vaultive really comes into help securing the SaaS, software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service side of our customers.
They are all feeling that a lot of - back to identity a lot of the most important things and workloads that are being managed by humans are done by SaaS administrators, by infrastructure-as-a-service, the cloud council administrators and privileged business users that are doing administrative path.
And so they look to us to give them a wider protection and extend our offering there, the beauty here is that it's also important to make it very easy for the user and an transparent and native, so provide the security but with the native cloud tools and Vaultive really brings that to the table and we actually have working demos as a partner even before the acquisition and are now really working quickly to integrate into our offering. Thank you for that. Good luck. Thanks Shaul. And our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is open. I just wanted to start out with your commentary around the midmarket, it sounds like you are making some inroads there, I just wanted to get a sense of maybe how much this is contributing to the overall growth and has there been much of an impact from Version10 in terms of targeting that market? I think we continued to talk about the midmarket because it is part of the of the opportunity, but the high-end of the market is really where we see growth in the enterprise, but with so much cross verticals so vertically diverse enterprises and governments is where we are see the growth and the midmarket is something we see more of the long term opportunity and that's why we view to address that more and more with our channel partners and through the managed service providers. And then just going back maybe the DevOps question how large driven opportunity do you see this and are you just seeing set of broad interest across your customer base how should we think about the potential for DevOps maybe relative to some of the other product suites that you are selling today? Sure. I would put it this way, every single customer meeting, every prospect or existing customer is seeing this evolution happen because there is a very clear explanation of adopting DevOps helps their business promote their top line because the faster you can release applications you are going to grow faster than your competitors, so actually across every vertical we are finding that they are either dipping their toes or there is an effort within the organization going into this and then security has two options.
They can see this train go by where - they are going to be the factor vulnerabilities built into their modern cloud infrastructure or they can actually provides a sec into the DevOps and creates a secure DevOps and the chief security officers are smart and they are getting it.
And we are seeing them wanting to touch both sides, provide a solution that keeps the company secure but do it in a way that doesn't disrupt the fast pace of developments. So I really believe it's across the board and on the enterprise side. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Gur Talpaz of Stifel. Your line is open. I wanted to ask about Vaultive and Conjur, but I want to ask about it from a different angle. Udi I want to understand are you starting to see your efforts here in the cloud and in DevOps serving as a point of differentiation versus competition and bake-off even for companies that may have not made the migration to the cloud yet or haven’t really gone in that direction, but are looking to go to do so in the future. Absolutely yes, I think the level we engage with our customers and we put a lot of emphasis in our customer is really think partnership and think securing for the long-term. And as we discussed a privileged access security program units are not already in DevOps. They can see it coming in.
So even if they have to do and many of them still doing, what we call core privileged access security of securing credentials in their server environment domain controllers and really all the important things to block and attacker have not yet jump on the DevOps wagon. They want to know that the solution will take them there, and can take them on the journey.
And the same thing goes for securing the SaaS and the IS side of administration so absolutely we are seeing it as helping that but further breakaway we have always been the innovator in the space and further breakaway with our competitive differentiation. And in this case it’s really an enabler of digital transformation. So there's always justification to the business to go there. That’s helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up, you talked about the push to multitenant fee and consumption based pricing for MSPs. How important do you think that architectural change and that pricing change is as far as driving or reducing some of the restriction points as part as go to market with the MSPs and SMBs? Yes, the reason we invested in that is exactly some of them are existing CyberArk partners that were either reselling or taking on one-off hosting and engagements for their customers. A lot of customers especially as you go down market one to upload the effort to their experts that can take it. And in orders with them to operate with ease they won a multitenant environment that they can operate in an efficient way. And so there is a clear alignment there and we are helping the partner reduce their total cost of ownership of the solution. Thanks Udi. Thanks Gur. And our next question comes from Howard Smith of First Analysis. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. I wanted to dig into your kind of your work with your partners, specifically some of your integration partners and your training that they have, where are we in terms of them really been able to shoulder the bulk of the load without you in terms of implementation? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, thanks Howard. I think we are making great progress, this time we did put up the number of how many certified CyberArk engineers are out there, but of course with every month that passes there are more of them out there. I think the greatest progress has been with the advisory firms really getting a lot of their staff trained and having the ability to take on a large part of the work, but we also partner with smaller VARs and national VARs.
And the approach we take is if they don't have the full certified staff, we at least augment them with CyberArk consultants to lead the way, so there is the partnering. I mean the most important side here is the customer and that’s the most important thing from our perspective, so go out with a partner, and make sure that either they have the staff trained and ready or we will augment them and put our experts in the field with the partners to ensure customer success. And then I assume that the more people are trained and the more visibility you have with successful implementations with that with those partners, the easier it is for them to recommend you, etc. but I'm curious if you're seeing either in regards to success from that, or otherwise changes in the competitive set and the competitors as you approach a particularly the Greenfield opportunities? And I would add also to the truth I mean is that with Version10 and so not only do we have more and more staff out there that can deploy CyberArk, we really simplify it, and add a lot of automation into not just the user experience that is managing CyberArk on a day-to-day basis, but also the installation implementation and the onboarding of privileged accounts after deployment. And so that combination is really helping us go after the Greenfield and we absolutely have a lot of reference that come in from happy customers and as we mentioned a big increase in the influence from the advisory firms recommending CyberArk. Okay. Thank you. Thanks Howard. And our next question comes from Daniel Bartus of Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. I just had two follow-ups related to the potential of Conjur mainly. So first I was wondering when you look at the deals you have done lately where customers go all in, in those cases how big piece of the revenue this Conjur represent, how high can that get? And then when you look at Conjur mailing about 10% revenue last year, I was just wondering what’s your view for it maybe 2018, 2019 just ballpark how do you see that evolving as a piece? Yes. I wouldn’t say it is still a very strategic but still an early CyberArk offering, so we have few customers that are in and all-in mode, and so the opportunity is there, but it's definitely a seven-figure type opportunity within an enterprise it’s just like we have talked about seven-figure and high seven-figure opportunity with our Application Identity Manager for management for more legacy type applications that are strategic focus and it’s the same thing applies to when they take your applications into cloud and DevOps.
But enterprises really see the combination. They want our applications they measure with Conjur. They want the same solution for or holistic solution for their legacy applications and Conjur. We are not going to separate that when we talk about that but we are seeing that be of significant contribution to our revenue. Got it. Thanks guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore. Your line is open. Hi guys thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for where your EMEA pipeline stands today relative to last quarter? Yes, I think basically we are seeing growth in the EMEA pipeline each quarter and its bigger than it was last quarter, and certainly significantly bigger than it was a year ago Q1. Great. And here maybe I will emphasize that we were very pleased with the EMEA performance over the last three quarters and in the first quarter I can really emphasize as the UK and Germany which are really strategic market for us, performed particularly well. And of course we are seeing that translate to pipeline offer. Okay. And I guess as the follow-up, just thinking more broadly. Could you give us a sense for the portion of quota bearing sales reps that are new to the firm versus last quarter. I wanted to be able to give that information right up after that, but I will tell you that we did finish sales and marketing organization at just over 500 people out of the 1053 March 31. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Your line is open. Zack Turcotte on for Catharine Trebnick. First, a just first a clarification. You mentioned some seven figure deal top pharmaceutical manufacturing companies as well as two of the top of 15 banks. These are all add on deals. Those were examples of add on deals, yes. Okay. And then the other one just going back to geographic split again. really a strong quarter for EMEA. I know you mentioned some organizational changes impacting that. I was wondering what impact your channel partners are having both in EMEA as well as your international expansion in general. And if there is anything in particular you would distribute the record quarter in APJ region. I think as a trend we are really seeing that we are trending in the right direction of more and more impact of the channels both big split across all regions and we track that closely. And again it was 60% of the bigger pie in the quarter. So we are very pleased with that. And so it applies really across the board.
There is obviously more work and we are continuously investing and enabling the channel and also the product specification really helps. And on the APJ outside we also emphasize that some of the contribution were large government deals. I would say continued execution but getting that diversity that we saw in other region across verticals also happen in the APJ region. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Hey Josh good afternoon, Dan Park on for Alex, thanks for taking my questions. So, seems like OpEx is likely to consolidate a bit as a result of the recent acquisition and increased success based investments, at what point do you expect your sort of decelerated investments a bit and achieve some more operating leverage? Hi Dan this is Josh. I think that this year is still a year where we are investing for growth and as we see the market opportunity ahead of us with the type of top line growth opportunities we are really focused on positioning ourselves to get that growth. So at this point the guidance for the year indicates the leverage that we have in fact that we were glad to be able to increase the guidance for the year and reflecting a 19% operating margin, which will already show some leverage in the model compared to the first quarter into the back half of the year and so I think you'll see some of your answer there. Okay great and as a follow-up, what was the FX impact your Q1 results and do you think this could even be a tailwind in the back half of the year given the recent strengthening of shekel related to the dollar? So, we had an impact of about 400k, more less income so the negative impact of about net income of $400,000 for the year I mean for the quarter and I think as we see the change in shekel that will help us a little bit, but as I said earlier in the call we are pretty much already we are focused on the rates that it's been over the last couple quarters as we try to plan this well in advance, so the increased or the weakening of the shekel that we have seen in the last week or so may have some small impact but it won’t be material. Okay, great. Thanks for your time. And our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Good afternoon, congrats on the good results. I wanted to ask about Application Identity Manager, so a little bit of commentary earlier on eight out of 10 deals including AIM and Conjur, so the question is how do you guys think about intersecting the cloud migration opportunity, with some of the work you are with system integrators, how has that progressed maybe year ago in terms of CyberArk getting to the conversation around AIM? Yes, so thanks you Gabriela. I think especially those system integrators that have a digital transformation of a business initiative and they are smart to do that are great partners for us with the entire offering but definitely with AIM and Conjur because this is the opportunity for customers to get it right before they start rolling applications in the fast-paced DevOps and we are seeing that, again a lot of the business drivers are security but the advisory firms and system integrators have the opportunity also to make that as part of their advisory and services for cloud migration and digital transformation. That makes sense. And the follow for Josh is on the incremental margin that you realized in 1Q off of the revenue. So the question is, if you are in a position where you are able to outperform on revenue and all the quarters this year how are you thinking dropping that to the bottom line versus maybe reinvesting. thanks Thanks Gabriela. I think we feel pretty good about beats on the top line with a good portion of it going to the bottom line like we saw in the first quarter. And I think we have seen that typically in the past and in many quarters from our results. I don't want to commit now but I would say that we would like to, and we would plan for having some of the top line going to the operating income. Thanks for the color. And our last question comes from Michael Kim of Imperial Capital. Your line is open Michael. Hi guys. Could you talk a little bit more about the add on sales and that security and primarily by multi product adoption. What are they purchasing or see the expansion. And earlier in the call you talked about some roughly about 20% penetration, so I’m curious for the more material or older customer cohort where you are seeing that customer penetration reach. Yes. So in terms of the add on business is very diverse. The conversations we are having with customers is really to think strategically and to think programmatically. And as we guide that we help them just get a better security posture and sometime it is more seats as you called it and more licenses of existing products around Core Privilege Account Security.
And many of them have come to us early years more compliance driven and have a little pockets of CyberArk but really didn’t take a program that secures them. And we are passionate about really helping them protect this attack factor. And then in many it combines with across into the add on EPM Endpoint Privilege Manager to really secure privilege on the inside and Conjur. Got it and just really quickly on EPM. Are you seeing acceleration in standalone opportunities, subsequent to those standalone deals are you seeing that circle back to the corporate account security suits? Yes, I think it's really a variety, because we discuss our programs with customers we don't really accelerate the EPM as a standalone. We have deals where it had been the case. But as part of the program it can be an add-on business or it can be the place where the customer wants to start. Got It great. Thanks very much. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Thank you. Our success is based on our deep relationships with customers, partners and the contribution by our great global team. Thank you all for contributing to our very strong first quarter.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Udi. Udi? Thanks, Erica and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Strong execution and robust demand across all geographies drove our results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 35%, reaching $78 million and we were very pleased to see license revenue growth by 36% to $41 million. We generated $17 million in operating income and our cash flow from operations was $56 million in the first 6 months of the year. It was a great quarter and we are thrilled with our results.
A number of secular trends are contributing to the momentum in our business. Compliance requirements and rigorous regulations like GDPR, persistent attacker innovation and escalating cyber threats, the execution of digital transformation strategies, the complexities of cloud migration and protecting hybrid environments, and most importantly, privileged access security is broadly recognized as a top priority critical to security strategies. In fact, in a smarter with Gartner, Gartner top 10 security projects for 2018 blog post published on June 6, 2018, Gartner summarizes the recent security and risk management summit held in June.
At the event, Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald recommended that CISOs, Chief Information Security Officers, focus on projects that reduce the most amount of risk and have the largest business impact and he identified privileged account management as the number one focus for organizations. Today, privileged access security is viewed as foundational to successful security strategies and is now the number four control on the CIS, critical security controls for effective cyber defense compared to 4 years ago when protecting privileged access was not even a top 10 control. These trends are contributing to our growth with the Americas and APJ generating record revenues again this quarter and while EMEA had an easy compare versus the second quarter of 2017, the region outpaced our expectations growing by more than 60% in Q2.
On the new business front, we are now helping secure over 4,000 organizations around the world winning nearly 200 logos in the second quarter, including 4 Fortune 500 and 22 Global 2000 organizations. The majority of our new business continues to be Greenfield, including 3 of the 4 Fortune 500 wins. A few new business highlights include a financial services company has deployed a number of disparate privileged access security solutions and wanted to standardize enterprise wide. The leadership team recognized that CyberArk was the only vendor who can scale to seamlessly manage secure and provide a single point of control across on-premise, hybrid and cloud.
Our proven track record, delivering innovation also gave the team confidence that we can support their long-term security strategy. A leading technology company picked CyberArk over an incumbent vendor to securely implement its digital transformation strategy, which will begin with deployment in Google cloud platform. We will be securing this mission-critical program, because we are battle tested in public cloud and hybrid environments and we are able to secure privileged access to modern infrastructure, technology and processes.
A medical device company will be implementing endpoint privileged manager for about 25,000 workstations and 3,000 window servers. Customers continue to embrace our unique combination of lease privilege, application control and credential theft blocking and we were pleased to see endpoint privileged manager represent about 10% of our license revenue in the second quarter. During the second quarter, CyberArk was chosen to not only mitigate risk and prevent the damage from cyber attacks, but also to solve critical compliance requirements for NIST, GDPR, Swift and PCI. Every organization needs to protect privileged access. Over the last 12 months, 9 verticals contributed more than 5% to the business.
A major highlight in the second quarter was the global government vertical, which represented more than 15% of the business. It was particularly rewarding to see U.S. federal, have a record quarter in advance of the fiscal year end in September. We signed 31 new U.S. federal agencies across 20 departments. Existing U.S. federal customers also standardized on CyberArk during the quarter demonstrating that we have quickly become the facto standard across many U.S. civilian agencies. We are building a strong foundation in global government and U.S. federal and are confident that they will be important contributors for long-term growth. In the quarter, we signed a 7-figure deal with a European government agency that suffered public scrutiny after privileged access was exploited to steal data and damage credibility.
Our mission is to secure organizations before successful cyber attacks, but a breach dramatically increases the urgency for privileged access security. While we are experiencing strong industry tailwinds, the execution of our strategy also contributed to our success in the first half of the year. The enhanced functionality and simplification of Version 10 has further extended our leadership position, which is reflected in our strong new and add-on business in Q2. Customers love the simplified workflows, streamlined implementation and the overall user experience, the new version has had a meaningful impact in sales engagements.
In addition, our investments in securing the cloud application credentials and the DevOps pipeline are enabling us to protect customers’ digital transformation strategies. In a 7-figure win, an existing financial services customer will leverage our solution in its application and development strategy for all consumer-facing applications. A few years ago, CyberArk was predominantly protecting infrastructure in on-premise datacenters. Today, customers recognized that securing privilege across the entire enterprise all the way to consumer-facing applications is critical to effective business operations. Application Identity Manager and Conjur are continuing to gain traction and so far this year represents about 10% of license revenue. We are winning deals for both new and add-on business. Security teams are pushing for programmatic privileged across both on-premise applications and the new DevOps pipeline as we saw with a major cross-sell deal with an existing technology customer in the second quarter.
Add-on business represented more than 55% of the license revenue in the second quarter driven by the tremendous value our solution provides as well as our high levels of customer’s satisfaction. We held our Americas and EMEA customer events in July, representing the largest gatherings of privileged security professionals in each of the regions. The feedback from the events reinforces that privileged access security is the top priority and that the majority of customers are early in the deployment of their cyber programs. There is significant room for growth. We acquired Vaultive in March and are pleased with the progress of the integration. The response to Vaultive at our customer events was overwhelmingly positive as customers are looking for solutions to secure highly privileged business users and SaaS and cloud administrators.
We continue to set the pace of innovation in the privileged access security market with our June introduction of the CyberArk privileged cloud. Customers have more options today and can deploy our access to CyberArk anywhere, on-premise, in the cloud and as a service or through an MSSP. Given the demand for our solution is driven primarily for buy on-premise deployments, we are not expecting CyberArk privileged cloud to be a meaningful contributor to our results in 2018, but we have recognized that the market will evolve over time and introducing CyberArk privileged cloud helps future proof our leadership position in privileged access security. Our momentum with advisory firms like Deloitte, PWC, KPMG and Accenture continues to build. They are investing in CyberArk, building world-class practices specialized in privileged access security. In the second quarter, new and add-on business influenced by advisory firms increased by more than 50% over last year and our indirect business represented more than 65% of revenue in the second quarter.
Our C³ Alliance is increasing awareness of privileged access security beyond our traditional stronghold with security teams and into IT and business operations group as well as within the identity and cloud teams. We are seeing strong traction with technology partners like ForeScout, Okta, Proofpoint, SailPoint and ServiceNow, cloud providers such as AWS, Google and Microsoft and robotic process automation vendors like Blue Prism, UiPath and Automation Anywhere. C³ is a meaningful differentiator in the field and we now have more than 100 technology partners. Through our partnerships, we also continue to extend the reach of our solution. Conjur Enterprise is now running on Red Hat OpenShift container platform and we introduced Conjur as a Kubernetes application in the Google cloud platform marketplace. And in June, we launched our core privileged access security solution in the AWS marketplace.
The speed and agility of software automation and modern application development are changing the face of business operations. Cloud migrations are well underway. Organizations recognized that securing privileged access is critical to security. Our investments in cloud, DevOps, product simplification and strategic partnerships are completely aligned with these broader industry trends and have significantly distance us from the competition. With our execution the first half of 2018, we have a tremendous opportunity and are in a great position to deliver both growth and profitability in 2018 and beyond.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh to discuss more details about our terrific results. Josh? Thanks, Udi. Before we begin reviewing the quarter, I wanted to remind everyone that our second quarter results reflect the modified retrospective approach to disclosure for accounting standard 606. So as Udi mentioned, we had a great second quarter capping off a very strong first half of 2018. Our sales execution coupled with robust demand resulted in revenue, operating income and EPS that were ahead of guidance and another quarter of strong cash flow from operations.
Total revenue growth accelerated to 35% year-on-year reaching $77.7 million in the second quarter. License revenue reached $41.1 million, increasing 36% over the second quarter last year and representing 53% of total revenue. We showed growth across all geographies and for both new and add-on business. Maintenance and professional services revenue was $36.6 million increasing 35% over the prior year period and representing 47% of revenue. Professional services revenue during the quarter by itself were $6.8 million or 9% of total revenue, which is at a high-end of the typical range we see of 7% to 9%. We saw overall better efficiency from our services group and an uptick in services from EMEA compared to the last several quarters.
Geographically, the Americas reached another record of $48.4 million with growth accelerating to 24% and representing 62% of total revenue. We often discussed the consistency of the Americas. The second quarter represented the ninth quarter of sequential growth in that region, which we are pleased to see given the strong seasonality we typically would experience in the fourth quarters. During the second quarter, EMEA revenue increased 62% to $22.4 million or 29% of total revenue while the growth in EMEA is often easier compare we are pleased with the strong execution in the last several quarters. APJ also achieved a record $6.9 million for the quarter growing 54% and representing 9% of total revenue. In addition, demand for privileged access security is increasing across verticals. During the second quarter, 7 verticals grew by 50% or faster, including banking, education, energy, insurance, IT services and software and telecommunications. As Udi mentioned, global government had a record quarter more than doubling from the second quarter of last year.
As I move through the P&L, all financial results will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our second quarter gross profit was $68.2 million or an 88% gross margin compared to 85% gross margin in the same period last year. The strength in our gross margin was due to increased utilization of our professional services team and the lower use of third-party subcontractors. Given that we are still in the early innings of our opportunity, we are continuing to invest in growing and scaling our operations. R&D expense grew by 47% year-on-year to $11.8 million as a result of a number of factors, including one, R&D headcount increasing by 27%, which included the acquisitions of Conjur in May of last year and Vaultive in March of this year, coupled with movements in the currencies.
Sales and marketing increased 19% to $32.4 million as we expanded our sales organization across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales. G&A expense increased 40% year-on-year to $6.9 million as we scale the business to support our growth, including the implementation of various IT systems, such as a new ERP. In total, operating expenses for the second quarter increased 27% to $51.2 million compared with $40.2 million for the second quarter last year. We ended the second quarter with 1,077 employees worldwide, up from 1053 at March 31 and compared with 921 at the end of second quarter last year. We ended the quarter with 513 employees in sales and marketing that’s compared to 502 at March 31, 2018 and 445 at the end of the second quarter last year. Another driver of our total expenses comes from our moves to the new offices located in Israel, London and Singapore to support the growth of the organization.
Operating income was ahead of our guidance at $17 million or 22% operating margin. This compared to an operating income of $8.8 million or 15% operating margin in the year ago period. Net income was $13.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the second quarter of this year compared to $7.7 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the second quarter of last year. We were pleased to generate $56.2 million of cash flow or 38% margin for the first half of 2018. That’s representing an increase of 90% over the first 6 months of last year. The strong cash flow continues to be driven by strong collections as well as our high maintenance renewal rates. As a result, we ended the quarter with $378 million in cash and investments. This compares to $330 million in cash and investments at year end and we ended the second quarter with $130 million in total deferred revenue, a 23% increase from $105 million at year end and a 56% increase from $83 million at June 30, 2017.
Turning to our guidance, as a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. So, for the third quarter of 2018, we expect total revenue of $77.8 million to $79.3 million or 21% growth year-on-year at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $11.4 million to $12.6 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.25 to $0.28.
Our third quarter guidance reflects a similar step up in expenses from Q2 to Q3 that we have experienced in prior years. The increase is primarily related to seasonal employee expenses in our third quarter marketing programs, which include our signature annual customer impact events held this year in Boston and Berlin as well as our new defense customer series. The defense series is a new sales and marketing initiative being held this quarter across 12 cities in North America and attracting more than 1,000 participants. Our guidance also assumes 37.5 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of 21% for the third quarter. Because of our strong first half execution and demand for our solution, we are increasing our guidance for the full year of 2018. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $320 million to $324 million or growth of approximately 23% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $64 million to $67 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.43 to $1.50. This assumes 37 million weighted average diluted shares.
Our guidance for the full year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for the year. We are pleased with our strong execution and our great results in the first half of 2018, which positioned us now very well for the remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here and well done. First, maybe for you Josh, you mentioned services were ahead of the typical range in terms of revenue, maybe just for comparison what was the rough split last quarter and how have you thought about that split in the second half vis-à-vis your guidance for the year? Yes. So, last quarter it was 8% and we have been running at kind of 7% to 9% for years and I would anticipate and we are modeling around 8% for the second half. Okay, that’s really helpful. Maybe a more strategic question for you, Udi, we all saw the acquisition of CA recently realizing that it’s still very early, can you just talk about whether you have seen any glimmers of sort of competitive shift as it relates to CDM and whether that’s something that you have actually seen when your other competitors have been acquired in the past, whether that’s like Quest or Lieberman or a lot of companies in your space have kind of changed hands. So, what’s been the history that you have seen in terms of competitive opportunity? Absolutely. And then thanks Saket for the congrats, we are really excited about the results here. I would say that we have not yet seen beyond the news that came out the immediate impact, but like everyone here we read that there is an intention to get drive significant synergies and cost-cutting. So, we expect that this could be another opportunity for us for competitive displacement. If we look at past similar acquisitions, CyberArk was able to benefit and from displacement opportunity, especially for customers who are strategically thinking about the space and want to go deep in privileged access security, specifically Xceedium, we have the CA Xceedium solution, we have displaced in multiple organizations. So, this is what we view as likely positive and again based on what we saw in the past. Very helpful. Thanks very much guys. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking questions. Maybe one for Josh or either Udi, you now have two quarters of data point on privileged access security bundle initiative that you undertook. I am wondering if you can quantify the impact this is having on your transaction velocity or pipeline growth and then part B of the question is as it relates to the bundling, do you have guardrails importantly to protect against any deal size contraction? And a follow-up for Josh if I may. Yes, hi, Fatima. I will start on the pricing. So, we do have two quarters now. Roughly in the first quarter though, I think only about a third of the business was going through our new pricing. That jumped up nicely into the second quarter. I think overall if we look at the whole first half, roughly half of the business came through our new pricing model. At this point though, I would still say that we are not seeing a necessarily shift in the order size. What we are seeing I think is more – as a lot of qualitative benefits within the sales cycle of the engagement process between the sales and the customers and an ease of the quoting and a smoother transaction. I think it’s still too early to tell that it’s reducing the sales cycle, but what I do think it’s doing and at least certainly qualitatively is leaving a lot more room for discussion of the product and less around the pricing machination. So, I think overall we are still keeping very close tabs on it. With regard to your second piece, we don’t see yet of having to have any unnatural guardrails so to speak on the pricing mechanism. It’s pretty straightforward. It’s a by-user price and then there is, it can be a discount applied and the discount rules are very rigid within the organization and controlled through approval processes. So I think at this point, it’s pretty much similar to how we are doing business a year ago but in a much more simple format. That makes a ton of sense. And just really quickly on your customer add rate according to what I see it’s probably some of your best new logo ad rate, in many quarters almost comparable to a fourth quarter ad rate. I am wondering what are some of the driving factors of that increasing new logo ad velocity? And that’s it for me. Thank you. Yes, Fatima, thank you. It’s definitely the combination of strong execution on top of executing on our strategy, which including launching v10 last year, which is all about simplified workflow for the customer that makes it easier in the proof-of-concept, makes it easier in the implementation phase and really contributes to the new logo cycle pricing that you mentioned is definitely a positive there. And on top of that, it was an extraordinary quarter on the government side and the addition of so many U.S. federal customers in a non-end of fiscal government quarter cycle. So that really contributed to the high logo, new logo count. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. This is Mike Casado on for Rob Owens. Thanks for taking my question. Udi, given the growth in EMEA, can you elaborate on the progress Rich Turner has made in that geo in the quarter and also hone in on an objectives, I guess, for the remainder of the year? Yes, absolutely. As I have alluded to in the past is number one thing was to improve consistency and really take the best practices that we have seen in the Americas market into the team. So we have seen improved execution over the last several quarters and I would say an increasingly successful and higher productivity from the team across region. We have also seen broader market awareness that’s a result of our marketing efforts and field marketing efforts and you couple that with the great improving market fundamentals specific to our space. Rich brings a very disciplined and focused approach and this translated to the results. Coupled with the continued work with the channel, that’s his background and it was strategic for us to further embrace, enable and partner with our channels in EMEA that includes the value-added resellers, but also the advisory firms that are taking an increasing role. Thanks, Udi and that makes total sense. It looks like the guidance raise on revenue and operating income roughly equal to quarters upside, just given the momentum you are seeing in the business, what are some of the mitigating factors in not pushing the guidance raise higher this quarter? I think that we feel pretty good that we are able to pass through the full raise into the year and also be able to do it at the same time by levering also the bottom line and increasing our operating margin as well and our EPS. So, I think at this point we feel good it increases the total year growth rate. And in terms of the guidance, we are comfortable with what we gave for the full year. That makes sense. Thanks, Udi. Nice quarter. Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Yes, hey, guys. This is Sai Sharma on for Sterling Auty. Congrats on the quarter and so how much did GDPR benefit in the quarter? I would say, hi, this is Udi. I would say we did see some activity that’s specifically referenced GDPR during the second quarter, but like we said after the Q1 call, we think GDPR will be more of a steady drumbeat and a steady tailwind for the business over a longer period of time, maybe many years versus just tied to the May deadline. So, it’s an overall tailwind positive, but for the long run, we also see that or believe that breach disclosure like we have seen in some cases may accelerate spending, but again we didn’t see that broadly yet. Alright, thank you. And just one more, so were there any very big deals in the quarter greater than 5 million? So, we don’t actually disclose the number of deals. This is Erica. We had a typical quarter for size of deals and transactions this quarter. So, there is nothing to call out on the deal size from a deal size perspective. Alright, thank you. And there was nothing over 5 million. And our next question comes from Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, this is Anjelo Austria in for Melissa. Thanks for taking my question. One area of particular strength was the sizable deferred revenue beat did you mind singling out any normal dynamics or drivers in the quarter to speak to the outperformance? The deferred revenue was 98% support and maintenance contracts. It just goes to our continued high maintenance renewals and there was nothing – there was nothing unnatural in there other than the fact that we keep really driving strong renewals. Understood, got it. And just one more question for me, another bright spot was the acceleration in U.S. revenue growth returning to over 20% growth, are there changes in the go-to-market or demand drivers or anything going on to understand what’s driving that growth? I would say, we went – whenever there were questions in the past, we talked about the fact that this is our most, best educated market and that we are seeing more and more customers move from a project-based approach to really taking our privileged access security program. And I would put into strong execution on both driving new business and educating existing customer to take a programmatic approach, coupled with the secular drivers that I mentioned before and privileged access security really driving to the top, so that the team executed on the opportunity. Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Bartus with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first on Cisco’s recent dual acquisition, I wonder if you had any thoughts on that and whether you partner at all and maybe just generally what’s your vision for the convergence of IAM and PAM over time? Yes, this is Udi. Absolutely. Dual-R and one of our 100 partners in the C³ Alliance and we support their specification for customers who want to use them to authenticate to the CyberArk platform as multifactor authentication. The acquisition I believe validates that identity is a key pillar in security, but we don’t see the acquisition changing anything on our partnership front or accelerating the various pieces of identity consolidated. Okay, great. And maybe quick one for Josh just wondering if you can talk to how much of your EMEA revenues exposed to euro? Thanks. In Europe, we sell in euro, sterling and dollars. I would say, roughly 60% euro, 25% sterling, 15% dollar. Okay, thanks very much guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter guys. So you talked a lot about government strength here in Q2 both internationally and domestic. And I guess what I am wondering is how do you feel about Fed opportunity as we now push into the fiscal year end for the government into Q3. Do you see sizeable pipeline or did you perhaps closed more than you expected in Q2? Yes, hey, Gur, it’s Udi. I would say that this was not bringing Q3 deals earlier. The prime amount of the federal deals that I mentioned, were off of that cycle and we are on government contracts that were not subject to fiscal year end. So, we still see a healthy government pipeline for Q3. Okay, that’s helpful. And then Udi, you talked a lot about hybrid environments in the prepared remarks and what I am wondering is as customers go through their broader architectural revaluations, does that create a new opportunity for discussion for you guys? I mean, does that create a catalyst of sorts to bring you and then have a broader discussion about bringing PAM into the fold if you will for customers that may not have had you deployed previously? Absolutely. I think it’s one of our strengths is that CyberArk is really relevant in that cloud migration space. No matter where it catches the customer it could be the on-premise customer that is only making the first steps into cloud or the customer that moves in all-in, but also to your question, the hybrid, the hybrid is here to stay for quite a while and in that hybrid, customers really appreciate having a solution that extends to all of their environments and very often whether it’s an existing customer, it triggers advanced discussions of how we help them take the journey and as I gave some examples. And if it’s a prospect that is in hybrid mode, they really appreciate our investments in making sure that we can take that entire journey and this includes of course, our self-developed capabilities, but also the extensions we have made with the Conjur acquisition, with the Vaultive acquisition in capturing the capabilities into their journey. That’s it. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Thank you. And I will probably add that we are always very proud to that in our business model we put diversity as one of our strength. So, we have often emphasized that geographic diversity and I think we really showed it this quarter. The vertical diversity as we have highlighted this quarter and Gur, to your question, it’s the diversity to be able to play both in on-premise, in all-cloud and in the hybrid in between as the strength for us. And our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Every quarter, we talk about a few specific areas, where you are building up the partnerships in the channels and the customer support side of the business. Maybe higher level question for either Udi or Josh, where do you feel you are now on the cadence of investment with being able to meet demand and the rates of channel you have and maybe just give us where your top couple of priorities are on the go-to-market over the next 12 months? Thank you. I would say that if in the past we felt a major bottleneck in partner enablement and training, we are seeing the fruits of our investments in having more and more CyberArk certified engineers out there, although we do create a good problem an industry of really high demand for this talent out there, but we are seeing the fruits of that. It was very strategic for us to – and we talked about it many times to really invest in that layer on of the advisory firms that can help those customers take a risk-based approach and take CyberArk on the strategic journey from a project to a program. And I think I highlighted the 50% growth of in deals that were influenced by these advisories. Another aspect is doing that across geographies. And I would say the progress we are making and it’s still top priorities, is extending that to EMEA, extending that to APJ and that’s all in progress. So, that’s on the advisory level, but I would say in all phases, including the value-added resellers, it’s really making sure if they are enabled and able to take this to market in a year, in which and in the time where the – in which periods access is labeled a top priority. And so this is the time to make it happen and we are investing in it. That’s very helpful. Thank you. The follow-up is on PTA product, I am hoping you can give us some color on how often PTA is coming up in conversations relative to year ago, what do attach rates look like and how are they changing? And when you go into a sale with and PTA does come up how much of a differentiator is it relative to what you are typically able to compete with when you just go in with EPV and then PSM? Yes. I think one of the important strategic moves we made for the benefit of our customers, but it’s really benefiting the business as well is to include privileged threat analytics in the new pricing model as part of core privileged access security. We believe every customer has to have Enterprise Password vault, privileged session management and threat analytics in the deployment as they are presenting lateral movement and privilege escalation attacking the networks and their clouds. So by putting that in there, we are seeing that it’s a differentiator in the PLCs. Customers don’t have to look through a variety of line items to pick and choose and actually get the benefit within this pricing. The fact that version, I think it was in 10.2 or 10.3, we really integrated PTA dashboard into the regular Enterprise Password vault dashboard even further simplified the adoption in new customer sales, but also in add-on business, where customers want this and now can easily benefit from threat analytics. So, we are not – we don’t have a metric to give you as a standalone product, because we are including it in CorpPass, but that move is driving more and more adoption of PTA. That’s helpful. Thank you. And our next question comes from Howard Smith with First Analysis. Your line is now open. Yes, thank you and I echo the congratulations on the broad strength of the business. Question dealing with how some of the newer products are affecting either the new logo ad or more likely the pipeline of new logos. You just talked about kind of your core that every customer should have with the password vault and some of the analytics, but are you able to now lead with Conjur, IAM at point and get them into the discussion and your partners kind of lead with that product and have that bring them into the ecosystem instead of thinking about as more add-on once they have the core adoption. And just any qualitative color around that would be helpful? Sure. First of all, thank you Howard. I would say in the majority of the cases for a new customer they need to start with CorpPass to really secure their crown jewels and to make sure that they are not vulnerable for tax and we really believe in prescribing to customers the things that will give them the fastest protection and ROI and then allow them to expand on the journey. So most often they will start with that, but indeed these two growth engines for us, EPM for extending to the endpoint and Conjur AIM for extending to application for DevOps are often a place, where we land, but not in the majority of the cases. The beauty of Conjur AIM is its security, but also enabling digital transformation. So, we do see standalone pipeline that is built in response to catching customers in the early phases of their digital transformation strategies. There have even been conversions that start with the fact that we have an open source addition or the community addition of Conjur that is standalone pipeline expanding on I would say the massive pipeline marketing that we build with our marketing and field efforts. But I would say that is still early and over time we will see that become a larger piece. We still have a huge Greenfield on core privilege. So we have a good problem to handle here is really bringing customers the best protection with CorpPass and then take them to the advanced logistics. Okay, that’s it for me. Thank you and congratulations again. Thanks Howard. And our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first off, I was wondering you had a strong contribution from new customers during the quarter, have you made any specific changes to either sales comp plans or channel incentives that drive new customer growth? No, nothing from that perspective, acquiring new customers is always a priority of ours and certainly is built in and focused on within the go-to-market strategy, but we didn’t make a specific change to that side of the business. Since we are still talking about the new business, I want to add on to Howard’s question, I would also as we mentioned earlier, the new pricing lets us introduce the newer products earlier, because again, we removed a lot of complexity on understanding the various line items. Okay. And could you discuss what portion of your customer base has started to use your solutions in a public cloud environment? And then around that how much upside can we see from up-sells there as you continue to penetrate your existing base alone? So, we don’t have, I would say, numbers to give you today. Almost every discussion, every new implementation, almost every new statement of work of implementation includes their cloud assets and it could be as strategic. I mean, we gave example as strategic as fully deploying CyberArk in the cloud provider like the Google cloud platform example that I gave earlier or deploying the one of our components in the cloud or extending an existing implementation to secure cloud assets and securing the administrators of cloud infrastructure. So, it’s coming up in every, or in almost every deployment. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. [indiscernible] on for Alex. Thanks for taking my question. So given the strong government in Fed penetration this quarter, could you just give us a sense of what’s sort of driving to accelerating interest in the vertical and what solutions are resonating with customers? Yes, absolutely. I think it’s a combination of really our long focus and investment in the space. Early on, we invested in getting common criteria another defense-related certifications and really led our space with that. We have a dedicated federal team that is partnered with federal-oriented channels to go after the opportunity. And really CyberArk has created the momentum and leadership in the space, where the agencies look at each other and look at references and see that CyberArk is the solution that can really take them on a risk-based approach, where I would say that the biggest change in general government, but also in U.S. federal has been to look at this as we really need to put this as based on a risk-based approach and select the vendor who can take us on a full program journey. And so really, it’s the result of that change in mindset and our investments in the space. Okay, great. And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter gentlemen. Two questions. One, really last quarter you talked more at the Analyst Day about hitting the mid-market, can you discuss what your go-to-marketing plan is to really drive revenue there? And the second part of the question is really early in the call you discussed the warm embrace by the advisory firms and what really is the secret sauce that’s driving them to adopt and embrace your solution and bring to their customers? Thank you. Sure. Hi, Catharine. It’s Udi. I would say as we have highlighted in the Investor Day and also beyond, we talked about the fact that the opportunity extends to – that the Greenfield opportunity extends also into the mid-market, but I think we have emphasized many times that we see the biggest opportunity in going after the enterprise as a prime focus for CyberArk and that it’s a huge Greenfield. I gave some examples of Fortune 500, Global 2000 and of course it goes on to the top 10,000, 20,000 enterprises out there. And with regards to the mid-market, it was one of the reasons why we launched MSSP offering is to give our partners the opportunity to launch service that would address this segment. And of course Version 10 was designed to simplify for all customers and will also help this segment and down the road, although it’s early, we will see our privileged cloud also further help address this market down the road. With regards to the advisories, yes, it’s absolutely one of the most exciting things I like to talk about against similar to my federal answer is it’s a combination of investment in it and partnering. The advisories want to help their customers with an impactful security layer and drive demand for their expertise. CyberArk is there as a company that leads the market and showcases to our advisory partners that we are in it for the long-term that we are investing and really be a solution that they can build a business practice on publicly traded investing in long-term innovation, making smart acquisitions, extending into the cloud, they can really see that they can build a business surrounded. And you can add an additional driver, they look at how they can help customers build an impactful security layer and they also want to be part of the customers’ digital transformation. So, that’s adding an additional drive to these this partnership. And our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open. Hi. Just wanted to I guess follow-up on your early commentary around the SANS framework and just rising up in terms of the prioritization, is this helping to change I guess decision-makers minds and how should we think about maybe the impact of pipeline over time when we look at things like this? Yes, I think – thank you Jonathan. I think Jonathan is someone who followed the company in the space for many years. I think we have come a long way in making this a really top priority and of course it took years of publications that this is what the attackers are going after and it is now translated to like I mentioned the Gartner emphasis and being a top 4 control. What we believe this helps prioritize with the Chief Information Security Officer, it helps prioritize projects security up there. We never positioned CyberArk as the only thing they ever need to do. We actually partner with a lot of the solutions they put in place with the C³ Alliance but this has become a pillar of security and definitely helps us build a more strategic pipeline. Of course, we still – it’s not that we don’t have any education work left, but we are in a beneficial place to start from the top in many organizations and where we didn’t get to the top to work our way up to the top with the help of our various partners. And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Yes, hi. This is Mike on for Gregg. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering how you characterize the pricing environment this quarter? I would say that probably the same I think most of our competitors are now private equity backed and those have been the prime changes. And so we encountered once in a while that they tend not to try to innovate, but rather push on pricing. I think we have seen an increase in our win rates. I think the new pricing that we launched across the board in Q1 is really helping us even in those situations. So, I would say, it was always competitive and I think we have improved our position with the combination of simplified pricing and of course Version 10 and everything I talked about earlier. And our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks. Just looking at the free cash flow strength you had this quarter, do you think that there is you think that you will see any repeat of that next year, is there any seasonal element to that? And then secondly as you look out to next year, do you think we can still model for free cash flows to exceed net margins by I think it’s 0% to 10%, is that still a good rule of thumb to work from? Yes. So, we are really careful about not giving quarterly, because there is seasonality, but I can’t necessarily predict all the seasonality, if it will, fall within Q4 or Q1, so lot of it has to really do with since renewal rates and then the linearity within the quarter and so forth. But I think overall, I think looking forward the business model kind of supports the same type of cash flow margins that we have been talking about and that you mentioned above net income within 10%. Obviously, this year we will certainly in the first half have exceeded that. And I think we have a good chance of coming out certainly hit the top or beating that for this year. And our next question comes from Tanner Hoban with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid quarter. And just wondering about given next quarter, it’s the fiscal year end for the Federal vertical, were there any deals in the pipeline that closed early, which caused some of the strength in the new customer acquisition across that vertical or it’s just the pipeline exhibiting healthy performance across the entire segment? Thank you. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, one of the unique elements was that the prime amount of U.S. federal deals here, we are not – we are buying off of contracts that are not subject to fiscal year end. And so in other words, we didn’t pull out from the Q3 pipeline and we still have a healthy pipeline for Q3. And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Udi Mokady for any further remarks. Thank you. In closing, I want to congratulate our team for a terrific Q2. I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and shareholders for contributing to our strong record quarter results and supporting our strategy. Thanks everyone for joining the call today.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Udi. Thanks, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today.
The third quarter was another great quarter for CyberArk. Total revenue reached a record $84.7 million, increasing 31% year-over-year. We generated record non-GAAP operating income of $21 million. And our net cash from operations was $89.2 million in the first nine months of the year, already exceeding the cash flow we generated in all of 2017.
Given our strong results, we are raising our guidance for the full-year, which Josh will discuss later in the call.
Strong execution and robust market fundamentals drove our results again this quarter. I want to highlight three major market trends. First, awareness and demand for privileged access security is stronger than ever, and accelerating generating across all geographies. Second, securing privileged access is recognized as critical for the successful execution of digital transformation and cloud migration strategies. And third, chief information security officers are solving increasingly complex regulatory challenges by focusing on securing the environment and not merely checking a compliance loss.
Given our leadership position and the breadth of our solutions, we’ve benefited from these macro trends in the third quarter.
In terms of our strategy, every team across the organization executed well, and contributed to our strong performance this quarter and year-to-date. Innovation has been key to our success. The simplicity and enhanced functionality of Version 10 of our core privileged access security solutions combined with the dramatically simplified new pricing model is accelerating new customer acquisition.
We ended Q3 with over 4,200 customers, adding nearly 200 new logos again this quarter. Year-to-date, new customer additions have grown by 37% over the first nine months of last year, accelerating from about 10% in the first nine months of 2017 and 28% in the first nine months of 2016. With the wins in the third quarter, we are honored to be helping secure the world’s leading companies including 50% of the Fortune 500.
A few key new customer wins include a Fortune 100 technology company will be leveraging our core privileged access solution to secure network security cameras. We won this greenfield Internet of Things project because of our investment in the technology integrations that securely extend our solution across the IT infrastructure on-premise and in the cloud. A major insurance company chose CyberArk, not only for the breadth of our solutions across core privileged access and for protection in DevOps, but also because we can secure multiple public clouds including Google Cloud Platform and AWS. The Chief Information Security Officer wanted to consolidate on a comprehensive privileged access security platform to increase control and security over the organization’s enterprise hybrid environment.
In the new digital world, every organization is a technology company, and retail certainly is no exception. In the third quarter, we signed over 20 new retail customers and the vertical grew by more than 75% compared to Q3 last year. To respond to increasing competition and higher consumer demand, retailers are securely implementing comprehensive cloud and DevOps strategies. In a seven-figure new business deal, a large retailer in Northern Europe will be leveraging our technology to secure its privileged accounts globally. In the hybrid deployment, this retailer is running our solution on-premise in the Americas and Azure to secure its EMEA the environment. This customer understands that securing privileged is foundational to its comprehensive security strategy. A large retailer in the U.S. will be leveraging CyberArk, Okta and SailPoint in a broad identity project to protect its environment on-premise as well as privileged access to AWS and Azure. Our security first approach to privileged, our ability to protect the DevOps pipeline and our strong relationships with our technology and advisory partners contributed to this great win.
An existing Fortune 100 retail customer who first purchased Enterprise Password Vault in 2012, is extending is CyberArk deployment to its next generation data center in GCP and Pivotal Cloud Foundry with Application Identity Manager and Conjur and Core PAS. This progressive customer wants full visibility and security of its privileged human users and machine identities. Our strategic moves over the last 18 months, including the new pricing model, Version 10 and our technology partnerships with Puppet, Ansible and Chef will significantly speed the tighter value for this mission-critical project.
Broad diversification is the foundational pillar of our business. Our top 10 deals in the third quarter represented five different verticals, but more importantly, they were balanced across the Americas and EMEA, new and add-on business, channel and direct, and included a number of products. Banking, manufacturing and global government were our largest verticals in Q3, each representing over 10% of the business. In the government vertical, we won agencies in North America, EMEA and APJ and continue to see traction with U.S. federal closing over 40 deals with both new and existing customers.
Geographically, we were thrilled with the performance in each region. The Americas delivered another record quarter, growing by more than 20% in Q3. The EMEA team has improved consistency across the region, resulting in revenue growing by more than 40% in the third quarter. And in APJ, we have seen an acceleration in deals over $100,000, demonstrating that securing privileged access is moving up on the security priority list in the region.
Add-on business was another important contributor to our record results. During the quarter, we had multiple seven-figure add-on deals including a U.S. financial services firm is expanding its initial CyberArk deployment across the global organization. We originally won a relatively small deal in a new data center to protect Tier 0 critical assets, the most valuable assets for a hacker. After proving, we are a superior solution, they are now ripping and replacing a legacy technology to deploy CyberArk globally across all data centers.
After data breach last year, a UK transportation company has leveraged CyberArk to regain control over its network. The organization now has a board mandate to implement a cybersecurity program targeted to significantly reduce risk. Because our solution is measurable, privileged access security was the number one priority for this customer.
Our strong exclusion is generating synergies across our advisory, value-added reseller, and technology partner ecosystem, which is contributing to our strong performance. We are putting the customer first, working with our partners to help better secure against cyber attacks. Value-added resellers recognize that combining our privileged access solution with the C3 Alliance Technology Partners will strengthen their customer security position.
In the third quarter, our indirect business represented approximately 67% of total revenue. Our advisory partners are expanding their CyberArk practices and providing customers with valuable and scarce security talent which can implement our solution and deliver ongoing services. In the third quarter, about 20% of our business was again influenced by strategic partners like the Deloitte, PwC, KPMG and others. Our ecosystem is promoting a best-of-breed approach across a number of security projects, notably in mission-critical digital transformation and cloud migration strategies.
Conjur and AIM play a critical role in cloud migration as well as digital transformation with DevOps and Robotic Process Automation or RPA, both steadily gaining traction. By bringing together advisory firms, VARs and tech partners like Automation Anywhere, UiPath, Blue Prism, Red Hat OpenShift, and Puppet and others, we’re helping customers across industries securely automate business processes and the DevOps pipeline.
Our innovation has empowered customers to deploy or access CyberArk anywhere, on-premise, in the cloud, as a service or through an MSSP. During the third quarter, a large system integrator partner purchased our multitenant cloud managed security service provider offering. This partner has signed its first customers and is in the process of building out its broader MSSP offering. Our MSSP solution is further extending our reach into the midmarket and we are looking forward to working closely with this partner and others as they rollout privileged access security solutions.
We recently introduced our first innovation based on the Vaultive acquisition, Privileged Session Manager for Cloud. This solution extends our reach to protect cloud administrators and privileged business users. Through a transparent, easy to use experience, this new functionality extends session isolation, monitoring and control to the most common web applications cloud and social media platforms. As part of our Core PAS solution, Privileged Session Manager for Cloud leverages our threat analytics and risk scoring capabilities to detect and alert on suspicious privileged related activity. The market for privileged access security is rich with opportunity, and we believe that demand has never been stronger.
Technology and attacker innovation are continually changing the threat landscape. Recent industry disruption and consolidations are also creating near-term opportunities to capture market share. Our execution in the first nine months of this year has established a strong foundation to continue to responsibly invest in the business and deliver growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh to discuss more details about our record results. Josh? Thanks, Udi.
Before we begin reviewing the quarter, I wanted to remind everyone that our third quarter results reflect the modified retrospective approach to disclosure for accounting standard 606.
So, as Udi mentioned, we had a record quarter for total revenue and operating income. We were pleased to again exceed our outlook for all guided metrics.
Total revenue through by 31% year on year, reaching a record $84.7 million in third-quarter. We generated $46.1 million in license revenue, increasing 29% over the third quarter of 2017, representing 54% of total revenue. We experienced strong growth across all geographies, as well as in our mix for both add-on business and new customers, as well as channel contribution, which increased during the quarter.
Maintenance and professional services revenue was $38.5 million, increasing 33% over the prior year period and representing 46% of revenue. The professional services revenue associated with this line was $6.7 million or 8% of total revenue. All geographies performed well, again, in the third quarter. The Americas reached another record quarter, generating $52.1 million in revenue, growing 23% over third quarter last year and representing 62% of total revenue. EMEA generated another high growth quarter with $26.3 million in total revenue, or 42% year-on-year growth and 31% of total revenue. APJ recognized $6.3 million in revenue, growing 52% and representing 7% of total revenue.
Beyond geographic diversification, we experienced a broad-based demand across verticals with five verticals growing by 50% or faster. Those include manufacturing, insurance, retail, telco and professional services.
As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our third quarter gross profit was $74.9 million or an 88% gross margin. That’s compared to 86% gross margin in the same period last year. We continued to enjoy increased utilization of our professional services team, resulting in the improved gross margin for the quarter.
To capitalize on our significant opportunity, we are also continuing to invest in growth and scale. Our innovation has been a corner stone of our long-term success. R&D grew by 33% year on year to $12.7 million or 15% of revenues. That was primarily driven by headcount increasing by 21%, which included the acquisition of Vaultive in March earlier this year, and currency movements and hedging, which represented approximately $400,000 of the increase in R&D expenses or approximately 4% of the expense growth.
Sales and marketing increased by 12% to $33.9 million, or 40% of revenue as we expanded across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales. Consistent with last year in the third quarter, we again hosted our annual Americas and EMEA customer events this year in Boston and Berlin, respectively. We also introduced during the third quarter our new Defend events series, which were conducted in 12 cities across the Americas and attended by approximately 1,000 customers and prospects.
In G&A, our expense increased 36% year on year to $7.2 million or 8.5% of revenues as we continue to scale the business to support our growth. In total, operating expenses for the third quarter increased 20% to $53.9 million compared with $45.1 million for the third quarter last year. As a result of our record revenues, powerful business model and disciplined investments, we experienced strong leverage in the third quarter, delivering operating income ahead of our guidance at $21 million or a 25% operating margin. This compared to an operating income of $10.7 million, or 16% operating margin in the year-ago period.
We ended the third quarter with 1,106 employees worldwide, that’s up from 1,077 at June 30, and compared with 966 at the end of the third quarter of 2017. We had 524 employees in sales and marketing on September 30th, compared to 513 at June 30, 2018 and 468 at the end of third quarter of last year.
Net income was $17.8 million, generating earnings per share ahead of guidance at $0.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018, that’s increasing from the $8.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017.
We continued to generate cash flow from operations into the third quarter, increasing our total net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months to $89.2 million. This represents a 38% cash flow margin and an increase of 100% over the first nine months of the prior year period.
As a result, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $410 million in cash and investments. This compares to $330 million in cash and investments at year-end. We ended the third quarter with $136 million in total deferred revenue, a 29% increase from $105 million at year-end and a 59% increase from the $86 million at September 30, 2017. As a reminder, our deferred revenue primarily consists of return revenue derived from the maintenance and support contracts.
Turning to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates.
So, for the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect total revenue of $94.8 million to $96.3 million or 19% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $27.3 million to $28.5 million or a non-GAAP margin of 29% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of between $0.58 to $0.60. Our guidance assumes 37.9 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of 21% for the fourth quarter.
Given the strength of our execution and the strong demand in our business during the first nine months of the year, we are pleased to raise our full year guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $328.9 million to $330.4 million or growth of approximately 26% at the midpoint.
We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $78 to $79.2 million, or an operating margin 24% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP net income for diluted share of $1.75 to $1.77. This assumes 37.2 million weighted average diluted shares. Our guidance for the full-year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for the 2018.
We are also increasing our outlook for cash flow from operations -- from operation margins to be between 8% and 13% higher than our non-GAAP net income margin for the full year. This compares to the prior year guidance range of net income margin to 10 percentage points higher than our net income margin. As a reminder, the cash flow margin can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on seasonality of the business, tax obligations, cash collection and duration of maintenance contract renewals. Our execution year-to-date positions us well for the fourth quarter of 2018.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Josh, maybe for you. You talked about sort of the strength in multiple verticals. I think you talked about some verticals that grew 50% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about the federal government contribution this quarter? I know that last year we had some deals closed, I’m wondering if that strength kind of continued here in Q3. Hey, Saket. It’s Udi. I’ll jump in first. I would say that Q3 was healthy in the federal government. Q2 was the record quarter, and we talked about some of the unique programs that we saw throughout the year. We saw continued growth in the vertical. Year-to-date, it’s up 25%, and we had 40 transactions of both new and add-on business within Q3 itself. There has been a lot of ceding that I’m excited about that happened throughout the year with opportunity for add-on business. And I think as we mention, the global government space is now -- continues to be in our top three largest and has grown very nicely throughout the year. Udi, maybe for my follow-up for you, more of a product question. Last quarter, you talked about introducing the Privilege Cloud to really future proof CyberArk’s leadership. I think, some of the deal examples that you talked about in your prepared remarks, also talked about hybrid deployments and such. Realizing it’s early, can you just remind us how the Privilege Cloud is different than your traditional EPV? And what some of the early feedback has been on Privilege Cloud? Sure, absolutely. So, the examples we gave in our prepared remarks are absolutely existing -- are existing solutions that currently extends into cloud deployments, either securing cloud assets or being deployed in the cloud, and some of the examples that I mentioned. And those are customers that are taking existing CyberArk products and deploying them in the cloud or to secure cloud assets. The Privilege Cloud is really brand new, the CyberArk Privilege Cloud and very early, but we are making early progress with early customers and pipes. The main difference there is that the customer will not deal with installation of the infrastructure itself with CyberArk. They are able to consume it as a service. And obviously, it’s more oriented towards smaller organizations, but like you said, it’s future proofing us to the world where more and more customers will trust the cloud as the place that they want to the keys of the IT kingdom. And so, we see it as a very important long-term opportunity for us. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. I think, I’ll start with maybe an update on the simplified pricing model and new bundles. I know you said in previous quarters that you’ve seen an easing of sales cycles within new simplified pricing, but you weren’t yet receiving the full benefit from that. So, can you just maybe give us an update of the benefits that you saw in Q3, if you’ve seen any changes? And then, also, if you are seeing any impact to ASPs from the new bundles? Josh, do you want to…? Yes. Hi, Melissa. So, with regard to the new pricing, we obviously are seeing with our new business deals, a real shift. We are already up over 90% of our new business deals in the third quarter. We are buying off of the new price list with the simplified pricing. And if we kind of look at total, all the add-on and the new combined, we are close to 70% in the third quarter, using the new pricing model. So, we’ve really got great traction. I think customers are getting it. And we are using it. I think in terms of impact on ASP, we are not seeing a big change or an impact on ASP at this point yet. But, we are seeing, like you called out early on is that a nice qualitative improvement on the sales cycle since it’s accelerating new customers, acquisition and we think it’s exciting as well to the success that we’ve had with the new customers. And it also in quicker way and easier way brings us to conversations around our other products in addition to Core PAS. So, overall, we like the decision we made there, and we are well on our way for being a fully adopted. And then, just one follow-up for you Josh on margins and margins came in well ahead of expectations in Q3. Is that simply because revenue came in ahead and that fell through to operating margins or was there anything to think about in terms of the timing of investments or maybe the investment plan coming in a little bit lower than what you were expecting and the reason for that? So, first of all, the revenue did flow through to the bottom line, which we really like to try to make happen. Also, we had a benefit that we also saw in Q2, which we had a nice benefit on the gross margin with our strong 88% gross margin contributing, at least another percent down to the bottom line with the efficiencies that we’re getting in our globalized services group that we started at the beginning of this year. I think in terms of spending, we’re pretty much on track. There were some I would say actually -- we actually worked hard and we had a lot of marketing programs in Q3. And we looked at a lot of them and actually negotiated well and we were in line or under on those program spending that we did through basically just good purchasing discipline. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Just as a medium term outlook question either for Udi or for Josh. Looking at some of the volatility that you’ve seen in license revenue over the last 6, 7 quarters in part due to the European execution issue that you called out over a year now. The question is, how should think about a normalized run rate or normalized growth rates for license revenue over the medium terms, just given all of your positive comments on growth acceleration? I’ll start here. I think that we -- first of all, we are talking them about obviously 2019 and beyond in terms of license growth. We are enterprise software and Q4 is important quarter for us to really know and be an indicator for going into next year, the next several years. But, I think the way we look at it and I think Udi might be able to add to this is, we look at where the market is going, where the industry analysts are talking about where Core PAS is and what the opportunity. And we definitely see ourselves as a leader in the competitive space and to be able to take our piece of that. So, I think that we still, as we talked about earlier in the year, see ourselves with an opportunity in the early stage of the game to be a higher grower, which requires growing in licenses well as our support contracts, and we’re going to invest to try to keep that momentum going. The follow-up is on the earlier comment on your cloud products that one of the big differences between on-perm versus other service, the customer won’t have to deal with the installation of any of the backend infrastructure themselves. I’m wondering if that maybe gets gives an opportunity on the pricing front. In other words, can you expand your share of wallet at the customer while also allowing the customer to realized better TCO on the service side on the installation side? Does that maybe give you an opportunity to expand your TAM or expand your pricing with your other service offerings? Udi, I’ll take it. I think, the biggest opportunity, and again, like I said, it’s the long-term one, is the ability to reach out further down market with the customers who do not want to deal with the installation and really consume this as a service. The biggest benefit and back to pricing right now is the adjustment we’ve done, and we are very pleased with how it’s kicking in for the enterprise customers and of course those on the mid-market that by off of it where we are making it very easy for them to quantify their use. And a bigger and an accelerated land for CyberArk. That’s how we see it today. But obviously, the lower the installation phase, the lower the installation cost, the easier it is for us to expand our reach. Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Udi, if I look at the 200 new logos you’ve discussed and disclosed -- the number you’ve disclosed this quarter, you’ve indicated also 20 new retail customers that makes it 10% out of the total for this quarter. Is it fair to assume the majority are mostly high-end and mid-end enterprise customers? And probably how many products on average have each of the new 200 logos acquired? Is it typical Core PAS product or there is already an EPM and Conjur potential IAM bundles into some of those new contracts? Thanks, Shaul. I would say that the majority are enterprise customers I would say in our focused markets, but we do see a pickup in the higher end side of the mid market as part of it, but the majority are our enterprise. And as we alluded, we for the first time put out our footprint in the Fortune 500 and we are happy to say that we are now sit in 50% of the Fortune 500. With regards to the product mix, now that we really unified the enterprise Password Vault and PSM and the products that into Core PAS. I would say most of these customers would land with Core PAS and it also is aligned with how we recommend to go about in really securing their major and burning risks around the retaining control over their network and cloud, but in several of these did include AIM-Conjur and EPM. It’s still really depending on the level of the customer. It’s still -- those are still products that make it into seeding and if not, in the seeding they are part of our add-on sales motion. Got it. And maybe one for Josh, given the strong result this quarter linearity anything out of the ordinary maybe there was some business that actually you guys have decided to push into the fourth quarter or it was pretty much steady as she go? I would say, we had good linearity in Q3. And it actually has tracked well from Q2 as well in terms of the linearity. And so we’re -- and I think you also see it reflected in our cash flow as well and the lower DSO that we are able to achieve. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. I wonder if you could just go into little bit more detail around the EMEA region. You are seeing nice consistency out of the geography for several quarters now. Wondering if you can maybe highlight, whether it’s marketing programs or other items that’s been driving the consistency and what we should expect from here? Thanks, Sterling. I really think it’s one of the items, I’m very pleased on the strategic moves we made and how they contributed to the overachieve and part of it is optimizing and globalizing the sales force and our theory that was hey, let’s take the successful sales motion that we did in the Americas and expand it to EMEA while pushing consistently in that, and that’s really what’s been happening. The one true change out there is more and more information security officers in Europe and I personally have the opportunity to talk to them, are trying to combine the heavy regulatory requirements that they have with addressing risk becoming really much more oriented toward, OK, if I have to comply, I’ll also raise the value I’m going to deliver to the organization by really solving true risk assets and privileged access has been really been elevating in the top priority as we’ve discussed in the Americas market. So the combination of being consistent, being very focused on reducing risk for our customers and training our channel partners to sell through risk and the growing market awareness, a lot of it driven by our marketing programs over the years and in the year, have been contributing to that consistency. Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is open. Good afternoon, thank you for taking the questions. Udi maybe to start with you, in your prepared remarks, it sounded more like you were having maybe more outsize success on the expansionary side and to that extent, I’m actually wondering on what sort of multiplier you’re seeing on lifetime customer spend and to what extent are your sales cycles actually shifting and frankly benefiting from the bundled approach and then a follow-up if I may? Yes, so Fatima I would say that one big header in this quarter is diversification. But it was, so geographic diversification, vertical diversification that we talked about, but also in the mix of new and add on, it was about a 40% new, 60% add-on business so definitely healthy contribution from new end and from add-on. In that add-on business, I agree with you, it’s customers that are becoming more strategic with CyberArk, we’re excited also to see that we are part of their cloud journey, it’s securing the ever-increasing footprint in the cloud, and again whether it’s for human users or for the application users like Conjur and AIM, and I would say, we’re pleased with the focus we’ve been giving with our customer success team on generating more lifetime opportunity from these major accounts and of course, there is a lot more to be done on this journey. Udi, you also mentioned sort of, on marquee when with MSSP customer, can you kind of walk us through the broader MSSP opportunity and how we should think about the potential for maybe cannibalization on the lower end of the customers as you increasingly partner with MSSPs and typical systems integrators and service providers? Thank you. I would say, true to our strategy also in partnering, we really go for quality versus quantity. And so the MSSPs have been cherry picked and they have to qualify to be able to really deliver true service to our customers. So we really don’t see a risk of over cannibalizing with too many MSSPs out there. It’s still an early CyberArk offering with the first MSSPs out there. And for us, strategically it’s our way to reach further into mid-market, and allowing us to focus on the enterprise opportunities. I think there’s going to be a healthy equilibrium of whether it’s a partner making it easy for their existing customers to CyberArk by joining their MSSP offering or really extending our reach by going further mid market that we would, on our own organically. And again, doing that with qualified partners really ensures that we keep a healthy equilibrium. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Thank you. And congrats on a nice quarter. Just want to ask about the competitive environment, it’s been getting a little noisier, there’s been a number of acquisitions in the space. Can you just give us an update on the landscape and whether those acquisitions may have opened up some more opportunities for CyberArk? Yes, absolutely. And thanks for the congrats. I would say, if we look over the last 12 months, CyberArk really strengthened its leadership position. And again, we see the execution and results. And a lot of it is the proactive measures that we’ve taken in our strategy Version 10, our simplification, our pricing and the strategic M&As that we have done, that really break us away from other vendors. But definitely the changes in the competitive landscape with the M&As in the last few months add, I would say, to turmoil within our competitive landscape, we’ve had. We’ve seen Francisco Partners has a private equity firm pickup four distinct vendors in the market BeyondTrust, Bomgar, Lieberman, Avecto and expect disruption there. We’ve seen CA get acquired by Broadcom. And so, yes, we do expect to see further opportunity from that disruption. And true to us, we are going after the leadership regardless of that and we will further capitalize on that opportunity. And then, I just want to ask about the, some of your partnerships with OKTA and SailPoint. I’m wondering, have you seen any new customer wins as a result of those partnerships yet? Absolutely. I think we gave one example in the prepared remarks, but we’ve been doing joint events, referring each other. It’s been a very healthy partnership out in the field that is adding, I would say to each of the company’s pipeline. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gur Talpaz of Stifel. Your line is open. Okay, great. Udi, I want to ask about the release of PAS v10.2 back in March. So how important has this been in driving some of the strength that you noted on the call. But more specifically, not just for the broader platform for products like Conjur, where you noted a bunch of pretty interesting wins? Absolutely. So, I think one of the unique things that go with 10.2 and beyond is, is that the customers can integrate their Conjur environment into their on-premise environment, and have a unified way to manage credentials, if they choose to do that for their on-premise environment, and also for their cloud and native cloud architecture based applications. We are now out there with 10.5. We’ve been continuously -- from Version 10 and beyond, it’s all been about simplification, automation, making it easier for our customers to install, making it easier for customers to deploy, manage, introduce more and more automation. So we really think it’s become a big differentiator, it’s become a big piece, as Josh mentioned, of the acceleration in the new logos, and we’ve been really working closely with customers to make sure that every additional dot releases is continuing that thread of simplification, and in automation and we’re excited about it. Within the public cloud specifically, where do you think we are in terms of the customer life cycle process, meaning, do you think we’re still pretty firmly in the evangelical phase? Are we starting to kind of push past that? I would say, we’re really a true I would say, compass for that, because we touched so many different verticals in all over the world, and I would say there is no customer that’s not doubling one way or another with cloud, and in one -- and anywhere on the scale of just being very early and trying to see what they can do because they are highly regulated to those, like the retail example I gave that just see it as a big differentiator, a way to lower cost and move workloads and -- into the cloud. So I think it’s -- the journey is very much advanced. It really differs between the different companies, but in all of them we were able to latch in at whatever phase they are in and say, okay, first of all, let’s make sure you have control over your network, and that you have control over your cloud and enjoying that transformation journey. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to maybe start with the resellers and channel leverage. I just want to understand a little bit better. What type of opportunity you see there, just given the pickup in terms of the third-party generation of leads? And then maybe what the size and influence service are doing on your behalf as well, that’s maybe a little bit more than what they did in the past? Yes, absolutely. I think Jonathan, just like we -- in the early years, we had to really evangelize why privileged access is such a critical security layer and over the past year, just like it came up to the top with customers. We’re really seeing it come to the top with our channel partners, and to the top in terms of what they’re seeing from their -- they’re hearing back from their customers, but also in what they’re seeing as an opportunity for their own revenue generation. And we team up with them, and we create business plans really depending on the strength of the VAR. Is it a company that’s -- that is going after the services opportunity? Is it a company with a strong reach in new markets for us? Is it an advisory firm where they really influence the Fortune 500 vendor selection and have built practices around that. So I would say, it’s more and more elevating. We are measuring internally the -- those that are not just generate leads, but also are influencing like the advisory firms and it’s really in the right trajectory. For specifically on system integrators, we’ve seen system integrators include the CyberArk offering in their responses when -- in RFP responses and others, when they’re going after even larger transformation projects like new datacenters, and digital transformation. We’ve also seen them go after the services opportunity with CyberArk. Some of them are also on the -- are adopting our MSSP offering. Got it. Thank you for the color. I also noticed that you talked about IoT opportunities, particularly on the security camera market. I think this is one of the first time that you’ve talked about, and probably which within this context. Can you maybe talk about this in terms of the growth opportunity. Is this a large portion of your business today? And is it being able to target that on the pipeline side? And can you maybe give us a color around the opportunities that you see here? No, it’s a great one. We gave an example of a Fortune 100 company, well, that was the landing point, was they’re concerned about their IoT devices, in this case, cameras and the ability to control and rotate credential on these devices. So that they won’t be the landing spot for attacks. We view that as a very early opportunity for us, and I would say it’s very nascent and it’s out, there are more enterprises themselves have that IoT sprawl, the more we can go after it. One of our partnerships is with ForeScout who have the capability to detect and discover these devices and CyberArk can be the company to rotate credentials and secure administrative access to these devices. So it’s early, but it’s out there. Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Smith of First Analysis. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you, and I’ll add my congratulations for the very strong results. My first question has to do going back to kind of a team question on new versus add-on, with the larger installed base and all the opportunity there, do you see a kind of medium-term trend toward more of your business, each quarter coming from the installed base versus new or not? We actually have been pretty consistent over the last, I think, a year almost or two years with being about a 60-40 mix, 60% of our license revenue coming from existing customers and 40% coming from new customers. We do see a little bit of shifting in there from quarter to quarter, but it’s been pretty consistent and we saw that into Q3. And if you look at the first nine months of the year, it’s also hovering around the close to the 60-40 mix. So as you pointed out yourself, we actually have a huge market opportunity within our installed base and we view it as a big market opportunity. I think at this point, we also only 4,000, we have 4,200 plus customers, but we only have that much and we see that as a big greenfield opportunity as well. So I can’t really predict exactly what the percentage will be going forward, but it’s been pretty consistent over the last year or plus at this level. And given the greenfield opportunity on the new customers and on the existing installed base, we’re really investing in the same tone going forward in both. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. So, I just want to circle back on the license growth, I mean if I look year-to-date growth is coming in at about 27% in license as well above even the best quarters that you had last year and it’s closer to the 2016 trend line. So I was wondering if you can just kind of high level talk about the top drivers of the improvement. And is it more, would you say it’s more the execution and things that you’re doing on your side like the new bundles or is it more just an improvement in the overall market? I would say that it’s executing and really seeing the fruits of strategic moves we’ve made, coupled up with increased demand of the globalizing of the sales and optimizing of the sales and support organization. Everything I mentioned about Version 10 to simplify the pricing, the strategic M&As we’ve done particularly EPM, Conjur, Vaultive that gave us a strengthened our cloud play both on the human side and the applications, coupled with the market fundamentals with privilege really moving up in, in priority even in third-party recommendations, like I mentioned last time in some of the government conferences and others. Digital transformation initiatives really rising up and compliance as I would say rising, but being addressed more in a risk oriented fashion. So we’re executing against that and the past investments have allowed us to, to really over-achieve here. Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question, really nice quarter. Can you discuss you’ve had such great, great following on Gray’s question here, what are you doing in terms of training. It seems like this, even though you simplified the product and the pricing, it’s still is pretty complicated and what steps are you going to implement training of your resellers and the people at the advisory firms et cetera that are helping you drive this growth? No. Thank you. As I said I think training is an ongoing initiative. We set a goal to really increase the ecosystem of CyberArk certified engineers out there, we put up some numbers in previous quarters where we’ve significantly increased the footprint out there. We see it as a good sign that our training courses in when we do our customer events are always completely booked and oversold their strong demand for CyberArk talent out there and we’re continuing to investing going after it also in train -- the trainer program, so that we can further bring our training programs to market. And we are hearing consistent feedback from customers and partners that everything we’ve done on 10 from a product perspective and everything we’ve done on pricing simplification is really helping them. Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP. Your line is open. Your channel, I think you said, contributed too were influenced 67% of your deals. I think that’s up from where it’s been historically, can you give us a sense, do you think that will continue to elevate from that level? And then secondly, did you have much influence or much effect from GDPR here in the September quarter since at the first quarter, full quarter that’s been in effect? So, I’ll start with the last one and we’ll come back to the channel. I think we see anecdotal connections to GDPR where customers have cited that it’s been a driver. But I think the bigger overarching driver for our business has continued to be the risk-oriented approach and compliance is, I would say compliance is being consumed in a smarter way. Beyond GDPR, there’s GDPR, NIS, PCI, SOX. There are continued strong compliance drivers and more customers are addressing them with things that we’re really move the needle on reducing risk.
But in EMEA, they definitely bring it up, but it’s more, anecdotal. I also want to note that we’re hearing US organizations, and North America organizations looking at GDPR as something that they have to look at, but again in our conversations they then combine it with less reduced risk. We think that GDPR will be more of a steady drumbeat for business over a long period of time. Hi, Eric. And if we kind of return back to the channel question. Yes, it was up in Q3, it was in the mid to -- just above the mid-60s and clearly that’s a level that’s also driven by the advisory firms that are contributing healthy as well to this space and I think though the overall our strategy has been pretty much the same if we think about the year-to-date, it is still around the 60-40 level which is similar levels that we saw in 2017. So I’m not going to jump the gun yet and say that we have a new level of channels, because we do get some lumpiness depending of certain deals may go through a channel. But overall, we’re happy with the way channels executed with us and for us in the third quarter and we’re keeping, we’re sticking with it and investing heavily in this area. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Could you give us a sense for how your large deals tracked in the quarter and how they’re tracking in the pipeline? Yes. We increased in large deals across the board. If you look at our over 100k deals, they increased dramatically. I think, faster than the rate of the business growth and if we look at also, if you go up into the next levels above $0.5 million, also increasing very nicely. I think every quarter, we have several seven figure deals and larger deals and overall we are pleased with the large deals are because it’s not just happening in one area too, it’s really happening the growth in our over 100k deals are happening across each of the regions. Also in Americas, also in EMEA, and also in APJ. So, that’s really sending a strong statement about the footprint that our customers want to take with us. And if we think about the pipeline, absolutely, in order for us to keep growing the business and we look at the health of our pipeline, we see a continued traction in developing large deals in our pipeline as well. It’s going to be -- it’s part of the cornerstone of our growth. The good news is that we continue to really have a diversified group of deal sizes and overall we’re -- our average deal size has been pretty stable, both on add-on and new customers. So, we think we’re in a good place there. And I guess not exclude specific to large deals, but could you give us a sense, which verticals you’re seeing the greatest increased in interest or if you want to describe that as pipeline? I think well if we talk about -- if we talk about the third quarter, the largest vertical growths were insurance, manufacturing, retail. We had three verticals, which are still -- which were over 10% of our pie -- banking as it usually is global government also manufacturing in the third quarter. And if we look at our -- if we look at our large deal split, we’re going to see it in every vertical. There isn’t -- I don’t think there is one of our key verticals, one of our top 7 or 8 verticals that we’re not doing large deals in -- on a regular basis. Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Ives of Wedbush. Your line is open. Just a quick question. How penetrated, do you think your installed base is today? I mean, just given the success you are seeing if you would estimate? How penetrated is our installed base? Yes, on your solution side. I think, if we look across all of our customer base, we kind of we view it as still under a third in a deployment rate and that’s, we were talking about earlier and one of the earlier questions, we’re seeing consistently 60% of license revenue coming from our existing customers. We also are still very much on track and seeing a third of our customers coming back each year and that grows obviously as we keep acquiring new customers that third -- that number goes up each year and we see them coming back and buying either more of the same licenses or across over to new licenses. So where -- we still feel though that we’re under the third mark. Thank you. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you. And I’ll echo the congratulations on a really strong quarter. Udi, I just had a follow-up on your success in retail. When you look at the deals that closed this quarter combined with the pipeline, would you say that you’re now seeing an inflection in retail? Or is this something that was also significantly ramping in the first half of the year? I think the biggest jump is in comparison to last year and I think the unique element is they embrace me -- that they are embracing cloud and digital transformation. I think the inflection point is more of these retailers obviously for all the reasons we understand that that’s their way to really jump on the wagon and with increased competition and also to differentiate. But there are also a prime target of attackers as we know, and so the biggest change has been our ability to latch on their digital transformation, initiatives and I would say the -- it started throughout the year. Thank you. At this time, I like to turn the call back to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Thank you. In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and our employees worldwide for contributing to our record third quarter results. Thank you everybody, and good night.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Thanks, Erica. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year end conference call. We had a phenomenal record breaking 2018, executing on all of the strategic goals that we outlined for you early in the year.
Through our innovation, we have cemented our leadership position as the industry's global solution provider to secure privileged access from on-premise to the cloud. We're increasingly a critical component of our customers’ digital transformation strategies by securing cloud assets and access, application credentials and secrets in the DevOps pipeline.
We extend our reach to our partner ecosystem and we significantly enhanced the efficiency, productivity and consistency of our sales and marketing engine. Our momentum continued to build throughout the year. And in the fourth quarter, we delivered amazing results, exceeding our guidance across all measures.
Total revenue reached a record $109 million, with growth accelerating to 36%. We were thrilled that our License revenue growth outpaced old revenue and accelerated to 38% in the fourth quarter. We delivered our best ever non-GAAP operating income of $40 million. And we signed over 250 new logos, the largest number in the company's history, ending the year with more than 4,450 customers.
For the full year, revenues reached $343 million, growing 31%. Non-GAAP operating income was $90 million and we generated a record cash flow from operations of $130 million.
Today's business paradigm dictates that every organization, the insurance company, the retailer, the airline, utility, is a software company. Implementing digital transformation strategies and migrating workloads to the cloud. They are leveraging speed, automation and agility as a competitive advantage. This is causing organizations around the world to rethink security and prioritize impactful initiatives.
Escalating privileges of human and non-human credentials remains at the center of almost every major attack. In this new, more complex environment privileged accounts are being created and privileged access expanded at unprecedented rate. Chief information security officers are also increasingly talking a security-first approach to solving compliance challenges, like GDPR, NIST, SOX, and PCI.
As a result, awareness and demand for privileged access security has increased across geographies, verticals and from companies of all sizes. In fact, on the 3rd of December 2018, Gartner published its first ever Magic Quadrant for Privileged Access Management, stating, and I quote, “Privileged Access Management is one of the most critical security controls particularly in today's increasingly complex IT environment. Security and risk management leaders must use PAM tools in a long-term strategy for comprehensive risk mitigation.”
We were proud that our ability to execute and completeness of vision were recognized by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant as a leader, farthest to the right on the completeness of vision, access, and the highest on the ability to execute access.
While strong market fundamentals certainly played a factor in our record result this year, our execution and strategic moves globalizing the team, delivering continuous innovation and simplifying our pricing were among the biggest contributors to our success, with revenue growth accelerating in all major [theaters].
The Americas revenue growth rate accelerated from 20% in 2017 to 26% in 2018. EMEA from 20% to 37%, and APJ growth accelerated from 30% to 47% in 2018. All geographies performed exceptionally well.
A number of seven figure add-on deals in the fourth quarter demonstrated the impact of our strategy. We were the only vendor who provided a leading bank in EMEA with a battle-tested global privileged access security program that complemented its cloud-first strategy in Azure.
With our new licensing we simplified the customers’ buying journey and solve the critical pain point providing visibility into unmanaged unauthorized privileged access across its on-premise and cloud environments with threat analytics.
A Global 2000 insurance company began with Enterprise Vault in the UK in 2015. Because of our team’s deep privileged access domain expertise the customer is standardizing on CyberArk across all data centers in the Americas, EMEA and APJ. With the simplicity of Version 10 the customer was up and running quickly after closing the deal.
A top five lifetime value customer significantly expanded its CyberArk program in Q4. The customer is adding Endpoint Privilege Manager for credential theft blocking and Conjur to secure application development in Pivotal Cloud Foundry and AWS. Both solutions help address its number one priority to quickly and measurably reduce risk across the enterprise.
Our strategy also contributed to a record number of new logos. In a competitive ripping and replace deal a larger European manufacturing company chose CyberArk because of our global scalability and support. We increasingly see organizations who bought privileged access security for compliance turn to CyberArk to implement holistic, scalable privileged access programs.
As part of its cloud-first strategy, a leading SaaS company has deployed CyberArk in AWS. After an extensive POC we won unanimous cross-functional support from information security, identity and access management and the application developers. With Core PAS and Conjur the organization will realize material security and operational efficiencies from centralized control and a single pane of glass into human users, machine identities, production applications and application development.
We saw Application Identity Manager and Conjur as key differentiators this year as CIOs and CISOs look to strike the balance between flexibility, growth and risk mitigation. In fact AIM and Conjur were included in six of our top 10 deals this year.
Innovation is critical to our long-term strategy. In 2018, we again set the standard and redefined privileged access security being first to market with new and enhanced solutions that automate and drive efficiency for security and operational teams. We accelerate the pace of our innovation, enriching our Core Privileged Access Security solution with eight new versions that included key functionality like Streamline Workflows, Just-In-Time Access, Automated Discovery, on-boarding of privilege accounts and Simplify Deployment.
We introduced enhanced protection in AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Azure as well as DevOps and containerized platforms to strengthen our customer security as they execute their digital transformation strategies.
In addition, we launched Privileged Session Manager for cloud which secures cloud administrators and privileged business users who are often targeted by attackers. We also empowered our customers to deploy or access CyberArk anywhere on-premise, in the cloud or as a service with CyberArk Privilege Cloud and our MSP solution. And our labs team is leveraging extensive experience to analyze the latest hacker threats and help inform our product roadmap decisions.
Another example from earlier in 2018 is the CyberArk marketplace. The industry's broadest and deepest portfolio of integrations for privileged access security, customers have a trusted platform to easily access and deploy integrations across their entire technology stack, including security, IT operations, cloud, DevOps and Robotic Process Automation software. Our advisory, value-added reseller and technology partner ecosystem also played a key role in our results with about 67% of our revenue coming from indirect channel, up from 61% in the full year 2017.
Deals influenced by advisory firms, like PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Accenture increased by more than 85% in 2018. Our partners understand that a best of breed approach to mission critical security projects like digital transformation and identity improves the customers overall security posture.
As we look at the year ahead, our primary focus is to deliver innovation and drive long-term sustainable growth. We are in a greenfield market and have tremendous opportunity to expand our relationships with our more than 4,400 customers. As a result, our major strategic initiatives for 2019 include: increasing enterprise customer penetration in new and add-on business, formalizing our motion in the mid market, driving adoption of our application and privileged endpoint solutions and delivering clinical innovation and expanding our solutions across on-premise and cloud to automate, simplify and better protect our customers.
2018 was an amazing record setting year, and I'm very proud of our team. Our results strengthen our conviction that we are in the early stages of our opportunity and that momentum in the privileged access security market is accelerating. As we move into 2019, we are in a strong position to continue to build an enduring leader in cyber security, and I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh, to discuss our record results. Josh? Yes, thanks Udi. Before we begin reviewing the quarter, I wanted to remind everyone that our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect the modified retrospective approach to disclosure for accounting standard 606. As you’ve heard from Udi already, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results, capping off a record year.
In the fourth quarter, we generated $109.1 million in revenue, accelerating growth to 36% year-on-year. Our outperformance in the fourth quarter was driven by strong execution coupled with broad-based demand and greater than expected year end budget flush. License revenue reached a record $66.8 million with year-on-year growth accelerating to 38%. In the fourth quarter License revenue represented 61% of total revenue, that's up slightly from the 60% in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Maintenance and Professional Services revenue increased by 33% to $42.3 million and represented 39% of total revenue. The Professional Services revenue associated with this line was $7.7 million or 7% of total revenue.
The Americas reached another record of $60.9 million in revenue and growth accelerating also significantly to 40% in the fourth quarter. EMEA also reached a record of $41.6 million in the fourth quarter and growing 28% year-on-year. We are also pleased to see the Asia Pacific Japan region grow by 56% year-on-year to $6.5 million in revenue for the quarter. We had a strong demand across verticals in the fourth quarter with manufacturing, telecom, IT services and software, retail and pharmaceuticals, all of them growing faster than 50%.
As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Gross profit for the quarter was $98.2 million, increasing our gross margin to 90% compared to $70.6 million or an 88% gross margin in the same period last year. We continued to experience higher utilization of our Professional Services team, resulting in the improved gross margin for the quarter.
On the expense side, our priority continues to be to invest in innovation, growth and scaling the organization. Our R&D grew 23% year-on-year to $13.2 million or 12% of total revenue. Sales and marketing for the quarter increased 7% year-on-year to $36.5 million or 33% of total revenue and G&A expense increased 41% $8.7 million or 8% of total revenue.
In total operating expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter to $58.4 million compared with $50.9 million for the same period last year. Our revenue outperformance and disciplined investments drove strong leverage again in the fourth quarter. Operating income and margin both reached the record of $39.8 million and a 36% operating margin, a strong increase from operating income on $19.7 million or 24% operating margin in the year ago period.
Net income was $33.4 million or $0.89 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of this year, more than doubling from $15 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year.
Now let me summarize our strong results for the full year of 2018. Total revenue for the year was again ahead of guidance reaching $343.2 million, with growth accelerating to 31%, compared to $261.7 million in 2017. License revenue for the year was $192.5 million with growth accelerating to 30% year-on-year and representing 56% of total revenue.
In 2018, 60% of License revenue was generated from existing customers, purchasing additional licenses and approximately 40% of revenue from new customers, consistent with the revenue mix that we saw in 2017.
On the product side, AIM and Conjur together represented about 10% of License revenue for the year and our Endpoint Privilege Manager represented about 8% of License revenue for 2018.
Maintenance and Professional Services revenue increased 32% over last year, reaching $150.7 million and representing 44% of total revenue. The Professional Services revenue associated with this line was $26.7 million or 8% of total revenue, very consistent with the prior year. Again in 2018, our renewal rate was over 90% which was attributed to mission-critical nature of our solution and our strong customer service.
As Udi mentioned earlier, growth accelerated across all geography for the year. The Americas generated $205.5 million in revenue growing 26% and representing 60% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew by 37% in 2018, reaching $112.1 million or approximately 33% of total revenue. Asia Pacific Japan grew 47% to $25.6 million or 7% of total revenue.
For the full year our business was also well diversified across [Audio Gap] both accelerating to 32% of those deals -- on those deals from 27% in 2017. We also had 133 deals over $500,000 compared to 92 deals over $500,000 in 2017.
We are pleased with the healthy growth for these larger deals not only in the Americas, but also across EMEA and APJ which demonstrated that privileged access security is moving up on the list of priorities for CISOs those globally, as Udi mentioned earlier.
Our gross margin for the year was 88%, compared to 86.5% in 2017, which was ahead of our expectations due to the higher utilization of our Professional Services team as we have discussed throughout the year. While we continue to make strategic investments in growth and innovation, our strong P&L demonstrates the efficiency of our operations.
For the full year R&D represented 14% of total revenue consistent with the 14% last year. Sales and marketing represented 39% of total revenue and G&A represented 8.5% of total revenue, resulting in record operating income of $90.5 million in 2018, or 26% operating margin, which was ahead of our guidance and a strong increase from the $51.9 million or 20% operating margin in 2017.
One of our goals for 2018 was to drive growth, while improving productivity and efficiency of our investments, we delivered in 2018. Our net income was $76.5 million or $2.06 per diluted share in 2018 increasing nicely from $41.9 million or $1.16 per diluted share in 2017. Our effective tax rate for the year was 19.5%.
We ended the year with 1,146 employees worldwide compared to 1,015 at the end of 2017, and that includes 541 employees in sales and marketing at year-end, up from 491 at December 31, 2017.
We generated record cash flow from operations in 2018 of $130 million or 38% cash flow margin. This compared with $81 million in cash flow in the full year of 2017 or 31% cash flow margin. Our stronger than expected cash flow from operations was driven primarily by improved linearity throughout the quarters and the year and outperformance in bookings while maintaining a disciplined approach to investments.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had $451 million in cash and cash equivalents deposits, marketable securities at December 31, that's an increase from $330 million at the end of 2017. Deferred revenue for the full year increased 42% to $150 million at year end.
Moving on to our guidance for the first quarter of 2019 and the full year. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses, as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates.
So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $91 million to $93 million or 28% growth, at the midpoint of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range from $18.5 million to $20 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.39 to $0.42. This assumes $38.2 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of approximately 21%.
We're initiating our guidance for the full year of 2019. We expect total revenue for the -- in the range of $411 to $415 or growth of approximately 20% at the midpoint. We expect a mix of License and Maintenance and Professional Services revenue in 2019 to be between approximately 54% to 56% from License revenue and the balance of 46% to 44% coming from the Maintenance and Professional Services revenue.
We expect our gross margin to be between 87% to 88% for the full year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $92.5 million $95.5 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.94 to $2.00. This assumes $38.5 million weighted average diluted shares. Our guidance for the full year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2019.
We typically experienced a sequential revenue decline into the first quarter, moderate sequential growth into the second quarter and then into the third quarter, and Q4, in our largest revenue quarter of the year. On the expense side, we typically see a step up in expenses in the third quarter as a result of seasonal employee expenses as well as our marquee Americas customer event.
We also wanted to provide you with a bit more color on some line items for 2019. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million, which represents approximately 2% of revenue at the midpoint of the range. As we look at the full year 2019, we expect our cash flow from operations margin to run between 5 to 10 percentage points higher than our non-GAAP net income margin. We recommend analysts to evaluate our cash flow on an annual basis, given that our cash flow from operations can vary quarterly based on seasonality of the business and taxes. We do not plan to provide quarterly updates on guidance for cash flow from operations.
Fundamentals for privileged access security continue to be robust, and as a result, our priority for 2019 is to strengthen the organization, to generate sustainable growth over the long-term while staying true to our operating principle of delivering profitability through disciplined investments.
As Udi mentioned, our key areas of focus in 2019 are sales and marketing and R&D. We had a great 2018 and the team delivered against all of its objectives. As a result of our execution we are entering 2019 with strong momentum, and are looking forward to the year ahead.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my questions here. Udi, maybe just to start with you. I think it's pretty clear in the results but I just want to make sure this question is asked. Did you feel like you saw higher win rates, that is higher competitive win rate for the quarter? Or do you have any other anecdotal observations from the quarter related to competitive disruption? Sure, Hi, Saket and thank you. Yes, absolutely. I think we indicated in the last several months that we're seeing disruption with our competitors primarily with the roll ups by private equity, they create disruption in existing customers, they definitely create disruption for them in active sales processes. And yes, so we saw an increase in our win rate, I would say consistently throughout the year. It was one of our strategic objectives into 2018. And of course, cementing our market leadership with the Magic Quadrant by Gartner, the Forrester report and others kind of made it very clear. And with the growing demand was a great setup for ‘18 and beyond. Got it, that's really helpful. Josh maybe my follow up for you. You gave some helpful metrics just around big deals and how they did in ‘18 versus ‘17. Maybe just dig a little bit deeper in that. Can you talk about the average deal sizes that you saw here in 2018 and how you sort of factor that into your guide for 2019 anecdotally? Yes, so we actually start our average deal size pretty consistent within what we've seen over the last several years in the same range. We did see our add-on business trend up a bit and our new business in line with what we've seen over the last few years. And the way we look at 2019 is really consistent with our guide. We believe that we expect to see a similar trend in where our average deal size are and continued growth in -- relative to our business in the larger deals. And Saket just to add to my previous answer, I mentioned private equity disruption to the competitive based but we also had CA acquired value by Broadcom and that was also a very significant competitive disruption. And your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi, from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. So it sounds like you've benefited from a number of drivers in Q4. I'm wondering if you could help us parse through what was most significant. Was it the fact that the market itself is accelerating just because there's greater awareness or do you think it's more your execution and the ability to capitalize on that opportunity? Absolutely its execution against growing market fundamentals. And so I think we've outlined throughout 2018 some of our strategic initiatives around globalizing the sales force, the services team, simplifying our products continuously, multiple releases that really show the customers our approach to more simplification and automation, the simplicity in our prices. And that execution and of course, coupled with the innovation and being first to market with the innovative size of DevOps and Privileged Cloud. But coupled that with a growing demand environment with privilege really rising up to a key priority, we talked about how privileged access security has been rising up as one of the major things CISOs need to do if they want to reduce dramatic risk in various industry reports and the growing awareness around that. And coupled that with digital transformation where it's very clear that okay, your job and the security team’s job is not just to protect the business but also enable the digital transformation that's going to drive growth. We really need to take chunks of risk off and privileged access security is a major thing there. So that's all. I didn't rate them for you but I would say a strong execution, delivered execution against growing market fundamentals. Got it, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up for Josh. Josh, you mentioned a better than expected Q4 budget flush I believe in your commentary. Do you feel -- well, I guess first, what do you think is driving that better than expected budget flush, and do you feel like there were any deals that maybe got pulled forward into Q4 that you anticipated in 2019? Yes, I think with regard to budget flush it's something as enterprise vendor we see every year, it's just hard for us to gauge whether or not the enterprises are going to move some of their flush to us or to our competitors. And I think it really dovetails with what Udi just said is that we basically we're seeing enterprises using it with us. And because of the dynamics of where privileged access security is on their priority list. And so I think it's coming from there, the deals are -- a lot of these deals are in our pipeline at some form or fashion and then can get executed in the fourth quarter.
In terms of any -- seeing enterprises move things in, unnaturally we did not really see that in the fourth quarter. And your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Go ahead please Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the ongoing strong performance and guidance. Udi, Josh, thank you for the transparency with respect to Conjur and the other tuck-in acquisitions you mentioned. I want to actually go and revisit the Conjur acquisition you guys have done if I'm not mistaken a little less than two years ago. Talk to us about the trend you're seeing within the DevOps, DevOp IT security arena, I think CyberArk was actually amongst the first company and I would even say the pioneer on the security front that triggered the cycle of a small tuck-in acquisitions, focusing on a DevOp. What's happening on that front and if Conjur was the same part of the 10% License revenue, where could we be seeing that by the end of 2019 or even 2020? Yes, thanks Shaul, Udi here and thanks for the warm words. We acquired Conjur in May of '17 as you mentioned, and I would say a very strategic acquisition for us in our play in the digital transformation for our customers. And first of all as innovators we were the first and then probably still the only privileged access security vendor with capabilities to extend all the way to the DevOp cycle and give the organization, the chief security officer a holistic approach to on-premise cloud and the DevOps environment. I would say that it's almost every customer right now is going through the discussions of migrating their applications, either migrating to the cloud or just adopting DevOps as the methodology to accelerate application development. And so it became really a natural piece of our Application Identity Management business to deal with this migration no matter where the customer is on the cycle. And hence as Josh indicated it was 10% of License revenue and behaving as a growth engine for us and very strategic in customer decisions to select CyberArk because they know that we can take that journey with them.
I would say 2019 we're not putting something specific in terms of the numerical but it's a major initiative for us. We continuously train our salesforce and our channels to be able to, I would say, expand from core privileged access security that grew and was really the reason for the outperformance in 2018 to our growth engines, which include Conjur and also EPM. Got it. Got it. And we think about the go-to-market and your growing channels and partners relation, do you see anyone specific, or a handful or a number of strategic guys that have been doing a little better pushing your products out there, whether it's in the U.S., whether it's in Europe? Or, Udi, pretty much a status quo from what we have been seeing throughout 2017 and 2018? Yes, absolutely. I would say the continuum of just progress is what we indicated on the advisory side, advisory firms, and just growing the amount of deals that they are influencing with us, as we mentioned. And the other end of it is the fact that they are growing their business and really training teams and putting people to help identify these opportunities and help customers go through privileged access security programs. So, I would say advisory firms.
I'm also personally very pleased to really see CyberArk move up the chain in major value-added resellers as key revenue producers for them. And that's a win-win. The more we get high up there, from Top 15 to Top 10 to Top 5, in some cases, revenue producers for value-added resellers around the world, the more they continue to invest in the various phases of the sales cycle. And so that has been a positive trajectory. I think very much in line with our revenue growth is also the growing importance of how we're perceived in the VAR channel.
And then the third element is the technology partnerships. We talk a lot about the C3 alliance. We've really increased the amount of partner integrations, collaborations in the field. Customers really appreciate the ongoing innovation and the fact that they have a marketplace and they can find these connections to other investments they make. And your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Either for Udi or Josh, you both mentioned that the investment priorities for next year will be focused in the sales and marketing arena and the R&D arena, specifically. So, I actually wanted to get some more specificity on what you mean on the sales and marketing side. Is it greater sales capacity? Is it more overlays? Just trying to better understand that dynamic as I look at your financial results and they are well in excess of the medium-term targets that you set at Analyst Day. So, I just wanted to kind of reconcile what's changed and what specific areas you are looking to invest in '19. And a follow-up, if I may. Sure, Fatima. Udi here. I'll start. I think, as I indicated with some of the 2019 elements, we're seeing that the enterprise business is definitely our prime market and is very much greenfield, both for new business but also, as Josh indicated, a lot of add-on opportunities. Another element that we're adding in the year is really increasing, I would say, our muscle in the ability to go into mid-market. And so I would say it's still early but that would be another area of investment for our go-to-market. And as we go, I would say for the prior question and for this, we also continue to invest in the channel. We really see this as a strategic piece for us and it's also the team that's supporting and enabling and training and selling with the channel. On top of that, of course, as the market leader and, finally, after many years of market education, we have the Magic Quadrant and that position there. It's also an opportunity firm up on the marketing pedal and take this to market. And all this in an across-geographic manner. I mean, we're very proud with the diversification we have as a key strength, a rough 60/30/10 between the theaters, and then diversity on the verticals. And so to push all of that to all markets. And actually a quick follow-up on the mid-market focus. How should we think about potential for any pricing changes or any pricing tweaks because the appetite in this market is a little bit different? The spending posture in this market is a little bit different than the enterprise. And then along those lines, I think one of your peers is sort of going to raise the subscription transition with a predominantly perpetual license model. So, how do you guys think about or discount or manage for a changing appetite for what traditionally is a perpetual license product for you and any pricing implications that may result as you push harder into the mid-market? Thank you so much. Sure, sure. Absolutely. So, I would say we really prepared for it and we seeded it in 2018 with the pricing simplification and in brackets, of course, the ongoing product simplification. And that was already kind of geared into addressing or preparing to address the mid-market and the ability for an easier way to scope the solution and to identify and to be able to accommodate smaller deal sizes for that market. Although I have to continually emphasize, enterprise is our major market and mid-market being a new muscle. With regards to model switch, no model switch. We're seeing that most of our customers want to own our solution and, definitely in the enterprise, they view this as mission critical. And although we've had options to buy this in subscription, primarily the enterprise customers want to own it. And then they're able to run it anywhere. They can run it in the cloud and install it in the cloud. For mid-market, they have the opportunity to buy it as subscription or as TPL but we're going to see that as a gradual infusion of our revenue and not any change. And so that's how I would present that. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bartus from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, on new logos, I was just curious if you could discuss how much of the business now is greenfield versus rip-and-replace and just maybe how that changed over the course of 2018 from what you saw? I would say we still primarily see this as greenfield in all markets, including kind of the enterprise space and, definitely, all theaters. There are truly new geographies, like Latin America, but we still view, in all theaters and all customer sizes, that it's primarily a greenfield opportunity. And even within the customer base, we didn't put up a new number on penetration rates but we have a lot of add-on to do with our customers as we take them from a project to program. Okay. And then if I could just ask quickly on GDPR as well and getting a little bit more color there. Just how important of a driver was that in 2018, if you can try to parse that out a little bit? And then does that continue into 2019? Are you guys expecting any kind of slowdown related to that? Yes, sure. So, I'll continue with that. I would say that it wasn't a big contributor to results in the fourth quarter or in the year. We did see some deal kind of cite GDPR as one of the factors but it wasn't a driving force. I view that as a positive because it actually means that it's another kind of ongoing drum beat of a tailwind that will push us farther and not just seasonal. And as we've indicated, what GDPR can also create, and we're hearing more and more about companies that are being fined, not just the well-known players but even smaller companies that are being fined on privacy issues, that's going to further, maybe, accelerate awareness. And, of course, if there will be big breach disclosures, we can see that, again, being a stronger driver like we've seen in other regions. It is interesting to see that GDPR is cited not just in Europe but also by multinational companies that have European customers. So, I think it's here to stay as an ongoing additional tailwind driver but the main driver for us, and the important one, is the ability to really reduce a big amount of risk for our customers. Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Yes. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I don't think I've ever been called Robbie on a call but I'll take it. I want to focus a little bit on privacy, especially domestically, where the conversation does seem to be intensifying and whether or not that's starting to resonate within the customer base as they're looking to get ahead or could that be a GDPR situation where everyone is going to play catch up? Hi, Robbie. Rob, right? You can go either way. Actually, my mother calls me Robbie so it's all good. We can do a new trend here. But I think what we're seeing is chief security officers really viewing and being very smart about, OK, I have other elements to deal with, like privacy -- the upcoming California regulation, which is GDPR-like, just like you said, and being brought up in the U.S. But, on the other hand, they need to reduce risk because they're trying to protect the organization. And I would say that's a trend we're seeing. We even talk about it sometimes in various panels and events that these CSOs are looking at -- let's couple these things. Let's reduce risk while meeting compliance requirements. And, for us, that's really a homerun. And when you go into competitive replacement situations, can you give a little more context around what that customer is consuming? Is it broader deployment of privilege? Obviously, you've got a better application stack than, I'm sure, what you're going and replacing but just to understand how you're taking more wallet share, I guess, within some of those customers that are looking to your solution versus having a competitor's that might be 5-10 years old. Yes, absolutely. I think there are a couple of flavors there. I think the most exciting one is when we see a customer with one of the solutions of one of our competitors and they're not considered innovative and they understood that this is a big strategic risk remover from them and they take a broader look and they see, OK, who's going to take us on a roadmap for the full -- like you said, for the full stack. Take us all the way from mainframe to cloud and DevOps. And just raise their head and call us or we call them and choose us strategically because they understood that the layer is a strategic. And a big part of it is our innovation on their cloud assets and on their DevOps pipeline and also scalability. They want to take this wide. They need a scalable solution. It's not enough if they selected another vendor for compliance reasons in a point area.
The other thing has to do with the lack of innovation and disruption that I mentioned earlier. Companies being acquired, like the CA acquisition. A lot of resumes out there from the security teams or the rollups where the customer kind of knows where the trend is going. There's not going to be innovation. The attackers are innovating. So, I need to partner with a company that's investing in innovation and is here for the long run. So, I would say competitive disruption that is causing that is there.
And then there's the customers that are really going global, going wide across their environments, and the ability to execute. The ability for us to take a customer that has offices in Singapore, France, and New York, and also a team in India, and give them a full solution, the ability to support them, and the ability to scale with them. Those are some examples there and kind of indicate that, beyond the greenfield, we also have the rip-and-replace opportunity. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I just have a few questions on the new per user pricing model that you introduced in early 2018. So, the normal sales cycle is, I guess, in the 6-9 month range, I was wondering if this was the first quarter where you saw an impact from that pricing model because this is the most upside that we've seen in any of the previous quarters. Yeah. Hi, Andrew. In terms of sale cycle, no, I think we're still -- we're very much on a, as you know, 2-3 quarter average sales cycle. And I say average because we deals coming in, it take 4-6 quarters even, or even longer. For new deals, in particular. For add-ons, it could be as fast as one quarter and also as long as 4-5 quarters. And the new pricing, what that's done is, while it hasn't necessarily shortened the sales cycle, it's made a much more, what I would call, quality sales cycle of 2-3 quarters, in that the content, the discussion, and the negotiation and the sale process is around the product.
It's around how to best set it up. It's around devising -- Udi mentioned the project to program theme that we always take with every enterprise. It's around, OK, this is how we start the process but let's also talk about what's going to happen over the next couple of years. And with the simpler pricing, it allows them to really forecast their own budgeting needs really easily and also to really scope out, quickly, not what their immediate needs are but also going forward. So, it's not necessarily shortening the cycle but it makes the cycle less painful for the customer, which is always good, and also we get more content out of it. Got it. And then you mentioned that add-on sales trended up in Q4, I believe, or I'm not sure if that was a 2018 metric. But were most of those add-on sales to those customers leveraging your new pricing model or are they still purchasing more on an a la carte basis? So, actually, a lot of -- and I don't have the statistic of what percent -- most of them were still on the a la carte. But we did have a nice sample, a nice group of customers that, as they came onboard, they actually converted onto the new pricing model. So, as part of their add-on there, we were able to say, OK, let's not just add more EPV users, let's also give you PSM, monitoring, and threat analytics content to the users that you have. So, the other thing that it helped do was be able to have more focus on the Endpoint Privilege Manager and on the AIM and Conjur products. That's great. And just a real quick clarification … So, 63% of all of our customers are now on the new pricing. Thank you. And then just real quick, did the U.S. government shutdown have any impact on your quarter? I would say that some minor impact on Q4 on federal sales but, overall, really minor. And, of course, we did overachieve on many other fronts and U.S. fed had a very strong first nine months. I think, as we indicated, the diversification in the government business was so strong that, as a vertical, it actually grew more than 40% -- global government grew more than 40% in the year. And that's really because -- federal is a big part of that but also state and local, European countries, countries in Asia, Canada, and others really contributed to that. So, it's a fast-growing vertical and the impact on the federal team, specifically, was minor but there was some in Q4. And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. So, in your prepared remarks, Udi, you mentioned that add-on business constituted around 60% of the license revenue. As we try to assess our models for 2019, I just wanted to get a qualitative commentary on how much runway do you think still exists within the existing customers and how much upsell opportunity is still left within those? Yes, it's a great question. Thanks. This is Josh. Yeah, I did mention this year, for 2018, 60% of our license revenue came from existing customers, which was very similar to what it was or identical to what it was in 2017 as well. So, it's the second year in a row where we're at about a 60/40 mix. And when we look at going forward, we actually still believe that we're in the first half with our customer base, with our 4,400 customers that we have. Obviously, there's a handful that are higher than half but the majority of our customers, we believe that we have a long runway and a big market to fill. Got you. And as a follow-up, the industry vertical concentration has remained fairly consistent, I would say, over 2017. Any particular programs that you are planning in 2019 to increase the vertical concentration beyond, say, banking, government, and manufacturing? And, if yes, what is the vertical that you think would be the most promising one? This is Udi. I would say that the vertical diversification is one of our major strengths. I mean, more than ten verticals were over 5% of the business. And Josh, in his prepared remarks, kind of indicated growth across multiple verticals. So, I would say the trend is increased diversity. And there's no longer an industry that we think is on standby. I mean, we used to say that a couple years ago about healthcare or manufacturing. And in different cycles, we've seen them join the bandwagon. It's become very clear. It's No. 1 on the Top 10 priority list from Gartner on how do you reduce risk and it's not vertical specific. And so it's really one of our strengths -- vertical diversification across the world. And so it's kind of a multiplier of diversification and then you can multiply it by another diversity, which is we address the cloud journey no matter where the customer is on that cloud journey. And your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Udi, I wanted to follow up on some of your comments on privileged access moving up as the priority for spend in the context of what we've seen over the last five years. Because the last time I remember you saw a step-up in priority was around 2014 and now it feels like we're seeing a little bit of a resurgence and awareness and the Gartner Magic Quadrant formally coming out, etc. So, just a little bit of color on what you think is driving the resurgence and how important is it? Is there a positive impact from Gartner having put together the Magic Quadrant formally? Does that impact what you're seeing in the pipeline? Thank you. Yes. Thank you and hi, Gabriela. I would say that it's -- I would put it as a continuum and that it's been climbing up there. And at some point, it got into a critical mass to the point where you have customers talking, you have partners talking, and you have a successful risk reduction project out there with CyberArk being in 50% of the Fortune 500. The awareness has really gotten there. The chief security officer, I think, you had a process of -- definitely, if you take a five-year progression, some chief security officers understood that the attacker will become -- a focused attacker can make it to the inside of the organization or to the cloud environments with a focused attack. And, therefore, I really have to strengthen my core and prevent lateral movement. And on the progression, it really moved up, where they're looking to -- they're going to be attacked, they're going to be infected, how do I really reduce risk, how do I prevent a network takeover, how do I prevent a cloud takeover? It really moved up there.
The mirror image of that is really the analysts, per your question. The analysts really moving it up in their recommendations. I mean, the industry analysts. And we referred in the past to the Top 10 list that Gartner put up and they listed privileged access security as the No. 1 there in risk reduction. And, of course, the Magic Quadrant coming out in December for the first time about this space and that definitely will help drive further awareness, especially to markets or verticals that were waiting for this kind of assurance that you have to do this and this is how we rate the vendors. There's more security technologies out there, there's the digital transformation, and so there's also a proliferation of credentials. And so the problem is only getting bigger. And that also answers a part of why it grew so big. How do I lower risk and still enable digital transformation? And we're a big part of that. And your next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz from Stifel. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question and, Udi and Josh, congrats on the very strong quarter here and the strong results for 2018. So, Udi, in April of this year, you took the product multi-tenant and you initiated a broader push into MSSP. Can you talk a bit about what you've seen since that timeframe? And then I think, in terms of the broader context, how you think about that in relation to a bigger push into the mid-market that you're planning for this year? Yes. Thanks, Gur. I think we strategically wanted to really enable customers to have different flavors of how they adopt CyberArk. We still see the majority want to secure the keys to the kingdom on-premise. We've invested to give customers the ability to also install and have CyberArk work for them in their cloud provider of choice. And I've given some examples of you can install us and we've been installed -- customers using us for their Azure, AWS, Google Cloud. And on that same thread, we also wanted to give customers the ability to kind of outsource the management part of the solution to third-party providers and, therefore, launched the MSSP version. We have several partners that jumped on board. Some of them also have the capability to both resell and be an MSSP provider. I would say it's still an early part in the revenue contribution but it really strengthens our leadership position. And, like you said, it will be an important avenue as we go further mid-market. So, I would say it's still early but it's part of our strength. It's really the ability to capture various appetites with the same solution. So, our team can really stay focused, in terms of R&D efforts, but provide the ability to consume it in different flavors. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one last quick question. Given the success in acquisitions like Conjur, Vaultive, and Viewfinity, how do you think about potential for further M&A, whether this year or just kind of looking beyond? And any sort of areas you think you could push into or extend into that you could look at? Thank you. Thank you. I think, even as indicated in the various reports, CyberArk leads not just in the ability to execute and going global with our partners and team, but also on the innovation side. And a lot of it has been organic but we also, like you said, made some very important non-organic acquisitions over the last couple of years. So, we definitely continue to hone that discipline. We feel like we lead the space by far and let's really focus on what's needed to secure our customers. And on that front, we have the CyberArk Labs that are really investigating how are modern day attacks progressing, what's the point of no return in an attack, and it's all coming back, most often, to credentials and lateral movement and either back to our solutions or more solutions on that front.
But we will also be very open-minded if we need to pick up other technologies to better secure our customers. We actually have a new VP of Corporate Development that reports to me that is working -- his name is Clarence Hinton -- that is working on further honing our CorpDev capabilities with no time pressure, just as an additional discipline in the company, on top of all the work we do organically. And your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for working me in. I'll be quick. So, at the Analyst Day last year, you mentioned that if you're growing at a 20% pace, then operating margin should be in the 17% to 21% range. So, you just closed out a strong 2018, you guided 2019 to 20% revenue growth and a 23% operating margin, so should we be rethinking that medium-term margin framework? Hi, this is Josh. No, we're not touching that medium-term framework. I mean, right now, we're going into 2019 with a lot of momentum and we have visibility to how we're looking at the year. And, at this point, we're still looking -- we're pleased with the guidance we're able to give but we're not necessarily changing our medium-term outlook. We want to be prepared. We see a long runway of growth opportunity because of the greenfield opportunity and because of our install base that's still also with a long runway. So, we're not changing that. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Udi for some closing remarks. Great. Thank you very much. I want to thank our customers, partners, and our dear employees who contributed to CyberArk's record results in 2018. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","CyberArk will open the call up to a question-and-answer session . a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures will be discussed in this conference call . we had a phenomenal record breaking 2018, executing on all of the strategic goals that we outlined early on .",1.0

Also, a webcast of today's call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thank you everyone for joining our first quarter earnings call. We were pleased to start the year with strong results exceeding guidance across all metrics. Revenue accelerated year-over-year to 34% reaching $96 million. Operating income was $25 million and our powerful business model generated a record $46 million in cash flow from operations.
Before we dive into the details of the quarter, I wanted to discuss the broader markets. Since we founded CyberArk, security solutions have evolved to keep pace with the expanding attack surface and hacker innovation. Over the last few years, we have reached a level of unprecedented change, digital transformation strategy, the migration to cloud, hybrid and modern architectures and the increasing connectivity among enterprise systems, our accelerating business and at the same time, creating massive security challenges.
These trends have been driving progressive shifts in our business. In our major markets, we no longer educate enterprise customers and prospects about the importance of Privileged Access.
Today we are recognized as a mission-critical solution that empowers and protects business operations by reducing risk across on-premise, cloud and hybrid environments, and enabling organizations to move faster, more efficiently and most importantly securely as they execute digital transformation strategies.
All of these trends have contributed to our results over the last few quarters including record revenue in the Americas and APJ in Q1. While we believe EMEA revenue which grew 60% in the first quarter was impacted by our strong Q4 2018, the pipeline across the region and globally continues to be robust.
In addition, the business was well diversified across industries, banking, healthcare, insurance, media and IT software and services grew faster than 50%, while banking, healthcare and global governance, each represented more than 10% of the business in the first quarter.
I had the pleasure of meeting with chief information security officers from a number customers and partners at the RSA Conference in March. These discussions were focused on expanding our solutions to drive Privilege Access Security Programs enterprise-wide. Existing customers continue to represent more than 60% of our revenue as they expanded deployments with CyberArk in the first quarter.
A few examples include, a large mutual fund is migrating all of its datacenters to AWS and will be expanding its core Privilege Access Security deployments to secure this new environment as well as an increasing number of SaaS administrators.
A leading European manufacturing company is rolling out CyberArk to secure a major Robotic Process Automation or RPA project as part of its digital transformation strategy and a financial services firm is standardizing on CyberArk enterprise-wide and will be leveraging our Application Access Manager to protect and share mission-critical data to leverage other key security investments.
We also won nearly 150 new logos in the first quarter bringing our total customer count to about 4600. Notable additions include, a large U.S. retailer will be protecting UNIX and Windows systems with core Privilege Access Security and will be securing Jenkins pivotal Cloud Foundry and other DevOps tools as part of its application development running in Google Cloud platform.
In a seven-figure deal with a Fortune 100 financial services firm, we were chosen for our scalability and AWS and Azure environment and because we are the only vendor who could protect its expensive RPA project with UI path. And as a payment company, we will secure access between more than 40 physical locations and gained visibility into privilege activity enterprise-wide with CyberArk.
This was a rip-and-replace of a niche vendor who could not scale to meet the long-term needs of this entertainment powerhouse. We are also pleased with our progress to drive adoption of newer solutions. In Q1, we introduced Application Access Manager which unifies Conjur and Application Identity Manager into a single solution for both dynamic and static application environments.
In fact, the solution was included in eight of our top-10 largest license deals in the first quarter. Software applications are the lifeblood of every organization today and we still see ourselves in the early innings of the opportunity for our application solutions.
In addition, Endpoint Privilege Manager continues to gain traction within customers of all sizes and across industries as an important component of security hygiene. We also took our first steps in formalizing the mid-market sales motion. The team is in place. We are establishing our channel relationships and the pipeline is building with both new and existing customers.
We are just getting started in the mid-market and are excited about the early progress. As we analyze our first quarter results, I am confident that we have a significant runway for growth across both new and existing enterprise customers and our competitive advantage continues to be our unwavering commitment to strengthening customer security fabric through ongoing innovation across on-premise, hybrid and cloud environments.
With the innovation we delivered in the first quarter, we are the only solution that automatically identifies and protect Privilege accounts in AWS such as unmanaged users including shadow administrators, and instances. We also strengthened our response capabilities and are rotating credentials based on risk scores for potentially compromised sessions in the cloud.
Our advisory, value-added reseller, and technology partner ecosystem contributed to our results with more than 65% of revenue coming from indirect channel in the first quarter. Momentum continues to build within our C3 Alliance program as we become more tightly integrated across the business operations of our customers.
With C3, we make it easier for customers to strengthen their overall security posture across technology investments including RPA vendors like Automation Anywhere, UI PAS and Blue Prism in addition to partners like SailPoint, Okta, Proofpoint and Tenable.
As we position the company for long-term growth and scale, we strengthened the team adding Rich Wenning as VP of North America Sales and Clarence Hinton as SVP of Strategy and Corporate Development. Rich brings deep domain expertise having run enterprise sales most recently at Paulo Alto Networks and previously at Cisco where he helped scale the organization to more than $2 billion in enterprise sales.
Clarence is leveraging his extensive experience from BMC Software and Nuance to help drive the long-term growth and scale of the organization. We are thrilled to have them join the CyberArk team. We were pleased again to deliver strong results in the first quarter. The market for Privilege Access Security is rapidly growing and as we look ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on that opportunity.
With that, let me turn it over Josh to discuss our strong financial results. Josh? Thank you, Udi. As you just heard from Udi, we were pleased to exceed our outlook across all guided metrics including revenue, operating income and EPS. Total revenue increased by 34% year-on-year to $95.9 million. License revenue was $51.3 million increasing 33% over the first quarter last year and representing 53% of total revenue. Both new and on-business contributed to our results in the first quarter.
On the product side, Application Access Manager represented about 10% of license revenue and Endpoint Privilege Manager represented about 7%. As we look more closely at the EPM, we were pleased to see the percentage of EPM bookings derived from SaaS deals increased in the first quarter compared to the year ago period.
Maintenance and Professional Services revenue was $44.7 million increasing 34% over the prior year period and representing 47% of revenue. The Professional Services revenue associated with this line was $8.2 million or 8.6% of total revenue.
Geographically, as Udi mentioned, the Americas reached a record of $62.1 million in revenue increasing 41% year-on-year and representing 65% of total revenue. APJ also reached a record $8.5 million in revenue increasing 45% compared to the first quarter 2018 and representing a 9% total of revenue. EMEA revenue grew by 16% year-on-year to $25.3 million or 26% of total revenue.
When we analyzed our first quarter EMEA business, we believe the year-end budget flush which helped to drive our Q4 2018 record results impacted our first quarter business. This is reflected in the higher dollar amount of deals over $500,000 in EMEA we saw in the first quarter compared to the first quarter this year.
Overall, demand trends remain healthy across all geographies with a growing pipeline of activity. As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our first quarter gross profit was $84.8 million or an 88% gross margin compared to 87% gross margin in the same period last year. Our top priorities for this year continues to be investing and innovation, growth and scaling the operations.
R&D expense grew by 22% year-on-year to $14 million or 15% of total revenue as we continued to deliver innovation. Sales and marketing increased 18% to $37.7 million or 39% of total revenue as we expanded our sales organization across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales. G&A expense increased 21% year-on-year to $7.6 million or 8% of total revenue to scale the business to support our growth.
In total operating expenses for the first quarter increased 19% to $59.3 million, compared with $49.7 million for the first quarter last year. Our revenue outperformance and disciplined investments drove strong leverage again in the first quarter. We posted operating income ahead of our guidance at $25.5 million or 27% operating margin more than doubling from $12.6 million representing an 18% operating margin in the year ago period.
Our overall expense growth is primarily related to headcount and we ended the first quarter with 1204 employees worldwide, up from 1053 at the end of the first quarter last year and we ended the quarter with 567 employees in sales and marketing compared to 502 at the end of the first quarter of last year.
Net income was $25.5 million or $0.56 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 and increasing from $11.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018.
In the first quarter, we were pleased to generate record cash flow from operations of $45.9 million or a 48% cash flow margin. The strong cash flow was driven by our record results in the fourth quarter as well as better than anticipated collections from our maintenance renewals which seasonally – which is seasonally high in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
We ended the quarter with $510 million in cash, deposits to marketable securities and this compares to $451 million at year end. Deferred revenue increased 43% year-on-year to $171 million at March 31. On January 1, 2019, we implemented Accounting Standard ASC 842 related to long-term operating leases in the financial statements.
As a result of the new standard, we capitalized these leases and recorded assets of $24.8 million and liabilities of $26.1 million as of March 31, reflecting the value of the leases. The P&L related impact of the adoption was not material.
Turning to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates.
For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total revenue of $96 million to $98 million or 25% growth year-on-year at the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $22 million to $23.5 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.45 to $0.48. This assumes a 39.1 million weighted average diluted shares and an effective tax rate of 21% for the second quarter.
For the full year 2019, we are increasing our guidance for total revenues to be in the range of $415 million to $419 million or growth of approximately 22% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $100.5 million to $103.5 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.10 to $2.16. This assumes 38.9 million weighted average diluted shares.
Our guidance for the full year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2019. For modeling purposes, as you’ve seen our guidance, we plan to continue to invest in the business in the second quarter. Please note that we also expect to see a larger step-up in expenses between the second and third quarters related to marketing programs, and seasonal employee expenses.
While we deliver the exceptional cash flow from operations in the first quarter, we still expect our cash flow margin for the first half of 2019 to be at the midpoint of the range of 5 to 10 percentage points above the non-GAAP net income margin. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow margin to run between 5 to 10 percentage points higher than our non-GAAP net income margin.
We recommend analysts to evaluate our cash flow on an annual basis given that our cash flow from operations can vary quarterly based on seasonality of the business and taxes. We do not plan to provide quarterly updates on guidance for cash flow from operations.
We were pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. Our priority for the remainder of 2019 is to invest in the business to deliver profitable growth over the long-term.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thank you. Hi, good afternoon guys. Congrats on the solid set of results, as well as the guidance. Udi, I want to start actually big picture. You’ve mentioned in your opening remarks, cloud, digital transformation as driving or even accelerating from our perspective to the business, can you specifically touch on the digital transformation trends you are seeing out there? And I have a follow-up. Thanks, Shaul. So, definitely, first and foremost, we are seeing Privilege Access Security be a top priority for security and chief information security officers, but we are continuously excited to see that we are an enabler and a big part of organizations adoption of digital transformation strategy whether it’s moving their applications, workloads into the cloud and therefore the new to manage application secrets with our AAM or previously we call the Conjur supporting digitization like robotic process automation more and more.
Those robots are actually mega super administrators and users and vivid and enable the use of RPA for these projects. And then, increasingly also to bridge that gap of trust with the cloud providers and moving servers and the administration of workloads in the cloud, we provide that layer that enables trust for adopting this move. Got it. Got it. And maybe a follow-up either for you, Udi or even for Josh, and it could be a little bit of a tricky one. When you look, for example at, I don’t know your top-10, even top-20 customers, especially those that have been with you for the past, let’s say 10, 15 years.
Do you have some sort of an LTV analysis or even maybe some sort of magic number meaning to say those that started with you ten years ago, investing, what would that number be now? Is it 3 x? Is it 4 x? Is it 10 x? Anything along these lines that can assist us a little bit? Yes, hi, Shaul. Thanks for calling in. I think when we look at the analysis and we’ve done a lot of cohort analysis going back, seven, eight, nine, ten and plus years, and I would say that, if we look at cohorts that are eight, nine years old, we are looking at seven times their first year purchase. Got it. Thank you, Josh. That would include obviously some component making it, obviously, as part of it. Bu we see that probably two-thirds of it coming from license and then the third coming from maintenance. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Okay, good morning. And congrats on the quarter. So, it seems like, it was sort of business as usual for CyberArk in Q1. But if I look across the security space, it was a little bit of mixed results kind of across the board with your peers.
So, I am just wondering from your perspective, Udi, did you see any change in the overall spending environment for security. And is there any reason to believe that 2019 maybe a little bit softer than what we saw in 2018, just from a high level perspective? Yes. Thanks, Melissa. I think if we would look from our prism, no, I would say, we started the year really being bullish on the opportunity in our space. Privilege Access Security is actually risen to the top end in priority and hence the results and hence our confidence in the pipeline. I also – I wouldn’t say that I have heard anecdotal comments from customers about other partners of ours or other security initiatives.
I think in general, security spend is moving towards the assumption of zero troughs and therefore you really have to strengthen your core and putting layers that are hacker-resistant. So little bit beyond the perimeter. And – but other than that, I would say the same trends that we saw last year are continuing. Okay, great. And then just a follow-up for Josh. You noted better than expected SaaS adoption in EPM and we did know that there is really good growth in your deferred revenue. So I am just wondering if you’ve seen higher kind of term license adoption across the board in the portfolio and how we should expect that for the rest of the year. Yes, absolutely, we saw an EPM. We actually did see stemming in the first quarter some – nice compared to first quarter last year had an uptick in SaaS bookings relative to the perpetual bookings on EPM last year.
But I would say still on the deferred revenues, we are still kind of in the same category of the same percentage point. So, the deferred is still the majority of our support contracts, but the SaaS and the term based license is creeping up. But I would not say that’s yet materially changed. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Josh, maybe just to start with you. Can you just talk a little bit about the average deal size in the quarter? It seem like it had gone up. And so, the question is, is that coming from really larger lands with customers starting with more products than you initially have in the past? Or is Cyber perhaps finding just maybe a little bit more pricing power given the competitive environment? No, I think, what we look at – overall, if you look at the entire license business, we would say that the – it’s pretty – it’s staying pretty stable. But if we were to break it down, we would see an increase on the new business deals on an average deal order and we would see, even maybe some slight decline on the add-on business.
And I think the new business increase is attributed to what you are commenting on is that we actually are – because of the simpler pricing and so forth, we are seeing customers coming in and taking bigger chunks on day one, because it’s a much easier acquisition for them. And – but overall, on a consolidated basis, we are seeing it about the same. Got it. Got it. Udi, for my follow-up, may be for you. Clearly, the competitive environment remains favorable based on these results and guidance. But, I am just kind of curious, what you’ve seen out there from your competitors?
Whether there is any sign of them trying to get back on track with any sort of success or any signs of incremental improvement from, maybe some of those ankle biters in the past? Anything that you would add? Yes. Sure. Hi, Saket. First of all, I would say that, we are stronger than ever. I think, the competitive landscape has changed, I think positively across and there is even the additional external third-party validations that we didn’t have in previous years from the Gartner and Forrester reports that came in end of last year about our clear leadership.
I would say that, enterprises, when they buy the invites are better, especially in new deals and when one is disrupted, then others make way. So, I would say that the niche competitors are probably invited more often in palace of companies like CA and Dell where they were in the past.
The disruptive type organizations like what we talked about disruptions from PE acquisition, we have not seen them regain foothold. Our working assumption is that we have to work hard to always retain our leadership and break forward with innovation. So we assume that even if they have not regrouped, let’s work as if they are regrouped and push further on all fronts, execution, but also innovation. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I want to go back just to the demand environment and ask it this way, how was the linearity in the quarter? And what have you seen, obviously, you’ve given the guidance for the quarter and for the full year both, what are you seeing in terms of the start to the second quarter? Hi, Sterling, it’s Josh. I’ll start with the – on the linearity, we actually – after coming out of the strong Q4 of last year, we were a bit more backloaded in the first quarter of 2018. And – but, overall though, we didn’t see any other – nothing that was different and within the marketplace. What was your second question? Was it on.. The beginning of Q2. Yes, I think, at the beginning of Q2, that’s where our guidance is based off of where we saw the pipeline going into Q2 and how it started and we feel very good about the Q2 growth guidance, as well as full year growth guidance. Okay. And then, in terms of the – you mentioned, I think the purchase from existing customers, how much of the demand you are seeing from existing customers is just – same solutions in more used cases versus adding on more of the portfolio. Certainly, Udi here. I’ll take that. I think, it’s really the continuous progression on moving from project to program and I mentioned the artificial, I just had the ability to meet so many of our customers at once and of course, since – and they are just taking this layer much more seriously. So with our simplified pricing, some of it really goes into core PAS.
But more or like you said, like more use cases across more piece of their infrastructure and not just to areas that were sales compliance in the past. But actually thinking risk and taking it across. And then more advanced customers are taking also some of our growth engine in our earlier or newer products again, for starting with the most critical use cases as we walk them through the program. Got it. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a couple. Udi, I’ll start with you. You’ve got a year under your belts now with respect to the bundled sales motion around PAS.
So, I am wondering if you can share the exact patterns in terms of how customers are buying and deploying and to the extent there is a change in how pervasively they are deploying because it’s a bundled package. That’s the first question and then I have a couple others for Josh. Sure, sure. Yes, well, definitely, hi Fatima, we are definitely on a full year of the new pricing and it really enables the core PAS to continue to be the major driving force in our acceleration here of revenue and license where it’s easier for customers to scope what they need and decide how they want to start with CyberArk.
As you alluded, it’s also leading to the right way to start an implementation, because of this bundle, it’s not just a simplified pricing. They are also getting all of the necessary components from day one that used to be broken down into smaller – into modules, they get from day one. And then, they start-off right in the right way to deploy CyberArk.
And then, kind of spend easily down the road. So, it’s kind of – as we alluded this bundling and the pricing along with the simplification of products is a win-win, because customers are putting this layer at the right way from the gecko. Understood. And actually just to stay with Udi, on with the mid-market efforts in your prepared remarks, could you just talk about taking the first step on building out that go to market motion, if you will. I am curious, if you can give us more details on what exactly is in play – and in place? And how we should see yield of those investments that you announced putting in some mid-markets? Sure. I think, the beauty is that, one of the reasons we began on working on the mid-market muscle is that, we wanted to optimize productivity for the enterprise team, where we still see the biggest opportunity. But wanted to start ceding the mid-market opportunity for the future. And so, our marketing focus continues to be on the enterprise and hence, I talk about it as a newer muscle to the mid-market.
What we’ve done is, actually created a dedicated team that can focus on the mid-market, invested in channel enablement because we really expect that that most if not all of this business will be driven through channels and it’s – we are early into it.
But we are seeing progress and it’s really an investment for the long-term. And of course, all of that goes along with the continued simplification of products as we think of the mid-market expects. Got it. And Josh, two quick ones if I can sneak them in for you. Long-term deferred revenue growth continues to kind of surpass how we thought about it. So, wanted to understand if there is any dynamics around maintenance contracts spending, there is any incentives that you’ve put in place to maybe incent that type of behavior?
And then, as it relates to sales hiring, how we should think about the linearity of those capacity additions over the course of the year? And I’ll jump back in the queue. Thank you so much. Great. Thank you. So, with regard to long-term deferred, it’s really a reflection of our long-term support maintenance contracts for most of it. And we’ve always had some kind of a pricing incentive for customers in terms of a discounted rate. But nothing has changed with that regard.
We still see the overwhelming majority of our contracts be one year contracts, but we are seeing in terms of dollar amounts some trends tick up to on the three year contract dollar side. So, it’s – there is nothing I think remarkable going on. There is nothing inside the company that’s trying to motivate that change.
But I do believe it’s just a reflection of our customers seeing the importance of our product for the long-term. And coming in early on, and particularly new customers, frequently making a claim for three years. But not that remarkably different that what we’ve seen in years past.
But other than this slight trend up. With regard to hiring, I think what we see in hiring every quarter on the sales and marketing side and we increased – you saw the growth in our sales and marketing year-on-year, specifically and I expect it to be every quarter hiring. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open. Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to start with a question on the competitive environment. With all the disruption that’s taking place, can you maybe give us a sense of what your win rate looks like now, maybe in comparison to before some of the disruption took place? Yes, I would say, hey Jonathan, Udi here. I would say the win rates are the same and because they have been increasingly strong as we talked about in 2018 because of past investments in simplification of products and of pricing. But I think we are in a very strong rate, especially, when we talk on the enterprise side, which is our major focus. Got it. And then, just in terms of the Application Access Manager, can you talk a little bit about why combining the two products, maybe it makes a little bit more of a difference here and maybe talk about how much of an upsell opportunity there is with the Application Access Manager? Yes, absolutely. Because of the customers are going through this journey of a combination of on-prem and applications and the migration of workloads into modern environments, like containers whether keeping them on-premise or migrating to the cloud, we found that the hard line of separation between static application and dynamic is actually and makes it harder for the customer to scope and also in the sales motion.
So this was an optimization that we did for both the customers and for selling motion where we are actually showing up as the trusted partner to solve this problem that exists both in static application and dynamic applications and actually in the same breadth, show the customers that, okay.
This is what we are going to do with these applications that you have here running your quick applications, you're trading floor and your self-developed applications that are static and this is what we would be helping you with your CITD pipeline as you take on DevOps workflows. And so, we combine it into one solution case.
And we also integrated the two products as you recall where from the acquisition to Conjur really integrating to the same platform. So, it’s a positive for the customer, but also helps them to find the sales motion. And as we look at it, it’s one of our biggest opportunities, because on top of everything everybody is so aware of you Privilege Access and the importance in every major attack.
But the same thing happens with applications where they are served with a credential or are given a pathway to strong access and therefore it’s kind of the new frontier for upsell for us. It takes a slower pace than core PAS. But we view it as a big part of our add-on business opportunity. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gary Powell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, so, I was thinking, I never heard you mention the adoption of RPA as a growth driver before. Can you maybe talk about that dynamic and the impact on demand for your Application Access Manager products? Yes, absolutely. I give it as an example of digital transformation drivers. So it would be on a list of types of programs that customers would do that elevate the need to secure Privileged Access. So I wouldn’t put it as the one, but it’s a growing one.
And through the C3 reliance we partnered with the major players there and as they get scoped out and in their sales motion, one of the biggest things that highlight is, hey, we are giving this robotic process administrative or very strong access to replace some human manual work. But to do that, they get very strong access.
So, CyberArk has an integration that’s very simple for our customers where we actually intercept the need for Privilege Access and broker and give the application the access they need. We are not leaving any exposure for somebody to take that over and get to the data as a Privilege user. And so, a smooth integration and it’s a hot topic now for many enterprises. Got it. Thanks. And it’s also interestingly another way for Chief Security Officers to bridge and bring value to the organization in digital transformation and be an enabler. And so, it’s a hot topic. Understood. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Your line is open. Hi, this is actually Chris Spears on for Gur. Congrats on another impressive. Can you speak to the degree to which the partnership with both Okta and SailPoint has contributed growth into Q1? And how to expect or how we should think about that as a growth driver through the rest of the year? Sure, sure. Thanks, Chris. I would say, it’s on a continuum. I think, we see a lot of field partnership on – probably, every couple of weeks you can see us also in joint field events with SailPoint Okta paying on the identity side.
And so, I wouldn’t say it’s an accelerated driver, but I would say, it’s an ongoing strong driver in addition to other partnerships that we have in the C3 alliance that are in other spaces of security, like vulnerability management and RPA that we talked a lot about and others. Our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is open. Yes, thank you for getting me in the queue. My quick question is, you talked about the vertical markets. They look pretty consistent. Are there any programs you are putting in place in 2019 to facilitate more growth or equip the channel to drive across 10 or 15 of them? Thank you. Yes, I think, really, part of our strength is that diversity, that we can sell the same software to whether you are a manufacturing company in the Philippines or a top notch financial services firm in New York. And so, it’s really about the sales motion and we continuously train our team to be able to go and – about this horizontally.
And as we strengthen our channel and reach, we can also go after the different verticals. The one vertical that takes on special attention is of course the federal vertical where we have a dedicated team and we continuously invest both in the team itself but also in the certification that helped the adoption in the federal market and through working with a lot of strong partners in that vertical. All right. Thanks, Udi. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Smith with First Analysis. Your line is open. Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You’ve talked about how the simplified pricing and product enhancements allow customers to kind of scope and get easier implementations. And I am curious, how it has affected you have enough data yet. The follow-on purchases in terms of either timing of when they come back or scale larger, smaller, byte sizes, et cetera. Any commentary around that? Yes, hi, Howard, this is Josh. Thanks for the question. It is a bit early for real data, because, we just introduced this pricing last year and so the real follow-on, I think one of the earlier callers asked, how many times do they come back and it’s seven times their initial order. But we looked at it over seven, eight, nine years.
So, I think it’s still a bit early. I think in the next year or two, we will be able to see better. Overall, with regard to average deal sizes though, and that’s some reflection of it. We are seeing on the new business an uptake and the on add-on, we are seeing more volume in deals, but slightly down on the average size. Okay. And a follow-up. You mentioned a rip-and-replace on one of your new logos. I know that historically it’s some of the exception, but are you seeing as this industry matures more displacements for your new logos? Or is it still primarily almost all Greenfield? Hi, Howard, I would say it’s primarily all Greenfield and as we look in the pipe, we continue to see that being the majority. But also, some seasoned with some rip-and-replace, especially the enterprises that do have something and are now looking now at it as a security layer. So, I think, we expect more displacements over time. It’s still the minority of the deals. Great. Thanks and congrats on a strong start to the year. Thank you. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just one question and then one follow-up. So, your guidance for 2019 implies a fairly material slowdown in license growth in the back half of the year. I am just wondering whether that is conservatism or if there are any other factors we should consider? First of all, we haven’t changed our guidance methodology. We’ve been public almost now five years and we continue to use our same guidance methodology, we have to reckon with our pipeline growth, but also at the same time, with being an enterprise software company.
So, I think, we are very happy with the strong growth we saw in the first quarter with being able to raise the full year guidance on the revenue and the growth that we see there. And I think, we are continuing to guide in the same manner as we have in the past giving the strongest number that we feel comfortable of giving. Okay, got it. And then, at your Analyst Day back in 2018, you talked about medium-term growth of 20%. Given the current demand trends underpenetrated both mid-market and enterprises, would you consider fiscal 2020 as within the medium-term? Yes, I mean, I think, we haven’t – we certainly, we’ve guided for this year and I still think that, we haven’t refreshed the last year’s Investor Day. But then, I think, we look at the overall, the trends in the market that we look at the analyst reports and so forth and we haven’t changed any of our outlook for that. All right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was curious, are you seeing seven figure deals representing a higher percentage of your pipeline versus this time last year? I think it’s – there is not a dramatic change and we’ve always seen a very large amount, 10% of deals that are seven figure. If we look at a year-on-year basis, we continue to see trending up on the number of deals – larger deals, whether it’s over a 100K or over a 500K deals, each quarter on a year-on-year basis and in order to do that, we are seeing more of them in the pipeline as well. Okay. And as a follow-up, you have a nicely growing cash balance. Can you give us your updated thoughts on use of cash and the M&A environment? Absolutely. I think, we have been very prudent in past M&As and to really look at how we horizontally secure Privilege Access Security for both humans and applications and made some strong moves in the past. We – I alluded in the prepared remarks that we hired a very experienced Head of Corp Dev. But it’s mandated very much to take its time and figure out long-term opportunities for us.
So, I think the robust cash balance is very important. It’s important to our customers to see that we have the financial strength and we will be very prudent on how we use it. Definitely, we feel that we’ve done well with that M&A. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much and I’ll add my congratulations on a good Q1, as well. Udi, you briefly alluded to Gartner and Forrester paying more attention to this space and with respect to Gartner anyway, it’s been a few months since the first magic quadrant report was published. Have you seen any change in the rate of inbound activity or closure rates or anything along those lines? Or is it’s simply just too early to tell? I think, we actually look at that and I would say that it’s more or less the same level of increased awareness. But over the last couple of years. So I think, it helps in new educating markets in our expansion to some of the emerging geographies. It’s clearly enables us to get more attention and to sign up the leading channel partners, especially in a new region.
But I will say it affects the pipeline pace. It’s really good for decision-makers in competitive situations and so, it’s overall another supportive tailwind, but not a mega tailwind. Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, Udi. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Couple questions first off. On the EPM front, you talked about contributions from cloud driving it. Can you discuss what the split is within EPM between the cloud and the on-premise version? And as the cloud component becomes larger, do you think EPM will become a larger driver of revenue? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, thanks, Erik. This is Josh. Yes, in fact, I mean, we saw for the first quarter, we did see our bookings on EPM go gravitate towards the SaaS. So I think it was about two-thirds of SaaS dollars versus one-third perpetual dollars or maybe 70% SaaS dollars. Just – yes…. Okay, and that which is growth rate compared to last year. And the second question? That was compared to first quarter last year, it was significant growth on the SaaS dollars. Okay. And then, clearly it was a strong quarter. To the extent, there was surprise upside in the quarter. Could you discuss whether you think that is a function of general demand? Or do you think that’s more of a function of a more favorable competitive environment? Hi, Udi here. I would attribute it to the general demand. I think we’ve been gradually – and we pioneer this space. So, I think we started off with really a strong position in the market and through continuous innovation and some smart M&A we involved in that leadership.
But the biggest shift has been the rise in this being a layer in priority and in the past we showed how it’s been in the top-10, top-5 priorities for organizations similarly in our channel partners, it rises up and I can’t say enough about the importance of the value-added resellers and our advisory partners giving attention to this space.
So the rise in priority and execution against that demand is the explanation for the results and that we relentlessly continue to innovate just to make sure we extend that leadership. Very good. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Just one question. With, Rich obviously joining, very experienced background what is some things that he has brought to the sales team in North America? Maybe any changes or just maybe strategically how he is really changing the organization? Thanks. Yes, I think, thanks for that. I think we’ve been very – we took our time and we were very selective in hiring a leader in the Americas that would come in and fit to culture and actually embrace a lot of things that were working so well for us, but bring us the experience of scale and some of you have seen us scale before.
So, I think it’s – first of all, he hit the ground running and he is well integrated to the team. But probably the first impression I would put out there is the importance of consistency of execution, like really looking at the things that are working and replicating them and driving them across the regions down to the last rep in anywhere in the region.
He also comes with strong channel background which is super strategic for us and just to add that continuously integrating our work with the channel. So, I’d say consistency of execution. The continuous partnering with channels and I could probably add like putting systems in place that supports the scale, because that’s the mandate. Like, we want to grow as bigger and we want that scale experience. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could talk through the issues around the sales force staffing levels. You’ve got expectations out there of 25% plus top-line growth. But your staffing is increasing at a 12% cliff.
Can you help us bridge between the rate of growth in staffing and increased productivity, increased deal sizes, other metrics that give us some confidence that the rate of increasing sales and marketing capacity is keeping up with your targeted growth rate.. Hi, Alex. Thanks, this is Josh. First of all, with regard to our sales organizations, we are growing them pretty much every quarter. So, a lot of what you see on this quarter it’s not necessarily reflective of - doesn’t necessarily translate to exactly growth rate for this quarter and for next quarter, because, we groom them over time and productivity increases dramatically when they get over six to nine months in in-house.
And so, really, we look at it over the course of last four and eight quarters in terms of the real strength for how much productivity we need for each current period. And I think we are happy with the increase that we have for the first quarter. We anticipate to continue growing that sales organization during the year. We see sales and marketing growing to be 40% of revenue this year and we are kind of farming.
So to speak, to ensure that we have the right productivity levels at the right tenure levels in order to achieve our guided growth rates. If I could follow-up with a second question, you identified EMEA as negatively impacted by the strong fourth quarter. But obviously, its growth rates were considerably less than the rest of the other two geographies.
Can you give us anything forward-looking in terms of a understanding the scale of what you have in your pipeline or other variable data that would suit give us confidence that that should reaccelerate to corporate average growth rates are better? Yes, if we look at it from a pipeline perspective, then, we are totally on track for the type of growing with the business. We’ve look at our diversification of our business over the last many years on an annual basis and you see EMEA growing with the business year in and year out. The percentage of the pie has been very stable over the last many years and the pipeline today substantiates that as well.
And that’s actually one of the strengths that we have within our diversified model both geographically and vertically is that, we are able to kind of flow through the fluctuations from the quarter-to-quarter behavior.
So, from a pipeline perspective, which I think, and what you raise, it’s a key trigger for us to really determine and give us the confidence that we see EMEA in a good place to grow with the business this year. Your next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with SBM Securities. Your line is open. Yes, can you talk about your expense growth expectations in the second half? In my model, I am getting over 30% year-to-year. You were, in the last several quarters, in the 20s. Why are you picking it up so much? We do see a step-up as we talked about in the cloud step-up on expenses in the back half of the year compared to the first half. It’s seasonal with related to our marketing event and also to employee expense step-ups that we typically see in the second half.
I think also, we see multiple-year growth opportunity for CyberArk. We want to ensure that we have the – still the ability today within our guidance to allow for us to continue investing for that growth in the second half of the year. And both on the sales and marketing organization and also on the innovation side, as it relates to our R&D investments. Okay. And then, second one is, related to Andrew’s question, the embedded revenue growth in the second half of this year, it’s something like, 16% to 18% which is below the medium-term target of 20%. And so, if you are sticking to that target in 20% it would imply an acceleration in the growth rate next year. Is that something you are thinking about? I am not sure – I am not sure I understood the second part – the second part of your question about next year. Well, the medium-term target is 20% growth. If that’s what you are thinking about for next year, that would imply an acceleration from the 16% to 18% growth rate in the second half of this year. I think, I’d prefer we stick to the guidance that we gave for 2019 on this call, which is the subject of this call and we are pleased with the – and feel confident about the guidance that we gave and I think, on another occasion, we may choose to discuss medium-term, again, in a formal basis. Right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you comment a bit on the customer growth this quarter? And what do you expect going forward for the rest of the year, because you had a good inflection in customer adds in 2018. It looks like the customer growth in this quarter was flat year-over-year. Yes, I think, we saw, basically kind of a similar pace in the new customer base. We still view it as a Greenfield opportunity. So, based on looking into the pipe and especially as we continue the motion downstream, we will continue to add new logos in a good pace. Thanks, Udi. And then, on summing up on Europe again, you said that you had budget flush in Q4 in Europe which help Q4, but then impacted Q1 numbers. Why was Europe different than U.S.? I mean, I would assume that you had budget flush both in U.S. and EMEA. Why do you think the impact was higher in EMEA for Q4 which pulled down your Q1 EMEA revenues? Yes, I think, in general, EMEA is more back-end loaded and very much channel-oriented as well. And we are running a global operation and you see sometimes a region behave a little differently in that respect. So we felt Q4 was just phenomenal and then, we saw a softer spend in Q1. But when we look at it, we actually said okay, and this is a natural cadence of spend.
Let’s look at the pipeline, the pipeline is healthy and we are benefiting from this diversification we have on a global perspective, because even with a slower EMEA, total revenue accelerated to 34% and license accelerated to 33% growth. So, pleased with that. And like I said, the pipe is healthy in EMEA and in the rest of the world. That concludes our question and answer session today. I would now like to turn the call back to Udi Mokady. Thank you. I want to thank our customers, partners, and our employees who contributed to CyberArk's strong results in the first quarter. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CyberArk Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Erica Smith, Investor Relations, CyberArk, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Julie. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's second quarter 2019 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information, specifically, our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the third quarter and the full-year 2019. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
Please see the risk factors contained in the company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release. CyberArk disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is also available in our earnings press release, which would be found on www.cyberark.com in the Investor Relations section. Also, please note that a webcast of today's call will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. We were pleased to exceed expectations across all guided metrics. Revenue reached a $100 million, [growing] 29%. Our revenue outperformance, disciplined investments, and strong business model resulted in $26 million of operating income for the quarter and in the first six months of the year we generated $67 million in cash flow from operations.
Given the strength of our business in the first half, we are raising our guidance for the full-year, which Josh will talk about later in this call. Demand for our solution remains strong across the Americas, EMEA, and APJ, and we continue to see broad market tailwinds. While digital transformation and cloud migration strategies are accelerating business operations, they are also exponentially increasing the complexity of enterprise IT, creating opportunities for CyberArk with new and existing customers.
In addition, regulators are flexing their muscles making headlines in the last few weeks by imposing staggering fines of $700 million, 250 million and 125 million related to breaches. The stakes have never been higher than security and in almost every successful breach, a hacker infiltrates the network or cloud environment and exploits Privileged Access, putting our solution at the top of Chief Information Security Officer’s priority list.
In today's environment, organizations are prioritizing proven and measurable solutions that deliver value. They recognize, the securing Privileges Identities human and nonhuman is the foundation of the strong Cyber Security strategy. In fact, industry analysts again listed protecting privilege as one of the top 10 most impactful security projects for 2019.
Privileged Access extends across all enterprise IT and the breadth of our solution simplifies the customer journey. A customer typically secures the most critical assets and applications first. And then expands increasing the number of users adding our application and endpoint solution, and ultimately extending protection enterprise-wide across on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. This is driving add-on business, which again represented just over 60% of license revenue in the second quarter.
On the new business front, we won more than 200 new logos in the second quarter, and are now helping secure over 4,800 organizations around the world. The majority of our new business continues to be Greenfield, and we are also surprised to see large enterprises managing privileged accounts manually.
Overall, in both new and add-on deals, our results were well diversified across industries, customer size, as well as geography demonstrating that every organization needs to secure Privileged Access.
In the second quarter, six verticals grew by 40% or more, including insurance, manufacturing, media, pharmaceuticals, retail, and transportation. We continue to see strong traction with our newer solutions. We were thrilled with our record quarter for endpoint privileged manager, including records SaaS bookings. Most breaches begin at the endpoint.
Removing local administrator rights, running a least privilege is recognized as a foundational pillar of security best practices from institutions like the Center for Internet Security, CIS; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST. Our platform provides customers with end-to-end visibility into privileged activity from endpoint through on-premise and cloud environments.
In addition, Application, Application Access Manager continues to gain momentum and was included in half of our top-10 largest deals in the second quarter with an increasing number of customers also landing with this solution. As organizations migrate workloads to the cloud and implement digital transformation strategies securing applications is increasingly important to reduce the attack surface.
Our more than 200 integrations are major competitive differentiator in the market, reducing the friction of securing mission-critical applications and making it easier for customers to strengthen their overall security posture. Securing robotic process automation or RPA projects was a trend again in the second quarter. To successfully automate and standardize human processes, RPA robots need access to multiple essential applications and systems.
Customers are increasingly turning to CyberArk to secure leading RPA vendors like automation anywhere, Blue Prism, and UI PAS. I want to highlight a few powerful new and add-on customer examples. In the Greenfield opportunity, a large global manufacturing company landed with Endpoint Privilege Manager and Core Privilege Access security. The firm's new Chief Information Security Officer quickly identified securing privileged access as a top priority.
They chose CyberArk because of our leadership position, ongoing investment in innovation, and ability to provide visibility into privileged activity enterprise-wide. A government agency in EMEA had a specific GDPR used case, which was extended to also secure its applications and IT environment with a comprehensive PAS program.
A European media company expanded its deployment of CyberArk. The customer wanted to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks across its European operations. The simplification of our solution and licensing, as well as our ability to secure its digital transformation strategy and AWS environment where meaningful contributors to this seven-figure add-on deal. A U.S. federal agency extended its coverage with Core PAS and added Application Access Manager and endpoint privileged manager. The agency wanted a single view into its privileged activity enterprise-wide, including its AWS environment.
In our largest deal in the second quarter, a financial services firm in the Americas is expanding with Core privileged access and Application Access Manager for its mission-critical customer facing applications. They have a multi-cloud environment and will leverage CyberArk to secure both AWS and Azure.
Our unwavering focus on innovation is critical to extending our leadership position. We continue to set the standard and define the market for privileged access security with the early July introduction of CyberArk Alero, our latest SaaS solution. Alero helps customers mitigate the risks of third-party vendor access to critical systems. We are the only vendor to combine Zero Trust access, biometric authentication, and just-in-time provisioning without the use of VPNs, agents, or passwords.
Our new solution makes it simple and easy for customers to manage remote vendor access. We also enhanced endpoint privileged manager to provide just-in-time administrative access to Windows and Mac endpoints on-demand. Given our security first approach, we’re also providing customers with a full audit log and the ability to revoke access as needed. The combination of Alero, CyberArk privileged cloud, and endpoint privileged manager is the most comprehensive SaaS portfolio for privileged access in the market.
Customers can deploy or access CyberArk anywhere; on premise, in the cloud, or as a service. Our laser innovations spread introduced at our recent CyberArk impact events for customers and partners in Amsterdam and in Chicago. These events were our most successful yet and marked the largest gathering of privileged access security professionals in the world with more than 2,500 attendees.
Partners also had an opportunity to dive into the new CyberArk Partner Network. This partner enablement program connects our ecosystem of advisory firms, global system integrators, and regional solution providers, and introduces enhanced competency-based tiering and certifications. The indirect channel represented about 65% of our revenue in the second quarter. We believe this new partner program provides us with an opportunity to accelerate momentum with our channel and advisory partners.
As part of our ongoing commitment to helping customers secure their cloud environments, we expanded our relationship with Microsoft by joining the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association. We are working with Microsoft to deliver joint customers, greater flexibility, and efficiency for securing privileged access. Our enterprise customers can more easily deploy our solutions in Azure and consistently enforce security and compliance across hybrid environments.
As you saw in our release today, we also announced that Ron Zoran will be transitioning out of CyberArk to help grow and scale early stage organizations as a board member. Ron was one of the very first employees at CyberArk and played an important role in defining privileged access as a critical layer of security and in establishing CyberArk as the de facto leader in the space. Like all strong leaders, Ron has built an exceptional sales organization with strong leadership across all regions.
We have initiated a search for new Global Head of sales. Ron will continue to serve as Chief Revenue Officer through September 30. To help ensure a smooth transition, he will continue as an advisor into the first quarter of 2020. We appreciate his ongoing commitment to the company. Our financial performance continues to demonstrate our significant market opportunity, the increasing awareness of privileged access security as a critical layer, and our ongoing commitment to delivering profitable growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh to discuss more details about our strong Q2 results. Josh? Thanks Udi. As Udi mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with total revenue growing by 29% year-on-year to $100.2 million. License revenue reached $52.2 million, increasing 27% over the second quarter last year, and representing 52% of total revenues. We showed growth across all geographies and for both new and add-on business.
On the product side, Application Access Manager represented about 9% of license revenue and Endpoint Privilege Manager represented about 7%. In the second quarter, we were again pleased to see the strong growth in the EPM bookings derived from SaaS deals. Maintenance and professional services revenue was $48 million, increasing 31% year-on-year and representing 48% of revenue.
The professional services revenue associated with this line was $9.2 million or 9% of total revenue. The business was well diversified across geographies. The Americas, revenue grew 28% to [$61.8] million and represented 62% of total revenue. EMEA revenue also increased 20% to $28.7 million or 28% to total revenue, APJ which achieved a record $9.7 million of revenue growing 41%, and representing 10% of total revenue.
As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our second quarter gross profit was $87.7 million or 88% gross margin consistent with last year's 88%. We are continuing to invest in the business to deliver innovation, drive growth and scale of the operations.
R&D grew by 24% year-on-year to $14.6 million. Sales and marketing increased 19% to $38.6 million as we expanded our sales organization across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales. G&A expense increased 16% year-on-year to $8.1 million as we continue to scale the business to support our growth. In total, operating expenses for the second quarter increased 20% to $61.2 million, compared with $51.2 million for the second quarter last year.
With our disciplined investments and revenue outperformance, we again deliver operating income ahead of our guidance at $26.5 million or 26% operating margin, compared with $17 million or 22% operating margin in the year ago period. Our overall expense growth is primarily related to headcount, and we ended the second quarter with 1,254 employees worldwide, compared with 1,077 at the end of second quarter last year.
We ended the quarter with 588 employees in sales and marketing, compared to 513 at the end of the second quarter last year. Net income was $23 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $13.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the second quarter of last year. We were pleased to generate $67.3 million in cash flow or 34% margin for the first half of 2019 that represents an increase of 20% over the first six months of last year.
The strong cash flow continues to be driven by strong collections, as well as our high maintenance renewal rates. As a result, we ended the quarter with $538 million in cash and investments. This compares to $451 million in cash and investments at year-end, and we ended the second quarter with $174 million in total deferred revenue, a 34% increase from $130 million at June 30, 2018.
Turning to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income, and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. So, for the third quarter 2019, we expect total revenue of $102 million to $104 million or 22% year-on-year growth at the mid-point.
We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $21.8 million to $23.3 million, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.45 to $0.48. The increase in our expenses in the third quarter is primarily related to seasonal employee expenses and our major third quarter marketing programs. Our guidance also assumes 39.4 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of 21% for the third quarter. Because of our first of execution and demand for our solution, we are increasing our guidance for the full-year of 2019.
We expect total revenue now to be in the range of $419 million to $423 million or a growth of approximately 23% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $106 million to $109 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.24 to $2.30. This is assuming $39.1 million weighted average diluted shares, and our guidance for the full-year assumes effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2019. We are pleased with our execution and our results in the first half of 2019, and it positions us very well for the remainder of the year.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? And at this time your first question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Absolutely. Hi, Saket. Hi, morning, Udi. Maybe Udi, just to start with you, you know from a product perspective, it seems like the momentum for Application Identity Manager and I'm guessing Conjur as well continues to be strong, can you just dig into that a little more, why do you feel like we are seeing that demand for AIM currently? And maybe related to that, how does the economics for AIM compare to Core PAS is if that’s comparable at all? Sure. Like we highlighted there was a record quarter for endpoint privileged manager, which really has its drivers around the fact that attacks begin at the endpoint and it’s becoming a no-brainer lets – let users run with full privileges on the endpoint and make it easier for an attack or two to exploit and [land there]. That’s our endpoint privileged manager. And with regards to AIM, it’s super strategic as part of digital transformation strategies of our customers, and so whenever we come to an existing account or new prospect, they are somewhere on that journey to moving their applications to modern infrastructure and running on containers, and again securing those keys and credentials is key. It’s still a smaller, obviously, a still smaller part compared to our Core PAS is the prime growth of this ship, but it’s behaving like a growth engine and is super strategic for us. Got it. And Saket, when we think about the economics behind the AIM versus our Core PAS, well first of all, again, it’s a pure software. So, on a margin basis, it’s a very, very high margins related. It probably drives also equal amount of services as well. It’s priced, you know a bit differently in the context because it’s both dynamic and for non-dynamic application environments, but overall, we think about organizations that would require it across the entire organization. The value of it would certainly be very close to the value of a Core PAS for that organization. Got it. That’s helpful. Josh, maybe for you, just in terms of revenue, nice speed on license, but also an even bigger beat versus [indiscernible] on maintenance and services, can you just talk a little bit about the breakout there within maintenance and services, what the split was between the two and sort of how do you think about that going into the second half? I think, when we look at the support of maintenance, that number included, I think I talked about it. It was 9 million – 9% of the total revenue was professional services. Got it. Very helpful. Thanks guys. Thanks, Saket. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Hi, guys. Just to clarify that, so I think we get to the same number, but I think in the prepared remarks you said, $9.2 million of services? Yes. Exactly. And that’s 9% of total revenue. Alright, perfect. Just wanted to make sure. So, Udi, in terms of your Chief Revenue Officer deciding to work with smaller companies, any additional insight as to why now? Yes. Absolutely. First of all, I wanted to be down in the book as the best possible and most amicable transition in recorded history because it is a long time and strong relationship and friendship. And he’s been with us basically from the beginning of time. So, the timing is his decision, but in everything he says and articulates, he's just very proud of where we are as a company and the opportunity for us. And after so many years in a demanding operational role wants to contribute from his experience to startups, and early stage companies, mostly as a board member and investor.
And so, it’s really, I would say, a good timing for him and for us, the best possible transition, because he’s leading the charge for Q3. He’s staying with the company all the way into Q1 and allowing us to really make this the best transition. Take our time and like we said, we launched a search for and will be very selective to make this a great fit and leverage the strong leadership we already we have in place across the regions. That makes sense. And then you mentioned the new partner program, is that ruled-out globally and when was that in effect? So, in other words, is everybody trained and up and running on the same page in all three theaters? Yes, absolutely, absolutely, we had the opportunity to launch it at our major events in Europe, in Amsterdam and Chicago for the Americas, but also earlier in several of the APJ regions, and we did it very thoroughly where we gave partners a heads up about it coming into effect where essentially it’s taking CyberArk to the next step. The demand is there, it’s top priority now across geographies, we really want to leverage our partners to be more capable, more enabled as they go to market.
So, it’s basically more rewarding, the more they invest in getting up and running and trained and launching it within these big events is just a great platform, because they have the opportunity to see full road map, everything the upside for them and hear more about the program and get up to speed. Makes sense, thank you. Thanks, Sterling. Your next question comes from Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Udi, I wanted to ask if you would classify what you are seeing as a sort of inflection in terms of demand for cloud solutions and that’s whether because of the launch of new solutions like Alero or because of just general increase in market awareness. You talked a lot about it on the call and I just kind of care to see if you could sort of classify that kind of terminology? Yeah, I think that in every customer and the beauty is that no matter where we are in the region, we find that they are somewhere in their journey. By the way, you still have those that are just tip towing and you have those that have moved all in, and somewhere in the middle, and we wanted just like we are diverse from a geography and a vertical perspective. We always want to be diverse on where they on their cloud journey, and for many of them it’s the ability to deploy CyberArk in the cloud or for CyberArk to secure their cloud infrastructure, but also new offerings if we can deliver them – as a service we’re definitely playing to the modern appetite.
And for example, Alero, which we’re very excited about was – we saw increasing demand for customers to expand privileged access to also those third parties that need privileged access and need to get into their infrastructure and the decision was rightfully okay. We’ll build this and launch this as a service, and expand our SaaS portfolio. The CyberArk privileged cloud is more intended towards mid-market and we launched it for that, for the customers with an appetite to consume privilege as a service, so that they’ll have that and of course EPM, which had a record quarter most of it, like the majority of the EPM was consumed in SaaS. When we look at Core PAS, we still see that enterprises want to own and put the keys to the kingdom, mostly on premise, but they have a variety of options and we cater to that. And your next question comes from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Market. Great, and thanks for taking my question. Udi in high levels we’re hearing about some disruption in Europe, maybe you had obviously a successful quarter there, but just give us some color in general, relative to what you guys are seeing at this point and any potential economic warning signs? Absolutely. Hi Rob. I’m think, I’m fresh to actually deep dive on the European business. We were very pleased with 28% growth this quarter. We ask about macro, obviously they are waking up in the morning and they are reading the news, but they are not seeing it translate directly into the pipe or the opportunity. And so, I would say that right now it has translated and again, perhaps it’s a matter of privilege being really in the high priority and not a nice to have privileged access being foundational, but of course we stay very close to it and stay tuned. Diversity is really a big part of our strength, so it’s also diversity within the region. And following for Josh, relative to a couple of the balance sheet items, the differed revenue, I don't think met your expectation but was in line with where you guys have been historically Q1 to Q2 if I look back a couple of years. So, maybe some of the puts and takes around differed and then number two, your DSOs did spike quite a bit sequentially, did that speak to the linearity of the quarter? Thanks. Thanks Rob. On the deferred revenue, I think you kind of nailed it in terms of where we are in the seasonality, this was where we thought we would end up around on deferred revenues. Let’s not forget it is a 34% year-on-year increase. So, nevertheless still a nice growth rate. Deferred revenue for CyberArk is predominantly the support and maintenance contracts, which have their seasonality and have their ebbs and flows for when we booked them and they are aligned with the licenses.
So, with the Q3 and with Q4 being the heaviest license period of the year, and then it dips down in the first half of the year, which is why you see lower on deferred revenue growth, but we’re aligned with where the deferred revenue growth is, and I think you pointed it out, it’s in line with the seasonality that we’ve seen in the past. With regard to DSO, actually the linearity was fairly close when we look at it from a month-by-month and weekly perspective into the last month of the quarter. It’s 41 days, it’s a bit, I think spiking is bit of a tough word, when it only jumps, when it’s only 41 days, compared to mid-30s as it was in Q1, but overall, it’s very much in our range of comfort zone for DSO. Next question comes from Daniel Bartus with Bank of America. Thanks guys. I wanted to ask first about just recurring revenue in general. Imagine most of the maintenance lines is recurring and then you have a decent amount of SaaS now in the business. I remember from the Analyst Day in the past, you guys showed that pretty steady repeat selling to existing customers every quarter too. So, you add all those up, I was just wondering how much of your revenue would you now classify as recurring or recurring like, and how do you expect this trend going forward? Yes, still the majority of our deferred revenue and recurring revenue is coming out of maintenance. We do have some SaaS, which is building certainly with the growth of the business and churn-based licensing which is growing within the course of the business. So, I would put the number roughly 40% in terms of recurring that we have today, and then on top of that as you kind of pointed out, is that we have a pretty consistent stream of recurring revenue.
In fact, about just over 60% of our license revenue, when I talk about recurring customers, just over 60% of our existing customers came back also in Q1 and also in Q2 this year and purchased additional licenses. So, it’s something we’ve seen consistently over the last few years, and while we don’t know exactly and always who will be coming back and for how much, we have consistency for customers coming back and purchasing more each quarter. On top of the 40% of contractual recurrence. Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with version 11 of your product and some of the new features like geographic distribution, maybe open up some new opportunities with your customers? Yes. This was, I would say version 11 really was a major enhancement for us. And a lot of it has to do with customers who really deploy CyberArk at scale, and a big part was what we call the active, active vault where it really allows them to trust the infrastructure to always be up and support their – of their critical systems. It’s been long in work and launched in version 11. We also continued to invest the items around simplicity, which we started back in – when we first rolled out 10, and we've been rolling that out consistently and showed it in our two impact events.
One of the exciting new introductions in version 11 were our secret list broker, which adds on to the strength of our AAM solution allowing in certain used cases developers to really be totally seamless in dealing with credentials and where the management is all behind the scenes for them. We view that as another important enhancement for that adoption. And on top of that, like I said earlier, we made major enhancements to our CyberArk privileged cloud. So, yes, all of these contribute to our ability to continue to expand globally. Great, and then, just with regards to Alero, you know, how quickly do you think this could potentially ramp? And if starts to, you know, cross over a little bit into the traditional SSO space, can you maybe help clarify, you know, where there’s this overlap and where, you know, there’s sort of uniqueness? Yes. It’s very much privileged access. It’s answering demand for our customers. They say we’re – CyberArk is our solution for employee, and strong users and their access to our IT infrastructure, but we also have a lot of third parties who need to come in and it could be that they are administering a router or a database or they could be an IT service provider. And so, it's a big pain, and – but it's very much in the privileged access world, so we give them a VPN less, password less and agent less way to get very strong and – strongly controlled privileged access and do what they are need to do.
And so, I would say it’s adjacency to the other IAM parts. In terms of the opportunity, the opportunity is very large. We see it really as great new, but also very at our business to our existing customers, but it is a new solution. So, we – you know we’re going to take our time as we roll it and its not baked into a big impact into 2019 itself, but definitely is going to be part of every sales process to new and existing customers. Next question comes from Gary Powell with Deutsche Bank. Great, thanks for taking the questions. Yes, maybe we can – can we talk about the competitive environment. Have you seen any benefit from customers looking to turn off from CA yet? And has that been a material driver to growth in the first half of this year? Yes. Hi, Gary. I would say, no major change since we updated last quarter. I would say, primarily seeing the PE role up companies in the competition amidst we – with regards to CA, yes, we see them trying to cling onto existing customers less or zero involvement in new business. And you're right, we have seen displacements in CA. Some of them have been ones that we’ve been eyeing for a while and in important enterprises, but it wasn't meaningful in terms of the overall impact on the number, but important for us strategically, especially since the customers really appreciate that we have the experience of also migrating from CA infrastructure. And so, the more we have added, the more we can do more in the future. Thank you. The next question comes Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Hi, thank for taking my question, and an awesome quarter. Mine has to do just with the advisory curve, could you dig into a little bit how that process works and, you know, how much are they really feeling? Could you give us may be an idea what percent of revenue comes from the advisory firms? Thank you. Yes. So, I don’t think we provided it in this quarterly snapshot, but we will in the future continue to talk about influenced deals. The influence our revenue, they usually do not resell. I would say that the partnership and their level of competency is the best ever, and it's the numbers. It’s the amount of trained professionals that they have and also really creating a business around us. One way to see it was their presence in our impact events. You really see the Big4, you see Accenture, really investing and partnering with us and it's really a win-win, especially with their footprint in Fortune 500 and Global 2000 and their ability to influence there. You're right; it's one of the things I’m really most excited about in the past one or two years. And the question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Alright, thanks. Thanks for asking the question. So, I understand your comments on seasonality with regard to deferred revenue, but it does seem like for the last few years and particularly in Q2 billings growth has generally outpaced revenue growth though it looks like this quarter it slowed pretty materially relative to your revenue growth rate. So, can you provide any more color as to what might be driving that and how we should think about it going forward? Yes. Andrew, you know, basically again, in terms of – you know this company is, you know, predominantly selling perpetual software licenses. So, when we look at – you know when we look at billings as predominantly the impact of deferred revenues, and then – and that's really driven by the seasonality of our maintenance renewals, and, you know, I think that, you know, overall, when we look at, you know, the maintenance renewals, we’re still above our 90% plus threshold, and, you know, I think, you know, it’s just a matter of the ebbs and flows of our renewal contracts of, you know, how it ties into the billings. But we’re happy with our 34% increase on deferred revenues, and the license growth revenue year-on-year, which is going to keep driving those maintenance contracts going forward. Okay. That makes sense. And then, I know you implemented some pricing changes last year at this time, and so, I’d assume all the new customers are on their new pricing model, but can you give us any color as to maybe what percentage of your existing customers have moved to the new pricing model? And should we view that transition to the new model as a growth driver? Thanks. Yes. So, as you said, all of – any new quote going out the door today is on the new pricing model has been for a year now. And then, you know, basically our existing customers, when they come back and buy more licenses, as I said before about 60% of our revenue – of our license revenue is coming from existing customers, though either choose to convert and to the new prices or continue buying a la carte and the old price list. And roughly about 30% of our customer base is on the new price list. Again, your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Okay, thank you. Udi, you spoke a little about the enhanced partner program, but can you update us on your mid-market initiative more specifically just in terms of how that’s progressing? Yes, absolutely. Hi, Gregg. I would say it's still early days from us. The biggest growth still comes from enterprise, but two quarters into it, we’re really seeing processes definitely improve and it – you know really the fruits of our investment in a different sales motion, our ability to touch the mid-market with less presence in the field. So, I would say it’s in the right direction. It’s still a smaller part of the business, but we view that as long term strategic for us. And that’s great. And then just a quick one for Josh, so your gross margins again were very good this quarter. I think you had previously guided to 87% to 88% for the year, but you're already at the high end, and, you know, historically speaking your second half margins are typically higher than first half, so just kind of wondering how you’re thinking about gross margins over the rest of the year? Thanks. Yes. I think we’re – you know we think that we’re still sticking with the original range, but as you said, we’re hovering towards the high-end of it. Some of it will depend upon, you know, the level of services in the fourth quarter in terms of how much we need to extend out to sub-contractors to help us, you know, provide that level or not. But I think we feel comfortable with the 87% to 88%. Next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Great, thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on the verticals. You cited six verticals that specifically grew in excess of 40%, which is great news, and I’m glad to see it. But the question is, is that a function of the need in those vertical? Or is that a function of you targeting those verticals? And if so, how do we think about the targeting efforts going forward? Is there other verticals where you haven’t targeted that you might be able to add in to provide that extra kick to growth? Yes. You know, absolutely. I think we want to show color about where – the beauty is we sell the same software to every vertical and across the world. And so, except for the federal team, we don't have dedicated teams for vertical, which really allows us to be diverse and scale. And so, the results of these growth are results of growing demand in a vertical, and of course, execution against that demand and just, you know, that beautiful pie of diversity that we have continues, and, you know, the growth levers are definitely just to go after the next 30,000 customers, 40,000 customers that don't have privileged access and do that cross-geography, cross-vertical because every vertical needs this. Next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Hi, thanks for taking the question. First off, have you made any changes to your 2019 hiring plans relative to what you're thinking last quarter? Hi, Ken. This is Josh. No, I think we’re very much on track for – in accordance with the plan that we had set out at the beginning of the year. I think, if anything as we look into H2, we start to think about, you know, whether or not we want to, you know, do early hiring’s for next year. But we’re very much on the same strategy that we had set out at the beginning of the year. Okay. Next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to drill in on some of the sales hiring comments you just made. Last year, we saw a significant improvement in productivity from your sales force and that certainly translated into upside into your license performance and relative to last year I think that’s moderated. So, I wanted to better understand what type of productivity trends you're seeing as you ramped up on sales capacity hiring and you expect to ramp on sales capacity hiring? And secondarily, if you can give us some color on retention and/or attrition trends within the sales organization, especially as we think about Ron transitioning out of the organization? Thanks. So, with regard to productivity, you know, we’ve had good productivity this year. I think as you can see from our nice growth year-on-year in each of the first two quarters. We continue to grow headcount across the entire organization, across sales and marketing. I believe it’s in the mid-teens, but if we were to look at the [quota carriers] actually we've increased them significantly more than that, so that's a big – that’s a lion share of what we've grown there. The sales and marketing organization is coming in quota carriers across both, you know, the commercial targets and also enterprise.
So – and that's really an anticipation of the fact that, you know, we see – you know we have to – we seek basically a sales ramp up of the quota carriers of six to nine months. And – so that's why we’re always ahead of the game for bringing quota carriers on, and, you know, we’re seeing good productivity from them this year. And as you said, it's kind of a continuation of what we saw last year. With regard to the question on Ron, whether or not you expect to see any change in the organization? No. I mean, I think like I said earlier, we’re managing this as a best-in-class transition, and he’s with us through all the way into Q1. And so, we’re going to minimize any distractions here and I think we put a good plan in place to do that. Next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Yes, thanks. So, my question is about some of the mid-market teams in both the U.S. and Europe, maybe just tell about some of the progress you are seeing there in terms of you minor installed base? Thanks. It is a new process for us to have dedicated teams, one of the prime benefits is allowing the enterprise reps to really focus on the enterprise and I think we’re seeing good process and progress, it’s part – like you said it’s primarily in the Americas and in Western Europe, we’ve done that differentiation of dedicated teams. We will report more on it, but there’s opportunity there to continue to see low touch sales and reach out to the mid-market where we will be more sporadically reaching out to and doing more in methodical, in our book right now it’s on the right track, but still early. Your next question comes from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim Partners. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. If I’m doing my math right, it looks like revenues in Americas were flat sequentially; usually they go up by quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. Can you comment on that? First of all Americas revenues grew up 28% year-on-year, so we’re happy with type of growth rate and also happy with the fact that if you look at all other regions, we build as Udi said earlier, we really built the organization to be diversified and seeing EMEA growing 28% and APJ growing 41%, you know that really helps us be able to operate the business over the long term.
Typically, the sequential growth between the first and second quarter is not as strong, but the region is our most mature, it’s consistently delivered strong growth and overall when we also look at kind of dig down under the hood of the America sales, one of the things that I kind of alluded to briefly in the call is that we had a very strong EPM SaaS bookings and the majority of those bookings were in America. So, actually kind of if we were to of neutralized out selling a lot more SaaS in the quarter in the Americas relative to what we had seen a year ago, we probably would have seen more sequential growth. Got it. Thanks. Just one follow-up. Last year you had a strong growth in Q4, I think you had one of the highest sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 last year and given that majority of your business comes from add on sales, you think that reflects in this year’s [indiscernible] Q3 to Q4, did you get a benefit from the fact that, you’ve a such big Q4 in 2018, those guys come back for renewals this year in Q4. Do we see that seasonality that you saw from Q3 to Q4 in 2018? Also, be a tailwind for your seasonality this year from Q3 to Q4? Well, I mean, certainly, we do expect such sequential growth between Q3 and Q4, which we typically have seen in years past and we do get certainly from bookings perspective, we get a lot more, we get growth on the [mentioned] renewal contracts from licenses that were booked in prior Q4s as well, but overall you are right. At this point, we feel good about the rest of the year and hence our guidance for Q3 and for the full year and I think part of Q4 is also what’s going on with regard to the budget flush environment as well, and especially in our space of enterprise software, so, but we feeling like we are in a good position to meet our goals there. Your next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with SBM Securities. Yes. So, your maintenance gross margin appears to have declined sequentially in year-to-year, I haven’t seen that in a while, you did grow that metric by 5 percentage points in 2018 to 75%, but now it’s down to 74.4%, I realized in the past you said that as SaaS grows that line item will decline. Is the ramp of our Alero impacting this or do you expect that to continue to decline? Actually, I would say, the, kind of the small step down that you saw in this quarter would be more related to the professional services side. You saw we actually had a nice growth and professional services, which also meant that we use some more subcontractors in that in order to provide those professional services, and that’s what could move the needle there by that 0.5% that you noted. So, that’s where on the support and maintenance piece, specifically. It would not be related to Alero. Certainly, not at this point and that would be related more to when we think – right now about the cost of goods on the licenses line as supposed to the services line? Next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Hi. Congrats on the quarter. Just one quick question on the security breaches that you mentioned on the [back of signs]. Have you seen that translate to, I guess better sales tailwind in the pipeline, due to the record signs you have seen at Capital One et cetera? Hello Eyal. I think it’s been very recent. I mean the publications are around the finds and Equifax and British Airways and Marriott and others have been recent, but it did come out when we had a lot of interaction with a lot of customers at our Chicago impact event, and you can see that it is becoming another factor in their thought process. So, I wouldn't say it supported sales in retro look, and I wouldn't say, that it’s like a mega tailwind, but it’s adding additional teeth to the regulatory element, which has always been another driver for our business.
So, our biggest one is of course reducing the risk. Digital transformation is a big driver, and compliance was always a driver, but now compliance comes with hefty fines and has teeth to it. And so, it is going to be top of mind of [indiscernible] and that has been our first impression from customer interaction since those publications. And just one follow-up Udi. In terms of the CCTA regulation, has customers been asking about CyberArk's products in relation to that? I know it’s not active until next year, but have you seen things through the channel from the angle? Yes. That’s a point, it’s – customers speak about it as a given, as something they have to deal with just like we, just like GDPR has become a given. They are talking about it as something that they will have to live with. Some they can approach that if they comply with GDPR, the will or they aim for GDPR, and therefore comply with the California regulations, but back to the previous point that’s going to be another tailwind, and we believe privilege is just foundational to ever looking anybody in the eye and saying we were securing our critical asset and private information. Your next question comes from [indiscernible]. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I appreciate the digital transformation driver, could you possibly, just speak directionally maybe on how much of the success in the quarter was due to customers actually using the solutions to secure more of those modern IT infrastructure uses, you’ve been speaking to relative to maybe just continuing to spend on securing credentials associated with more of the traditional assets that’s been driving growth in the past? Yes. It continues to be both. I think one data point is the adoption of our Application Access Manager, which as I mentioned was in more than half of the top 10 deals and that’s usually a direct connection to digital transformation, but as we talk to our teams and our deployment teams, basically in every single account, and in part of what they're trying to do in the privileged access security program there is a connection to digital transformation. So, it could be their RPA, the Robotic Process Automation. It could be, we need to secure these administrators of our cloud server.
So, it’s becoming hard to actually disconnect it. It’s in every sale motion, and the customer then prioritizes. Very often they do want to prioritize with locking down domain controllers and critical infrastructure and user access to that, but in other phases of the program, we tie in to their digital transformation. Sometimes it is the landing point of, okay, now is the opportunity we want to get this infrastructure right because we’re doing the lifted shift or moving applications. That was very helpful. Thanks, and then just a quick follow-up. Of the existing customer revenue in the quarter, would you classify it more as customers moving towards that enterprise-wide strategy or are we still seeing tactical deployments whenever it’s necessary? Of the new deals in the quarter or are you asking …? Customer revenue. The existing customers, it’s been now more years of us pushing what we call the CyberArk hygiene program where we take a programmatic approach. So, you can attach most of the add-on business to most – to customers going through and taking off pieces that they want to take or accomplish on the program. You still have, of course customers that have taken more tactical approach, but I think it’s really working and we had a chance to really test that and touch that in the customer events. There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Udi Mokady. Thank you. Thank you everyone. In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners, and employees, our dear employees for contributing to our strong second quarter results. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you again for your participation. This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. I am excited to discuss our third quarter results with you. We were pleased with our strong performance. Our results exceeded expectations across all guided metrics. Revenue grew by 28%, reaching a $108 million and non-GAAP operating income increased by 40% to $29 million or a 27% operating margin.
During the quarter, we reached a record for revenue in the Americas, a record for EPM SaaS bookings and generated record business in the global government vertical. We’re also pleased to again deliver best-in-class growth and profitability, not only in the security industry, but also across technology companies.
Given our execution and the robust demand environment for the third time this year, we are raising our guidance for revenue growth and operating income for the full year which Josh will talk about later.
Overall, we continue to benefit from strong secular trends. It is estimated that two-thirds of Global 2000 CEOs are not only adopting digital transformation, they are centering their corporate strategies on building software-driven businesses.
At the same time, almost every enterprise customer is running on-premise, cloud or multi-cloud IT environments migrating workloads that drive more efficiencies and productivity into their business. This increased complexity and the rapid pace of change in business operations and IT is expanding the attack surface, exponentially increasing the risk from cyber attacks and driving the velocity of hacker innovation.
In today’s IT paradigm, the adoption of Zero Trust frameworks is accelerating. Organizations are taking a never trust, always verify approach to managing and securing human, application and infrastructure identities.
Privileged Access management is not only the foundation of Zero Trust, but also of every strong security program, which is contributing to the rising demand for our solutions. While mitigating risk for customers is a key driver of our business, we are also a core component of compliance in a growing list of requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI, SWIFT, CCPA and others.
With that background I will move into our results for the quarter. We were thrilled to win 200 new logos in the third quarter, bringing our total customer count to over 5,000. We are proud that the world’s leading organizations across industries are trusting CyberArk to help protect their most valuable assets.
A few new business highlights include; a rapidly growing financial services company had deployed a niche competitive offering that could no longer scale to meet its more demanding requirements. In a rip-and-replace deal, they are moving to CyberArk, because of the breadth of our solution across endpoints, applications and core Privilege Access, as well as our ability to secure containers and modern application development with Kubernetes at scale; An information services and solutions company engaged with CyberArk to remove local admin rights on all desktops with Endpoint Privilege Manager to meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements. During the sales process, the customer suffered a ransomware attack and the deal quickly shifted to risk reduction with both Endpoint Privilege Manager and Core Privilege Access for Tier Zero access; a government agency in Southeast Asia is leveraging CyberArk to secure Access to and enable auditing of all video recording devices across its physical locations in an interesting IoT use case.
Our leadership position in the PAM market, as well as our commitment to innovation was key to winning this Greenfield deal. Given the exploitation of Privilege Access is at the root of almost all major attacks existing customers are prioritizing CyberArk in their security budgets. We have also accelerated time to value through product simplification, as well as partner enablement.
We have made it easier for customers to extend Privilege Access protection to cloud and hybrid environments, as well as digital transformation and DevOps initiatives. In fact, more than half of our Fortune 500 customers are using CyberArk to secure cloud assets.
A couple of add-on examples include, an energy company is securing Privilege Access enterprise-wide across its hybrid environment including Azure, the organization had landed with our endpoint solution, but was using a competitive offering for Privilege Access.
Over our long tenured relationship, we demonstrated our strong cloud security capabilities, our long-term vision and our high-level of customer satisfaction and as a result, we won this strategic seven figure rip-and-replace deal.
Lastly, I would call out a seven figure expansion deal with a U.S. financial services company. The company became a CyberArk customer in 2018 with core Privilege Access security for a segment of its Privilege users.
The company is now expanding to protect workloads and detect anomalous behavior in its AWS environment, remove local admin rights in over 5,000 endpoints with Endpoint Privilege Manager as a service, secure its Robotic Process Automation or RPA project with our Application Access Manager, as well as protect Privilege business users with PSM for Web.
We also had a record quarter in global government, driven in part by U.S. Federal. The strength of our federal business was in large part the result of our continued investment in this important vertical.
Just last week, we announced that our solution again achieved International Common Criteria Certification by the National Information Association Partnership or NIAP, which validates that our solution meets the stringent requirements for U.S. National Security System procurement.
This certification is used not only by the U.S., but also globally by 31 member countries, which will contribute to our ongoing success in governments around the world.
In the third quarter, our U.S. Federal business benefited from spending on our core Privilege Access Security Solution under the Department of Homeland Security’s CDM program. The CDM program makes it easier for U.S. Civilian Agencies to strengthen their security by funding approved products like CyberArk’s Core Pass. We have been thrilled with our success under this strategic federal program.
Beyond CDM, civilian agencies are standardizing on CyberArk across our solutions including key wins during the quarter for Endpoint Privilege Manager and Application Access Manager including our largest AAM deal to a federal customer.
In addition, because of our high-levels of customer satisfaction and our extensive product certifications, we also continue to gain traction in U.S. military and intelligence agencies in the third quarter.
Moving on to product diversification, Application Access Manager was included in half of our top ten largest deals in the third quarter. Every organization today is a software company using technology to automate human tasks, drive business operations, and increase efficiencies. These applications have identities that need to be secured a key driver to our Application Access Manager Solution.
We were thrilled with another record quarter for Endpoint Privilege Manager SaaS bookings. There was increasing awareness that removing local administrative rights, running a least privilege and preventing credential set is an important component of stopping attacks where they typically begin at the endpoints.
Geographically, the Americas had a record quarter and we were pleased with the growth in APJ. In EMEA, revenue grew by 13% in the third quarter, off a very strong Q3 2018 when the EMEA region grew by over 40%. Growth rates in certain countries in EMEA has been inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter in 2019.
EMEA’s annual seasonality has typically been back-end loaded towards yearend. Consistent with that trend, the fourth quarter is off to a strong start in EMEA, while there are been macro headlines regarding Europe in recent quarters, we believe demand for our solutions remains healthy.
Our more than 400 channel partners and advisory firms are extending our go to market reach. Today, we have over 4,000 certified trained professionals across delivery engineers, presales engineers and sales people, which is more than double the trained professionals at the beginning of the year.
In the third quarter, the indirect channel represented about 65% of our revenue. Our innovations have empowered customers to secure Privilege Access across on-premise in public or private cloud and in hybrid environments. Our newer SaaS solutions CyberArk Privilege Cloud and Alero are gaining momentum.
Our early Privilege Cloud customers are up and running and the pipeline of opportunities continues to build. Alero has been met with overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. Every enterprise needs to mitigate risk from third-party vendor access. We are the only vendor to combine Zero Trust access, biometric authentication and just in time provisioning without the use of VPNs, agents or passwords.
We are in a market rich with opportunity, driven by not only the complexity of IT, but also organizations embracing the cloud and executing digital transformation strategies. Our investments in research and development, in sales and marketing have positioned us as the leader in Privilege Access management and we are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Josh to discuss more details about our results. Thanks Udi. We again exceeded our outlook across all guided metrics. Total revenue grew by 28% year-on-year, ahead of our guidance reaching a $108.1 million in the third quarter. We generated $57.9 million in license revenue, increasing 25% over the third quarter last year and representing 54% of total revenue.
We also had strong diversification across our products with Application Access Manager representing about 11% of license revenue and Endpoint Privilege Manager representing about 5%.
We were particularly pleased to see EPM have another record quarter of SaaS bookings, which lowered the EPM revenue recognizing the current period, but will increase our current revenue down the road.
Maintenance and professional services revenue was $50.2 million increasing 30% over the prior year period and representing 46% of revenue similar to the last year. The professional services revenue associated with this line was $9.6 million or just under 9% of total revenue.
Geographically, the Americas reached a record $69.8 million in revenue, growing 34% over Q3 last year and representing 65% of total revenue. EMEA grew total revenue by 13% to $29.8 million or 27% of total revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2018, EMEA had a particularly strong quarter with revenue growing by 42%, which created a tough compare this year.
Year-to-date, EMEA revenue has grown 19% and as Udi mentioned, the overall opportunity in EMEA remains strong. APJ recognized $8.5 million in revenue growing 35% and representing 8% of total revenue.
As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please use the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the tables of our press release. Our third quarter gross profit was $94 million or 86.9% gross margin.
That’s compared to an 88.5% gross margin in the same period last year. The decline in gross margin which we anticipated at the beginning of the year is due to increased investment in our cloud infrastructure and in higher utilization of subcontractors, because of the strength of our license revenue in prior periods and the heavy demand for those related services.
As part of our ongoing strategy to drive growth, deliver innovation and scale the company, we continue to invest in the business. R&D grew by 20% to $15.4 million or 14% of revenues, sales and marketing increased by 18% to $40.1 million or 37% of revenues, as we expanded across all geographies to support direct and indirect sales.
This included our highest attendance and most successful Americas customer event we held in Chicago that we talked about during the Q2 call.
G&A expense increased 27% year-on-year to $9.2 million or 8.5% of revenues as we continue to scale the business infrastructure to support our growth. In total, operating expenses for the third quarter increased 20% to $64.6 million, compared with $53.9 million for the third quarter last year. Revenue outperformance and disciplined investments again drove strong leverage in the third quarter.
Operating income came in solidly above our guidance at $29.4 million or a 27% operating margin, which is also an increase from $21 million operating income and an increase from 25% operating margin generated a year ago. The majority of our expenses are related to headcount and we ended the third quarter with 1,326 employees worldwide, up from 1,106 at September 30, 2018.
We had 625 employees in sales and marketing on September 30 this year, that’s compared to 524 at the end of the third quarter last year.
CyberArk generated net income of $25.6 million with earnings per share ahead of guidance at $0.65 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019, that’s increasing 44% from the 17.8 million and improving earnings per diluted share by $0.17 from the $0.48 we reported for the third quarter of 2018.
We generated cash flow from operations for the first nine months of $89 million. This represents a 29% cash flow margin for the period. As a result, we ended the quarter with $555 million of cash and investments.
This compares to $451 million in cash and investments at yearend. We ended the third quarter with $177 million in total deferred revenue, a 30% growth from a $136 million at September 30, 2018.
Turning to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains and losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. So, for the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect total revenue of $125 million to $127 million or a 16% growth year-on-year at the midpoint.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of business to be approximately 57% from license revenue and 43% from maintenance and services.
We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $38.5 million to $40 million or a non-GAAP margin of 31% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of between $0.78 to $0.82. Our guidance also assumes 39.2 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of approximately 21% for the fourth quarter.
We are pleased to raise our full year guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $429.2 million to $431.2 million or a growth of approximately 25% at the midpoint. We are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of a $119.75 million to $121.25 million or an operating margin of 28% at the midpoint, which is an expansion from the 26% operating margin for the full year of 2018.
We are increasing our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.58 to $2.61. This assumes 39.1 million weighted average dilute shares. Our guidance for the full year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for 2019.
As we look ahead, driving growth through disciplined investments continues to be our top priority. Our execution year-to-date reinforces our conviction that we have a long runway for growth and positions us well for the fourth quarter of 2019 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here. How are you? Good, Saket. How are you? Good, good. Udi, maybe just to start with you. Can you just comment on the competitive environment, at all? And whether you are seeing any of the competitors that ownership changes in the last year or so, whether those competitors are merging at all? The numbers certainly wouldn’t seem to indicate that, but I am curious if you are seeing anything on the ground, just to add a little bit more color. Sure. I would say, Saket, that there is no major changes in the competitive environment that we saw in the third quarter. We still see the competition from the Francisco Private Equity rollup and so they are out there. They’ve been kind of self-disrupted with the rollup. But I wouldn’t say that they are gaining any resurgence, but deals are competitive and they show up in deals.
With regards to CA, we do see that they are working hard to try to maintain their relationship with existing customers. And I think they’ve alluded to that strategy. We have seen displacements where we’ve displaced them and of course others. As we noted a little bit in the prepared remarks, we have lot of examples of rip-and-replace including with the legacy Dell - solution. That’s really helpful. Josh, maybe just one follow-up for you. Can you just talk a little bit about the overall SaaS mix of the business? You mentioned in your prepared remarks, couple times just around strong SaaS bookings for Endpoint Privilege Manager. Udi, I think you talked about strong reception for Alero Privilege Cloud.
I guess, as we look back at Q3, or maybe year-to-date, however you’d like to look it on, what percentage of the business now at this point is coming from SaaS? And how do you think about that mix going forward? Yes, hi, Saket. It’s Josh. So, when we think about our SaaS business, the majority, the overwhelming majority of the business is still really coming from our Endpoint Privilege Manager. Alero, as you know, we just released it. I think, Udi’s enthusiasm about it was around customer reaction to the release and to the product itself and the general availability is happening only in Q4 and I think that we are optimistic there.
So, when we think about the SaaS business, it’s around the Endpoint Privilege Manager. It’s around our initial tractions for Privilege Cloud and we saw in Q3 about 7% of license revenue going to our combination of SaaS and term-based licenses about which half of that was pure SaaS business. And that was just – that’s just under 5% of total revenues.
I think as we kind of look going forward, we are seeing, it’s still small numbers, but if we look at the growth rates of our contracts for SaaS they are growing at a higher rate than the growth of the business. And I’ll just reiterate three sources for our SaaS revenue, EPM SaaS as the majority, Privilege Cloud that we are very excited about, again with early customers and Alero, minor correction was GA at the end of Q3, but it’s still an early product. But we are seeing a lot of excitement and it’s a no brainer issue of our remote vendor access. Your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Udi, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the funding environment, particularly in EMEA, you said it was uneven year-to-date. I am just wondering if it has gotten more uneven in Q3 and you did know the pipeline looks good for Q4. But how should we expect that business to track as we close out the year? Sure. Hi, Melissa. I would say that, the nine months it to we were able to track consistency a little bit better and to see that that in Southern Europe and in France, we’ve seen less. I wouldn’t say that Q3 was dramatically different. But we see more visibility and to the point we are in this business, you can’t overlook the macro uncertainty.
But then, you measure – we measure our own numbers and we see healthy pipeline and as I mentioned off to a strong Q4 start. We did have a tough compare there as I mentioned where Q3 2018 was 40% growth. Right, helpful. And then, I just wanted to follow-up on the sales organization. So with Ron stepping down this quarter, I realize that he is staying on Board. But I am just wondering if you can update us on the quest to find a new Chief Revenue Officer and then, just given the transition, I am just wondering how you saw sales productivity this quarter and if you’ve seen any change in sales attrition? Thanks. Yes, no, absolutely, I think in the last call in August, we talked about let’s make this a best-in-class transition and I think that’s what we have been seeing on all fronts. Just the sales leadership in the company across the theaters, across the various pieces of the sales organization just completely stepped up and I would say, zero to no issues with the transition on the opposite people really stepping up.
In this quarter, I am taking a more active role and I’ve started that also in the – towards the end of Q3. In brackets, I’ll say that I am enjoying that, but don’t worry, it’s going to be short-term. I think it’s good for the business. It gives me a closer handle to the sales.
And in parallel, we are very advanced in our Chief Revenue Officer search with some – I would say, advanced candidates where we were looking for the combination of ability to further scale CyberArk towards our long-term plan, but also strong culture fit and I am very optimistic that we’ll be able to find the right candidate in the – I would say, in the next couple of months. Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the strong set of results and elevated outlook. Udi, if - or Josh, if we look at the 200 new logos you nailed down this quarter, how many of them are displacements? How of those are Greenfield and probably, it’s a little tricky, but maybe any color that you could provide us will be extremely helpful. Yes, sure. I think, we would still – we gave a lot of rip-and-replace examples in the script because of just some exciting examples, but the majority were Greenfield. And then, there could be some light brown in the sense where our customer had a tactical solution more driven historically by compliance and when they took a security approach CyberArk won the full strategic approach.
So, the quick answer is primarily Greenfield. A growing amount of rip-and-replace, but some of them are really of solutions that were brought into parts of the organization. Got it. This is helpful. And as we think about the 65% coming from the indirect channels or partners, any number of VARs that stood out this quarter or pretty much very consistent across the board? Yes, I would say that, we saw the – of course the Federal business was extraordinary in Q3. And so, we saw our partners there really delivering. And then, across the U.S. and internationally, strong performance with the channel and the advisory fronts. I think, they don’t always – they don’t certainly count in that 65%, because they don’t resell, but they influence a lot of the deals, especially in the Global 2000. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Josh, I wonder if you take a minute and talk a little bit about deferred revenue and billings. And what I mean by that is, traditionally, deferred revenue has gotten lumpy based on different factors.
I wonder if you could highlight those and in particular, with the strength in EPM and SaaS, I would think that that would actually given the revenue recognition actually bolstered the deferred revenue and how should we think about that as we move to the fourth quarter? Yes, okay. Thanks, Sterling. First, we had deferred revenues grow by 30% year-on-year and I think one of the things that has impacted, maybe have slowing a bit the deferred revenue growth this year was that we are seeing more and we’ve had a case in the last couple of quarters to more multi-year deals, contracts, larger contracts that also include extended payment terms over the life of the contract meaning annual payments.
And then, that would certainly – that certainly – while it’s the business is there, it will impact the overall deferred level. But overall, I think that we feel good about the business, one is that our maintenance renewal contracts are still tracking at 90% above our renewal rates. There is no dramatic changes in how that business is operating.
And overall, I think as we kind of go – going looking forward, or going into Q4, Q4 is a big year, big quarter for maintenance renewals. So that’s when we start to see that come in. But if I will remind you and the people on the cloud that we recognize that in deferred once it’s collected and then, we recognize the PCS on that deferred after collection.
So, some of it will depend upon the linearity within the quarter of when those renewals occur, because we have to collect the cash before the yearend to be able to identify that. With regard to the SaaS, you are right, we are happy about it and we just talked about in the prior question our growth in the SaaS component, particularly in the Endpoint Privilege Manager growing.
It’s more than in the last couple of quarters it’s been more than 60% of our bookings going to SaaS contracts. But we are still talking in small numbers. So, with regard to the very large deferred numbers that we have coming from the maintenance contracts, it’s not – there is still a limited impact there. All right. It makes sense. And then, one follow-up question. There is a news report out there talking about you guys exploring a bond deal. Just wondering to the extent you could comment of rounds your current cash position, your capital structure and capital needs and what additional capital might be used for in that type of situation? Yes. Hi, Sterling, Udi here. So, obviously, we don’t comment on the market rumors. But I would say that, part of our planning involves regularly evaluating out capital structure and capital allocation and how they align with our long-term strategy and goals, really thinking long-term in every planning session we do. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much. And very good quarter guys. Congrats on that. So, I guess, first question for Udi, you mentioned that you have over 4,000 certified professionals and then that’s more than double where you were at the start of the year. Can you elaborate on how you’ve been able to scale out the ecosystem still rapidly? Yes, absolutely. It’s been strategic for us to – with the growing demand to make sure that our ecosystem can support our customers out there internationally. So, we’ve been investing in trading and certification and also the channel program has been updated to reward and incentivize enablement or enabled channels especially on the technical front and it really drove attendance and demand for our certification courses.
And in the customer event that Josh mentioned and then the prior one that we did in Europe, we were just overly subscribed on the training sessions. But we also take it to the field regularly. And so it’s strategic for us and the demand is out there for these certifications and I’ve seen a lot of people boast when they get the CyberArk certified result. Okay. It’s great. Thanks, Udi and then, just one for Josh. Your TSOs did go up fairly meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. If you can talk about the linearity that you saw in Q3? Yes, actually around linearity, we saw in Q3 and really kind of – even in the first Q1 and Q2, it revert to kind of where we expect it to be. Last year in 2018, we had – and we talked about it on the call, during the year that we had really favorable to historical terms, linearity within the quarters.
And that kind of help boost our cash flow last year, as well. And this year, we are seeing it kind of revert back to a more historical norms. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one for Udi and one for Josh. Udi, I’ll start with you. On the AAM and proportion of license revenue this quarter, some of the highest we’ve seen in the recent past.
So, I am wondering if you can bifurcate that strength between sort of overall improved market awareness versus anything you are doing with the sales force internally to incentivize greater adoption and then, my follow-up is for Josh. Sure, Fatima and it’s a great question, because I think it is the combination. The combination of deeper into the integration of Conjour and a better integrated in robust product that we have out there. The driver of really playing to digital transformation and that strong driver where CyberArk can enable customers to move workloads to the cloud into modern infrastructure.
But then also, like – as you asked, changes in the sales organization that we did in the beginning of the year, where we really embedded some overlay efforts to help the field with the emerging technologies. So the – it really supported the AAM business and it’s showing up really in our largest of the deals and hence the 11% of the revenue. It’s a really exciting part of our business. That’s helpful. And Josh, for you, I know you price in local currency in geographies outside of the U.S. Could you just remind us any movements in FX, any impact to both revenue and operating expenses, both in the quarter? And what your expectations are baking in, in your full year guidance? And that’s it for me. Thank you. Yes. We do, as you said in Europe, we sell in sterling and we sell in euro. And if we kind of take a view of the FX impact on income, we had a headwind of about $300,000 and on expenses, we got a positive of around $900,000. Your next question comes from the line of … Sorry. Let me just correct that, it was $600,000 on expenses. Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, I appreciate you giving the insights on license revenue for Q4. You guys do have some pretty tough comparisons on the license front for both Q4 2019 and Q1 of 2020.
So, how would you suggest as we think about growth there on a normalized basis? And then, I mean, would it be fair to just look at the last two years and take an average or just any insights you can give us on that metric going forward? I am sorry, you are asking about 2020? Not, just like, you gave guidance on Q4 license revenue and I am just trying to think through, you guys have tough comps. So just how we should think about normalized growth on that metric looking forward? Yes, we are not at this point… If you want to give 2020, that’d be great. No – but we are not looking at 2020. We are not going to discuss 2020 today. But I think, historically, we’ve been pretty consistent on our mix between revenue and from licenses and from services and from maintenance and at this point, there is no new news I would give regarding how we would look at 2020. Okay. Fair enough. I just try another one if I can. Just how do you feel about visibility on your pipeline and growth prospects today relative to this time last year? Well, I mean, about our pipeline, it’s grown, it’s much bigger this year than it was last year at this time and I think as Udi also remarked in his remarks that we are seeing a growth across all of our different products, across all of the different geographies. So, I don’t think we – I think we feel we are in a similar position to how we see the market today than how we saw it a year ago. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how customer expansions performed in the quarter and how you are thinking about the contribution from expansions in 4Q? Yes, absolutely. So, add-on business was more than 60% of total revenue and on a base of 5,000 customers now, it’s become a super strategic fit to continue to grow that customer base from beyond the into Core Pass of course, where it’s strategic, but also with the emerging technologies.
So there is a lot of add-on opportunity within the customer base and we invest in that regularly while going after the Greenfield opportunities. So, we have both engines turned on. Our next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Your line is open. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. Udi, you talked a bit about Alero on the call and you gave us some exciting initial feedback. But I was more curious to see if you are encountering a different competitive set here with the solution, with the approach as you ultimately look to broaden the value prop of the company. So, right now, we are really focused on the remote vendor access in high growth. Very focused on the remote vendor access as a privileged expansion opportunity and as a privilege use case. I mean, it’s kind of a no brainer if you want to limit and put controls over how IT employees and developers of your company are accessing the IT infrastructure.
You definitely want to put those controls on third parties that are coming in and getting Privilege Access and the solutions today are punching holes with VPN. And so, it’s an expansion of the Privilege use case and I would say that in the short-term, we are keeping it under the Privilege umbrella. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bartus with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taken the question. So, maybe first for either Udi or Josh, I wanted to also ask about AAM a little bit differently. Across some of your more mature customers, how does the split of their spending look between the application and the Core Pass side of things? And then, ask differently, just kind of how are you guys thinking about the TAM in your customer base between the application and Core Pass there? So, I would say that the majority of the customers of course start with Core Pass and start with securing human access. And so, it’s still the smaller part of our customer base that has addressed the AAM use case and those that have done, usually start with some low hanging fruit, like securing off-the-shelf third-party solutions through our extensive C3 Alliance program and partnerships.
And then, more and more we are in the path to use they would gravitate or securing embedded credentials and code and legacy applications and more and more moving to securing dynamic applications from our Conjour acquisition. So, it’s still very much open ground in the majority of our customers.
And I think, in the past, we’ve equated it where the deal size in a customer that went all in, in AAM can be equal to the potential opportunity on securing the humans is not greater. So it’s part of the TAM. We put out there when we discussed our overall TAM.
So we factored it in. But it’s really two different things. Securing humans and securing applications, yes, we can double the – I would say, the value in a customer through this kind of expansion. Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yako with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just provide an update on the mid-market build out? Any key investments you still need to make? And then, maybe how that segment contributed to overall results in the quarter? Absolutely. So, like we said before, the more strategic part of our business is definitely the enterprise. But we’ve built out a team that’s looking further into mid-market and proving the case that that we can serve a low touch, higher volume type of sales. So we definitely see that as a component of the business.
But it’s still a small part of the revenue. And so, I would say, we are growing that muscle. It’s an important long-term muscle for us. But the majority of the revenue comes from the enterprise opportunity and that’s where the majority of focus on investment is for us. The next question comes from the line of Howard Smith with First Analysis. Your line is open. Yes, thank you for taking my question. In the past few years, we’ve talked about the driver moving from compliance to security focus. So I was interested in your prepared remarks you mentioned the growing list of standards requiring has and I am curious is that opening up new verticals to you? Or how was that affecting the business trends you are seeing? Yes, I think – hi, Howard. I think it’s – the – one of the reasons we mentioned it again is it’s popping up as a supporting driver in many of the deals. So the main driver is still our risk reduction. But in these enterprises, they have these DPR mandates or they have mandates prepared for the new California regulation and it’s coming up as a – all right, this helps us also support this mandate and sometimes it’s in the budget allocation and in others.
And so, I think we are really multi-vertical already and very diversified. But we’ll keep a close watch at this further expense especially internationally and we’ll come back with more data. Perfect. And just as a quick follow-up. You called out the government in particular, particularly strong this quarter. Any other vertical strength you might highlight? Yes, energy was a stronger example. Pharmaceutical is another one in the quarter. But, I think the beauty is we also – when we look at a year-to-date perspective, we actually see strong consistency of the strong performance across all verticals. Your next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you comment on the duration for this quarter? List out the long-term deferred mix went down a bit this quarter versus the last few quarters it was going – the mix was going up and how should we think about that for Q4? Yes. Hi, Taz. This is Josh. The duration is not really moving around all that much quarter-to-quarter. It’s really what you are looking at on the deferred, I kind of spoke about earlier as well. One of the things that we saw in Q2 and Q3 is that some larger multi-year contracts that had payment terms across each year as opposed to upfront for those multiple year contracts.
So, you are not necessarily going to see then the deferred for those long-term pop up from those contracts. And that reflects several million of the maybe the increase that you’re looking for in the deferred. Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Two questions, one, can you break out what the federal contribution is? Or can you at least provide some context around the contribution and how are you getting there? Yes. Hi. This is Josh. Typically, we see global government be just around 10% - just 10% to 11% of the business, of which, Federal will be anywhere from just under a half of it. And this time, we saw global government be in close – in the mid-teens with federal driving that extra growth. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Yes, just on the last question, in terms the Federal, I mean there is a lot of cloud deals going on, especially on the Federal side, that seem like they could create opportunities for you guys in terms of the product positioning.
So maybe, can you talk about it? I mean, is that something where we look out a year, some of the opportunities there is much more significant than what you’ve seen over the last year just given what’s happened, Federal on the move to cloud? Thanks. No, absolutely. I can’t say yet that we can connect ourselves to the recent headlines on some major Federal cloud decisions. But if you – we look in our world, A, where part of the deals have been securing application workloads and the ability to transition to modern workloads with our AAM.
And while the bigger drivers are really securing infrastructure, it’s very clear that we are extending and will extend to the government’s cloud infrastructure. But right now, it’s securing the infrastructure they have. Some of it includes some early cloud adoption and a lot of it is the bread and butter infrastructure. Your next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN. Your line is open. Thank you very much. So, you just had a rather steep decline in your services gross margin to like, 70.7% from the mid-70s before. I think you mentioned, future cloud and subcontractors, going forward, do you see that services gross margin continuing to decline to like 65% or do you think it stabilizes around 70% or so? Yes. Hi. This is Josh. Yes, you are absolutely right. We saw decline mostly on the services side it was related to the using subcontractors to fulfill the demand for providing the service – the increased demand that we are getting. And overall, it’s – the function of using subcontractors is the lumpiness and the demand for how many days we need to deliver.
Overall, we could – I don’t anticipate that driving or moving the number that much more. On the cloud side, the more we sell SaaS, software and business and clearly, the cloud is going to become a bigger and bigger component of that. But still, I think that it’s going to be gradual and we’ll be able to give clarity on that when we talk about 2020. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Berenberg. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the mid-market. We’ve been seeing some of the identity governance players bundling in Privilege Access functionality, with the IGA functionality, I was just curious how should we think about the competitive landscape as you move into the mid-markets? Yes, you are probably alluding to the recent SailPoint acquisition. We actually have been looking at that closely and talking to them and it’s primarily a cloud governance move with some of the tuck-ins they’ve done and we continue to collaborate in the field strongly.
And so, I would say that when we look at the mid-market opportunity, it’s still the PAM vendors that are going after it. For us, it’s an expansion and there are some vendors that started from mid-market and we meet there. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. Thank you, Scott. In closing, we would like to thank our customers, partners, and employees around the world for contributing to our strong third quarter results. Thank you very much. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode, and After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Erica Smith, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, James. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the first quarter and the full year 2020. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made herein.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is also available in today's press release, which can be found on our website in the Investor Relations section. Also a webcast of today's call will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section as well.
With that I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. We had a record fourth quarter, capping off a strong year. We delivered growth and profitability by executing against the plan we outlined this time last year. We expanded customer penetration by adding a record number of new logos and increasing our add-on business with existing customers. We increased adoption of Application Access Manager and Endpoint Privilege Manager. We established a mid-market sales motion, and we significantly strengthened our leadership position in privileged access management delivering critical functionality and new solutions like Alero.
As a result, we exceeded guidance across all metrics. In the fourth quarter, total revenue reached a record $130 million growing 19%. Non-GAAP operating income reached an all-time high of $42 million. And we signed nearly 300 new logos, the largest number in the Company's history in a single quarter, ending the year with more than 5,300 customers. For the full year revenue reached $434 million, growing 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $123 million, and we generated record cash flow from operations of $142 million.
Our business continues to benefit from strong secular tailwinds that are gaining momentum. IT environments are changing at an unprecedented rate driven by digital transformation and cloud migration strategies. These trends are expanding the attack surface, while at the same time there is a sprawl of privileged activity. As recent examples demonstrate, attackers require privileged access. Ransomware leverages privileged access at the endpoint and is holding organizations of all sizes as well as state and local governments hostage. Cloud Hopper was a multi-year campaign against MSPs where privileged access allowed attackers to steal information from hundreds of companies. And in December 2019, it was reported that a customer -- a consumer brand accidently left mission critical API keys hard-coded, exposed, and vulnerable on GitHub. In the wrong hands, these keys could have provided access to internal systems and ultimately control of the AWS environment.
As a result, Chief Information Security Officers are prioritizing measurable solutions that strike the right balance between flexibility, growth, and risk mitigation. They are putting privileged access management at the foundation of their security and zero trust strategies. A few great customer examples in the fourth quarter that highlight the CISO's view; in a greenfield win, a Fortune 200 pharmaceutical company needed to secure both human and application credentials as part of its digital transformation strategy. We won this marquee new logo because of the breadth of our PAM offering, our strong relationship with Accenture, and how easily our solution can be deployed on AWS.
A global insurance company is rapidly migrating workloads to the cloud. We were the only vendor who gave the CISO much needed peace of mind by providing end-to-end security, visibility, and analytics into privileged activity. Three key competitive differentiators [indiscernible] replace new business win. First, our solution is battle tested, securing the world's leading enterprises across hybrid environments. Second, our proven track record of delivering innovation that meets the current and future requirements of dynamic, modern enterprise IT. And the third differentiator was our new Alero solution, which solved a major pain point by enabling a secure, third-party access via biometric authentication without a VPN.
A software company needed to remove local admin rights on developer workstations and enhanced its privileged access management program to support its digital transformation strategy. The majority of our business continues to be greenfield. However, in this rip and replace new business example, our SaaS Endpoint Privilege Manager and CyberArk Privilege Cloud outperformed the niche incumbent vendor, particularly given the software company's rapid growth, cloud-first strategy, and global footprint.
An existing manufacturing customer has been using Endpoint Privilege Manager for more than four years and has successfully blocked 100% of malware attacks since implementing its least privilege strategy. During the fourth quarter, the manufacturer added EPM users and extended its relationship with CyberArk in a three-year deal for CyberArk Privilege Cloud. This 10,000-employee company was not [ph] vaulting or rotating privileged credentials with a software solution, which demonstrates our significant greenfield market opportunity and the traction our SaaS solutions are gaining in the market.
A large technology company was incredibly happy with the rapid time-to-value of its core privileged access security purchase in Q3. As a result, in the fourth quarter they not only expanded with more PAS users but also purchased Application Access Manager to secure Ansible Automation, PHP, and Shell Scripts used in digital transformation strategy as well as our new Alero solution for all third-party vendor access as part of its zero trust framework.
Diversification across geographies, verticals, product, and delivery is a critical pillar of our strategy, and we realized the benefits of this diversification in 2019. Revenue growth accelerated in both the Americas and APJ. This strength offset the 16% revenue growth in EMEA during 2019. If we drill down to the major countries, the UK grew faster than the business, while Germany and France both faced macro challenges and underperformed. Overall, our EMEA pipeline has grown nicely with significant opportunity for both new and add-on business, which we believe supports stronger growth in the theater for the full year 2020.
On the product side, [indiscernible] had another record year and was included in six of our top 10 license deals. Securing applications is a priority today as every company across all industries increasingly leverages software to drive productivity, efficiency, and the competitive edge.
While the majority of our large enterprise customers continue to prefer to consume our solution as a perpetual license, diversity of delivery is important to our long-term business. We are pleased with the early momentum of our SaaS portfolio. Just yesterday we announced compliance with SOC 2 requirements for EPM and Privilege Cloud, which demonstrates the security and integrity of our SaaS solutions. EPM reached a new record and saw material mix shift toward SaaS, as organizations recognize the importance of locking down privileged access at the endpoint.
CyberArk Privilege Cloud gained traction with certain market segments and verticals. Our new SaaS Alero solution delivers zero trust remote vendor access to increase control and visibility into privileged activity with no VPNs, agents, or passwords. Since introducing Alero at the end of the third quarter, many of our customers have expressed interest in this service, and we are thrilled with the early response.
Innovations like Alero have strengthened our leadership position in the market. This year some of our other innovations include Active-Passive Vaults for high availability and disaster recovery in our core PaaS solution. We can now continuously detect alert and respond to risk-scored privileged activity in AWS. We introduced application credential management in our Privilege Cloud solution. We launched Secretless Broker capability in Application Access Manager, an innovative approach for secret management that frees developers and increases security.
We also extended our market reach in 2019 and today have more than 450 channel partners and advisory firms. In the fourth quarter, we added 500 trained professionals across delivery engineers, presale engineers, and sales people, bringing the number of certified professionals to more than 4,500. This partner enablement contributed to our indirect business, which represented about 67% of revenue in 2019. We also experienced a greater than 50% increase in business influenced by our advisory partners like Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, and Accenture. We were very pleased to have four of our advisory partners present at our Global Sales Kickoff a few weeks ago. Each partner discussed the significant opportunity they are seeing for PAM and their investments in CyberArk practices, setting the stage for continued growth in 2020. Our C3 technology partners were also a key differentiator in 2019, particularly for digital transformation with RedHat, UiPath, and Blue Prism; risk reduction with Rapid7, Tenable; and cloud migration with AWS and Microsoft influencing deals in 2019. Our success with C3 supports our long-held position that security is a team sport.
We were very pleased to add Matt Cohen to the team as Chief Revenue Officer in the fourth quarter. Matt's extensive experience delivering comprehensive go-to-market strategies that will be instrumental to our long-term growth, particularly as we bring multiple delivery options, including our SaaS and perpetual license to market.
2019 was a record year, and I'm proud of our accomplishments. Our strong results demonstrate that we have a tremendous market opportunity to scale and grow CyberArk to a $1 billion revenue company and beyond. As we look at our objectives in 2020, we are focused on strengthening our alignment and business process across the organization to drive growth and scale the Company. We plan to further enhance our strong relationships with advisory, reseller, and technology partners through ongoing enablement programs and joint marketing; win new and add-on business through targeted marketing and sales programs; evolve our customer success organization to ensure privileged access is secured across our customers hybrid IT environment and enhance the support of our SaaS customers. And as always, we will continue to deliver innovation that will not only extend our leadership position but also deliver a meaningful layer of security to customers.
With that let me turn it over to Josh to discuss our record results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Udi. As you have just heard, we delivered another strong quarter ahead of our guidance, generating record revenue of $129.7 million, which represents 19% year-on-year growth. License revenue reached a record $76.5 million, growing 15% year-on-year. And that's against the tough compare with license revenue growing 38% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our license growth in the fourth quarter was driven in large part by new business, particularly in the Americas and APJ, and in the fourth quarter, license revenue represented 59% of total revenue.
Maintenance and professional services revenue increased by 26% to $53.1 million and represented 41% of total revenue. The professional services revenue associated with this line was $9.3 million or 7% of total revenue. The Americas reached another record of $71.1 million in revenue growing 17% year-on-year. EMEA generated $45.9 million of revenue in Q4, growing 10% year-on-year. As Udi mentioned, EMEA was impacted by macro trends in Germany and France. In addition, the Asia Pacific-Japan region delivered again and capped off a great year with revenue growing by 94% year-on-year and reaching a record $12.6 million in revenue.
We had a strong demand across all verticals in the fourth quarter with government, health care, pharma, IT services, and media each growing by more than 40%. As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $115.6 million, increasing from $98.2 million, generating a gross margin of 89%. That is just a slight decrease from the 90% gross margin in the same period last year, and the 1 percentage point decline was primarily due to our investments in the cloud and our increased use of third-party contractors as we discussed throughout the year.
On the expense side, we are investing in the business to deliver innovation, drive growth, and scale the organization. Our R&D expense grew 34% year-on-year to $17.6 million or 14% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter increased by 27% year-on-year to $46.3 million or 36% of total revenue. G&A increased 10% to $9.6 million or 7% of total revenue. In total, operating expenses increased 26% in the fourth quarter 2019 to $73.5 million, and that's compared with $58.4 million for the same period last year.
Our revenue outperformance and disciplined investments drove record operating income of $42.1 million for the fourth quarter compared to operating income of $39.8 million in Q4 of 2018. Net income reached a record of $37.8 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase from both the $33.4 million and $0.89 per diluted share for fourth quarter last year.
Now let me summarize our results for the full year 2019, which were also ahead of our guidance across all metrics. Total revenue reached $433.9 million with growth of 26% compared to $343.2 million in 2018. License revenue portion was $237.9 million, growing 24% year-on-year and representing 55% of total revenue. In 2019, approximately 65% of license revenue was generated from existing customers purchasing additional licenses and approximately 35% of revenue from new customers.
As Udi mentioned, we saw a healthy increase in revenue from our newer solutions with Application Access Manager representing about 11% of license revenue and Endpoint Privilege Manager representing about 7% of license revenue in 2019. And that's even with about 60% of the sales being delivered as SaaS and revenue was recognized only ratably. Maintenance and professional services revenue increased 30% year-on-year last year, reaching $196 million and representing 45% of total revenue, and the professional services revenue associated with this line was $36.3 million or 8% of total revenue, and that's consistent with the prior year.
Moving onto the geographies for the full year. The Americas generated $264.8 million in revenue with growth accelerating to 29% in 2019 from the 26% growth rate in 2018. In total, the Americas represented 61% of revenue in 2019. EMEA grew by 16% in 2019 to $129.7 million in revenue or approximately 30% of total revenue. Asia Pacific-Japan revenue growth accelerated to 54% growth from 47% in the prior year, reaching $39.4 million or 9% of total revenue. For the full year, our business was also well diversified across industries with nine verticals representing at least 5% or more of the business. Banking was again our largest segment, representing 28% of the business in 2019. That's compared to 30% in 2018. Global government was 14%, an increase from the 11% in 2018. Manufacturing was 8% compared to 10% in 2018. And healthcare increased to 7% of the business from 5% in 2018. And during the year, deals over $100,000 increased to 1,020 from 868.
Our gross margin for the full year was 88% consistent with the 88% in 2018. We continued to make disciplined and strategic investments in growth and innovation. So for the full year, R&D represented 14% of total revenue. That's consistent with the 14% in 2018. Sales and marketing represented 37% of total revenue, a slight decrease from the 39% in 2018. And G&A represented 8% of total revenue, also a slight decrease from the 9% in 2018, resulting in strong leverage as well as record operating income and operating margin of $123.4 million in 2019 and a 28% operating margin, which was ahead of our guidance, an increase from $90.5 million or 26% operating margin for the full year of 2018.
Our net income increased to $107.9 million from $76.5 million and our earnings per diluted share increased by 34% to $2.77 from the $2.06 in 2018. Our effective tax rate for the year was 19%, which was in the range that we projected. We ended the year with 1,380 employees worldwide compared to 1,146 at the end of 2018. That includes 656 employees in sales and marketing at the year end, up 21% from the 541 at December 31, 2018. We generated record cash flow from operations in 2019 of $142 million or a 33% cash flow margin.
Now turning to the balance sheet. First, deferred revenue for the full year increased 27% to $190 million at year-end. Also, we ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, an increase from $451 million at the end of 2018. The increase was driven by the strong cash flow from operations, but also from net proceeds from our November issue of zero-coupon convertible notes of approximately $560 million before the capped call.
So regarding the convertible debt issue, we were pleased to execute this financing at such attractive pricing. The deal is structured as a five-year note due in November of 2024. The notes also have a provisional call any time after November 2022 through maturity assuming certain conditions are met. The conversion price associated with these notes is $157.53. That represents a 37.5% conversion premium at the time of issue and are convertible into approximately 3.6 million shares. Importantly, we also took approximately $54 million of the net proceeds and entered into a capped call transaction, which enables us to participate in any upside beyond the conversion price up to $229.14. Taking into account the capped call, the net proceeds from the financing were approximately $506 million.
So for modeling purposes for the full year 2020, we expect to have approximately $17 million in non-cash interest expense related to this offering, which we will be adjusting out of our GAAP financial results and will be reflected in the non-GAAP tables of our financials. We are using the treasury stock method, and as a result, the offering is not dilutive to our EPS in the fourth quarter or the full-year 2019.
Moving on to our guidance for the first quarter of 2020 and the full year. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income, and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. So for the first quarter of 2020, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $106 million to $110 million. Our revenue guidance for the first quarter takes into account the tough growth compare from first quarter last year, particularly in the Americas and APJ, the mix of perpetual and SaaS business which we estimate will be about $3 million impact on revenue in the first quarter, as well as the performance in EMEA for 2019. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range from $16.5 million to $19.5 million, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.35 to $0.41. This assumes 39.6 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of approximately 21%.
We are also initiating our guidance for the full year 2020, which reflects the strength of our pipeline and our overall opportunity. We expect total revenue in the range of $511 million to $519 million or growth of approximately 19% to the midpoint. We expect our gross margin to be approximately 86% to 87% for the full year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $109 million to $115 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.26 to $2.38. This assumes 39.8 million weighted average diluted shares, and assumes guidance for the full year -- also assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2020. We typically experience a sequential revenue decline in the first quarter, moderate sequential growth then in Q2 and Q3, and Q4 is our largest revenue quarter of the year.
On the expense side, we typically see a step-up in the expenses in the third quarter as a result of typical increase in employee expenses. We also wanted to point out that we are moving our Americas' customer event to the second quarter this year; so that will result in a shift in marketing program expenses from the third quarter as we've seen in prior years, to the second quarter this year. We also expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $7 million and $8 million, which represents just under 2% of revenue at the midpoint.
As we look at the full year 2020, we expect our cash flow from operations margin to run between 5 to 10 percentage points higher than our non-GAAP net income margin. We recommend analysts to evaluate our cash flow on an annual basis given that our free cash flow from operations can vary quarterly based on seasonality of the business and taxes -- and payment of taxes. As an example, we just paid approximately $3.8 million of taxes already in the first quarter of 2020, which will impact our cash flow from operations. We do not plan to provide quarterly updates on guidance for cash flow from operations.
We are pleased with our 2019 results, which position us well for profitable growth in 2020 and beyond. We are looking forward to the year ahead. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Hey, guys. How are you doing? Thanks for taking my questions here. Absolutely. Hey, Saket. Good, Saket. Hey, Josh. Hey, Udi. So I'll just keep it to one. And maybe I'll -- maybe it's for you, Josh. Can you just talk about how you think about the SaaS part of the business here in 2020? I know you mentioned it's roughly a $3 million impact here in Q1, and clearly the vast majority of the business is still traditional perpetual license, but what sort of assumptions did you make about how some of the core PaaS business comes in between perpetual versus SaaS in 2020 as part of that revenue guide? Yes, good. Thanks for the question, Saket. So I think what we're trying to do here is really infuse new technologies to be consumed in the form of SaaS and we're seeing that. Last year we saw EPM growing and its SaaS consumption almost 60% of the bookings were done in SaaS. That was a big increase from the year before, and we anticipate that to continue to grow. This year we're starting out the year with three bona fide SaaS products with Alero and as well with the Privilege Cloud as well in addition to the Endpoint Privilege Manager. The way we look at it from a financial perspective for 2020, we still believe it will be less than 10% of total revenue from SaaS, but we do see it's off of small numbers. So we see it's a large increase. Already in 2019 we've almost doubled the [ph] AAR from SaaS and subscription business on our books. And as you pointed out and we've called out on the call, it's already -- it's kind of already changing our view on how we look at each quarter. And so already in Q1, we're assuming about $3 million kind of going through ratable SaaS business incrementally than what we've seen, for example, in Q1 last year.
So, I would look at it -- and in terms of the Privilege Cloud, what we really see is that's still being more of a sweet spot for our commercial market space and creeping up into some of the smaller or medium enterprises that are contemplating looking at SaaS products. But overall, we see it growing off of a small base in 2019 and still being though within about 10% of our revenue. Got it. I'll get back into queue. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Okay. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have another one for Josh. I wanted to dig into the margin outlook for 2020. By my calc, I'm calculating 30% growth in expenses next year. That's an acceleration. Can you talk about what's driving that acceleration? Is it a function of the fact that maybe perhaps you underinvested a little bit in 2019 and now you're kind of catching up? Yes. Hi, Melissa. Thanks very much. So when we look at where we're going to be investing faster than the business, it's really going to come in three areas. The first and largest area will still be -- is really in sales and marketing. Right now I would attribute roughly if we look at these kind of the six points that you're referring to, probably half of that is going to be faster investment in sales and marketing, and that's really just a reflection of the opportunity that we see in the marketplace. And we see that every year we try to keep investing in sales and marketing.
The second place would be R&D and that really goes to some of the things that Udi talked about, our continued innovation and also our -- looking at the new technologies that we're putting out there. So we have also the on-prem perpetual and now the new SaaS technology products that were out there. And I would put that at roughly a 2% of that 6%. The other piece on R&D is that we do have a little bit of impact from the FX as well. So that 2% gets a share of the shekel increased -- stronger shekel rate as well.
And then the third piece, about 1% I would put at the cost of goods. And that really goes to again our increase in SaaS products and the fact that we're investing more and more in our vehicle to be able to third-party host these SaaS products and going into the cost of goods. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I'll dive into the EMEA comments. I think you called out France and Germany in particular. How much of this is end market just macro? You've done a good job improving execution through the years in the region. Is there any other changes that you can make to kind of bolster what you're seeing in that marketplace? And what have you kind of factored into your guide? Hey Sterling, Udi here. So, yes, definitely, I think in Germany clear macro headwinds that we saw throughout the year and especially in Q4, and the same applies for France. So kind of two strong and foreign European economies were a drag on us, whereas the UK actually outperformed the rate of the business. We always -- even when we have macro, we always combine and put attention to our own execution. And there actually France specifically has a lot of new headcount that was added throughout the year that we expect to perform much better and improve our, I would say, contribution from the region in 2020. So we still expect that. We've factored that in our guide for sure, but like I said, overall, we're optimistic that we'll have a better year in EMEA. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to maybe start a little bit with the competitive landscape. Are you guys seeing any sort of shifts there or any other improvement or worsening of the competitors that are out there? Thank you. Hi, Jonathan. I would say no major change in the last year. Probably slightly more competitive rip and replace that we've been seeing and we gave some examples on the call, but still most of the opportunities out there, I would say, more than 60% of the businesses is greenfield opportunities. And so we see the same competition. And I would say that our leadership is even stronger with our new Alero, which is a very exciting use case for the entire customer base and every prospect, and with our strategic investment in AAM especially for dynamic applications. So I would say, strengthened -- a stronger leadership position and no change from the competitors themselves. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open. A question; as we unpack the guidance for the coming year and the implied acceleration that is in the guidance relative to Q1 versus kind of the total year yet being mindful of increasing SaaS, curious what else might drive that acceleration outside of the comps. And with regard to the SaaS revenue. Is that one year upfront? Is that multiple years? I'm just curious what the free cash flow or the operating cash flow per year guidance impact might be? Thanks. And that was one question, but two parts. Yes. So, Rob, I'll answer the second one because I still remember it. Yes, basically in terms of the average duration on the SaaS, we're getting around 18 to 20 months so far historically on those contracts. And I think your first question was related to expanding from the Q1 guide to the full year and the opportunity. And absolutely, when we look at the full year, we're looking at the full year pipeline and the opportunity and the investments that we made towards the back half of last year and going into the first quarter of this year. And I think as Udi talked about, the competitive environment is still the same. There hasn't been a major transition there. The market is still growing, and we're seeing numbers certainly at the 20% level. And we feel comfortable that we'll really be able to stay with that and take the opportunity during the year. And we're pleased with the full-year guidance of 19% at the midpoint and be able to do that as well with 22% operating margin. Great. Thank you. Welcome. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the questions. I have a cash flow question as well, so for you Josh. Appreciate the annual color on the cash flow guidance, but as I think about how the business mix is shifting, you're adding more subscriptions into the mix, you have seen general trend towards annual invoicing, I'm wondering why the cash flow guidance of 5% to 10% higher than net income margins is still sort of intact relative to history. If you can just help me unpack some of the drivers and then certainly the drivers in deferred revenue growth there that would be really helpful. Thank you. Yes. So I think that again we're still talking about that piece of the SaaS and the subscription being under 10% of the expected revenue this year. So we still see the overwhelming majority coming from perpetual with our maintenance and services component. So we, at this point, don't really see that as going to impact it outside of that range, and we are getting more than a year contract on average from our subscription business, which in some cases are paid annually but also still in many cases are paid full upfront, even if it's two or three years. So we're still comfortable with that. The deferred revenue growth from 2019 is still the majority coming from our maintenance and support contracts. The overwhelming majority is still above 90%. But again as we creep into one more percent and one more percent of SaaS and subscription business, it does -- it can impact certainly when we look at revenue from a quarter-to-quarter perspective. And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Go ahead please Your line is open. Okay, thank you. Hi, guys. So this was a record net new logos quarter, as you pointed out earlier. How much of this is a function of the mid-market rollout in 2019 as compared with having stronger advisory relationships and more direct sales capacity as well? I would say there was -- hi, Gregg, Udi here. I would say there was definitely contribution from the new mid-market motion. But a lot of these were enterprise accounts and really executing on our global reach to the enterprise. Yes, we're super excited about the contribution of the advisory muscle. Some of that is new logos, but a lot of that is also bringing existing customers into program. So it's a combination of reaching into the mid-market, but we were there before, but it has accelerated. But a lot of these new logos are in our sweet spot enterprise. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. Can you discuss more global federal and US federal and the contribution of US federal and then the strength -- what kind of strength you're seeing into 2020? Thank you. Absolutely. Hi, Catharine. We talked a lot about it following a record Q3 in '19 where we really saw our federal programs kick in and privileged access management as part of CDM and DEFEND-funded programs where we're definitely in plan to expand a lot of the existing customer base within federal but then -- but also it's still very much greenfield on both core privileged access management and definitely with our growth engines, Application Access Manager, our Alero, our Endpoint Privilege Management. So it's an important part of the business and that was just on federal.
In the rest of the world, I think we saw -- we talked to a lot that it's becoming our second -- global government is often our second or third largest vertical in a given quarter, and that includes the fact that we sell globally APJ governments, European governments, Canada, on top of the US federal. So it's definitely part of our opportunity. And I think the beauty is that we invested -- we have the certifications in place. We continue to invest and the team is going after it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz from Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Udi, you provided some interesting customer commentary on the call. With application credentials in AAM, are you seeing greater interest here in centralized application and user security management? And how do you think about the AAM opportunity within the installed base? Sorry, could you just repeat the first part? Yes. It's are you seeing greater interest in sort of centralized application and user security management within the base? Yes. So absolutely, I think, the motion with AAM is super-exciting because there's a security driver and there's a digital transformation driver. The suite now really includes our solution for legacy applications but a bigger and growing motion is our solution for dynamic application management. And yes, that's very often driven in both directions. Chief Security Officer and the security team wants a centralized way of managing these credentials and rolling out applications in a secure way, and developers just want to get the work done. So we invested a lot in making it very easy for the developer but also this connection of the AAM to our full platform so that Chief Security Officer sees the benefits of a holistic solution for both applications and humans. And so, yes, it's an important growth engine for CyberArk. It had a record year. It was 11% of 2019 license revenue, and it's an important piece for us. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Yes, Tal. Okay. Hope you can hear me now. I want to ask a question about the revenues. One of the answers you gave, Josh, was about the growth in recurring revenues versus perpetual. And I'm trying to understand if it's the same product that is now being shifted from perpetual to recurring and this is why the decline is related to the shift in the business model. The question is whether you see any slowdown in the core business? And then not related to that, you see growth in new types of businesses and net-net, you're growing nicely, or that it's more just shift in the business model, which has different implications for the core business? Yes, so first of all in 2019, the shift to the recurring business was primarily around the Endpoint Privilege Manager, which has always been one of our kind of growth engines and faster growing off smaller base product. So it really wasn't a move from the core biz. And as we kind of look into 2020, we'll see some movement with the Privilege Cloud SaaS, but particularly to incremental group of customers for what we're seeing to the commercial markets that might have bought on-prem subscription and maybe to some larger -- to smaller enterprises. We kind of always -- and Alero, which is in for 2020 as well, again, we expect that to grow faster than the business as it's a new product. So I think overall when we look at the business, every year over the last several years, we are always kind of looking at kind of what we called in the past, even emerging products like our Endpoint Privilege Manager, our Application Access Manager as growing faster than the business in general. And we don't necessarily -- and this year we have the Privilege Cloud as well. We don't necessarily see a slowdown with our core business. We see it growing with the market. Got it. And I know I only have one question. But I wanted to ask, if you don't mind, to repeat the reasons for the lower operating margin. You went over it quickly. Thanks. Yes. So there is a -- if you take the 6% on the operating margin, half of that is sales and market 2% would be -- 2% of the 6% would be R&D, which some of it is FX and then 1% on cost of goods related to our continued investment in deploying cloud infrastructure. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Go ahead please. Your line is open. All right, thank you. So I had a question on your billings. Q4 typically is heavy maintenance renewals, but it looks like billings decelerated down to about 16.5% in Q4, below the 20% market growth rate that you had mentioned. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether renewal rates may have changed, or if there were any other factors impacting that growth rate? Thanks. No. Andrew, renewal rates are still at the 90%-plus level and deferred revenues grew by 27% year-on-year. So there was nothing remarkable that I would point out. I'd have to kind of really dig a lot deeper to see if there was something seasonal in the quarter. Okay, thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on an earlier question on the macro environment and how it's factored in the guidance. Should we expect EMEA revenue trends to improve from the pace of 2019, or should we expect current trend lines just to continue? We're just trying to clarify something that I thought I heard you say earlier in the Q&A. Yes, I'll take it. This is Udi. Yes, we expect them to improve in the back half of the year as we get returns from investments from hiring we did at the end of this year and -- at the end of '19 and hiring we are doing in the first -- from the start. So yes. Got it. And that's baked into the guidance? Yes. And as we think -- when we think about the macro, obviously, that's not in our control, and we're coming out of '19 seeing that. So that's baked into the first quarter guidance. And as we kind of move forward, we'll see -- we'll be able to adjust. And it also has a component in the full-year guidance as well. Okay. I got it, got it. That makes sense. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the duration of your contracts. If I look at fiscal '17 and fiscal '18, I think the duration went up quite a bit based on the long-term deferred mix. It steadied in fiscal '19. How should we think about duration in fiscal '20? Do you think the long-term deferred mix remains at the same level or should that change in fiscal '20? Yes, I think at this point we don't see any evidence of it necessarily changing behavior between what we've seen historically and 2020. But I think the SaaS contracts we see will be shorter duration and the maintenance we see as combination of one year and multiple years. It's hard for us to really say that it's going to change dramatically. One thing that we are seeing more of is that in the multiple year contracts there is -- even on the maintenance, there is more of a shift to annual payments to some degree. So that would make it longer term, but I think right now, I would take the trend that we saw in 2019 and build off that. Got it. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. One, I'm just curious, what are you assuming in terms of AAM and EPM contribution in 2020. Will we start to see those approach 20% contribution? Then secondly, I understand Asia did well. But do you have any reason to think that some of the virus issues are going to be causing any disruption there? Okay. Yes, hi, Erik. I'll take the first one. We're not going to guide by product, but we absolutely do expect AAM and EPM to grow even possibly faster than the business. However, on the flipside, we're seeing, certainly on the EPM, it's going to be on a SaaS basis. So the average deal sizes will be smaller, and it will be recognized ratably. So we can't necessarily say how that's going to shake out from the revenue perspective, but we do see them becoming bigger and bigger, connected to more and more deals. And certainly from a opportunity perspective even grow faster than the business. And I'll take the question on APJ. So obviously our number one priority is our employees in the region and their families, and part of the regions they've taken steps to reduce travel. We're watching it closely. China is a very small percentage of our business. So at this point, we don't see it having a major impact on our results. Josh, can I just come back? Is there a goal or a target of getting contribution from both AAM and EPM to 20%-ish at any point? Or can you give us just kind of some color around where that might go? Obviously, we have our own internal goals of growing those pieces of the business, and we have overlay teams that are focused on those specific sites of the business. But Erik, I don't want to get -- we're not going to get to a position where we'll guide specifically to those products because it would just be too hard for us to do that. But absolutely, we expect it to be a bigger piece of -- a bigger -- more and more opportunities each year. And I would say, I think the beauty is that all products can win. We have such a greenfield in pure privileged access management and the customer now has the ability to, especially as we go down mid-market, they can consume even privileged access management as a cloud service, which is an exciting offering for us. And the growth engines can behave like growth engines on top of that, both for new customers and add-ons. So the way we look at it internally is all products winning and making sure that the growth engines are at a high pace. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yako with Cowen. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. With Matt taking over as the head of the sales organization, anything you can share around his strategy or new initiatives he hopes to implement in 2020? Yes, absolutely. First and foremost, I would say Matt came, I'm excited and we're excited to have Matt join here, and he was super pleased to see the quality of the team, the quality of the customer base and the market opportunity. So he is staying focused on retaining the things that have worked, and then we were very selective in bringing Matt on board so that he will really help us build the best path to a $1 billion and beyond scalable organization. And he is focused on those things that have to do with scaling the business.
I'll name a few, but one of his first priority is on the channel front further strengthening and leveraging our global channels. I mentioned the advisories attending our sales kickoff. We just really have the partners here to build this even bigger. Another one, and he has tremendous opportunity there is in customer success is how do we refine our customer success, one, for scale and also for stronger cross-functional alignment like you need in a company with increasing services-oriented offering, the more SaaS solutions we have out there. And there are additional elements around our demand generation engine, refining our market segmentation that he is working on, and so yes, we're very excited to have Matt on board and just work with us to take this to the next level. Great. Thank you. Thank you. The last question comes from the line of Howard Smith with First Analysis. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you for squeezing me in here. So I just wanted to follow up on some of your mid-enterprise initiatives. I know it's still small, early days. But could you talk a little bit about whether the competitive environment you see there is different than your traditional set of competitors that you've talked about? And also in terms of go-to-market strategy, is that purely kind of a channel approach that's helping support those strong channel numbers or do you target some of those direct? Yes, absolutely, Howard. I would say that mid-market we do encounter the smaller players in PAM that don't really play on the enterprise front like [indiscernible] but are seeing great wins, especially now that we have the optionality to offer the SaaS solution to that market. So the go-to-market is very much leading with -- especially in 2020, leading with Privilege Cloud, so software-as-a-service solution for PAM to this market. And you're right, more of a channel focus to this market segment. Great, thank you, and congrats on a great year. Thank you very much. Thanks, Howard. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Udi Mokady for some closing remarks. Thank you, James. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees who contributed to CyberArk's record results in 2019. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would like to hand the conference over to one of our speakers for today, Ms. Erica Smith. Ma’am please go ahead. Thank you, Angel. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's first quarter 2020 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer.

Also a webcast is available on our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and I want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. We hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe during this extraordinary time. The well-being of our global community remains our first priority and we are continuing to evolve our policies and procedures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for their continued support and agility and dedication in these times. We have a lot of ground to cover today.
My plan is to, start with the Idaptive acquisition and how it directly aligns with our mission; outline our response to the COVID-19 pandemic; provide brief details on the first quarter and recent trends; and lastly, review our priorities for the rest of h the year before turning it over to Josh.
This morning, we announced the acquisition of Idaptive, an industry-leading identity-as-a-service provider, which includes AI powered single sign-on, adaptive multi-factor authentication and zero trust functionality. We are excited about the technology and the team as we work together to deliver the industry’s only modern, identity security platform.
In speaking with customers, they recognize that the provisioning of privileges, even temporarily is creating a pathway for attackers to execute sophisticated attacks and in general is expanding the attack surface. Together with Idaptive, we will better secure conditional privileged used cases and also extend our solutions to adjacent identities that have various levels of privileged access.
If we look broadly, we are seeing privileged access and activities proliferate across all identities, driven by digital transformation, cloud and automation initiatives. We believe our approach to managing these identities with privileged access management at its foundation will significantly reduce risks, simplify operations and improve business agility for customers.
With this acquisition, we also had another SaaS offering to our portfolio, increased our recurring revenue and expand our total addressable market to sell into the $25 billion access management market. We welcome all of Idaptive’s employees, leadership team and Danny Kibel, Idaptive’s CEO to the CyberArk family and are looking forward to learning from each other.
I would love to talk more about our excitement and vision for Idaptive, but we have limited time today and I’ll move on how our COVID-19 response is progressing. We delivered uninterrupted customer support, while transitioning our staff to remote locations providing 24/7 service and ensuring customers and partners had the resources required to help keep their businesses up and running.
We are also offering Alero at no cost into June. Delivered as a SaaS solution, Alero offers quick time to value, enabling remote employees and contractors to securely access CyberArk through biometric authentication without a VPN. Our IT organization worked tirelessly to ensure all of our employees were able to work securely from home and as we were closing our global offices in March.
Our Security Services group has done a great job adjusting and is delivering all services remotely, including consulting, implementation, program delivery, red teaming, cloud andeducation services, and our sales team has always worked from remote location and is quickly adapting to virtual engagements while marketing has shifted to digital programs.
Our longstanding relationships with existing customers have been easier to transition to virtual interactions. With – we have established a virtual sales motion, that is evolving with meetings, demos and proof-of-concepts happening online. We are building trust with these organizations and demonstrating the value, security and business efficiency of our solutions.
In some ways, we are benefiting from having no physical boundaries, because digital marketing and virtual events are more efficient, scalable and allow us to extend our reach. Our quick response, operational agility, and focus enabled us to deliver results in line with or exceeding all guided metrics for the first quarter with total revenue of $107 million, non-GAAP operating income of $22 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 per share.
At the end of the quarter, some companies began making shorter-term decisions due to the uncertainty of COVID-19, which affected our license revenue in the first quarter. Overall, we were pleased to see the strong deal flow at the end of Q1. We also accelerated pipeline generation significantly late in March demonstrating that privileged access management is a top priority.
In fact, we signed nearly a 116 new logos in the quarter and add-on revenue from existing customers grew by about 25%. From a fundamental perspective, the drivers of our business early in Q1, in today’s COVID-19 world, and longer term, remain essentially unchanged. But COVID-19 is accelerating many of the themes contributing to the long-term growth of privileged access management.
Our customers have immediate needs as they transition and secure business operations and remote employees. Customers added laptops at unprecedented pace and employees are accessing corporate resources from any and everywhere. This has not only expanded the attack surface, but it has placed incredible strain on organizations, especially IT and security.
In response, we are seeing growing demand for our SaaS portfolio, which aligns directly with this new business paradigm. We are looking forward to adding Idaptive to this mix.
As an example, late in the first quarter, a large U.S. financial services company turned to CyberArk to secure its remote employees, significantly expanding SaaS users for Endpoint Privilege Manager. EPM locks down the endpoint, provides application control and improves IT efficiency by reducing helpdesk call volume.
EPM also stops ransomware progression and we have already seen an uptick in ransomware attacks like Mace that is used to encrypt and extirpate data.
The long-term fundamentals for EPM are strong and our pipeline is growing as customers secure new endpoints and strengthen security controls. Momentum also continue to build for our Privilege Cloud. In one example, a utility company in the UK undergoing its digital transformation is moving off of a competitive solution to Privilege Cloud and became a new CyberArk customer in Q1.
We have incredible interest in our Alero solution including the COVID-19 free subscription. A European transportation company who participated in the free offer recognized the SaaS factor value and signed a longer-term commitment for more than 1500 global users. Alero combines zero trust access biometric authentications and just in time provisioning to allow customers to easily and securely access CyberArk without VPN.
When combined with Idaptive’s IDAAS offering, we believe Alero will be that much more powerful. Securing applications is at the core of digital transformation strategies, which are only accelerating with COVID-19.
We had a strong quarter for AAM, with a number of great wins including a cross-sell example at a Federal agency customer who will secure secrets for the development of its most critical applications running in Red Hat OpenShift.
Core Privilege Access Security is the lion share of our business today and it is even more relevant in organizations designing their enterprise security strategy in the COVID world. We saw excellent acceleration in customer expansion in Q1, which reinforces this point. In a seven-figure deal, a pharmaceutical customer implemented the next phase of the CyberArk program with Core Pass.
All business users and remote offices will now access applications and network resources through CyberArk. With the abrupt business changes in March, applications and infrastructure were deployed without full testing or security. Attackers are being more aggressive exploiting this situation.
In this elevated threat landscape, pipeline generation across our solutions accelerated late in Q1 as companies realize they needed to adjust their past strategy to accommodate these changes.
There has also been an uptick in our remediation services engagements, while we are not a remediation firm, securing Privileged Access is one of the first steps in gaining control over a breach environment. Our labs team accelerated its work to analyze new attack vectors and vulnerabilities created by the remote work environment.
We recently published the team’s findings that a motivated attacker could easily launch a widespread data theft campaign using an image file in Microsoft teams. Working closely with Microsoft, the immediate risk associated with this attack vector was quickly mitigated. At the RSA Conference back in February, we met with hundreds of customers, prospects and partners who reaffirmed three main things.
First, PAM is the foundation of a company enhance its security program. Second, we have a long runway for growth, and third, the sprawl of Privileged Access and activity is a major pinpoint and security concern. This feedback from RSA strengthened our commitment to deliver a modern identity security platform.
Over the last few weeks, we have critically analyzed our business and I want to share with you some of the major risks and opportunities over the next few quarters. Early in the second quarter, we have continued to win new logos and we have had a lot of new business activity including significant pipeline generation. However, we expect the new business environment to be more challenging near-term.
We have established a virtual sales motion and the team is building trust with prospects. We are well positioned, but this is a new process for both us and the prospects. We also anticipate business will slow down in certain industries that are in survival mode, like retail, travel, and oil and gas.
On the opportunity side, we sell into the enterprise and have strong established relationships with a roster of nearly 5500 loyal customers including many of the world’s leading companies and added about 500 more customers from Idaptive today. We also benefit from the diversification of our business across verticals, geographies and delivery.
While verticals, I mentioned have been impacted more acutely, we have mature opportunities and the growing pipeline in banking, insurance, healthcare, global government, pharmaceuticals and utilities that are less affected. We also have a broad portfolio of solutions that are aligned directly with the current environment like Endpoint Privilege Manager, Alero and Privilege Cloud.
Application Access Manager secures digital transformation initiatives and Core Privilege Access protects against advanced attacks.
Lastly, we have a truly global footprint, which will help cushion against the potential volatility as economies open. For the remainder of the year, our R&D team will deliver innovation in our cloud and Core Privilege Access solutions.
Sales and marketing will strengthen our virtual sales function and digital programs. We will focus on delivering high levels of customer and partner satisfaction, while enhancing our customer success team.
And lastly, the entire company is focused on the smooth integration of Idaptive. In this new world, people and technology are more tightly woven together than ever, expanding the attack surface. Security and PAM are not discretionary spending, particularly as attackers become more aggressive.
April and early May have been strong. We are pleased with the close rates and the number of opportunities progressing through this funnel is increasing for both new and add-on business.
While we face near-term uncertainty, we also have an opportunity to strengthen the company and emerge stronger. As a result, we plan to continue to hire for key positions and invest in the business, but we will do it the CyberArk way, balancing our investments against our top-line expectations, which Josh will discuss in a few minutes.
The acquisition of Idaptive positions CyberArk to deliver the industry’s only modern identity security platform, further separating us from the competition.
We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and are confident that our leadership position, strong market fundamentals, experienced leadership team and long-term strategy will position the company to accelerate growth when the business and environment stabilizes.
I will now turn the call over to Josh to discuss our financials and outlook for the second quarter. Josh? Yes. Thanks, Udi. I want to reiterate what Udi said at the beginning of the call and wish everyone health and safety during the unprecedented time. For the first quarter, total revenue was $106.8 million, up 11% from $95.9 million in the first quarter last year.
Since we typically close around 60% of our business in the last month including a high percentage in the last two weeks of the quarter, we were pleased to deliver revenue in line with guidance even with the rapid decline in the business environment during March due to COVID-19.
License revenue was $51.7 million, compared to $51.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. As the selling environment changed, we did see some deals cancelled and certain deals were downsized late in the first quarter.
Even with the uncertainty, we closed a tremendous amount of deal volume late in Q1. Add-on business increased to 79% of license revenue in the first quarter, that’s compared to 63% from add-on business for the full year 2019.
We were very pleased that recurring SaaS and subscription revenue more than doubled in the first quarter to 15% of license and that’s compared with 7% in the first quarter of last year. Subscription revenue represented 10% of license, driven by increased demand for Core Pass and Application Access Manager as a subscription, up significantly from 4% of license in the first quarter last year.
In addition, we were pleased with the performance of our SaaS portfolio including our Endpoint Privilege Manager, Privileged Cloud and a layer of solutions. SaaS revenue increased to about 5% of license revenue, that’s up from 3% of license in the first quarter last year. The mix toward SaaS and subscription impacted or lowered our revenue by about $5 million in the first quarter of 2020.
That effectively impacts our license growth rate by 10%. To give you more color on the product side, Application Access Manager and Endpoint Privilege Manager, each represented about 7% of license revenue. Maintenance and services revenue was $55.2 million, growing 24% from the 44.7 million last year, and our Professional Services revenue associated with this line was $9.1 million or 8% of total revenue.
Geographically, the Americas generated $69.9 million in revenue, increasing 13% year-on-year and representing 65% of total revenue. EMEA grew 8% year-on-year to $27.4 million or 26% of total revenue and APJ generated $9.5 million in revenue, increasing 11%, compared to the first quarter of last year and that represented 9% of total revenue.
In terms of the verticals, global government was our fastest growing vertical in the first quarter. We also experienced strong year-on-year growth in insurance, pharma, transportation and energy. As we mentioned, we expect COVID-19 related macro and business challenges to persist in segments of energy, retail and travel.
For additional color, last year in 2019, energy was about 7% of total bookings, retail was 5% and transportation and travel represented additional 3% of the business.
All the line items of the P&L will now be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $92.5 million, or 87% gross margin, that’s compared to 88% gross margin in the first quarter last year as a result of the lower license mix including the increase in SaaS revenue in the first quarter of 2020.
If you look our P&L, R&D expense grew by 30% year-on-year to $18.3 million. Sales and marketing increased 19% to $44.7 million and that includes $500,000 in non-recurring cancellation charges related to transitioning our global customer events to virtual. G&A expense increased 5% year-on-year to $8 million.
In total, operating expenses for the first quarter increased 20% to $70.9 million and that’s compared with $59.3 million for the first quarter last year. Our operating income was ahead of our guidance at $21.5 million or 20% operating margins. And as a reminder, over 70% of our operating expenses are related to headcount.
In January and February, we were executing well against our aggressive hiring plan and we ended the first quarter with 1490 employees worldwide, that’s up from1204, a year ago or more than a 100 employees since December 31, 2019. Of our total employee count, 696 employees are in sales and marketing, compared to 567 at the end of first quarter last year.
Much of the outperformance in our operating income in the first quarter was related to our deliberate slowdown in hiring in March, lower travel expenses, as well as variable compensation.
Net income was $19.6 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the first quarter, compared to $21.5 million or $0.56 per diluted share for the first quarter last year.
I wanted to take this opportunity to outline where we stand financially. We have a durable business model that generates significant cash flow from operations. In the first quarter, cash flow was $33.8 million or a 32% cash flow margin and we are pleased that the margin exceeded our forecast of five to ten percentage points above our non-GAAP net income margin of 18.3% in the first quarter.
This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we ended up the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. This cash balance will be impacted by the approximately $70 million related to the acquisition of Idaptive.
We also increased deferred revenue by 22% year-on-year to $111 million. Approximately, 5% of the total deferred revenue related to recurring SaaS contracts. And this compares to $171 million at March 31last year and 3% of total deferred related to SaaS.
Turning to our outlook. We have a robust mature pipeline, more sales people given the high earning in Q1 and believe we have adjusted well to the new remote selling environment. However, we are only about eight weeks in the major effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, global shutdowns, business uncertainty and resulting economic downturn.
At this point, while there is positive momentum and a real business need for PAM, we have limited visibility into our customers’ decision-making processes and lack data on close and conversion rates in this environment. As we mentioned, certain industries have been impacted harder than others and we expect customers make shorter- term decisions, which could lower deal sizes.
In addition, we are seeing more budget and project scrutiny which we can believe will lengthen sales cycles. Our solution is very sticky and while we have a strong renewal rates, we do anticipate that the current uncertainty may have some moderate impacts.
All these factors make it difficult to predict the timing of when deals will close. As a result, we are withdrawing revenue and non-operating operating income and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2020.
With that said, the management team remains committed to delivering profitable growth, the more than 100 employees we added in the first quarter position us well for this year, while we intend to hire key roles in the remainder of 2020, we only plan to add about 30 to 35 people in both the second and third quarters.
We will monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and given our high gross margins and that most of our expenses are related to headcount, we have flexibility to adjust our hiring to better align with the top-line as we move through the year. While our cash flow from operations will be impacted by the current economic environment, it is too difficult to forecast to what level.
As a result, while we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year, we are withdrawing the guardrails that we have previously discussed.
We are providing guidance for the second quarter, which reflects our mature pipeline of opportunities with six to nine months sales cycles and our strong deal closing activity for April and May, while still considering the pervasive uncertainty in the market, and changes in the business environment, due to COVID-19.
We have widened the range for second quarter guidance and expect total revenue of between $95 million to $105 million. We anticipate approximately $58 million in maintenance and services revenue for the second quarter. We expect to generate non-GAAP operating income to range between $7 million to $16 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.35.
This assumes between $3.5 million to $4.5 million in additional expenses this quarter related to the approximate 130 people from Idaptive who joined CyberArk today. Our guidance does not assume, one-time integration expenses or any incremental revenue from the acquisition of Idaptive in the second quarter as we have not yet completed the purchase price accounting review.
We estimate 39.4 million weighted average diluted shares and an effective tax rate of about 24% for the second quarter. Idaptive is a great acquisition. The company brings a world-class, IDAAS platform and deep identity expertise.
With Idaptive, we are also expanding our portfolio with another SaaS solution, which we expect to more than double, our SaaS AR, adding approximately $16 million to $18 million to our $13 million AR from existing SaaS solutions.
We believe that with our strong balance sheet, powerful financial model, and balanced approach to growth and profitability, CyberArk will be able to successfully navigate the COVID-19 situation and will be well-positioned as the environment improves.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia. Please go ahead. Okay. Hey. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. I hope everyone is doing well. Maybe first for you Udi, congrats on the deal. Can you just talk a little bit more about the strategy for Idaptive a little bit? It sounds like, it’s potentially the same buyer as your core PAM solution. But how do you sort of envision Privilege Identity and perhaps we’ll call, non-Privilege Identity, sort of messing together over time. Yes. Thanks, Saket. And good to hear from you and proposal with you as well. First of all, we are very excited. We’ve been working on the strategic process for a while to execute our vision to deliver a modern identity security solution and further take us to be this modern identity security company. We believe that the access issue is a security issue.
We saw proliferation of privileges in the PAM world. We are also seeing credentials as the primarily attack points for the beginning of attack cycles. So, we are taking a security first approach to managing identities.
And with Idaptive, it allows us to cater to the security-oriented enterprise customers that we worked so closely with today and those that want to approach managing identities as a security issue and again from a single, best-in-class vendor.
And of course it will us take us to beyond security, it expands us to securing business users and taking even a bigger part in the digital transformation strategies that our customers ongoing. So beyond the security will also take us to the digital officers, to the CIOs in companies. Got it. That’s really helpful. Maybe for a follow-up for you, Josh, how full commentary there at the – in terms of the ARR kind of addition that Idaptive brings. Can you just dig into the profile just a little bit more? Particularly interested in billings here and growth rate.
So, can you talk a little bit about what are the billings terms here in terms of annual advance versus sort of multi-year upfront? What’s sort of the average contract duration and what sort of the growth rate that Idaptive have seen over time, sort of broad brushes? Sorry, there was a lot there. Does that make sense? Yes, it makes sense and you know, let’s remember, this is very new. I think we are about 15 hours after close formally. So we are still absorbing. But I think that, those questions are pretty straightforward. I mentioned today already in the call that we are looking at adopting another very quickly, $16 million to $18 million of ARR already.
I think with regard to their selling patterns, what we say, what really saw in the data is that their contracts are roughly just over a year on average. So, call it, a 14 to 15 months on average is kind of what they’ve been experiencing and when they build, they typically are building one year upfront. So, they are collecting one year at a time.
And with regard to the growth rate, I think that’s something that, they are pretty impressed into the game being solo for the last year and a half as an organization and I know in the last year it’s been certainly into the double-digit slope. But I think, let’s – I think we have talked a lot more about the growth expectations in the next couple of quarters as we absorbed that into CyberArk. And your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you for taking questions. And I trust you are healthy and safe. Josh, I have… Operator, is everything good? Yes, [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi everybody. Hope everybody is doing fine. I had a question on Idaptive, also building on Saket’s prior question. So, Udi, that transaction completely makes sense, completely in line with prior transactions, whether it's Conjur, Viewfinity, others, price, people, culture, product, et cetera, correct me if I am wrong.
I imagine you knew some of the Idaptive team from their prior Centrify days. Were you targeting just the IDAAS piece that will spun out – well, if I am not mistaken and does that get you into elevated competition, maybe with some other various providers as the as the swimming lanes within the broader identity arena gradually glaring? Yes. Hi, Shaul and great to hear from you. Yes, they were – Idaptive were spun out of Centrify before and we were laser-focused and interested in Idaptive as a standalone company, because it’s been a growth engine focused on creating a modern platform for Identity-as-a-Service and we wanted our foray into this market to be with fresh and a modern platform to execute on our strategy and we are very excited about the team.
A lot of the team members are actually identity experts. But the fact that many of them are super familiar with the PAM market is an extra bonus. And in our conversations, it’s going to make the integration even more powerful as we understand the both markets.
With regards to, I would say, extended competition, we are taking a security first approach in this and focused on our enterprise customers. But we will continue to integrate and work alongside many of our partners in identity that especially with our joint partners. And so, I think in enterprises, we find – can work with multiple vendors.
We'll focus on really the core Privilege Access Management expanding to adjacent identities and we'll continue to integrate with various partners. And competition is reality in identity like in most tech verticals. And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Udi, your commentary with regard to buying centers and the targeting of customers that are managing identities as a security issue, how fragmented is this market relative to buying centers and how much the is the thesis that you see convergence over time versus kind of where things are right now? Curious on that front. Rob, it’s a great question, because I would say, the identity spaces is a gradual convergence, and it's not happening overnight. Here in CyberArk, we wanted to the future proof our leadership position and like I said earlier and do that while entering in with an acquisition of a truly modern platform. So, if you are joining the game, join it with a truly modern platform, but it is early in the convergence.
So, we expect that a subset of customers will already at day one want a unified solution. But, that over time there will be more of a focused approach where the CISO views, the Chief Security Officer would want to manage all identities in a security first approach.
And of course, we tested the water for a while and with close customers and partners and with close customers and partners and many of them were telling us, if CyberArk had it, we would buy from you. And your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question and good to hear all of you. Just shifting the business and what you’re seeing from a pipeline perspective, Udi, you talked about seeing an acceleration in the pipeline in April and into May.
Can you just give us a little bit more color around what was driving that acceleration? And to what extent is that impacted by maybe some more pent-up demand from disruption in March? ... modern environment and also born with security in mind because of... Yes. So, I think, another – good to hear from you, Melissa, as well. I would say that we even saw acceleration in pipeline in those last two weeks of March and into April and May.
I think the importance of that and why we gave it so much attention is of course for the long – the mid and long-term business, but also really puts it up there that Privilege Access Management is one of those high priority programs, especially as companies are being disrupted and moving into a work from home environment and stepping up to digital transformation.
So, really, it was important in that sense. Additional color, I would say, it’s the variety of new prospects, add-on business, and really opportunities coming along. And increased interest in our – and momentum for our SaaS solution. EPM is very much, because that you have many more endpoints right now that are the point of start for the employee, but also for the attacker, increased pipe and demand for our Privilege Cloud and for our Alero.
But like I said earlier, the cross-products, it includes our Core Pass Solutions and we just see it as indicator of the business. When you have to choose, what are you going to do, the - PAM is one of the top priorities for CISOs. Got it. That’s very helpful. And then, one follow-up on the Idaptive acquisition. Udi, could you just maybe give us a little bit more details around how the technology is differentiated? I know you said that, this is going to be targeting a more security-oriented buyer relative to maybe some of the other players in the market. But can you put a finer point around what Idaptive offers from a technology perspective, relative to maybe Okta or Microsoft? Thank you Yes. I think, and like Josh said, it is early and it is a much younger company, but it was both born in the cloud really in the most modern environments. And also born with security in mind, because of their roots coming out of the PAM market.
So, the components are – that they have really include Artificial Intelligence elements to make sure that sessions are analyzed and as they apply a multi-factor authentication and a single sign on, lifecycle management.
They have behavior analytics capabilities. So, in the root, everything is about this – that we need to enable access to these employees, but this access can also be a point of start of attack which is really much the – CyberArk mindset.
And so, I think the customers who trust CyberArk with securing privilege access would now be able to make sure that they are also blessing regular user access with the type of controls and security mindset that we deliver. And of course, we need to integrate this together. We are going to integrate them also with our Alero, and it's going to be very powerful. And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I am curious what the sales coverage ratio was through the March quarter seems. You had such good success and what’s going to be the strategy given the economic environment in terms of managing that in the coming quarters? All right Sterling, it’s Josh. So, we actually had very – very strong coverage in terms of numbers for the first quarter. And not only did we come out of the year in 2019 with capacity to meet a 2020, let’s call it a non-COVID year. We also continued to hire into the first quarter. So, overall, the capacity for the – we are bringing on already in the first quarter is for the second half of this year and already into 2021.
So, I mean, basically, the coverage was very high – higher than usual even. And basically, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, we will be actually looking at – we’ve reduced already starting at the end of March, kind of hiring trends towards the end of the first quarter. We are looking to probably at the incremental growth of 25 to 30 people, each of Q2 and Q3.
And that’s going to be a lever based on how we see the economic environment changing. I mean, one of the things we are also tracking very closely with regard to our coverage because, we want to make sure that we come out of here – come out as strong as possible once the external issues are behind us, is attracted our pipeline, which Udi talked about really has been growing very nicely and that’s presenting us the future – that’s presenting us kind of with where we want to have the coverage going forward, which is why we are very happy to keep building as we speak.
... Idaptive transaction, can you share with us the integration time line... Okay. And then, on Idaptive, the $16 million t0 $18 million, is that a full year runrate? Or is that what you are expecting to come to CyberArk for the remainder of 2020 and then more specifically, what are you expecting the acquisition to contribute here in the June quarter? Yes, the $16 million to $18 million is what we would be immediately acquiring in contractual AAR already today to add to the $13 million SaaS AR that we already have. And what was your second question, Sterling? How much revenue would you specifically expect in the June quarter from the acquisition? Yes. So, yes, still, we haven’t even – we are just starting now the PPA, because as we said earlier, this deal closed less than 15 hours ago. So, we don’t anticipate - right now, we are not building in any significant revenue for the quarter – for the six weeks of this quarter based on what the PPA is expected to be. That makes sense. Thank you guys. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Moskowitz. Please go ahead. Thank you. And, hi, Udi. Hi, Josh. So, regarding the Idaptive transaction, can you share with us the integration timeline on delivering an AI-based solution across PAM and IDAAS? And then also, since Idaptive is a SaaS model, I was curious if this transaction could accelerate a transition to a subscription model for your core business, how should we thinking about that? Hi, Greg. Udi here. I’ll start. I would say that, we are working on the integration. We really plan to unveil more of the joint offering story in our July impact events which has moved into be a virtual trade show and put the systems together, again, through the due diligence we’ve already mapped out a strong connection points immediately – immediate things like multi-factor authentications to our – to the CyberArk customers and leveraging their AI platform in conjunction with our threat analytics, but there is more to come. There is going to be integration with our Alero as well.
With regards to the subscription transition, I would say, we are very pleased that this will basically double our SaaS ARR and we’ve seen the momentum grow on our SaaS products. And so, we are executing on this strategy that we call to infuse the business with SaaS and now including Idaptive.
But we are not undergoing a subscription transition at this time. But we regularly evaluate the demand, our pricing and – again, this infusion is working. And our next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz. Please go ahead. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. And I hope you both are well. With Idaptive, have you contemplated any impacts here on partnerships within the C3 Alliance? And then, just more broadly, as we sort of push forward here, how do you think about your philosophy about M&A versus partnership as you look to the future? Yes, Gur, great to hear from you, as well. So, obviously, we are super passionate about our C3 Alliance. We’ve put a lot of energy behind it and the field partnerships are very important for us. So, yes, we put a lot of thoughts into it. We have the strategic initiative to future proof CyberArk as spaces converge.
And hence the decision to expand from Privilege Access to covering broader elements of access, but in our unique way in security. We really believe that we can continue many of our field partnerships with identity players. For example, if you take Microsoft, the one of the unique attributes of Idaptive is, it does not force the customer to choose the directory and migrate from a Microsoft active directory.
So, we can come and piece and really complement what our customers are doing with Microsoft. And we are probably having those conversations as we speak now. This is so fresh. I think similarly with Pink, we have a good relationship and I think we will find those use cases that we complement each other in the enterprise.
On top of that, the C3 is really – C3 Alliance is really broad and includes other elements like DevOps, partners – and our partnership with Red Hat and there are so many other flavors that of course will continue to be super strong. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. I am glad to hear everyone is well on the call. Maybe, Udi, if I could follow-up on Idaptive, as well, I think the presentation you have indicates that they have over 500 customers. Maybe just a sense of how much overlap there is in that customer base with the profile is, and the potential opportunity for you to penetrate those and maybe in an accelerated rate? Yes. Great to hear from you as well. Yes, they have about 500 customers. The overlap is actually relatively low about 30 – about 30 accounts. And so, there is an opportunity to go after the rest of those accounts and of course, in the coming days, the teams will be partnering and looking at what are the best ways to do that.
We are even more excited obviously about taking them to our 5500 customers and the opportunity there. We think that’s even bigger force, especially given our very tight relationship with our customer base. And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho. Please go ahead. Hi. I just wanted to maybe start out with understanding a little bit of better color around the Alero free offering and maybe some of the opportunity that you see there, particularly around conversion rates as well? Yes, absolutely. I think first of all, we came out of it from doing the right thing. And I think, like many companies, that was the mindset is, okay, our customers are all deploying and trying to land on their feet in this environment. And what are they going to need to do? They are going to need to enable their employees to access their IT infrastructure from remote.
And so, Alero was very much born to enable remote vendor access. But if your employees are remote, they are exactly in that kind of a situation. So instead of – so the right thing to do was to give a long, free trial of Alero that really solve their day one and day 30 and day 60 issue for our customers to deploy and allow their employees to get access to CyberArk remotely.
And obviously, we gave some examples doing the right thing pays off and it was much, much appreciated. And we saw a growing pipeline of Alero I would say interest. And I don’t have conversion rates ready for you now. But I would say, it's early - and it’s early in the process. But it's been a successful campaign. And we'll probably know more in a few quarters. And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bartus. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. And maybe for both Udi, and Josh. Just wondering if you guys can comment on the competitive landscape. Any changes either traditional players emerging stronger under the new ownership that many of them have, or even players like Okta moving into your space a bit more. And maybe you can just discuss if there has been any change in win rates in this environment? Thanks. Obviously, I think this environment actually creates a differentiation between, I think vendors that are strong and can really ensure their customers that they are going to be there for the long run and folks who have a shorter runway. So, we believe that even before Idaptive, we've built an even – a strong position.
Just a report a week ago from KuppingerCole put us as the leader in the PAM space really a fresh report there. And they want the company that can give them the 24/7 support global reach. So, I would say, in these times, it's actually differentiated us further from other players in PAM and probably no significant change in win rates, but really in a good place. And your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. Udi, could you give a little more color on how you've transitioned this team to a virtual sales process? And how that has impacted your close rate? Thanks. Absolutely, Catherine. So, first of all, I was really – and I told them this many times, because we do much more communicating than ever. I was super pleased with how the team adapted quickly into this environment. We've already had, of course, the sales organization is globally spread and it was kind of used to this remote environment. But we’ve had to have other departments like R&D and deploy.
I think with our global presence, we were kind of able to see a little bit into the future, because we saw kind of the – our Singapore offices and how they responded, then we saw Israel and the local government regulations and kind of had a heads up on what's coming into the U.S. and got ready for that. So, I would say really minimal disruption to all employee productivity and especially the sales.
We did see, as we mentioned at the end of Q1, we did see that it was some deals were harder to close, especially large new business deals or some deals were shrinking in size. But we looked at it closely and they all stayed in the pipeline. And so, things were closing including seven-figure deals, including really in the last two weeks of the quarter.
And things closed early into Q2 and remained in the pipe. So, we feel like the team adjusted really well and everything that also Josh, and I mentioned here is, we are very pleased with the pipeline buildup and the activity levels. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just a follow-up on your prior question regarding sales coverage. I appreciate your efforts to control spending. But I was just wondering if you are slowing hiring on sales reps now, would this have an impact on your calendar 2021 growth trajectory, sort of exacerbating the COVID impact that we are seeing right now? Sorry. I didn't hear the last part, Andrew? I said, if you slow hiring now on sales reps, which presumably will take twelve months to reach full productivity. Would this have an impact on your calendar 2021 growth trajectory, sort of making the COVID impact or extending the COVID impact into next year? Okay. Thanks. I get it. Well, actually I think we're in a good position, because we - as I said earlier in the call, we actually ended 2019 with the right capacity for 2020. And so, as we add the new coverage in 2020 in the first quarter, and we are not – well – that's a better position, as well as we go hopefully to a post-COVID world environment.
And the truth is that, we have a lever over the next nine months. And we're continuing to be prudent, but certainly choosing to invest where necessary, so that we're in a position not to exacerbate for 2021. Okay. Got it. And then, just a follow-up on the Alero integration with Idaptive, does that require - do you need to have that integrated first before you start selling the Idaptive solution once the deal closes? Or is that just something that will happen throughout the course of the year? Thanks. That would be something that happens throughout the course of the year. We do not need to integrate it to sell Idaptive. Idaptive have a full robust solution set. We are looking for ways to bring even additional power and value over time. Thank you. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was little surprised by Idaptive. Obviously, Centrify is a PAM provider. Can you discuss why you are in a position to see better synergy between Idaptive and your – you, versus what Centrify was able to do when it was part of Centrify? Yes, I think the biggest change there is Centrify's acquisition by Thoma Bravo. And they have basically two different behaving elements. One, a PAM vendor kind of - and not a leader in the space and then, they put a strong team to develop a modern Identity-as-a-Service solution. That of course is going after the major leagues and addressing an extended TAM.
And so, we actually were looking at the broad markets and what is our best way and foray to enter it and we are incredibly excited by how they were built-out. And then in our hands, and with our market leadership, and with our credibility, and strong business model, we can give them the energy and attention to bring this to market.
So a high-quality asset that was given - I would say limited go to market energy. And with us, we can really take this broadly. And your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for slipping me in under the wire there. The primary question I want to ask is around the work from home phenomenon. Obviously, you guys get a clear benefit from that as people scrambled.
But as that has now kind of plateaued and as a dynamic and is now receding, was that part of the reason why your business accelerated in late March and April? And therefore, that dynamic is starting to become less of a positive?
And the second question I had for you is, identity, obviously is critical in the container world and it's the root of security in that environment. But it's more around the identity of applications than necessarily individuals. So, can you talk about whether there is any capabilities on that front within Idaptive? And how you plan to play there? Or is that just going to be off of Conjur? Thanks. No. No. Thanks, Alex. I think the work from home shifts basically brought home that the fact that, that there is really no more perimeter and that identity is the new perimeter.
So, I think the work from home even – and we all hope it will be this way, even if we are seeing gradual return, really brought it home that the new modern company doesn't really have a perimeter and that's what we've been saying all along is that, you have to operate assuming an attacker will be able to get to your core assets.
And so, Privileged Access Management is elevated, because you actually have no boundary anymore with such a broad attack surface with distributed endpoints and employees. And even as the employees come back, it will be very clear that okay, attacks start on the endpoint and very quickly jump into critical assets and cloud infrastructure.
And you need that last layer of defense to make sure that there will never be strong access to that infrastructure. So, we were pleased to see that acceleration, because it was highly – it was in the top – remained in top priority and got prioritized. But we think the PAM opportunity is a long-term opportunity as such an essential layer.
With regards to the second question, I think it's great, because I should have emphasized it more. I think the combination of Idaptive and what CyberArk has - brings to the table is, we can really cover human identity and then machine identity in one platform. And machine identity, we've been doing with our AAM, with our Application Access capabilities really securing our containers and applications.
And we've done that for the humans that needed Privileged Access and with Idaptive, we can go for all humans, all types of users. And again, as we integrate, put it all under one platform. Idaptive also brings other assets in this world like access to cloud, consoles and cloud assets. So, we are going to have additional joint use cases both for human identities and for machine identities. And now, I would like to turn it back over to Udi Mokady for any closing remarks. All right. First of all, thanks, everyone for joining the call this morning. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees. I am incredibly proud of how the - our entire team quickly adapted to working from home and remain productive during this difficult time that impacted every aspect of our lives.
I also want to thank our customers and partners who trust CyberArk to secure their IT infrastructure. We are working hard to reduce the impact of this pandemic on their business and we'll stay close to them. Thanks, everyone. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Erica Smith, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you Sharon, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk’s second quarter 2020 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question and answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements which reflect management’s best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the third quarter. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC and those referenced in today’s press release that are posted to CyberArk’s website, as well as risks regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related impact on global economies and our ability to adjust in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made herein.

Also, a webcast of today’s call will be available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks Erica, and thanks everyone for joining the call.
During the quarter, the safety and wellbeing of our employees continued to be our top priority. We evolved our policies and procedures based on the rolling nature of the pandemic in the countries in which we operate. Our global teams are agile and have adjusted well to today’s new normal; in fact, we believe reduced travel schedules, virtual events and digital marketing have increased the overall productivity and focus across the company.
Before getting into the details of the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the trends we are seeing in the market, then discuss our Q2 results in more detail. I will recap our first ever virtual customer event held two weeks ago, and finally discuss the integration of Idaptive and positive response from customers and partners.
We continue to see identity security and PAM at the top of CIO and CSO priority lists. This was confirmed by customers at our recent Impact event held two weeks ago, as well as by recent industry analyst reports. In today’s environment, secure and privileged access is more important than ever to global [indiscernible] risk. Every geography and every industry is experiencing a sharp increase in attacks from those looking to take advantage of the distraction and disruptions that COVID-19 has created.
Our team is on the front lines. In the breach, we are often the second phone call after the remediation firm, helping lock down privilege activity, rebuilding the integrity of the environment, and restoring secure operations.
In recent engagements, we have been ransomware, including Maze, adding data exfiltration to data encryption tactics. Attackers move laterally across the network, escalate privilege access, steal unencrypted files and encrypt vulnerable devices, crippling organizations. This pattern can be seen in the headline grabbing Twitter event - attackers compromised internal administrative tools, changed email addresses to gain access, and hijacked high profile verified accounts.
Based on research from our labs team, we believe the privilege escalation used in the Twitter attack could have been mitigated with PAM controls, including isolating access, session monitoring, behavioral analytics, and lease privilege at the endpoint. The Maze, Twitter and recent COVID-19 vaccine attacks demonstrate that the privilege pathway is the attack vector of choice, putting PAM as a top priority.
Organizations have responded to the pandemic, rapidly adjusting how they support employees, how they go to market and service customers. After establishing their work from home operations, they are now focused on securing new environments, end points, applications, and access across users from IT [indiscernible] and third party vendors. There is little debate 2020 will be viewed as the great digital accelerator as companies embrace cloud and SaaS solutions to deliver efficiency, innovation and rapid time to value.
When you look at the quarter, we were pleased to deliver results ahead of all guided metrics with total revenue of $106.5 million, non-GAAP operating income of $17 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 per share. These broader market trends resulted in positive momentum in our business with record recurring license revenue, record SaaS bookings, record growth in end point privilege manager, as well as strong demand for application access manage and for our core privilege access security solutions delivered both on premise and in our privileged cloud. We were particularly pleased with our results especially given our revenue headwind from acceleration of our SaaS and subscription business.
On the new business front, we signed more than 170 new logos, including great logos like a Fortune 100 retailers, a born in the cloud technology company, a European car manufacturer, and various global government agencies. Our wins in the second quarter were across verticals, geographies and customer size, including the midmarket, demonstrating that every company needs to secure privilege access. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was in line with our expectations and was contained primarily to the speed of deal progression with prospects who more closely scrutinize budgets for new IT initiatives. Josh will talk about the new business dynamics later in the call.
At the same time, existing customers are increasingly turning to CyberArk as a trusted advisor to strengthen their security posture given the heightened threat environment. As privilege access proliferates through the enterprise, they are first expanding their PAM footprints with core privilege access then extending their deployments based on our PAM blueprint methodology to include application access manager and end point privilege manager.
As an example, a large existing S&P 500 customer described the foundation of its security strategy as CyberArk everywhere. In the second quarter, this customer added more than 2,000 core privilege access users to provide visibility and access across its data centers and Azure environments. This customer will also leverage application access manager to secure its robotic process automation, or RPA initiative as well as Kubernetes and Jenkins.
As I highlighted, SaaS bookings accelerated in the quarter and I want to highlight a few of our wins. An existing end point privilege manager customer purchased privilege cloud to lock down the privilege pathway, Alero for third party access, and application access manager to secure its applications as well as its vulnerability management solution.
A competitive rip and replace deal for end point manager, a major U.S. insurance company chose CyberArk to secure more than 130,000 end points with our SaaS solution because of our enterprise scale to support the new work-from-home or work-from-anywhere imperative, as well as our ability to block ransomware and prevent potential theft at the end point.
A global law firm was reducing its data center footprint and consolidating infrastructure. Because of the increased risk of this consolidation, this customer prioritized its comprehensive PAM program and purchased our three SaaS solutions: end point privilege manager, CyberArk privilege cloud, and Alero, as well as application access manager to secure its DevOps environment.
While interest has increased for PAM delivered as a service in specific verticals, the mid market and the low end of the enterprise, I want to highlight that we continue to see strong demand in the large enterprise for on-premise delivery. However, with the macro uncertainty in the first half of 2020, more customers are asking for the flexibility of subscription pricing for their on-premise deployments, which contributed to our record recurring license revenue and bookings in the second quarter.
From a geographic perspective, while our business continues to be well diversified, we were very pleased with APJ’s revenue growth of 20% in the second quarter, including early traction in Japan. Our partner ecosystem continued to play a key role in our success. Ten percent of our revenue was from indirect sales.
Our advisory partners like Deloitte, PWC, KPMG and Accenture continue to influence new and add-on business. C-cubed alliance partners like Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism and UI Path in robotic process automation, Tenable and Rapid in vulnerability [indiscernible] help differentiate CyberArk in the market.
I would like to make a few comments on our CyberArk Impact customer event. Our Impact event is always very rewarding for me. It is the world’s largest gathering of cybersecurity professionals dedicated to securing privilege access. By conducting a virtual event, we were able to extend our reach and engage more than 11,000 individuals globally. This year information security officers [indiscernible] help mitigate customer risk.
Our customer based views CyberArk as a meaningful layer of security [indiscernible] long term strategic goals. In meeting after meeting, they reinforced their reliance on CyberArk as a critical partner in securing their business success.
During the event, I shared our vision for identity security which directly aligns with the trends we are seeing in the market. In today’s mobile, digital and cloud world, along with remote workforces, access continues to grow exponentially. All identities - human, applications, machines and automation tool - can become privileged uncertain conditions. This expands the attack surface if not properly secured. We believe the traditional approach to managing identities is no longer sufficient. Our identity security strategy will provide customers with peace of mind knowing that privileged access management is at the foundation of our platform while also reducing user friction with intelligent access from Idaptive.
We are taking a unique modular approach to our identity security platform which will allow customers to leverage their [indiscernible]. Early feedback from Impact on the acquisition of Idaptive and our strategy has been incredibly positive from customer and partners alike.
The integration of Idaptive is well on its way and our first step is to offer Idaptive AI driven multi-factor authentication across our products and solutions. Idaptive’s team hit the ground running, winning new customers and building pipeline even with virtual introductions.
As we look at the remainder of the year, we expect the uncertainty of the global pandemic to continue to create some level of headwind, particularly with new customers. With that said, we are in a market that is rich with opportunity. We are benefiting from work-from-anywhere and digital transformation paradigms, demonstrated by the record quarter for our SaaS solutions as well as the strong momentum with application access manager.
Our customers are turning to CyberArk to reduce risk with core privilege access. We have a robust growing pipeline of new opportunities and a loyal base of existing customers. We are making smart investments and are executing our strategy and infusing the business with more and more recurring revenue. I am confident that this combination will drive long term growth and shareholder value.
Before turning the call over to Josh, we hope that all of you are safe and well during this challenging time.
Josh will now discuss our financials in more detail and the outlook for the third quarter. Josh? Thanks Udi.
We are pleased to deliver results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue was $106.5 million compared to $100.2 million in the second quarter last year. License revenue came in at $47.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $52.2 million last year. As Udi mentioned, while COVID-related headwinds persisted for new business sales in the second quarter, we also experienced positive trends including our best ever quarter for SaaS, increased engagement and expansion deals with existing customers, and record pipeline growth across our portfolio for both existing and new customers.
If we dig deeper into the drivers of license revenue, existing customers continue to move forward with their mission critical PAM programs and add-on business, representing over 75% of license revenue during the second quarter. We were pleased to sign more than 170 logos, but we did see the combination of these customers making shorter term purchasing decisions because of the economic environment and an increase in SaaS bookings [indiscernible] deal sizes during the second quarter.
On the product side [indiscernible] end point privilege manager represented about 15% and 9% of license revenue respectively and had a record quarter. Consistent with our strategy, more than 75% of our EPM bookings were for SaaS, making the revenue contribution from this solution a lagging indicator of its overall success.
In the second quarter, we generated record revenue recurring license revenue of $12 million or 25% of license revenue amount. Our recurring license revenue breaks down to 10% of license revenue from SaaS and just over 15% of license revenue from on-prem subscription deals. For comparative purposes, in the second quarter of 2019 our recurring license revenue was $2.5 million or just 5% of license revenue in total.
Taking a step back from revenue, I want to talk briefly about bookings and pipeline. The second quarter was a record for SaaS and subscription bookings. Our strategy to infuse the business with more recurring revenue is working; however, our record SaaS and subscription bookings resulted in over a $9 million revenue headwind for the second quarter, reducing our total revenue growth rate by about 9%.
In terms of the pipeline, we had strong growth in the second quarter across new and add-on customers, our SaaS portfolio, application access manager, and our core privilege access security solutions. We have also seen an overall shift in the pipeline towards more SaaS and subscription deals as customers look for more pricing flexibility because of the macro environment, more efficiency from SaaS delivery, and increased automation from digital transformation strategies, as Udi talked about earlier.
Our combined maintenance and professional services revenue was $58.6 million, increasing 22% year-on-year. $48.7 million came from our maintenance contracts as our renewal rate continued to be strong during the quarter, reinforcing that PAM is mission critical within the security stack. In total, our recurring revenue which combines maintenance, SaaS and subscription, was about 57% of total revenue in the second quarter. That’s compared to about 41% in the second quarter of last year. The professional services revenue associated with this line was $9.9 million or 9% of total revenue, consistent with past period levels.
The business was well diversified across geographies. The Americas revenue in the quarter was $64.5 million, representing 61% of total revenue, up from $61.8 million in the second quarter last year. EMEA revenue was $30.4 million or 28% of total revenue in the second quarter, also up from $28.7 million last year. APJ generated $11.6 million in revenue, representing 11% of total revenue and growing 20% year-on-year, up from $9.7 million in the second quarter of last year.
In terms of verticals, we experienced strong year-on-year growth in insurance, pharmaceuticals, telecom and healthcare during the quarter. We did close deals in the industries impacted by the global pandemic. The bookings in retail, transportation and travel declined as a percentage of total during the second quarter.
As I move through [indiscernible] discuss on a non-GAAP basis, please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release and posted to our website.
Our second quarter gross profit was $90.7 million or an 85% gross margin. That’s a decline from 88% gross margin in the same period last year. The decline is primarily related to the increase in our SaaS revenue mix during the quarter, including the acquisition of Idaptive as well as ongoing investments in our cloud infrastructure.
We continue to make disciplined investments across the business. R&D grew by 34% year-on-year to $19.5 million as we made key investments to deliver innovation and enhance our SaaS solutions. Sales and marketing increased 18% to $45.4 million to extend the reach of our sales team globally, and G&A increased 10% year-on-year to $8.8 million. In total, operating expenses for the second quarter increased 21% to $73.8 million, and that’s compared with $61.2 million for the second quarter last year. Still, our operating income was ahead of our guidance at $16.9 million or 16% operating margin.
Included in our results that I just summarized are approximately six weeks of revenue and expenses related to the acquisition of Idaptive. Overall as Udi mentioned, we were pleased with the early traction of Idaptive. Total Idaptive revenue recognized in the quarter net of the purchase price accounting adjustments was approximately $1.5 million in SaaS revenue and $300,000 in professional services, totaling $1.8 million. For context, if we had not made any accounting adjustments, total revenue from Idaptive for the same six-week period would have been approximately $2.7 million in the quarter.
The impact to our expense line from Idaptive was approximately $1.1 million in cost of goods, lowering our gross margin by about one percentage point, and an additional $2.8 million in operating expenses. In total, Idaptive lowered our operating margin by approximately 2%.
[Indiscernible] are related to headcount. We ended the first quarter with [indiscernible] including about 125 employees from the acquisition of Idaptive. This is up from 1,254 employees at June 30, 2019. Of our total employee count, 752 employees are in sales and marketing compared to 588 at the end of second quarter last year.
Net income was $16.7 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020, that’s compared to $23 million or $0.59 for the second quarter of 2019. We were pleased to generate $53 million in cash flow or 25% margin for the first half of 2020. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments. This cash balance reflects [indiscernible] payment during the second quarter related to the acquisition of Idaptive.
We ended the second quarter with $226 million in total deferred revenue, that’s a 30% increase from $174 million at June 30 last year. Approximately 12% of total deferred revenue or $27 million is related to recurring SaaS contracts, that’s compared to 3% of total deferred related to SaaS contracts at June 30 last year.
Now turning to our guidance, as a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. [Indiscernible] for the third quarter of 2020, we expect total revenue of $107 million to $115 million [indiscernible] headwind from our increased mix of SaaS and subscription bookings expected in the third quarter of 2020, that’s compared to the bookings mix from a year ago. We expect non-GAAP operating income to range between $8 million to $15 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.19 to $0.33 [indiscernible] assumes approximately $3 million in SaaS revenue from the acquisition of Idaptive net of purchase price accounting adjustments and approximately $8 million in expenses for the full quarter [indiscernible] assumes 39.8 million weighted average diluted shares and [indiscernible] for the third quarter.
In the near term, we expect ongoing economic uncertainty and the roaming nature of the global pandemic to impact our ability to predict our results, particularly for new business and in various industries. In addition, while we have a robust pipeline, we also do not yet have full visibility into potential budget flush for the fourth quarter at this time. As a result, we are not providing guidance for the full year 2020. We did want to provide, though, a bit of color on our hiring in the back half of the year, and we expect to add approximately 30 to 35 people in the third and fourth quarters each.
We continue to see strong momentum in our business and a real business need for reducing risk, both from new and existing customers. We are making the right investments in the business across our cloud solutions and in core privilege access that we believe will position CyberArk to accelerate growth as the environment improves.
I will now turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator instructions]
The first question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thank you, good afternoon guys. Congrats on the results. Udi or Josh, I have a question that could be a bit tricky here.
We understand that SaaS is gaining steam, whether it’s the product agility, the payment flexibility that was noted also by Udi in his prepared remarks. Knowing and understanding that CyberArk carries a predominantly on-premise business model, can you maybe qualitatively talk about the potential long expansion, have you looked into it? You know, we have [indiscernible] that is coming as a platform, or maybe slightly more in a modular manner depending on the customer, but do you have a rough estimate about the potential [indiscernible] up to this that you could be seeing from a gradual migration to more of a subscription model? I would say, Shaul, first of all I think--thanks for the congrats, and we’re really pleased about the ability to accelerate the SaaS contribution. I would say [indiscernible[ has consume our on-prem solution and the fusion strategy is really working - we’re seeing more and more adoption and while in parallel, we’re increasing our SaaS portfolio, so it’s coming together. We’ve been growing adoption and we expect more of that with Idaptive [indiscernible] other companies, we believe that both customers and of course the financial strength here will benefit from the fact that the more and more we have recurring subscription as we expand our offerings, the more value both our customers will get and of course CyberArk will benefit.
So strategically this is going in the right direction, the way the customers want to buy, because that’s been very important for us - deliver on-prem, deliver SaaS based on how the customer want to buy, but in the long term I think we will benefit from the fact that there’s a growing portfolio and we can get this loyalty and growth with subscription. For sure, thank you for that. Also, Josh, the few dozens of employees that will be added within the second half period to your headcount, is that mostly R&D or some sales and marketing? When are you expecting to fill those positions mostly? Yes, hi Shaul. Definitely the majority will be R&D, and then the second place will be on the sales front as we start to think about already in the second half building sales capacity for next year. R&D and sales. Thank you for that. Good luck. Next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for you, Udi, just maybe a little higher level. Can you talk about the competitive landscape a little bit? I guess more specifically, are you seeing anything from some of the players that were acquired within the last 18 months, or perhaps others that have changed in the last couple quarters? Just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape as you see it over the last couple quarters. Sure Saket, thanks. First of all, I would say that in general, we don’t see a real change in the competitive landscape. CyberArk has really been extending our market leadership, both in PAM again with our growing innovation and growing SaaS portfolio, but further now with our identity security vision after acquiring Idaptive. I think we continue to break away and lead this market.
I think in this environment, the strong financial position has become even more important for customers, so on top of course of the technology and leadership in the space, we benefit from being that trusted customer that customers in this environment can continue to invest in.
I would say that the opposite applies to the PE-backed ones that find it harder to invest in innovation in this environment, so I would say overall continued market leadership, some vying for the distant top two and three positions between themselves. Got it, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe a follow-up for you, Josh. Can you just maybe remind us of the cash flow profile for your SaaS and on-prem subscription contracts, if you will? Are they annually in advance or any other model, and just maybe compare and contrast that for us to your traditional perpetual license-slash-maintenance model, if you will. Yes, thanks. Absolutely. When we think about the SaaS and subscription, where we’re typically going to be seeing cash on an annual basis for those projects and for those transactions, whereas in perpetual we saw the perpetual upfront together with a one-year or greater maintenance contract, so I think that’s one of the things that we’ll see different, so one respect we’ll be spreading out a little bit the cash over the contract of the SaaS and subscription terms.
You know, we were pleased in the first six months that we generated $53 million in cash flow from operations - that’s eight percentage points above our net income margin, and that’s kind of as we continue to build out and sell more and more SaaS, that’s kind of playing out nicely for us. We see over time we’re going to be building in a lot of future cash flow off of the new SaaS and subscription contracts. Got it, makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys. Next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Yes, thanks. Hi guys. You mentioned a couple of times the pipeline. I’m just wondering if you can at least qualitatively describe where the pipeline sits versus pre-COVID, or maybe a year ago, and what you’re seeing in terms of sales cycles. Yes, hi Sterling. I’ll start here. What we’re seeing actually this year in our pipeline is really across all of our products and across even existing and new customers, we’re seeing really record growth in the pipeline, and that was not impacted by COVID. We saw it in Q1 and we saw it continue as well into Q2, and that’s compared to Q1 and Q2 of last year. We’re pleased to see really where the openings are coming from and the pipeline developing and progressing, and again not just for core pass but also for our application to access manager for our new SaaS products, and of course for EPM [indiscernible].
I think one of the things also we look at is coverage growing as well, which in this environment we also like to see. Absolutely, and then one follow-up. You mentioned coming in after incident response has happened as a first call. Are you actually being brought in directly by the incident response companies, and if so, who are you seeing the most traction with? Yes Sterling, hi. Yes, we’re often invited either by the customer or recommendation from the incident response firm. It’s very interesting and often gives us the opportunity to help in the recovery and, of course, get that trusted advisor position that later follows on with privilege access management as a layer. When it’s not driven by customer, I would say the incident response firm that invites us the most is probably Mandiant, but we’ve seen several others invite us, including I would say vendors that have incident response arms that call us in. Got it, thank you. Next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Good afternoon, thank you for taking the questions. Udi, I’ll start with you. I think on a number of different occasions in the prepared remarks, you alluded to the pandemic’s impact to new logo and new business progression, so I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on what were or what are some of the gating factors around new logo and new business activity, particularly if the priority for PAM and PAS projects has catapulted to the front of the line. Then I have a follow-up for Josh. Absolutely. First of all, I think we’re really pleased to see the add-on business muscle really behave normally and with normal cycles and be such a big lift for us, and also with the ability to bring 170 new logos in this environment. I think we were very happy with that.
But what we are seeing, and I think it’s natural, across the board that you can be and PAM can be a very high priority, but just given the environment, there is much more scrutiny in priority, much more scrutiny in looking for budgets, and longer approvals. That’s kind of the new normal on the new logos, and therefore we’re factoring that and making sure we have a wider pipeline, like Josh mentioned, and that we’re factoring for right now longer cycles when it comes to new accounts. But again, there is some mitigating factors on the fact that we have the SaaS portfolio to address some of them, that we can offer subscription pricing to some of them, so there is growing mitigating factors. Fair enough. Josh, a question for you. If I look at the sequential compression in gross margins, I think you talked through about 100 basis points of that 300 basis point compression due to Idaptive. I’m wondering what the other dynamics were that caused that level of compression in gross margins, particularly if the recurring license mix is largely skewed to TBL versus SaaS this quarter. Just wanted to parse that impact out as to why the impact to gross margins would be so dramatic. That’s it for me. Thank you. Yes, thanks for that. Absolutely, 1% coming from Idaptive and then really the other percent and a half coming from the SaaS business, from [indiscernible] really increased its SaaS on EPM, started to sell into Alero and we saw a really large uptick on the organic side of our SaaS products, so that also impacted as well on the gross margin. Very helpful, thank you. Next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Udi, just a real quick question on deal progression and the nature of some of the large deals that you’re seeing on the privilege access side, particularly with regard to some of the consulting firms that you called out as partners. How many of those deals are larger--you know, particularly with respect to Deloitte and Accenture and so forth, how many are multi-vendor larger identity deals versus explicit privilege access deals, and how often is this kind of a larger consolidated effort on behalf of the customer to just revamp their identity management profile? Brian, I think it would be hard to generalize, but if we look at the engagements, very often what the big four and the consulting firms, the PAM practice at those firms, we may have a beachhead at the account or we’re coming together at the account, and they would drive a PAM [indiscernible], so we see that phase. Very often it could be part of a larger identity initiative and more and more in recent year there’s a PAM first approach - let’s secure the keys to the kingdom first before doing the others.
But you’re right - in some cases if you zoom out, we can see that identity initiative and that in these firms the group, that PAM effort is also collaborating [indiscernible] team that’s doing identity.
With our expansion to identity security and with the acquisition of Idaptive, we of course will continue our modular approach and to collaborate with other identity initiatives that have started with other vendors, but believe we will also be able to take an even greater share of those identity programs. Got it, that’s very helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up for Josh, could you put a little bit of a finer point on the guidance for the third quarter operating expenses, elevated to costs relative to Idaptive, soon to be a little bit higher in this quarter. Maybe just pointing where we should expect, I guess outside of sales and marketing headcount, R&D headcount, I don’t know if that’s the lion’s share of it, but how we’re thinking about spending for Idaptive’s expansion integration relative to other potential opex increases? Yes, hi Brian, thanks for the question. As we’ve [indiscernible] million dollars of total expenses, of which $6 million are in opex--sorry. Because if you recall, when we talked about the increased expenses in the first--for Q2, was only for six weeks, so that’s the jump in the [indiscernible] expenses for the full quarter of Idaptive.
When we think about where we’re going to see those increased expenses, it’s really going to be on the R&D from the recruit, like I talked about the majority of the headcount will be on the R&D side, and as well as on sales. The R&D is really focused on still building out our SaaS infrastructure for our SaaS product, but also for the integration of Idaptive products with CyberArk products. I would say it’s going to come out in the R&D and then next in sales. That’s helpful color, thank you very much. Next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Hi, good morning. Congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to maybe start out with the cross-sell opportunity that you’re seeing with Idaptive and your core products, and maybe how often do you think the two will be purchased together? Will Idaptive be sort of a separate tip of the spear? I’m just trying to understand how you think about [indiscernible]. Hi Jonathan. It’s relatively new, but the timing for us was great because we announced the acquisition to gear up initial integration and then really come out with it in our Impact event and really test the waters with customers. I think kind of ideal to have an acquisition, begin to integrate, and then have the opportunity to showcase it to our customers. I think the strategy right now is really to leverage the amazing customer base that we have, and they’ve selected CyberArk for this critical area in PAM and now extend with Idaptive to other use cases around their regular users.
As I mentioned in my prepared remark, first out of the gate we’ll be offering integrated MFA into the CyberArk solutions, but we will be able to up-sell the rest of the Idaptive suite to the CyberArk customers. In parallel, we’re going to keep the muscle and enhance the Idaptive muscle to also go after standalone opportunities, but that would be a new element for us where really the bigger access to market is leveraging our [indiscernible]. Got it, got it. That makes a ton of sense. Just as a follow-up, when we think about the opportunity in the midmarket, I think you called that out as an area that saw some strength this quarter. Talk about maybe the dynamic here and what’s making that market more attractive. Thank you. Yes, I think what we’re seeing is we could be very strong in where we’re coming from in the enterprise space, but that PAM demand is also growing in the lower--in the smaller enterprise and the high end of the midmarket. The fact that CyberArk now has a SaaS portfolio makes it easier for us to go after that market as well, so I would say dynamics are obviously smaller deal sizes but often shorter sales cycles, and nicely augmenting the enterprise approach which is still the most strategic for us to keep the leadership and expand. Next question comes from Rob Owens. Please state your company. Your line is open. Yes, it’s Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Good morning, guys.
Thank you for the visibility in and around the headwinds created by the SaaS business, and appreciate you impacting that for us, but can you give me a sense of relative to the Q3 guide and the headwinds, given your commentary around pipeline, why it would be a flat quarter-over-quarter headwind in terms of dollar amount. Hi Rob, this is Josh. Good to talk to you. I think again we’re anticipating certainly some transition headwinds also in the Q3 guidance, and I think what we tried to do here when we gave a range on guidance was really to capture--also knowing that we’re not certain exactly where that mix is going to come out. The pipeline is growing, as you said, it’s robust. We have good visibility particularly on the add-on customers, on the existing customers, but as we’ve said in the call, when it comes to the new customers, the progression through the pipeline and the visibility for when those are going to close becomes a bit harder to predict.
Then on top of that, you have the mix of whether or not they’re going to go off the SaaS or the subscription or the perpetual, so I think we feel comfortable with where we are in the guidance. We tried to provide a range that captures a few different types of scenarios for us, and we like where it’s heading over the next several quarters based on the pipeline. Great, and then following up, given we are in the third quarter, any high level thoughts around the U.S. federal opportunity, and would you expect this to be a normal U.S. federal quarter or do you think that COVID will have an impact on that? Thanks. Yes, I think it’s a new normal for everyone, so I think it’s the first federal quarter in this environment. We’ve had a lot of success throughout the year in federal, and so again we’re counting on a close to normal in the new normal environment and leveraging some of the, I would say, access to customers that we’ve gotten.
We’re also investing in getting our SaaS products fed-ready to be able to take that to the federal market as well. Is there any time frame around when those might be fed-ready, and how long it typically takes? It’s a process. I’m not ready with an answer there yet, and Idaptive has just gotten onboard, but super important for us. Some of them--it’s a pipeline, like some of our solutions are already in play and now we’re adding Idaptive to the fed ramp mix. But we’ve successfully sold, of course, our core PAM, our application access manager, our EPM to the federal market. It’s super strategic and important for us. Next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hi, how are you? I guess first question is for Udi. I wanted to dig into a little bit more on the prioritization of PAM and the more distributed work environment. As far as what you saw in Q2, did you start to see that increased demand in prioritization come later in the quarter, and is the expectation that it will start to translate more to the actual results into the back half or next year as budgets start to come back? Is that the progression that you see as it relates to your PAM portfolio? Hi Hamza, Udi here. I would say that the linearity is the linearity in our quarterly sales, and not really a reflection of PAM, the PAM opportunity. As we walked into COVID, first we saw organizations really just trying to get that initial [indiscernible] but that was last quarter. In this quarter, we saw that when you engage with the customer, they understand that the perimeter basically evaporated overnight and there is no perimeter, and it may take one step, it could take two steps, but an attacker can get privilege access to the heart of their IT infrastructure, so the priority is up there.
It’s also in--I would say the analysts in the industry are putting it really as the top thing to do, but with a new account we obviously have to go through the regular education and prioritization that we need to go through. I think it’s only getting up there, if I reflect a couple quarters ago in terms of awareness. I look at meetings at Impact with chief security officers, they start with this is my most critical control. Some say this allows me to somewhat sleep at night - CSOs don’t really sleep, so we’re seeing that continue, but we have to navigate the COVID environment when it comes to new logos. Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with DA Davidson. Great, thank you, and congrats on the nice quarter in a tough environment.
I want to start with a high level question. It just looked like the Twitter attack that happened this quarter was largely a privilege access management attack, so I’m wondering if that resulted in any improvement in the pipeline when it hit, because it does highlight why PAM is such a high priority. Yes Andrew, I think once every couple of months, there’s just an event that is a Super Bowl commercial for PAM, but I think the CECL community this will be an incremental effect because they get it, so I wouldn’t say that this would dramatically drive pipe. Pipe is growing because the awareness is there. It’s just another example for organizations to help prioritize this, to just get into the nitty-gritty of understanding that two hops and it’s down to privilege access to defend from a takeover.
So I would say it’s another positive, and kind of latching onto the education of past events, industry reports and so on. Next question comes from Daniel Bartus. Please go ahead. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess I’ll just ask one for Udi - nice quarter on the AAM side of the business. Curious, has the competitive landscape changed there at all, and who are you seeing most in the market competitively on this side of the business? Thanks. Yes, absolutely. When I answered earlier that no change in the competitive landscape, I know of referred to the regular PAM vendors when it comes to PAM. But you’re right - at your point, the one vendor we see with regards to securing secrets is Hashi, which come from the-I would say the developer, the developer world and less from security. We’ve seen great growth especially in--and that’s the most strategic piece of our portfolio, in the product lines that’s securing modern applications based on our acquisition of Conjur in 2017, dynamic applications and [indiscernible] secrets, and we’re coming in more from security. We see them often seeded through open source. We get a lot of wins when it’s a security-driven [indiscernible] piece of our portfolio, and we [indiscernible] story and platform, deliver a full PAM platform to the customer for humans and for applications. We’ll continue to invest in this line and also continue to invest in partnerships, like the partnership with Red Hat. Next question comes from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities. Thanks. Just a question in terms of hiring. Can you talk about maybe you just getting a lot more inbounds from a sales perspective than you were, and maybe just talk about the type of sales person that you’re looking for in the field, especially given the broader sales push? Yes Dan, I would say that the people are very amazingly adjusting. I look at our sales team, they adjusted amazingly to this environment, and also credit to the customers and prospects out there - people are engaging, people are meeting, people are having proof of concepts. I would say we’ve always hired very dynamic people and as you look in this environment and as we bring on the new type of sales persona is one that’s able to navigate and environment where you can’t have a series of face-to-face meetings, where you are leveraging the technology partnership, you’re leveraging the big four. It’s more people who know how to work in a team or an ecosystem to drive value all across.
We’ve seen an increase in--great contribution in our indirect business, so really that’s a great way to navigate this environment, leverage the access that the channel partners have, bring value, and close the deal. Next question comes from Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Udi, you talked about a large EPM displacement. I was hoping you could talk about what you’re actually displacing and then, more importantly, how do you view the overall displacement opportunity across the business as we look into the future? Thank you. Yes Gur, I was thinking about that as I was answering the competitive landscape. One attribute that we’re seeing--again, there’s a lot of green field out there, but there is a displacement when customers turn strategic. I would say we’re seeing a displacement across the board, and in that specific example I believe we replaced another technology that could not scale. I can’t recall if that example was BeyondTrust or thycotic, but it was one of them, when it came to the ability to scale, and that’s been a big advantage for us again when the customers go for a full PAM program.
EPM has been a big one on displacements. There’s also more and more CA, Broadcom CA type displacements going on, and we had some important wins in the quarter on that front too, but that was classic PAM. Next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Okay, thank you and congrats on the quarter. I think it’s a big deal that SaaS and subscription made up 25% of license revenues versus 5% a year ago, and that SaaS is 12% of deferred versus, I think you said 3% a year ago. You mentioned that more customers were requesting on-premise licenses to be delivered as a subscription. Now that is in motion, what I’m wondering is why not go on offense and actually try to sell more term licenses? I realize that there is a near term cash flow headwind, but conversely more on-premise subscription contracts would drive obviously more recurring revenues and very likely a higher LTD as well. Your perspective on that would certainly be appreciated. Yes Gregg, it’s a great question, and you’re right - we’re very pleased, and like Josh said, we’re very pleased to see that part of the business accelerate. Again, the infusion with SaaS, which was very deliberate, but then also seeing that the customers wanted on-prem but as a subscription as another way to increase our recurring revenue, so we’re very pleased with that. But right now, for that example, for the on-prem as subscription, it’s hard for us to determine how much of that is--of that acceleration is COVID related and how much is going to be the new normal, where they want to go term based for the on-prem.
Actually what we did is we put together a cross-functional team here at CyberArk led by Matt Cohen, our CRO, to determine how this--if this will persist, what are their buying patterns going into the future, and right now the leading strategy is we’re going to sell to the customers how and where they want to buy, do they want perpetual, do they want on-prem but subscription, do they want of course the SaaS portfolio, which we are--we are promoting, and after we finish that deep dive, we’ll decide, to your point, do we further accelerate on that strategy. Great, thank you. Next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Colliers. Thanks for taking my question. Could you put a finer point for us on the split you see between licenses and maintenance more on the quarter? I know you’ve been saying [indiscernible] can’t really predict it, but could you at least give us a little bit more of a hint - you know, traditionally you do well second half of the year on license revenue, especially in Q4? Thanks. Hi Catharine. I think basically if you want to--you know, for a further breakdown into license and maintenance, I would follow the model, which is basically maintenance will continue to be what we carried last quarter with the additional licenses going forward. I would say that the maintenance will probably grow in line at about 20% of the licenses that we’ll do for next quarter. All right, thank you. And also, kind of a finer tune, a finer point on professional services, we’re still running really the 7% to 9% of total revenue will be in professional services. All right, thank you very much. Next question come from Imtiaz Koujalgi. Please state your company. Your line is open. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. A question for Josh. You mentioned about customers chose to go with subscription for your on-prem offerings. Can you tell us how much deal compression happens when customers choose a subscription form factor versus, I guess, on-prem? How much is the deal size lower when you go from a perpetual to a subscription? Hi Taz. It kind of depends on how long of a subscription contract they take. If they’re taking a three-year, then it’s going to be pretty close very much to a perpetual transaction, and if they’re taking a one-year, it’s going to be closer to probably half of that. Got it, thank you. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to the presenters. Hi everyone, Udi back again. I just want to thank our customers, partners and employees for continuing and contributing to our success in the second quarter, and to everyone here, stay safe and be well. Thank you.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. Erica Smith with Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, madam. [00:00:40] Thank you, Cindy. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review Seiberg third quarter 2020 financial results with me on the call today, or Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question and answer session. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the fourth quarter. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form twenty five of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to Cyberonics website, as well as risks regarding our ability to actively begin transitioning the business to a subscription model in 2021 and the duration and scope of the covid-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies and our ability to adjust in response to the pandemic. Steimberg expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release any public updates or revisions to any board looking statements made here in. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliation's to the most directly comparable get financial measures are also available in today's press release, as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's Call. This information can be found at www.youtube.com in the Quarterly Results Section Under Investor Relations. Also, a webcast of today's call will be available on our website in the I.R.S.. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. [00:02:33] Thanks, Erica. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We first of all, we hope you and your families are all well. While the global pandemic has had a profound impact on all of our lives, our community of customers, partners and employees have adjusted to the new normal. This is reflected in our third quarter business performance, record levels of customer and prospekt engagement and business productivity gains. I am very excited to discuss our strategy to begin actively transitioning to a subscription model in 2020 one. But first I will touch on third quarter highlights and industry trends. For the third quarter, we reported 107 million dollars in revenue, thirty million dollars in non-cash operating income and non-GAAP of 31 cents per share. We are pleased with our execution and the momentum in our business. In the third quarter, our mix of recurring revenue bookings accelerated, driven by increased demand for our SAS solutions. This impacted our reported revenue and profitability, which Josh will discuss later in this call. As we move deeper into our subscription transition, it will be important in the near-term to look beyond the headline PNL as it is a lagging indicator of our true success. We believe annual recurring revenue, or IRR, which grew 40 percent in the third quarter reaching 250 million dollars, provides increased visibility into the overall strength and the long term growth of our business. This metric demonstrates that we are building a rapidly growing base of high value, more predictable recurring revenue.
[00:04:06] Industry tailwinds continue to underpin our business and contribute to our record pipeline growth and remains at the top of Seow and Sisso priority lists, delivering a critical layer of protection against hacker innovation while enabling regulatory compliance, digital transformation and cloud migration. Escalating privileges is the most frequent pathway for attackers who are more aggressive with the expanded attack, service and work from anywhere environment to manage that risk. Organizations turn to cyber as the clear market leader and industry innovator. There's also a long list of ever-changing compliance requirements that our solutions help address. As an example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NYST, recently introduced standards for Secure Zero Trust architecture, which specify that the Palm Privilege Access Management is critical to comprehensive 021 security frameworks. When it comes to digital transformation and cloud migration strategies, customers can implement these programs faster, smarter and more securely by leveraging. These programs have created highly distributed I.T. environments and increased automation and application development and business processes, resulting in the proliferation of privileges. Almost all identities, including users, machines, applications and tools, can be privileged under certain conditions. Our customers have increasingly asked us to secure additional identity use cases, which is significantly expanding our total addressable market. Our vision for identity security is taking a SACE delivered security first approach with a foundation and plan to provide users with the right level of access and privileges depending on the activity.
[00:05:50] Transitioning to a subscription company accelerate this long term vision by aligning Cybex business to these trends, we have always focused on our customers and delivering a meaningful layer of security that evolved at the pace of their IP environments. This includes being ready for when enterprises demand shift into SAS and subscription in 2020 years of change that have happened in a matter of months. covid-19 and work from anywhere have accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration and significantly increased adoption because of our strong execution and business agility. We are in a great position as we begin to actively transition our business next year. In fact, we will enter 20 21 quarters ahead of most technology companies who have gone through similar transitions. Our financial results show that customers are embracing recurring revenue consumption models without making any changes to our go to market approach. Year to date, more than 35 percent of our new license bookings were from SaaS and subscription in the third quarter. This makes reach over 45 percent of our new license bookings, including seven of our top 10 license mix license deals. This dramatic increase in subscription mix was driven predominantly by record Sesemann. We have the broadest, most feature rich cloud portfolio to secure privileged access and identity security in the market. Our ongoing innovation, the breadth of our portfolio and the maturity of our cloud offerings will be a key driver of our subscription transition program, adding incredibly valuable SaaS, recurring revenue and deeper, long lasting customer relationships.
[00:07:32] We have been working on a comprehensive readiness program to ensure long execution, strong execution throughout this transition, and dedicated cross-functional team is also working to ensure we execute the transition with the rigor and focus. We also conducted internal research and engaged one of the leading independent consulting firms who validated the durability of demand for on premise subscription well beyond covid, covid-19 and the current economic environment. We will adjust our go to market approach that will holistically nurture our customer relationships, putting their success at the center of everything we do. Matt Cohen is taking on an expanded role in the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. He will continue to head the global sales organization and is adding all those sales engagement, including services, support and customer success. This organizational structure will support long term sustainable growth by accelerating customer adoption and expansion and at the same time ensure that we deliver best in class customer satisfaction and strong renewals. Matt has deep operational experience and will be an integral part of our subscription transition success the field. He has done a great job selling and subscription year to date to help accelerate the pace of our transition. We will not only roll out comprehensive sales and channel enablement programs, but also shift our compensation plans in favor of sass and subscription sales versus perpetual licensing beginning in 2021.
[00:09:02] We will be rolling out attractive new solution packages to incentivize customers to adopt our service and subscription offerings. I am confident that this transition will reduce friction in the sales process, increase cross-sell activity and build enduring relationships with our customers by delivering deeper value and stronger security. Moving into a few details on the third quarter, we are seeing unprecedented activity with existing customers who are increasingly turning to cyber as a trusted adviser following our prescriptive Pam blueprint methodology. As examples, a large UK consumer manufacturing company is building its long term security programs on purpose and application access manager for drops to protect its fast growing global multi cloud environment. We are seeing increased traction for A as organizations increasingly shift left integrating security into jobs earlier to drive down costs and improve speed to market. Our largest adaptive win to date is an existing Seiberg Enterprise customer. This organization understands the power of multifactor single sign on lifecycle management integrated with PEN, which is the foundation of our identity security strategy. In the third quarter, new business activity and pipeline progression continues to pick up. We added more than 190 new logos, including a Fortune 500 company and the global 150 technology company. While we are seeing increased demand for new cloud solutions around premise offerings, including corporate taxes, security continue to meet the requirements of many large enterprises. A few new business highlights include in a seven figure rip and replace with a large regional bank is modernizing its security program with core parts for operational efficiency, with automatic prudential onboarding across its NWC and on premise environments, and will also benefit from our extensive secure integrations, including SailPoint Wireless and of.
[00:11:00] As part of its digital transformation program, a Fortune 500 company is rolling out cyber privacy cloud. This new Chief Information Security Officer wanted to maximize control of the environment while benefiting from the efficiency and tremendous time, the value of service delivery. A large health care system in the US blended with private cloud endpoint his manager and application access manager. Hospitals are frequently attacked by ransomware, and we provided this customer with peace of mind. Given that endpoint privacy manager has been tested against and successfully blocked over three million types of ransomware. Innovation is a foundational pillar of our strategy and strengthens our leadership position in the market. We were pleased to be named a leader in the Gartner August 2020 Magic Quadrant for projects management position, both highest and ability to execute and furthest incompleteness of vision for the second time in a row. We continue to make ongoing foundational investments in our core architecture that are enabling us to release major innovation and functionality more quickly. Yesterday's introduction of cyber cloud entitlements manager and apower says a solution that enhances cloud security is a prime example of the innovation engine from our cyber labs team, as are as new environments and cloud services are deployed.
[00:12:17] Thousands of commissions are created that provide a pathway for attackers to gain privileged access. We can now help organizations to take back control of cloud security by transforming how these permissions are secured and managed with continuous visibility, in-depth analysis and real time remediation. Finally, I want to provide a bit of color on what we are seeing from customers and partners after crisis planning and business continuity and early 2020 organizations are deep into strategic planning. They recognize that long term success is dependent on the speed of their digital transformation progress. This is increasing the sense of urgency to not only implement strong security controls to mitigate risk, but also incorporate technology that would enable the organization to move forward faster in every quarter of 2020 our new pipeline generation across all of our solutions has reached another record, demonstrating that we are capitalizing on these trends. We are well on our way to transforming cyber into a high growing recurring revenue company with significant contribution from our SAS solutions. I am confident that this subscription transition program will further solidify our position as the market leader accelerates this adoption, build a base of high value recurring revenue, and position us to deliver sustainable growth and profitability. Josh will now discuss our financials in more detail. Our subscription transition and outlook for the fourth quarter. Josh? [00:13:45] Thanks. Judy, before we discuss the details of the quarter, we wanted to remind you that we posted slides to the website this morning. That will be helpful as we walk through our results. As we mentioned, we are pleased with the momentum in the business. The acceleration of our staff and subscription offerings is beginning to impact our reported revenue and profitability, making it now in the near-term more a lagging indicator of our success. The shift in the bookings resulted in total revenue of one hundred and seven dollars million in the third quarter, compared to one hundred and eight dollars million in the third quarter of last year, while license revenue in the third quarter was forty million dollars, compared with fifty eight dollars million in the third quarter last year, the recurring portion of the license revenue was thirteen dollars million. That's an increase from four million dollars last year, driven by even faster recurring license booking growth year to date. The detailed breakdown of license revenue can be found in the slides on our site, but I would like to highlight that that's revenue increased nearly 300 percent year on year, reaching seven million dollars, and that subscription or term based license revenue more than doubled to five dollars million in the third quarter. In total, our staff and subscription license revenue represented about eight percent of our total license revenue, a significant increase from seven percent last year.
[00:15:06] Our combined maintenance and professional services revenue with 61 million dollars increasing 21 percent year on year. The breakdown of this line is approximately 50 million dollars from recurring maintenance contracts and 11 million dollars in professional services revenue. As we begin actively transitioning our business to a subscription model in January 2021, we will be focusing more on metrics that measure and provide visibility into our business beyond the traditional PNL. These metrics include our total recurring revenue, the percentage mix of bookings from staff and subscription, and most importantly, annual recurring revenue. Or are. I would start with total recurring revenue, this metric includes that subscription or term based license and recurring maintenance revenue associated with our perpetual license contracts. In the third quarter, recurring revenue grew to sixty three million dollars, or 59 percent of total revenue, and that's up 40 percent from the 45 million dollars and 42 percent in the third quarter last year. Our recurring revenue growth is being driven by strong staff and subscription bookings in 2020, as well as our continued strong maintenance renewal rates for our software. Our next Patrick, which we are introducing this quarter, is the new is a mix of new SAT and subscription bookings as a percent of total license bookings, which is an indicator of where the business is heading and is the driver of the increase in our deferred revenue in total tax and subscription represent more than 45 percent of our license bookings, which compares to about 10 percent last year and brings us to more than 35 percent of our license bookings from staff and subscription year to date.
[00:17:00] This mix has accelerated dramatically throughout the year and gives us strong confidence in our momentum as we head into our active subscription transition, including incentivizing our team. Of course, this growth in recurring license revenue bookings is increasing, the headwind to our reported revenue in the first quarter are Hadwin was approximately five million dollars. In the second it was approximately nine million dollars. And in the third quarter, the headwind to revenue from them from the bookings net was about 14 million dollars. This quarter, we are also introducing the well-known metric of LRR to provide investors with more visibility into the growth of our recurring business are is defined as the annualized value of Sath subscription or term based license and maintenance contracts in effect at the end of the reported period. As of September 30th, our RR was two hundred and fifty million dollars, increasing 40 percent year on year from one hundred and seventy eight dollars million as of September.
[00:18:06] Twenty nineteen. These three metrics demonstrate our success already towards becoming a high growth subscription company. As we discussed in January, we are also implementing a comprehensive stated strategy to support our transition, which includes modifying our compensation plans to further incentivize the team to sell recurring revenue, rolling out attractive subscription packages, strengthen our customer success, culture and team to ensure long term sustainable growth, and shifting our reporting and financial systems towards a recurring revenue model as demonstrated by the introduction of Air and Mitzie percent bookings. Historically, most of scripts and transitions have taken companies approximately eight to 10 quarters, given our strong starting point. We believe we are positioned to complete our transition on the earlier side of that timeline. Now, I'll provide some further color on the business. We are increasingly seeing our approximately 60, 300 customers turned to cyber as a trusted adviser to execute their mission critical identity security programs. The level of engagement with existing customers is at an all time high, with Arab business representing about 77 percent of license revenue during the quarter, as we mentioned, we believe the move to subscription will help accelerate the sale motion.
[00:19:42] On the new business front, we signed more than one hundred and ninety Martillo goes in line with about 200 logos in the third quarter last year. We did experience smaller new business deal sizes and some new perpetual license customers are making shorter term purchasing decisions because of the economic environment, buying only the licenses they need immediately to get started. But with plans to expand. In addition, we saw an increase in staff bookings from new customers, which often started smaller before they expand their overall footprint with Sobhraj Solutions. Another key area for us is the amount of activity we see in the market overall new pipeline generation across geographies and our product portfolio for our staff and on premises solutions was at a record level again in the third quarter, which position positions us very well for 20 21. In terms of Solutionary, application access manager and employee privilege manager represented about nine percent and 10 percent of license revenue, respectively. Even faster than we anticipated already about 90 percent of our EPM bookings process. The business was well diversified across geographies, the Americas revenue in the quarter was sixty three dollars million, representing 59 percent of total revenue. It is worth noting that the Americas had the strongest percentage of staff and subscription bookings during the quarter, which impacts recognize revenue.
[00:21:19] Ymir revenue was thirty four million dollars, or 32 percent of total revenue in the third quarter, APJ generated 10 million dollars in revenue, representing nine percent of total revenue for the third quarter. In terms of verticals, we experience strong year on year growth in financials, health care, telecom, pharma and the I.T. services software vertical. We also encouraged we are also encouraged by the strength in the retail vertical in a large in large part as a result of the digital transformation strategies. As I move further through the P.A., all light items will be discussed on an ongoing basis, please see the full gap to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release and posted to our website. Our third quarter gross profit was eighty nine million dollars, or an 84 percent gross margin in line with our expected decline from 87 percent gross margin in the same period last year. The year on year decline and gross margin is primarily related to the increase in our staff's revenue and bookings mix during the quarter and the incremental cost in cloud infrastructure for our staff business, including about one million dollars, which is related to adaptive. We continue to make strategic but disciplined investment in the business to drive long term growth.
[00:22:40] R&d grew by 33 percent year on year to 20 million dollars to enhance our solutions and expand our staff's portfolio like yesterday's introduction of the cloud entitlements manager. Sales and marketing increased 18 percent to 47 million dollars to expand the reach of our global sales team, with the increase partially offset by the reduced travel spending. Gené expense was relatively flat and nine dollars million in total operating expenses was third quarter, increased 18 percent to 76 million dollars, which includes about 5.5 million dollars in operating expenses associated with the adaptive acquisition. Our operating income was 13 million dollars or a 12 percent operating margin, and in total, Adap.tv lowered our operating margin by about four percent.
[00:23:31] As a reminder, the approximately 14 million dollar revenue headwind had a corresponding impact on our operating income, normalizing for the headwind from the bookings mix, our operating margin would have been approximately 22 percent in the third quarter. Over 70 percent of our operating expenses are related to headcount. We ended the third quarter with one thousand six hundred sixty one employees worldwide. And of our total employee count, seven hundred fifty seven employees are in sales and marketing.
[00:24:02] Net income was one million dollars or 31 cents per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. That's compared to twenty six million dollars or sixty five cents for the third quarter of 2019. We are pleased to generate 63 million dollars in free cash flow from operations, or 20 percent margin for the first nine months of 2020. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet, and we ended the quarter with one point one dollars billion in cash and investments. We also enter the third quarter with two hundred twenty eight dollars million in total deferred revenue, that's a 28 percent increase from the one hundred and seventy seven million at September 30th, 2019. Approximately 15 percent of total deferred revenue, or 34 million dollars, is related to recurring staff contracts, and that's compared to only four percent at September 30th, 2019. Turning to our guidance as a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial or other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses, as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. For the fourth quarter 2020, we expect total revenue of 125 to 135 million dollars, which assumes about 80 million dollars in revenue headwind from our increased mix of tax and subscription bookings projected for the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP operating income to range between 25 to 33 million dollars and nongay of net income per diluted share of fifty to sixty seven cents.
[00:25:33] Our guide, our guidance also assumes 40 million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of 23 percent for the fourth quarter and for modeling the full year, we would expect thirty nine point seven million weighted average diluted shares and a tax rate of twenty one percent. Given the momentum in the business. We plan to still add between 35 to 45 people in the fourth quarter, including key hires, to expand our sales and engineering organizations and position Tigra to deliver future growth. We are not providing guidance for 2020 one, but to assist you in modeling, we expect our business next year to follow a trend similar to other subscription. Transition stories are successful. Execution will be marked by strong growth in our mix of staff and subscription bookings are and result resulting deferred revenues.
[00:26:27] This growth will nicely expand our base of recurring business, even with the delay in recognize revenue from a higher ratable recurring mix. We expect total revenue to increase next year after the 2020 levels. This will be against a backdrop of ongoing investments to drive long term growth that will cause a near-term decline in our operating margin in terms of free cash flow. We anticipate that it will continue to be in line with our non-GAAP net income margin to five percentage points above net income margin over a 12 month period. As we exit the transition period, we expect a meaningful acceleration of revenue growth, improving operating margins and cash flow generation.
[00:27:07] We are already beginning to see our recurring business expand, illustrated by more than 400 percent growth in staff deferred revenue and our two hundred and fifty million dollars in are, we are confident that our strategy to begin actively transitioning to a recurring revenue model in 2020 one will make growth more durable and profitable, which will drive value for sobre our customers, partners and shareholders.
[00:27:34] We want to wish you and your families health and safety. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A operator. [00:27:45] As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question, press the pound or hash key and please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.
[00:28:01] Your first question comes from second Carlia. Your line is open. [00:28:08] Ok, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Can you hear me OK? By the way. [00:28:12] Yep. [00:28:17] OK, great, awesome. So maybe maybe for you, you know, maybe just to dig into some of the components of the subscription transition here, you know, I think you mentioned sales force incentives and 2020 one to help drive that higher mix of recurring, maybe without getting too specific. Can you just go one level deeper into what that might entail and and maybe, you know, others that you've looked out to to maybe think about how to model that, that, you know, those sales force incentives? [00:28:48] Surasak, at first of all, good morning, as you can tell, we're very excited about the transition and the momentum we have going into this now with 250 million and they are growing 40 percent and the fact that 45 percent of our Q3 license booking was from recurring.
[00:29:03] So this is without any changes. So we did this in the as we call this with infusion now that we're actively transitioning or like you said, we're going to put programs in place.
[00:29:16] We're working on them to incentivize the reps in 2020 one. I think we we have a lot of examples, examples out there to we move from making it neutral for them throughout this past year to actually making it a net positive for for for the rep to to to promote our solutions or our subscription for for for on on Prem. In parallel, the the the other side of it is, of course, rolling out the subscription packages that will incentivize the customers. And we're we're seeing healthy demand and we're really excited about putting that in place. I think be on top of this on the go to market front. The alignment that we're having in the organization having mass now is Chief Operating Officer with both sales, but also a services customer success and support. Everything that is in the life cycle of customer care is going to be very strong for us to drive value. And I would say the life with with our customers and and and aligning our strategy with what's best for for our customers. So we're very excited about putting this in place. In terms of more details on the on the incentive packages, I would say we're you know, we're focused on Q4 now and finishing the year strong will provide more details on on on the on the packages beginning of the year. [00:30:44] Got it. God, that's really helpful. Josh, maybe for my follow up for you, you know, it's probably early to ask this, but out of curiosity, how are you thinking about the mix of of license license revenue between recurring and non-recurring in the next couple of years? I think you mentioned you've had about 20 percent here in Q3. I think you mentioned about 45 percent of bookings, you know, in Q3 as well. You know, understanding it will not be necessarily a straight line and sort of getting to your target. How do you think about that targeting long term of recurring versus nonrecurring in that license revenue line? [00:31:22] Yeah, sure, HiSeq, good to talk to you again. So, you know, we I mentioned also in my prepared remarks, you know, when we think about the transition and we look at we looked at a lot of other examples and so forth, you know, this is usually an eight to 10 quarter transition when we when we think that we're going to be at the earlier side of that for a lot of the reasons that outI just talked about now in terms of where we are going into the transition. And so, you know, for the most part we see and we see kind of the success, the success point of coming out of that transition and being more than 85 percent recurring revenue. And, you know, so it's kind of going from where we are today at 45 percent to, you know, getting well into the 80s where we kind of can see, you know, already the other side of the transition. And I think when we think about next year, you know, our sales cycle still is a six to nine month sales cycle. So a lot of the pipeline for H1 next year is already intact. So I think that it'll be a little bit slower at first on gaining those percentage points. And then as we get into the middle of the transition, you know, we'll see a pickup towards subscription. But because we'll still be selling Perpetual, there'll be lumpiness. So there may be some quarters that it that it that it fluctuates or is a bit volatile. Then, of course, you know, as we get to the back end, it's going to be a, you know, kind of a more of a linear tale heading up to the into the high 80s. And then I just want to be totally on the percentage of recurring revenue in terms of the mix shift of the bookings. [00:33:04] And I just want to confirm, just meant success of the transition is 85 percent in the mix of license bookings for. [00:33:14] Got it, got it, very helpful, guys. We'll get back in queue. Thanks a lot. [00:33:17] Thanks I. [00:33:37] Hi. We'll take our next question. [00:33:43] Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani. [00:33:48] Good morning to you and thank you for taking the questions just at the highest level, as I digest some of the newer metrics and some of the headwinds that you quantified as a result of the business moving to sass and subscription form factor this quarter. I wanted to get your perspective on a product level. So with a EPN in total, about 20 percent of your license revenue, that implies about 80 percent of the business is still tied to the bread and butter part. So I'm wondering if you can talk to the speed or velocity at which the pass business is accelerating and how we should see that manifest and impacting your numbers. And I have a follow up for Josh. [00:34:33] No, absolutely, I think what we're we're excited, of course, to see the entire piece grow into subscription, a part of that is more and more on our cloud solution. But yes, you're right, we're seeing great demand for palm on both form form factors.
[00:34:53] And so is as part of this plan, we will serve customers that want to consume privileged access management on premise, but in a subscription model and of course, service this great growing demand for our private cloud. So we saw great uptake for private cloud in throughout the year and definitely in Q3. And it's taking place in the pipeline. I think originally we were looking at midsize to the customers, to the lower end of the enterprise, but we saw that it's also going beyond that. And even some of the examples I gave this morning were of Fortune 500 taking on projects as management, as a service. [00:35:41] That's very helpful. And Josh, just a follow up question for you regarding the cash flow and cash flow impact as we look towards the next eight to 10 quarters as you're in the thick of this transition. You did talk about a roughly five point increase on net income margins and the right way to think about cash flow and cash flow yields. But at a qualitative level, what are some of the puts and takes that you are considering in the cash flow profile from here between invoicing and in billings durations from some of these newer form factors that you're going to be introducing? And that's it for me. Thank you. [00:36:23] Yeah, thanks, Fatema, for that. You know, if we think about the puts and takes, obviously, as we sell more and more stats, we're looking at more annual payment terms, which is pretty traditional in that environment. So that's certainly something that we're considering in in our calculation for cash flow forecast, as we're thinking about as we're thinking about subscriptions as well, it's less subscriptions. We're still seeing more that will that will make our multiple year payments up front. But as we saw already in 2020, there's been kind of an increase towards annual payments. And we anticipate that that trend will continue as we go into 2020 2021 as well. So both the stats for sure, which is the standard way for for those for that to be sold and that even on the on prem subscription, we anticipate more of that going to annual payments as well. When we talk when we talk about duration, you know, I think we'll we'll we'll have a lot more visibility into that as we as we get into the first quarter of next year. And we and we begin and we we begin this transition actively. You know, for the most part, what we've seen in the last year is, you know, the the transition has been pretty stable around two years for for both staff and subscription. [00:37:54] Very clear, thank you. [00:37:58] Your next question. I'm sorry, your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. [00:38:06] Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys, and welcome to the recurring subscription world. It's good to have you here. So I just want to level set on some understanding in terms of metrics and and how you're thinking about the transition. When you talk about that, the average transition takes eight to 10 quarters. What do you mean in terms of what that means to be complete? [00:38:34] Yeah, hi, doing his Josh, so, you know, I'll start what we see that being completed is when we get a bookings mix of our when we get the new license booking mix above 85 percent of the mix in recurring revenue. [00:38:50] Ok, good, because I think that's important because I think a lot of investors have been fortunate to cover most of the subscription transitions and I think a lot of the investors, you know, look at, you know, the completion of the transition is when you've gotten back in terms of a revenue run rate equal to or above what you had prior to the move. And I'm just kind of wondering within that usually takes one time through your customer base to get them to consider moving to subscription. So under that type of guys, how long do you think it would take for all of your multi-year customers to at least have one shot to move over to subscription? [00:39:35] You know, we actually we actually address most of our customers every year and, you know, we see probably, you know, half of our customers coming back to us and buying new licenses, you know, on an annual basis. So I I certainly think that, you know, if we were to look at kind of historical how how much contact we've had with with our customers, you know, probably over, you know, a couple of year to two plus year window, we're going to see customers return to us for four new licenses. [00:40:12] All right, perfect. That makes sense. Thank you, guys. [00:40:17] Your next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. [00:40:23] Great, and thank you guys for taking my question. First of all, I just want to touch a little bit on some of the opportunity might be sitting there around recent ransomware outbreaks. [00:40:34] Absolutely, I would say that we've seen that increase, increased demand, we've seen the fact that the EPM you don't need to know what the malware is in order to block it from from from accessing and encrypting.
[00:40:50] So it's a tremendous success against ransomware samples. We've tested against almost three million or more than three million samples and with 100 percent blocking. Now, that's in the labs. In the field. We have huge adoption for free. IBM already for for many years in the last couple of of months, we've seen increased demand for it because of the direct correlation. There's no the perimeter has dissolved.
[00:41:15] There are more endpoints out there and and customers to extend the privacy protection to to the endpoint. And and, of course, as Josh mentioned earlier, primarily consuming our end point privilege measure in through SAS. More than 90 percent of the business deals in Q3 were SAS, were SAS CPMs. It's become a very, very important product and solution for us. [00:41:44] Great, and then as you look towards the fourth quarter and where the pipelines are you anticipating, I think you mentioned six a.m. and sales cycles and that's going to lend to some delays in the first half. But as you look at that fourth quarter, guys, are you anticipating a snapback in license at this point or does SAS continue Sason subscription to an increasing percentage of the license mix? Thanks. [00:42:12] I think, you know, once you know, when we're looking at Q4 in terms of the pipeline, we really have a very robust pipeline, both on the on a perpetual and on the fastest ascription net.
[00:42:24] So, you know, at this point, it would be hard to say it be a snapback in one direction or the other. But, you know, we're really focused on, you know, just taking advantage of the really a record pipeline for us in terms of opening new opportunities and also and also the size of the opportunities. [00:42:45] All right, thank you. [00:42:50] Your next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. [00:42:57] Great, thank you. And a high level, you know, I understand why it comes from a transition to a term based subscription during the Soviet period with with tighter spending constraints. But why would a customer choose a term based subscription versus a perpetual license? You know, outside of this covid environment, looking in the counter, 2021, you know, it seems like it has to be more expensive for that customer over a three year period. [00:43:21] So I'll start, Andrew. And actually, that's why and when we talked last quarter, we really wanted to to test it out and be very thorough before we actively transition. And we did a combination of both our checks with with customers and also an external leading consulting firm. And the and the and the answer was very it was very clear this is how they're they're buying other software solutions. This is how they're oriented in terms of their budgeting and their and their spend towards their opex. And so it's becoming the the exception to buy in a perpetual license model. And this way we're actually aligning with with how they want to to buy and and spend. It also gives them, of course, is the common the common model in the industry. And it also gives the customer more flexibility. They feel that they're they are buying what they are going to to use and that it's going to better align them with with the fact that this is a distribution model, that that the customer that the vendor needs to prove outcomes and customer success, which which we continuously do and are eager to do. So I think it's a win win on all fronts. And the combination of having the SAS portfolio, but also the on premise description really allows us to cater to to all of their all of their preferences. [00:44:50] Great. Thank you. And then, you know, OCTA announced a partnership with Hachey Corp. back in August. Has that put any or have you seen any increase in competition on your kind, on your kind, your business as a result of that partnership and sort of pushing more into the Daboub space? Thanks. [00:45:08] We haven't really seen an impact of that. I think we we do a lot of partnerships and in our seeking to increase our stickiness and lead into to customers. I would say with with both. We haven't seen an increase in competition, but definitely not related to to this to this partnership. We do compete with Hashi on the developes side. And it's and it's it's a constant it's also a good to have another vendor that pushes the need to secure secrets in modern modern applications that we come to it really from from security and a platform for all types of secrets. [00:45:50] Thank you very much. [00:45:50] Thank you. [00:45:53] Your next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. [00:46:00] Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. So if we just look back at kind of the disclosure you guys gave last quarter, right? So it seemed like the SAT in terms ascription was just about a quarter of license revenue that jumped up to 28 percent in Q3. It seems like that that that mix, it was an incremental five million dollar headwind versus what you were expecting when you gave the Q3 guidance. So if we adjust for that, it seems like the revenue came in just slightly above the midpoint of the Q3 guy. So I'm wondering, is there anything else that you would call out that perhaps drove revenue below the high end of what you got it from from a macro or pipeline perspective? And at what point did you really see the pipeline mix shift really accelerate towards that, you know, since we spoke back in August? [00:47:04] Yeah, I will start. So I would say we're pleased with the results and the strong industry tailwinds we saw driving driving us to to this result of 45 percent sacia subscription in our license booking. And and, of course, you talked about the headwind. The other data point I would add is we had a tough compare here when it comes to the Americas, particularly federal, the Americas grew 34 percent in in Q3 of of 19, driven by the largest ever federal quarter for us. And and this year, Q1 was our was our large what we call the CDF spent where where the government can spend outside outside the fiscal the fiscal cycle. And Q3 was not a strong federal quarter. And so we saw that we saw the spend elsewhere in the year. And I think that that creates a a tough compare on that. If we if we double click on on a year over year. [00:48:08] And just as we look into Q4, I'm wondering how you feel about the pipeline visibility into Q4 versus, you know, when we spoke back in Q3 and any sort of directional commentary on on air in Q4 as well. And that's it for me. Well, any direction on what I didn't hear the last, but on Iraq, I mean, obviously that seems to be the main metric that we should focus on. I'm wondering if, you know, I know you didn't provide guidance, but any directional commentary on how we should think about that and to keep our. [00:48:47] Yes, so with regard to the pipeline, as I kind of said earlier, you know, we're we're hitting record levels of opening pipeline opportunities really for this entire year, both across all the geographies and also across existing customers and also across new customers and across all of our product lines. And so we go into Q4, we feel, you know, we're feeling aware and we're in a good position, a very good position with the pipeline that we have in Q4, buddy. And of course, as you know, we have long sales cycle. So actually, as it goes into 2021 as well, when we think about, you know, the are the mix shift for the fourth quarter and it was at a couple of minutes ago as well. You know, we anticipate, you know, kind of the headwind that we're that we're talking about now that we gave in our prepared remarks of around 14 million dollars, are we believe the headwind for this quarter would probably show an increase in mix shift towards new license bookings a bit higher than where we were this quarter. And obviously then that would relate to seeing a nice growth in air as well. [00:50:06] Yeah, and I want to emphasize that the pipeline is moving nicely so far and we see strong not only in the in the opening, but also as the progression through the sale cycle. [00:50:19] Thank you.
[00:50:22] Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho. [00:50:28] Can you hear me OK? Yes, I don't, but I just want to just start out with the transition from unpretentiousness, you know, how much can you really influence that? You know, from a customer perspective? And, you know, I know like you're seeing the trend move in this direction, but can you push the customer harder? Like, I just want to get a sense for, you know, how much influence you have on on that side of the equation. [00:50:53] Yeah, Jonathan, absolutely. First of all, we have the ability to to introduce new packages, especially to to new customers that that will include a subscription. And of course, SAS is is a SAS and but but also new packages to two existing customers. It gives them the the excitement of of not looking modularly at the different product components, but actually having a user the ability to transition to a user based subscription as a as really an opportunity for for them and for us as we we really increased our portfolio over the years to to really create, I would say, win packages for them. So yes, we we say yes, we we think that we we we've succeeded with being I would say just infusing, passively infusing. We're very bullish that that was an active transition. We can we can make it happen. And that will come out very strong from from this. [00:52:01] Got it. And you reference sort of the new identity use cases where you were starting to see customers pulling demand. Can you talk about where you're maybe seeing the highest demand and you know, how much of an uplift this could be if you start adding on some of these newer use cases? Thank you. [00:52:18] Yeah, I would think so. Since the acquisition of of Adaptive and and having the stronger full identity security positioning, we're seeing our customers. First of all, the proliferation of privileges is really on their minds. So they're expanding from from from securing the classic I.T. and developer type of of users to to definitely the personnel behind that are administrating cloud and the cloud consoles. We've had that before, but without doubt that we can really give them a smooth way to do that and put these controls under the looking and excited about the business users that are actually having privilege, whether they are they are an employee from an H.R. department that was administering the H.R. system or somebody from from finance. So the ability for for cyber to expand the controls to all types of users, I would say that this is a a multi what we're seeing multiple vertical interest. Most of the dialog that I've seen has been with with the large enterprises and leveraging the fact that we have 60 to 100 customers to have these to have these conversations with. [00:53:43] Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. [00:53:48] Very much, hi, guys. Judy, I guess just my first question, you of excited about the new subscription packages, and I'm sure the new entitlements manager product is going to be an important part of this. Can you elaborate on how you may look to to go to market with these packages next year? [00:54:04] I'm really excited that you brought up the I was manager again. The launch was the launch was yesterday, but we've been sharing it with customers for a couple of months. And it's it's really right where the puck is going because they are seeing that the cloud identities come with thousands of permissions and and a human on their own can really figure out how to put control over it. And this this way with with A.I. we and the solution here, we have the opportunity to to give them at least privilege, a process for for cloud immediately remediate excessive access. And so they're very, very, very excited about that. So that's another example of a of a of a service solution that that goes into goes into the mix, the mix here in terms of the type of packages, I don't have to elaborate next next year. But given the broad portfolio, we can create different landing points for for for customers with with with a mix of our solution. [00:55:20] Ok, terrific. Thanks, Judy. And then just for Josh, it's interesting that Sason subscriptions made up more than 45 percent of new licensed bookings this quarter versus only 10 percent a year ago. I think we all get the fourteen point headwind on unrecognized revenues this quarter. But what impact does this mix shift have on license bookings in absolute dollars or license bookings, growth, for that matter? How should we think about that? [00:55:45] So what does that have impact on license bookings for the last part, on unlicensed bookings growth? [00:55:52] So if it's a 14 point headwind on recognize revenue growth, you know, clearly there's an impact to your license bookings, growth rate as well from this from this mix shift and just kind of wondering how we should be thinking about that part of it. [00:56:06] Yeah, I mean, actually, I mean, the way we think about it is, first of all, in Q4, Will, we're looking at a bigger headwind, you know, based on a mix shift that we're that we're anticipating. You know, we're not breaking out the different license, you know, license bookings from from other types of bookings as part of as part of our guide. But really, you know, in the end of the day, it's going to be what's going to be important is, is how how quickly we get to, you know, growing our ACR, you know, the at the next level that we want. And that's going to really you know, that's really going to dictate, you know, the strength of the business. So I can't I can't give out what what we expect the license bookings growth will be.
[00:56:54] But, you know, we're we're you know, we talked about in Q4 being about an 18 million dollar headwind in the guidance we gave for total revenue. OK, that's helpful, thank you. [00:57:07] Your next question comes from Eric Suffolk's with Goldman Sachs. [00:57:14] I good morning, it's Brian. Hey, thanks for taking the question and I apologize. This has been asked before, but can you maybe touch on the difference between, you know, annual contract by what you're seeing, stars versus license and you know, how you anticipate that might drive more effective customer adoption of the platform? [00:57:42] Just you, I think that. [00:57:46] Yes. So actually, we're seeing on the satellite description side of the recently increase on the annual contract values that we're getting on the Saddam subscription pieces overall. So, you know, we you know, they typically, though, when we see our SAS customers, they're going to start smaller, but they expand much more quickly. And, you know, we're still new in this game. So, you know, bear with us. But, you know, at this point in this year, what we've seen is that they've actually increased off of us up to a smaller number at the beginning of this year when we first started selling more and subscription. [00:58:32] Got it, and then how might that compare to the way that, you know, from what I understand, you know, on the license side, there is a little bit more, you know, phasing of deals or, you know, lowering of the initial contract by an expansion. Is it similar to what you're seeing on the license side, or is it is that, you know, materially different because of the different way that that that platform might be consumed? [00:58:57] No, I think it's similar. I think that, you know, customers, particularly new customers, they come in and they and they start in a certain area where they want to go. The high is a high risk area if it's in this privileged crowd. And then they've got a they have a map of where they want to expand, you know, over over the next couple of years and move out within their IT infrastructure. So I think we expect it to be fairly similar. Would that either the SASO operations or or with the buying on premise and subscription pricing? [00:59:34] Got it, that's helpful, thank you. [00:59:39] We would now like to turn the call back to Mr. McAdie. [00:59:44] That is in the I want to thank everyone here, I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for contributing to our success in the third quarter as a subscription company. I'm confident that we will build even deeper relationships with our customers and partners. And again, thanks, everyone, for for the time today. And look forward to talking to. [01:00:05] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Erica Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you, Erica. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2020 Financial Results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer.
After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website as well as risks regarding our ability to begin actively transitioning the business to a subscription model in 2021 as well as the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies in our ability to adjust in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. This information can be found at www.cyberark.com in the quarterly results section under Investor Relations, also a webcast of today's call will be available on our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We hope you and your families are safe and healthy. We want to spend some time today discussing our record results for the quarter. Outlining the market dynamics and tailwinds; and lastly, detailing the formal launch of our subscription transition, just a few weeks ago, and how it aligns to our 2021 objectives. We have a lot of information to cover as we kick off 2021. So we will be also hosting a virtual Investor Event on March 10, where we can provide more detail on our growth strategy, innovation and on our subscription transition.
2020 was not what any of us expected, but I'm incredibly proud of what CyberArk accomplished as a team. Because of our focus and agility, we are a much stronger company today. We executed against our strategic imperatives from early in the year to drive cross-sell and upsell, strengthen our channel program, build new ways of targeting prospects and enhance our customer success organization. We also responded to COVID-19 and successfully adjusted our entire operation and processes to work from home, including not missing a beat for remote deployments, support, and the full range of customer engagements.
We quickly responded to the more abrupt change in customer buying preferences of our products towards SaaS and subscription. Early in the year, we acquired Idaptive, positioning us to deliver our identity security strategy. And in every quarter of 2020, we created record new pipeline across our solutions. When coupled with our strong execution, in Q4, we delivered our best quarter ever.
Total revenue reached an all-time high of $145 million in the fourth quarter with record SaaS and subscription bookings, which also created increasing headwinds to our recognized revenue. In addition, we generated non-GAAP operating income of $40 million, well ahead of our guidance. For the full year, revenue reached $464 million. This included over $50 million of recurring license revenue, which grew faster than 200% in 2020 compared with $16 million in 2019.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the year was $91 million. It is important to remember that even with the record quarter, during our transition to a recurring revenue model, the headline P&L is the lagging indicator and understates the stronger momentum that we are experiencing -- that we experienced in the business as we exited the year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, better demonstrates this success. ARR reached $274 million at year-end, with growth accelerating to 43%. In any event, you will hear from Josh later that when we adjust for the mix shift, our sales grew about 25% in the fourth quarter.
The 4 main takeaways from our record results. First, we experienced broad-based demand across PAM, including on-premise and cloud, Endpoint Privilege Manager and DevSecOps, or Application Access Manager. Second, the pace and level of engagement with existing customers is at an all-time high with room to accelerate. Identity security is increasingly recognized, not only as foundational to comprehensive security strategies, but also as a business enabler of digital transformation and cloud.
Third, we saw a healthy increase in new business, signing about 280 marquee logos across industries. We also have a record new business pipeline where we are seeing an acceleration of progress through the pipeline ahead into 2021.
And lastly, we are formally beginning our subscription transition with strong momentum with a large, rapidly growing base of recurring revenue, and importantly, off a record fourth quarter.
PAM remained a top priority, but we did see macro uncertainty drive customers to buy for immediate need in 2020. Digging into the fourth quarter, we saw this actually lead to even faster velocity in some of our add-on business, including these following great examples.
A European retailer began implementing a Privilege Access Management program based on our Blueprint methodology in Q2. This customer quickly added on another $750,000 of core PAS licenses in the fourth quarter, and is still in phase 1 of its program. Like many organizations, this U.S. consumer manufacturing customer is shifting left, embracing DevSecOps to move faster and grow its business. They were leveraging conjure to secure secrets and drive their mission-critical digital transformation program forward. In the fourth quarter, they enhanced their security posture, buying Privileged Access Management and significantly broadening their conjur deployment. A financial services customer in APJ was rolling out a multi-cloud strategy with Azure and Google Cloud and wanted a scalable enterprise-class secret management solution. This existing CyberArk customer for PAM was using a competitive DevSecOps solution. But in the fourth quarter, decided to move to CyberArk to secure secrets across all applications because of our increased security and visibility enterprise-wide.
On the new business front, a number of key wins include a top 50 retailer, a regional European airline, an Asia Pacific cloud services company, and 2 major car manufacturers. We ended the year with about 6,600 customers, up from about 5,300 last year. We are proud to be helping secure nearly 40% of the global 2,000 today. Of the 280 new logos we signed, about 57% of the business included our SaaS or subscription solutions, up from about 23% in 2019.
Two examples are: a top 10 energy provider in Europe with a cloud-first strategy selected CyberArk as their trusted partner to help secure critical infrastructure. They will be consolidating tools and standardizing on CyberArk for privileged endpoint security, enabling the team to have increased visibility and control with our SaaS solutions.
In a competitive win, a major car manufacturer picked Idaptive for its cloud-based single sign-on and MFA. We also won a leading U.S. restaurant chain with Idaptive, which we believe will provide us with a new landing point for our sales team. Our identity security strategy, with PAM as the foundation, is at the center of the major industry tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud migration, hacker innovation and compliance. The solar wins breach is clearly hacker innovation.
Supply chain attacks are far from new, but this attack was unprecedented in its scope. While solar wins was not a driver of our results in the fourth quarter, it was a wake-up call for organizations, an important reminder that privilege exploitation is at the center of every major attack. There's been a significant uptick in interest in our identity security offerings.
The response to this attack has clearly been a flight to trust. Companies are now adopting an assumed bridge mentality and are turning to trusted security partners who not only have comprehensive solutions, but also deep experience remediating post-breach situations. We expect this event to be a tailwind for our business over the long term.
Moving on to the transition. We officially kicked off our subscription program in early January. And based on feedback from partners, customers and employees, we are confident that the timing is right. Customers and partners want the benefit of a subscription model, and we have the mature SaaS portfolio, the differentiated subscription offering that will contribute to our success. Some of the main components of our program include: incentivizing our sales team to grow ARR by selling subscription and Saas, introducing new on-prem PAM packages to pull purchases towards our subscription offering. These offerings are feature-rich with our Alero remote access with satis functionality, including adaptive multifactor authentication, single sign-on and loosely connected devices, or LCD functionality, focusing the entire organization around faster time to value and adoption with our customer success team and established customer care life cycle, and rolling out a company-wide enablement program to all of our employees to deliver a best-in-class transition.
As we look into 2021, our priorities are growth, innovation, the subscription transition and scaling within the large identity security market. To drive growth, the team is organized around 3 pillars: Access, DevSecOps and PAM, which together form our identity security portfolio. We believe this optimized structure will provide the right level of attention and resources and our Access and DevSecOps speedboats, while also driving growth of our core PAM business.
In addition, in 2021, we will extend our reach by strengthening our partner program across VARs, advisories and MSPs. Fueling our innovation engine is critical to staying a step ahead of attackers and also strengthening our leadership position in the market. In 2021, we are stepping up our R&D investments to build our SaaS identity security platform and at the same time, continue to enhance our solutions.
We believe delivering new functionality and solving complex security challenges will also be key to completing the virtuous cycle of success in our subscription model. We are well on our way to transforming CyberArk into a high-growing recurring revenue company with significant contribution from our SaaS solutions. We continue to expect the transition to take 8 to 10 quarters, beginning from the first quarter of 2021.
This year, we are laser-focused on increasing our subscription mix, growing ARR and protecting our base of customers. We believe we will reduce friction in the sales process, increase cross-sell activity and build enduring relationships with our customers by delivering deeper value and stronger security. Ultimately, the tighter relationships forged by subscription sales will generate higher lifetime customer value. We are in a growing market, and our solutions are aligned to the broader industry.
We are making the right investments in our go-to-market and innovation engines to drive growth, and are also focused on profitability and returning the company to the rule of 40 after we exit the subscription transition.
We are heading into 2021 off a record quarter with strong momentum, and I'm excited about the year ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our record results in more detail, our subscription transition and outlook for the first quarter and the full year. Off to you, Josh. Thanks, Udi. Before we discuss the details of the quarter, we wanted to remind you that we posted slides to the website this morning that will be helpful as we walk through our results. As Udi mentioned, we were pleased to beat our guidance for revenue, operating income and earnings per share, including record revenue in the fourth quarter of $145 million, that's up about 11% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Our best quarter ever was driven by increasing demand across our solutions, and we accomplished this despite the increasing revenue headwind from the subscription transition of $18 million for the fourth quarter and about $45 million for the full year. License revenue in the fourth quarter was $80.8 million compared with $76.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, and the recurring portion of license revenue was $17.4 million. That's 22% of our total license revenue. That's more than tripling from $5.7 million or 7% in the fourth quarter last year. SaaS revenue grew by over 300% year-on-year, reaching $9 million and subscription or term-based license revenue increased to $8 million in the fourth quarter from $3 million the prior year.
Our combined maintenance and professional services revenue was $64 million, increasing 20% over the prior year period. The breakdown of this line is approximately $52 million from recurring maintenance contracts and $11.5 million in professional services revenue. As Udi mentioned, we are on track with kicking off our subscription transition formally in the first quarter, with the known transition effect of increasing revenue recognized ratably we will emphasize total recurring revenue, the percentage mix of bookings from SaaS and subscription and annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as the key metrics to provide visibility into the health of our business.
Looking back in the fourth quarter, total recurring revenue grew to $70 million or 48% of total revenue. That grew 41% from the $50 million of recurring revenue, which was only 38% of total revenue in the fourth quarter last year. Our recurring revenue growth is being driven by the record bookings for subscription-based licenses throughout 2020 as well as our continued strong maintenance renewal rates for our software. As a reminder, total return revenue includes Saas, subscription and the recurring maintenance revenue associated with our perpetual license contracts.
The mix of new SaaS and subscription bookings as a percent of total license bookings is an
indicator of the pace and success of the transition. In total, SaaS and subscription bookings represented about 35% of our new license bookings, increasing from the 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our strong execution at year-end, including robust perpetual license sales as customers move forward with their mission-critical identity security programs added to our top line, while we still remain on track with our mix expectations related to our transition time line goals. The headwind created by the mix of bookings was about $18 million. That's in line with what we discussed in November, demonstrating yet another record quarter for our SaaS and subscription business.
Taking the headwind into consideration, our revenue in the fourth quarter with a comparable
mix of bookings would have grown by about 25%. For the full year of 2020, the significant shift in our new license bookings towards more recurring and ratable business effectively lowered our reported revenue by approximately $45 million. The metric we are also excited about is our AAR growth as it indicates the path towards becoming a high-growth subscription business. At December 31, our AAR was $274 million, with growth accelerating to 43% year-on-year from $192 million at year-end 2019.
Now I'll provide some further color on the business. The level of engagement with our 6,600 customers continues to be at an all-time high, and we saw about 74% of license revenue coming from add-on business during the fourth quarter. We are pleased as well with the momentum in our new business with improved close rates and strong pipeline growth in the fourth quarter. We also continue to see an increasing percentage of new customers land with our SaaS privileged access manager solution. Our expectation is that our new SaaS customers will start smaller, recognize time fast -- recognize faster time to value and quickly expand their overall CyberArk program following the blueprint methodology.
In terms of solution areas, our application or DevSecOps solution had a record quarter,
representing about 16% of license revenue with more customers securing their digital transformation programs with CyberArk. Endpoint Privilege Manager was about 6% of license revenue, and that's with about 90% of the EPM bookings being SaaS. The business remained well diversified across geographies for the quarter.
Americas revenue in the quarter was $82 million, representing 57% of total revenue. I would also note that the Americas, again, had the strongest percentage of SaaS and subscription bookings during the quarter, which naturally impacts the recognized revenue. EMEA revenue was $50 million or 35% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. APJ generated $12 million in revenue, representing 8% of total revenue for the fourth quarter.
As I move through the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see
the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release and posted to our website. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $127 million or 88% gross margin. As we demonstrated throughout the pandemic, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of our business and our shareholders to continue to make strategic, but disciplined investments to drive long-term growth.
R&D expense grew by 28% year-on-year to $23 million to enhance our solutions. Sales and
marketing increased 16% to $54 million to expand the reach of our global sales team, with
the increase a bit offset by the reduced travel spending. G&A expense grew single digits to about $10 million. In total, operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $87 million, and that includes about $6 million of incremental expenses associated with the Idaptive operations.
Our operating income was significantly ahead of our guidance at $40 million or 28% operating margin. As a reminder, the approximately $18 million revenue headwind had a corresponding impact on our operating income. Net income was $33 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, also beating our guidance.
Now let me summarize our results for the full year 2020. Total revenue for the year reached $464 million, with $226 million in license revenue, $197 million from recurring maintenance contracts and $41 million in professional services revenue. Total recurring revenue accounted for 53% or $247 million. That's growing 41% from the $176 million and equaling only 40% of total revenue for all of 2019.
You can see the details of our revenue breakdown in the PowerPoint presentation on our website. Our gross margin for the full year was 86% compared with 88% in 2019 as we continue to invest in our cloud platform.
Looking at the full year. R&D represented 17% of total revenue, up from 14% last year driven by the acquisition of Idaptive, increasing investments in our cloud and on-premises offering as well as our identity security platform. Sales and marketing represented 41% of total revenue, that's up from 37% last year, and G&A represented 8% of total revenue, in line with 8% in 2019. Our operating income was $91 million or a 20% operating margin. And in total, Idaptive lowered our annual operating margin by about 2%.
As a reminder, the approximate $45 million headwind also had a corresponding impact on our operating income. Normalizing for the headwind impact on the P&L, our operating margin would have been approximately 26% of for the full year. Over 70% of our operating expenses are related to head count. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,689 employees worldwide, we ended the year with about 772 employees in sales and marketing, that grew about 18% year-on-year. Our net income for the year was $81 million with our earnings per diluted share of $2.05. We generated $100 million in free cash flow for the year or 22% margin for 2020. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet, and we ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We also ended the year with $243 million in total deferred revenue. That's up 27% from $190 million at the year-end 2019.
Our SaaS deferred, it grew by over 400% again this quarter, reaching $46 million compared to $9 million at December 31, 2019.
Turning to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not consider any potential impact to financial, other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange gains or losses as we do not try to estimate future movements in foreign currency rates. So for the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue of $6 million $112 million. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about $2.5 million to non-GAAP operating income of $2.5 million for the first quarter. We expect our EPS to range from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.03 per basic and diluted share to net income of $0.07 per diluted share. Our guidance also assumes 39.2 million weighted average basic and diluted shares and 40.7 million weighted average diluted shares. And we are assuming a tax rate of approximately 23% for the first quarter. This guidance assumes about 47% of new license bookings from SaaS and subscription, which results in a revenue and profitability headwind of about $10 million for the first quarter of 2021.
We are also initiating our guidance for the full year 2021, which reflects the strength of our pipeline, our overall opportunity and an assumption for the mix of our bookings. We expect total revenue in the range of $484 million to $496 million, which assumes approximately 55% of new license bookings from SaaS and subscription, resulting in a revenue headwind to our guidance of approximately $39 million for the year.
We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million. We expect our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.64. For the full year, we expect about 40.8 million weighted average diluted shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, the increase in our expenses are related to 4 major areas. Our increasing investments in cloud infrastructure is impacting our gross margin for the full year. We expect to now be between 80% and 82%. Changes in exchange rates are increasing our expenses by about $10 million over 2020, in particular, will hit R&D and G&A.
As Udi mentioned, 2021 is a year of R&D investment across our offerings and our identity security platform. Lastly, we are investing in sales and marketing. Our record results in the fourth quarter and record pipeline throughout 2020 give us continued confidence in our market opportunity. It is critical that we invest today to drive long-term growth and get back to the rule of 40 after we exit the transition. As additional color, our guidance assumes that we resume travel at a lower level in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter.
In terms of free cash flow, we anticipate that it will be in line with our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period. We also expect our annual CapEx to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, representing just under 2% of revenue at the midpoint. We had a record fourth quarter and are thrilled with our momentum as we enter 2021. We are confident that our strategy to begin actively transitioning to a recurring revenue model will make growth more durable and profitable, which will drive value for CyberArk, our customers, partners and shareholders.
We want to wish you and your families, health and safety. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Udi, maybe just for you, just digging right into the subscription transition, understanding that it's still very early here. What are you sort of seeing from customers in terms of preference for term licenses versus SaaS? And how do you think about that mix sort of over time, if you will? Does that make sense? Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Saket. First of all, we're really seeing strong reception to our transition across the board, like I said, customers, partners and employees. With regards to the mix, I would say it's about a 2:1 mix towards preference for SaaS, and among new customers. And we expect that to continue, really in line with the approach to consume more and more SaaS solutions. And they're very excited about our offerings there. So I would say that trend should continue, a 2:1 mix towards SaaS. Got it. That's helpful. Josh, maybe for you. Thanks for the guide on mix next year. I think you said it should be roughly a $39 million headwind. And if I remember correctly, I think the headwind here in 2020, I think, is about $45 million. So it's actually a smaller headwind next year. So I guess the question is, how are you thinking about that maybe given the increased sales focus on selling SaaS and subscription in 2021? Yes. Thanks, Saket. Well, basically, we are seeing -- we had a very big increase this year with that high headwind. And it jumped from, I think, 10% of our mix being SaaS and subscription to 35% for the year. And now we're talking about, in the guide, it jumping to high 40s in the first quarter, about 47% and a blended of about 55% for the full year. So I would focus on that mix, which then basically is really going to drive the AAR growth for the year, in 2021 as well. So when we look at the headwind, the headwind obviously will decrease a little bit compared to 2020 because we did almost a 2.5 times increase from 10% to 35% compared to the 35% to 55% this year. So we think we're very much right on the right track for our $8 million to $10 million quarter transition. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. So with the imminent move to subscription. I'm wondering if you saw anything like what other companies like [Autodesk] did where customers realize that subscription might be coming, perpetual might be going away, and maybe accelerated the purchase of perpetual in advance of that transition. Sterling, Udi here. I would actually say we looked at it carefully, and I think the overperformance in Q4 is very much execution on deals that were in the pipe. And so it wasn't a scramble. This is your last shot. Because I think the way we position it, again, they'll be able to buy perpetual going forward, but they'll be incentivized towards the SaaS and subscription. So it's really been execution on that strong pipeline we've been building. All right. Great. And then, Josh, one for you. Can you remind us under ASC-606, given the mix of the SaaS and subscription, how the revenue recognition treatment is for those 2 elements. And what I mean by that is, how much is still being recognized upfront because of certain amount being on-premise. And also, maybe what is the average duration of the maintenance contracts that you've had historically? Yes. Right. Thanks, Sterling. So with regard to 606, with regard to our ongoing subscription term-based license that we've been selling for the last 12 months. It's really around -- it's going to be 50% upfront in 2021 and 50% over the term of the contract. And as we move more and more into customers, buying our newer subscription packages, which are going to include SaaS components, integrated into the subscription, then it will be moving down from the 50% level. And it depends on really how much of the SaaS components they buy in the subscription. So 50% will be the most that we'll recognize on day 1. But it could go down into the 40s or into the 30s as they pick up SaaS subscription packages that have more and more SaaS components. With regard to the second -- with regard to duration, we're about 2 years on duration, average duration for the maintenance contracts. Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with some of your comments that you had on solar wins. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing from the customers? And what the typical cadence or timing is for a breach like solar wins to maybe translate into revenue? Absolutely, Jonathan. I think as industry veterans, we can both agree that this is one of those pivotal major events. I think every 5 or 10 years, we have an event that shapes the industry, and this is one of them. We were leveraging the virtual environment, actually meeting more and more customers, CISOs and CIOs. And first of all, they all understand that this attack demonstrates that you need and assume breach mindset. The attacker will get that initial foothold and how do you protect deeply inside and that attackers want Privileged Access because they want to undermine all of the other controls like the attackers did here. and attack tier 0 assets and undermined and went after trying to be a regular identity in the environment. So I think we're very much part of that second wave, the first response was to run patches. And of course, those that were directly affected. Look, if they had the malware installed. But the second wave, which we believe is the longer tailwind. And what we're hearing from our -- the advisory firm partners and from instant responders is really how do we invest in trust systems in our environment. Let's make sure that we have the deep controls in our environment to protect identity in what we call identity security. So that would be on infrastructure -- on cloud infrastructure. And then additional attention now to securing the DevOps and the DevOps pipeline because of how this whole thing happens. So I think we'll see a longer tail to this. But CyberArk with identity security is really right at the heart of creating that flight to trust. Excellent. And then just in terms of, I guess, the R&D investments that you intend to make in 2021. Where do you see the most opportunities there? Are there specific product groups that you want to dedicate more funds to or add more features to? Just want to get some additional color on where that's going to head. Absolutely. I think we'll provide even more color in the Investor Day. But I would say we're doing the following. First of all, as Josh alluded, we are continuing to support the many on-prem customers, so to investing across the board in our existing solutions. We need them happy, successful, and like I said, protecting our base. And then the bigger investment is going towards our identity security platform, continuing to provide additional capabilities in SaaS-delivered identity security. So it's really in our SaaS platform. A lot of things have -- are being integrated on to onto a single modern SaaS offering that will serve our customers for many years to come. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Udi, maybe I'll start with you. The SaaS portfolio has obviously significantly in the last 12 to 18 months, especially with the addition of Idaptive. So I'm wondering if you can talk to us about which particular products and/or SKUs within the SaaS portfolio, you expect to drive the bulk of the momentum and activity for 2021? And then I have a follow-up for Josh, please. Sure. Absolutely. And sorry for that wait there on the call. I think we're really seeing -- I mean if you look at Q4 and this past year, we're seeing EPM, Endpoint Privilege Manager, and also in the context of the prior question on solar wins. It's become the no-brainer solution for ensuring that endpoints, including servers, which were attacked in this case. Are in lease privileged mode and that we're preventing credential steps. So I would say, Endpoint Privilege Manager. Our privileged cloud, for sure, we're seeing really strong adoption of customers wanting to consume this as a service. And of course, our Access portfolio, which is, like you said, Idaptive, but includes additional components like Alero, that was born organically. And so this is -- it's going to be a big differentiator for us to have such a wide portfolio as we think of the new subscription offerings. Fair enough. Josh, maybe shifting to you. You did touch on some of the cash flow dynamics should expect to see in the business. But I'm wondering if we can unpack some of the puts and takes around cash flow and cash flow trajectory, especially over the next 8 to 10 quarters as you undertake this transition. And also considering the maintenance revenue trajectory is going to look a lot different now that you are going to be emphasizing recurring subscription and term license. And so wondering if you could just sort of reconcile and help us with the trajectory of cash flow dynamics in the next 8 to 10 quarters of transition horizon. And that's it for me. Great. Thanks, Fatima. So to start off with, just to remind on the call, what we're looking at for the year is going to be somewhere around -- our non-GAAP net income margin should be similar to the cash flow to the cash flow margin. I think in the near term, there'll be some pressure on cash flow as it relates to duration and annual payments on the more -- on the increasing mix going to SaaS and subscription business. So I do think, in the past, we've historically been running at higher than our net income margin. And now we're talking about going closer to our net income margin. And I think that's where you're going to see the -- that's where the pressure is coming in to reduce from less maintenance contracts, which are frequently paid all upfront on -- what if it's multiple years -- to multiple years a SaaS and subscription contracts, which will be now paid more likely to be paid annually. But overall, we feel good about the cash flow margin relative to where net income will be. But -- and the duration that we're seeing of our SaaS and maintenance -- and subscription contracts are fairly similar on average to our maintenance contracts. It's just that there'll be more of them being paid annually as opposed to upfront. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. I was wondering maybe if I could start with the strength that you saw in the perpetual. I mean really nice results there. How -- and I think you noted that 74% of license revenue was from add-on bookings, how much of that strength was, I guess, customers that may not have pursued a complete end-to-end solution coming back and rightsizing their rightsizing their solution, given the macro and elevated threat environment that we saw over the past year. Brian, Udi here. Absolutely, that's exactly the trend we saw that if throughout the year, those customers were taking, and I would say, the small first bite because of the uncertainty macro, they were expanding as it came towards Q4 and really going for what they really needed. And so we saw that both with new logos that landed throughout the year and had faster add on, and we saw that with add-on business in Q4, consuming more again, both -- we saw that both in both sides of perpetual and on the subscription side, but definitely, that's part of the overachieved on the perpetual side. Got it. That's helpful, Udi. and maybe just a follow-up on the transition. Maybe if I could get a better understanding of when Salesforce incentives went into place and what the trajectory of transition to SaaS and subscription as a percentage of total license bookings you might expect? And I'd imagine it would be back half weighted towards the end of 2021. But just to maybe help understand how those -- how that migration may roll forward through the next fiscal year? Yes. Absolutely. So we -- I think the timing of announcing it to the world in November and getting the organization ready, really worked well for us. The entire team had gone through training, leading up to the end of the year. But we kicked off the year with a full kickoff, and that's when the full incentives and training went into play. And it's really exciting to see, I think, how the sales team and the broad team really embrace this transition. So obviously, we have 6- to 9-month sales cycles. And so like you said, we believe that the bigger mix shift will occur towards the back half of the year. That's the way to think about the bigger impact. We did see, as we move through 2020, a natural increase in pipeline of SaaS and subscription. So it's already bearing fruit for the first half, but the bigger impact is in the second half. Your next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. You mentioned some wins that you had with regard to that. I think relative to restaurant change, car manufacturer. Just curious, I know it's still early, but where you're seeing success, how competitive these deals are? Are these pre-existing customers and why you're winning in these? Yes, absolutely. I think there are probably 2 dimensions to talk about. One is the existing CyberArk customers. That we're always saying, if you'd have it, we would buy it from you. And so that's a dynamic we would, of course, are seeing the early fruits of and will be bigger into 2021 now that we trained the full team and everyone on the team can sell the full portfolio. But those customers trust us for Privileged Access Management. And while you've expanded, you can actually put security on our workforce, we want to expand with you. The second one is really actually creating that as a landing force and Idaptive came with a commercial team that we're expanding. And so I would say in both mid-market, but also in the enterprise as another way to land new accounts. Of course, the bigger lever and the bigger flag we lease is the existing strong CyberArk customer base, but we're also seeing some healthy good examples of differentiated selection of Idaptive because of its security foundation and the fact that they can then expand to the full CyberArk portfolio. Great. And then secondarily, while we've all started with our calendar for your Analyst Day in March, I'm sure we'll get a lot of commentary around AAR and the transition. Prior to that, as we said, our '21 models, any guardrails around AAR growth that we should be thinking about? Yes. Rob, this is Josh. I think that I would probably -- we want to think about the mix shift that we talked about, which is going to be towards 55% blended for the year. And if I were to think about AAR, I would kind of use 30% is the right way to look at it. 30% growth. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. I just want to start off with any large deals that you may have had in the quarter, anything abnormal in Q4? And were any of those deals, did they perhaps maybe pull-in from Q1? And into Q4? Or are they all expected? Actually a very normal quarter in terms of diversity. And hi, Andrew. A very normal quarter in terms of diversity in deal sizes, geographic mix and all of those. And so no [ pool ] in. This was execution on that expanded pipeline we've been talking about in the last couple of quarters, and that led to the overperformance. Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to maybe touch on competition in the space. There's certainly some chat around, inside partners looking to sell psychotic. I'm just wondering if you could comments on any of the competition you're seeing if that's changed at all in your space. Yes. I would say that our leadership in PAM has never been stronger. We recently shared in our internal kickoff, the continued strong win rates, the -- of course, the leadership in -- with the industry analysts. I would say, no big change in that competitive environment. Really CyberArk continuing through doing all the right things, innovating, expanding organically and organically to that full portfolio. What you alluded to from the private equity holdings, I think that's one of the things that our customers and prospects look at. They view this as mission-critical, and they want to partner with a company that's going to be there for the long run and that consistently invests in innovation. We use the term today of hacker innovation. I really think it's something to pause and think about. There is hacker innovation. So our industry has to invest in innovation. Hence, our investment in -- which I was asked about earlier, continued investment in 2021. And it's a differentiator in this market. This is a nice -- it's not a nice to have layer. This is a mission-critical layer. And that's with regards to the PAM market. Obviously, with our expansion into identity security, we're now playing in the adjacent opportunity. And of course, we're early there. But focused on the customers that put a preference on security. And lastly, DevSecOps is just a huge opportunity where -- it's probably about 1 additional player out there as we go after the DevSecOps opportunity. Your next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Josh, just one question for you. I wanted to follow up on your comment around AAR growth, thinking about it, maybe in the 30s to start with. If I look at the AAR growth directory this year, right, it's been accelerating in the 40s now, right? You mentioned, I think around 50% of your bookings were recurring, this year. You're saying 55% for next year. And you really -- like you're just starting to basically incentivize the sales force towards selling SaaS. So I'm just curious, like do you think that initial outlook is just conservative? Or is there anything else that we should be mindful of? Yes. Great question. I think the other thing that we need to be mindful of, we anticipate -- if we hit our mix shift that we're talking about, of 55% of the new license bookings coming from SaaS and subscription. Then we're confident for very high AAR growth on the SaaS and subscription side of the business. The one thing that we need to keep in mind, though, is there will be a drag on the AAR growth as it relates to the maintenance, which will be flat. And depending on what the mix shift is, there could even be a minus drag. So I think that's the 1 piece that the model needs to consider is, is the mix shift of -- is the mix of the bookings because that's going to also play into how much does the AAR from the maintenance contracts related to the perpetual goes up. But I would say that overall, we're looking at great growth on the SaaS and subscription side of the AAR, much higher than the 30%. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. All right. I guess just first question for Udi, just from an ecosystem standpoint, where do things stand with respect to the number of certified professionals on CyberArk? And about how fast would you say that's been growing? So Greg, I actually don't have an updated number for you, but we've continuously been investing in that ecosystem and made it more and more accessible for our partners. So I think it's been growing every quarter. And next time around, I'll make sure to share a number of certified professionals out there. Perfect. And then just for Josh, what are your expectations of SaaS and subscription adoption by companies that are based in EMEA and Asia Pac? How do you sort of see that evolving from here? Yes. Clearly, and I pointed out in our call, Americas contributed to the largest percentage of the SaaS and subscription business in 2020. But we've started already in the back half of 2020, starting to see it come in, in EMEA and in APJ. We're set up on the SaaS side across all the regions with regard to our data centers to be able to sell all of our SaaS products with local data centers in the regions. And we expect it to pick up into 2021 as we start to, one, really roll out the subscription packages, and the account executives get comfortable there. And two, of course, the incentive plan is the same incentive plan for the EMEA and APJ regions as in the Americas. So they will be -- they're going to be well incented to learn how to sell subscription and SaaS in those regions as well. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Berenberg. I just wanted to touch on. You mentioned incentivizing the sales force to sell SaaS and subscription. Are you also disincentivizing the sales of perpetual and then also when you just talk to customers who choose to pick term, what are the reasons for not wanting to go with the cloud offering? So by the way, great question. And no, we're not disincentivizing the perpetual. We're incentivizing -- so it's the [CARA] technique. We're incentivizing the SaaS and subscription. I would say it's still early to have like a lot of examples of customers on the fence. But again, like I said, there's a 2:1 on -- mix towards Saas. The ones who do prefer subscription are organized this way. They still want -- are still leaning to having on-prem. And of course, ones who would push for perpetual, I would say, more on the -- in government sectors and APJ like Josh mentioned, I would say those were kind of organized and still used to buying perpetual. But that's really we expect that to be a decreasing minority as we go through this. That's helpful. And if I missed this, I apologize. But if you look at the SaaS business from 2020, could you possibly break out how much of that was Idaptive, and maybe give us a sense of what that business is growing at. And then also, did you just see the lower pricing relative to some of your peers maybe play in your favor during this macro environment. So I wouldn't say that lower pricing was the dynamic in Idaptive wins. And I think the portfolio in general is really considered the robust security-minded portfolio. But it's for the security for the security oriented buyer were really differentiated. And Josh, I don't know if we can give anything on the mix. Thank you. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Udi Mokady. Thank you. Thank you, Erica. And of course, thank you, Erica Smith and Josh Siegel here. I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for contributing to our record fourth quarter, and supporting our transition to a modern subscription company. I'm confident that as we execute our strategy, we will build an even deeper relationship with our customers and partners. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. Thank you. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the Q1 2021 CyberArk Software Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Erica Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, [Amy]. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's first quarter 2021 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the second quarter and the full-year 2021. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website, as well as risks regarding our ability to actively transition the business to a subscription model, the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies, and our ability to adjust in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release, as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion of today's call. As we outlined at our investor day that we held in March, beginning in the first quarter we changed the revenue and cost of revenue presentation of our P&L to increase visibility into our subscription transition and the long-term focus of our business.
The historic breakdown of this new P&L presentation can be found in the appendix of the Q2 update deck which can also be found in the quarterly results section of our investor relations website. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. We hope you and your families are safe and healthy. 2021 is off to a great start. We successfully completed the first quarter of our active transition to subscription. We are thrilled with our execution and are well on our way towards transforming CyberArk into a fast growing recurring revenue company with a comprehensive SaaS portfolio of solutions.
A few financial highlights. Total revenue was $113 million in the first quarter, ahead of our guidance with our new subscription revenue line growing 180% over last year. In addition, it was great to see our recurring revenue reached $76 million or 68% of total revenue. We also generated more than $5 million of non-GAAP operating income and $31 million in free cash flow both ahead of our expectations.
Our revenue outperformance was particularly rewarding given that our subscription booking mix exceeded expectations at 51%, much of our success this quarter was again from the strength of our SaaS solutions. Given the increase in ratable revenue from subscription, we believe that annual recurring revenue or ARR can be used to evaluate the strength of the underlying business.
Our ARR reached $288 million, up 41% year-over-year and even more impressive is that our ARR from SaaS and subscription together grew faster than 250%. ARR subscription mix and recurring revenue demonstrate the momentum in the business and the incredible demand for our identity security platform, which is centered on PAM.
At our Investor Day in March, we outlined four pillars that will create long-term value for CyberArk, our customers, partners, and shareholders. I will use the same framework of growth, subscription transition, innovation, and profitability to walk through our Q1 results. Let's start with growth. Positive, secular tailwinds and excellence in execution are driving our strong growth trajectory.
Identity Security is at the center of every major industry tailwind, including digital transformation, zero trust, hacker innovation, and compliance. Digital transformation and the explosion of technologies applications and automation tools are not only blurring the line between a privileged user and a workforce user, but also between human users, applications and bots.
For customers, this is creating a sense of urgency for cybersecurity. Enterprises have moved beyond the emergency initiatives and build-out of 2020 and into strategic execution of comprehensive security programs. And as a result, the flight to trust we signed the fourth quarter, continued in Q1. In the wake of SolarWinds and the Microsoft breaches enterprises are embracing zero trust and an assumed breach mindset.
They are looking to security partners who have comprehensive, measurable security solutions, and deep domain experience. As we look at our business, these industry dynamics are making identity security more relevant than ever before. To drive our growth, we are executing well against this opportunity with our land and expand strategy.
Early this year, we aligned our business across privilege access management, and our two speedboats, DevSecOps and Access. This strategic move has further accelerated our momentum with an immediate impact as seen in our Q1 performance. The increased focus also contributed to another record quarter for pipeline generation across the portfolio, which will fuel our growth throughout the year.
We continue to see customers embrace our SaaS solutions with privileged cloud and endpoint privilege manager among the fastest growing offerings in our portfolio. Enterprises continue to run in a hybrid world resulting in strong demand for our on premise PAM offering, where more often than not in a subscription package versus the perpetual purchase of the past.
I'm hearing from customers that one of the ripple effects from SolarWinds is that Chief Information Security Officers increasingly recognize the criticality of Access, DevOps, and cloud entitlements as key risk points that need to be secure, which is contributing to our record pipeline growth in these areas. Our investments in customer success over the last year are also paying dividends as the pace of engagement with existing customers remains at an all-time high.
A number of customer examples from the first quarter demonstrate the power of our strategy. In a highly competitive deal, a wholesale distributor expanded with workforce identity as part of a strategy to modernize access, security employees, and deliver operational efficiency. This customer recognizes that the explosion of SaaS applications is extending privileged access to all employees, making security equally as important as a seamless user experience.
I love this win for two main reasons. First, the customer embraces our identity security strategy; and second, it demonstrates the increased sales velocity from our SaaS portfolio. This wholesaler realized fast time-to-value, ease of use, and unparalleled scalability after buying privileged cloud in just the fourth quarter of 2020, paving the road for Workforce Identity expansion just a quarter later, it was a great win.
The SolarWinds Orion attack was a catalyst for an existing Telco customer to significantly expand its PAM deployment and reducing its attack surface with secrets manager, a key win against a competitive DevOps platform. A large grocery store chain is following our Blueprint methodology as part of its identity in access management modernization. We are protecting this customer’s robotic process automation or RPA strategy with secrets manager will also significantly expanding its PAM protection with the rollout of privileged cloud.
Our new business progression and close rates continue to improve in the first quarter. We landed over 170 new customers and about 70% of these wins were subscription deals, up significantly from about 57% just last quarter. We won logos across all industries, including retail, global government, and financial services. As examples, a U.S. based retailer is replacing an incumbent PAM vendor that couldn't scale to meet the requirements of its hybrid environment. We're helping this customer secure across Google Cloud and Azure, as well as all servers and databases in its on premise environment.
A consulting organization was looking for an Identity Security partner committed to delivering innovation that would evolve in step with its long-term strategy to secure its AWS and Azure multi-cloud environment, the DevOps pipeline and its machine identities. In the first step of its CyberArk program, the company is rolling out privileged cloud and secrets manager to secure homegrown applications, as well as other software like Tenable’s vulnerability management solution.
As we look ahead, the sales capacity we added in 2020 has ramped to productivity and we are growing the team to keep pace with the accelerating demand environment. Our partner ecosystem of advisory firms of ours and CQ Technology Partners is further extending our reach and will help us drive scale in our go to market.
Moving on to the subscription transition, feedback from customers, partners and our own employees has been incredibly positive. The levers we introduced earlier this year are working, creating both push and pull in the market. Customers were already pulling a store subscription in 2020. And the new packages we introduced in mid-January combined with the maturity of our SaaS offerings have accelerated that motion.
The sales incentives, as well as the deal desk and deal scoring are helping push CyberArk towards our goal of becoming a subscription company. This is reflected in our new pipeline generation, which is overwhelmingly geared towards recurring subscription bookings heavily weighted towards SaaS. Geographically, the Americas had the strongest mix of recurring bookings, which impacted our recognized revenue, which Josh will discuss.
We are pleased with the subscription traction in EMEA and APJ, both trending ahead of our expectations. The subscription transition is reducing friction in the sales process, and increasing our cross-sell activity as you saw in some of the earlier customer examples. The team is already shifting towards delivering transformative value and building deeper, more enduring relationships, which will generate higher lifetime customer value. I couldn't be more pleased with where we are coming out of the first quarter in terms of the transition.
Now, moving on to our innovation pillar, where we continue to step on the gas around our innovation engine. In the first quarter, we made considerable progress evolving our portfolio into a unified, comprehensive identity security platform centered on privilege. We've integrated multi-factor authentication with our privilege portfolio to provide our customers with significantly enhanced security controls.
Customers are embracing zero trust frameworks, and while our just in time capabilities are solving enterprise used cases today, we are continuing to enhance our offering. Our investments in innovation that help customers secure the cloud environments are paying off. Large entitlements manager is building momentum. Our tighter integration between our Conjur secrets manager solution and privileged cloud offering is strengthening our customers security posture as they move more and more applications to the cloud, and adopt cloud native approaches to application development.
Our CQ partnerships are extending our reach, demonstrated by recently being named Partner of the Year by Red Hat. We will be rolling out exciting offerings as we move through 2021, and I can't wait to preview many of these at our upcoming customer and partner impact event in June.
Finally, we are making strategic investments this year to drive growth, innovation, and scale, and Josh will discuss our profitability pillar in more detail. I wanted to emphasize that we have not changed our approach to Investment and building a durable business model is part of our DNA, a guiding operating principle of CyberArk. We remain committed to delivering profitable growth and returning to the rule of 40 once we are through the transition period.
As I look into the remainder of 2021, we have major industry tailwinds driving our business. In the wake of the recent cybersecurity attacks and the accelerating pace of hacker innovation, our solutions are a business imperative. And we are seeing a heightened sense of urgency across PAM, Access, and DevSecOps.
Our go to market machine is executing well. We are extending our leadership position and delivering innovation at a record pace. We are well on our way towards transforming the business into a fast growing subscription company, and our cloud solutions are leading the way. With our strong execution in the first quarter, we are in a great position to unlock tremendous value for us, our shareholders, our customers, and our partners.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our results and outlook for the second quarter and full-year. Josh? Thanks, Udi. Before we discuss the details of the quarter, we wanted to remind you that we posted slides to the website that will be helpful as we walk through our results. The appendix of the decks contains the historic breakdown of the revenue and cost of revenue lines and the new presentation of our P&L that we discussed at our Investor Day in March. We are making this change to the P&L to increase visibility into the success of our subscription transition and the direction of our business.
So, moving into our results, our strong business momentum continued in the first quarter. We were pleased to beat our revenues, operating income, and EPS guidance, particularly given that we also exceeded the expectations with a percentage mix of subscription bookings. Total revenue was $130 million with a 51% subscription booking mix, up from $107 million and approximately 20% subscription booking mix in the first quarter of last year.
Subscription revenue reached $25 million and represented 22% of total revenue in the first quarter, increasing 180% from $9 million in subscription revenue, and 8% only of total revenue in the first quarter last year. As anticipated, given the shift in our sales motion towards a recurring subscription business model, perpetual license revenue did decline and was $27 million for the quarter.
Our combined maintenance and professional services revenue was $61 million, with 51.6 million from recurring maintenance and $9.8 million in professional services revenue. During the subscription transition period, it is important to evaluate additional metrics that provide increased visibility into the momentum and health of the business. They include total recurring revenue percentage mix of bookings from subscription and annual recurring revenue.
In the first quarter, total recurring revenue reached $76 million or 68% of total revenue and growing 41% from $54 million and increasing from the 51% of total revenue in the first quarter last year. Our recurring revenue growth is driven by strength of our subscription bookings from SaaS and on prem subscriptions, as well as our continued strong maintenance renewal rates for our mission critical software.
The mix of subscription bookings as a percentage of new license bookings is an indicator of pace and the success of the transition. In the first quarter, the mix was about 51% of new licensed bookings. That's compared to the mix in our guidance, which assumed only 47%. This compares to about 20% in the first quarter last year.
Please note, as we move through the transition, the subscription mix will level set all deals to an annual value, including the perpetual bookings. The headwind created by the mix of bookings was about $11 million in the first quarter. Taking the headwind into consideration, our first quarter total revenue would have grown by about 16% year-on-year. It is critical to keep in mind that the headwind is calculated based on the annualized bookings mix year-on-year.
At March 31, our ARR was $288 million growing 41% year-on-year from $205 million in the first quarter last year. On organic basis, excluding the contribution from Idaptive, our annual recurring revenue still grew faster than 30% in the first quarter of 2021. Another important metric that we kept watch closely is the growth of just the subscription portion of ARR, which includes our SaaS and on prem subscription contracts.
We were pleased that our subscription portion grew faster than 250% year-on-year to about $88 million, representing over 30% of total ARR at March 31, that's up from $25 million or 12% at March 31 last year. This clearly highlights our tremendous success in growing our recurring subscription business. Our ARR growth this quarter was driven by both existing, as well as new logos.
Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. The Americas generated $61.3 million in revenue, representing 54% of total revenue. And for the year-over-year comparison, the Americas again, had the strongest percentage of SaaS bookings during the quarter, which lowered our recognized revenue in the period by about $8 million.
EMEA grew by 40% year-on-year to $38.3 million. APJ generated $13.1 million in revenue that's increasing 39%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. All line items of the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our first quarter gross profit was $95.5 million or an 85% gross margin, that's compared to 87% in the first quarter last year.
Our gross margin is being impacted by two factors. First, the headwinds from our subscription bookings mix; and second, the increased cloud expenses related to delivering our SaaS services.
Moving down the P&L, we continue to make disciplined investments in the business. R&D grew by 39% year-on-year to $25.4 million as we invest to deliver innovation. Idaptive expenses contributed about $2.1 million to the year-on-year increase in expenses. Sales and marketing increased 20% to $53.8 million as we expand our go to market engine across all geographies.
G&A increased 37% year-on-year to $10.9 million to scale the business. In total, operating expenses for the first quarter increased 27% to $90.1 million. Our operating income was $5.4 million in the quarter. Operating Income was lowered by about $1.2 million net from foreign exchange rates. As a reminder, the approximate $11 million revenue headwind had a corresponding impact on our operating income.
Taking the headwind into account, our operating margin would have been approximately 13% in the first quarter of 2021. Over 70% of our operating expenses are related to headcount. We executed well against our aggressive hiring plan to invest in the business ending the first quarter with 1,808 employees worldwide. Of our total employee count, 832 employees are in sales and marketing.
Net income was $3.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter. In the first quarter, free cash flow was $31.3 million or a 28% free cash flow margin, driven by strong collections from our fourth quarter bookings. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We also increased deferred revenue by 23% year-on-year to $260 million. Our SaaS deferred revenue grew by over 300% to $48 million, compared to $11 million at March 31 last year.
Turning to our guidance, for the second quarter 2021, we expect total revenue of $111 million to $119 million. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about [$3.5 million] to non-GAAP operating income of 3.5 million for the second quarter. We expect our EPS to range from non-GAAP net loss of $0.11 per basic and diluted shares to net income of $0.06 per diluted share.
Our guidance also assumes 39.6 million weighted average basic and diluted shares and 40.7 million weighted average diluted shares. We are assuming $2.5 million in taxes for the second quarter. This guidance assumes about 55% of subscription bookings and a revenue and profitability headwind of approximately $9 million for the second quarter of 2021.
Our guidance for the full-year of 2021 reflects the strength of our pipeline, our overall opportunity, and an assumption for the mix of our bookings. We expect total revenue in the range of $484 million to $496 million. While we are maintaining our revenue range because of our stronger than anticipated total bookings and our higher subscription bookings mix in the first quarter, as well as our robust subscription pipeline growth we are increasing our subscription mix assumption to about 57%, and our revenue headwind increasing to approximately $45 million. This compares to our prior guidance, which assumed a mix of 55% and a $39 million headwind to revenue.
Our upward adjustments to the mix percentage and headwind represent an increase in our bookings outlook for the full-year illustrating the strong first quarter performance, as well as our confidence in the robust demand environment and execution of our strategy. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $20 million to $30 million. We expect our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.64.
For the full-year, we expect about 40.9 million weighted average diluted shares and about $10 million in taxes. As Udi mentioned, and we discussed at Investor Day, we are not changing our investment philosophy and are planning for profitability levels to snap back quickly after we exit the transition, which we continue to expect to be in between 8 quarters to 10 quarters, so exiting in the fourth quarter of 2022 or by mid-2023.
In terms of free cash flow, we were thrilled with the outperformance in the first quarter, which reflected the strength of our perpetual bookings in the fourth quarter and our strong cash collections for maintenance. For the full-year 2021, considering the seasonality in our business, we continue to anticipate that our cash flow margin will be in-line with our non-GAAP net income margin. Our performance in the first quarter strengthens our conviction that we are making the right level of investment to drive growth and innovation in 2021 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket, your line is open. Okay, great. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey, Saket, good morning. Hey Udi. Hey, good morning. Maybe for you first, Udi, can you just talk about your thoughts on new entrants into this market? And maybe just specifically to call out Okta and what your thoughts are on maybe, you know, the puts and takes for a broader identity platform like Okta, you know, entering the PAM market, any thoughts on that? Sure, sure. Look, we are the pioneer and the leader in a very hot space that's growing in importance. I think [recent breaches] really highlight the importance. So, we’ve expected more competition in entry. We've always been like, I like to call it, productively paranoid about our leadership position and hence invested in continued breakaway innovation to further accelerate our leadership. But I think specifically, the journey we took for identity security gives us a major advantage.
We think that coming from PAM where we put security first, and following the proliferation of privilege across both human and non-human infrastructure is giving us major advantages as we expand into identity security and looking at it as a security problem. I talked to enterprise customers all the time, and they won't compromise on security when it comes to the keys to IT kingdom and the keys to the Cloud kingdom. And so, we're going to continue to break away and lead with the broad expansion into identity security, but with PAM as a major advantage, and at the center of it. Got it. That makes sense. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you, thanks for some of the detail on the ARR components in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just zoom into the maintenance piece just a little bit. I believe maintenance is a bigger piece of that ARR pie, if you will, how did that component of ARR maybe compare versus your expectations? And they need to keep in mind for sort of modeling those two pieces through the rest of the year. Yeah, hi, thanks for the question. You know, I think maintenance came in about where we anticipated with regardless came in about 70% of the total [ARR]. I think on the flip side, we saw ARR come in a bit better than we anticipated with that 41% growth really coming from the he SaaS and the subscription component, which was now 30% of that [ARR] and that's compared to 12% if we look back in the first quarter of last year. So, you know, we're pleased with that. And so, I think on maintenance, you know, we're getting the right renewal rate that we expected to get, but really the bonus is coming from doing better on the SaaS side. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks Saket. Next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling, your line is open. Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So, I'm just curious, what kind of pushback you may have gotten. So the mix in subscription was better than you expected, which I don't think comes as a surprise to many of us that have watched a lot of the transitions. But where you got pushed back? Where did it happen? And why did it happen in terms of customers not wanting to choose subscription, or SaaS? So, hey Sterling, first of all, we're excited with the strong start to the subscription transition, I think it beat our expectations. And so, as a first quarter, that is chewing on some old pipeline, you can see we have some old pipeline that we expected to continue to sell as perpetual, but very pleased with how the mix has outperformed and very pleased with how it’s looking in the current full-year, you know Q2 and full-year pipeline. So, I would say, no pushback, but actually better than expected transition and really the way we wanted to start this year. Alright, great. And Josh, maybe one follow-up for you. I want to make sure I understand the full-year EPS guide. Has anything really changed in your expense outlook, or it's just the mix, going more subscription that would potentially weigh a little bit more on EPS? Yeah, hi, Sterling. It's really actually even below the operating income line. It's really around the taxes. As we kind of finished Q1 and we saw what happened in Q1 and we were forecasting taxes for the rest of the year. We, you know, when you're hovering at the lower operating mark – at the net income levels, then we actually end up with a higher tax rate around globally. So, we just adjusted for the tax – for our projected tax provision. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks Sterling. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima, your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Josh, I wanted to start with you on the Americas performance. So, appreciate you quantifying that headwind for us as it relates to the model transition that seems like it's more concentrated in the Americas, but even if we adjust for that headwind, we're still looking at a sort of flattish performance in the Americas, relative to much better performance in your other [geographic theater]. So, wondering if you can talk to any other marketplace dynamics, or go to market motion dynamics that would explain that flattish year-on-year growth adjusted for the headwind? Yeah, Fatima, Udi here. I’ll start. So actually, when we looked at it, and you touched it, we are actually excited to see that it is the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight done on SaaS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth in Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're, you know, we're pleased with where we are in the Americans, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there – I would just add on specific in terms of markets. You know, last year, in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn’t repeat in this quarter. So… Very helpful. Josh, since I have you, any high level modeling points or expectations, you could point us to as it relates to the subscription revenue and subscription ARR mix between SaaS and on prem, and to the extent the performance this quarter is changing your mix expectations specifically for that category? And that's it for me. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. You know, we're still seeing a really SaaS heavy on the [ARR]. So, you know, we're still using kind of a 2:1 ratio of SaaS versus on prem subscription. And, you know, at this point, I would continue looking at it that way. Your next question comes from a line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Rob, your line is open. Great, and thanks for taking my question. As we look towards Q2 in ARR, noting that you bought Idaptive a year ago, any puts and takes around how we should think about growth? And I know you said, you were over 30% from organic perspective this quarter, are you sticking to that kind of guardrail? And then number two, I’ll ask them both up front? Given it's been a year since the acquisition, maybe an update on how Idaptive was doing? Thanks. Sure, I'll start with the latter question on Idaptive, I think we've invested the last several quarters on really integrating it to create one plus one equals 11 with being part of connected into PAM and part of the identity security portfolio. And we've also invested in putting an overlay sales effort there. So, we are – it's still early innings for Idaptive standalone, but we're seeing it and some of the examples I’ve given really played well in the cross-sell, upsell motion with existing customers and also as a new landing front for us as the tip of the spear as Matt called it in the Investor Day.
And so it's an early young speedboat within CyberArk, but is really taking off well. And Rob, you know, on the [ARR] growth question, you know, we're still very much looking at 30% growth for the year on [ARR] and, you know, we started off nicely on the first quarter with 41%, 30% plus organically and we see that continuing for the year. All right, thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hamza, your line is open. Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question and good morning. I just want a question on, sort of the Salesforce productivity ramp. I know that, you had just started to really introduce incentives around selling fast, you know, with the Salesforce in Q1 and had some new product announcements. I'm wondering, you know, how do you see that ramp sort of progressing, particularly in the back half? And, you know, how should we think about, sort of ARR growth in relation to that? You know, hi, Hamza. Yeah, you're right, we really continue to ramp our capacity on the sales front into the first quarter. And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine months sales cycles. And we're excited about the, you know, the kind of the record continued record growth that we have in pipeline and will be continuing to expand our sales, our sales teams, globally. And, you know, going, you know, going into, you know, each of the quarters, you know, through the second half of the year, they do take two to three quarters to ramp.
So, we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that, when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, in Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones from the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams. And I think it has to do with the ramp up that we did last year, on the sales teams.
And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SaaS and [subscription]. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe, some have only subscription deals in their pipe and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year. Got it. And just maybe a brief follow up for Josh, I was wondering if you could maybe give more concrete, sort of inorganic contribution from Idaptive, I think last quarter, the organic growth was somewhere in the high 30% range, was that was that fairly consistent this quarter as well? The organic, the inorganic impact on revenue from Idaptive? What’s your question? On ARR. Oh, on [ARR]. I think the impact for was, again, I said it was about 41% growth, and it was about 30, just over 30% growth, if it – from an organic perspective. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg, your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Maybe to start with Udi, how was, I know you that call that one interesting customer example, but more broadly, how is adoption of privileged cloud this quarter among both mid-market and enterprises? And how do you see this evolving over the course of 2021? Thanks. Yeah, absolutely a super strong quarter for privileged cloud. I would say that we're beginning to see the lines blurring into how big and how large enterprises can be in adopting it. And even some very – even financial verticals, and very large accounts. And so it's becoming the larger force within new PAM, within new PAM deals is landing in privileged cloud. All right, that's great to hear. And then Josh, can you tell us roughly what AAM was as a percentage of either revenue or licensed bookings, and just kind of how that compared to your expectations? It absolutely hit against our expectations. And actually, now when we look at revenue, you know, with our much larger percentage coming from SaaS and subscription and so forth, it becomes a little bit less relevant when looking at the product mix on a revenue because there's now a change for whether it's happening perpetually or subscription basis. But I will say that from a bookings perspective, AAM absolutely had a nice growth rate year-on-year and absolutely contributed at the levels even at the levels that we anticipated even a bit higher. Okay, great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Brian, your line is open. Great, thank you and good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You know, Udi, I had a couple for you. You know, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a flight to trust and maybe if you could just update us in terms of how customer buying patterns may have evolved as you enter this year? I think last quarter you noted you know, a number of customers that came on at abbreviated attach rates or maybe didn't do end-to-end solutions kind of trued up their deals. But what is the tenor of buying pattern in 2021? What you're seeing in the pipeline? Are you getting more end-to-end and higher attach rates now? And is that more prevalent on the SaaS platform? Yeah, it's definitely more prevalent on the SaaS platform, where we see the progression in the cross-sell move faster. I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we’re seeing them much – be much more back to their strategic programs.
We already saw that in Q4 and it continued in Q1 and commentary and things we’re seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track is that they’re looking to do a deeper programs, whether – like in the commentary really following our Blueprint when it comes to add-on, and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers, we’re seeing them be more strategic about going deep in PAM and other areas in Identity Security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SaaS deal size are similar to perpetual - the historic perpetual deal size, which is great. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Andrew, your line is open. Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. So, just wanted to start up with a high-level question and you touched on the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange attacks, I’m just wondering if you could, maybe put a finer point on how they may have impacted if at all the Q1 results? And how they may have had an impact on your pipeline going forward? I think the really important news is that they created a long tail for CyberArk. It’s one of those events that has multiple years of return where if anybody need a reminder that privilege, no matter how do you dissect that and attack and no matter how they first entered a network or cloud environment, what are they looking for, lateral movement, escalation and it’s all about credentials and movements.
So, we see it creating the long tail of awareness and the field is feeling that, both in PAM and also as we’ve expanded PAM into Identity Security because there are other examples there in those attacks of attacking other elements of identity. And then specifically, there were some examples in Q1 and I gave the example of the Telco, where it helped reinforce or accelerate a deal or at least expand the deal size into a more strategic buy. But I think the important thing is the long tail we get. Got it. Thank you. And then when I look at your new customers you added it looks like over 170 this quarter. I was wondering if you could just break out how many came by way of Idaptive purchases and how your new logo adds performed excluding the Idaptive customers you added relative to your expectations? I’ll jump in and when we looked at – actually I think on the new customers the overwhelming majority were from our core PAS and actually, a large percentage of them were coming in off of our subscription and our SaaS business as well. I think 30% of – if we look even back over the whole last year, 30% of the incremental ARR that we’ve added has come from new customers and probably still 90%-plus are coming from organically. It’s important to add that many of the new packages we introduced in the year actually include Idaptive components in them, like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on. So, it’s attached to many of the new logos. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal, your line is open. Hey, guys. I have a question about next quarter guidance. It seems like the revenues are under – just slightly under Street expectations and EPS as well, would you mind to give us the context of the accounting impact on the migration to SaaS? Maybe give us the context of ARR for next quarter just to make a comparison of like-for-like? Thanks. Hi, Tal. Thanks for the question. I think from, you know really, if you’re talking about the accounting, we talked about the headwind as it relates to our SaaS and subscription rate. For the subscription side of the business, on-prem, term-based licenses, we’re looking at it going up between 50% upfront and for the new packages, it’s closer to 70%, 30% upfront and 70% pro rata over time. So – and on SaaS, obviously, it’s fully ratable so that goes in, obviously, into the headwind calculation for the guidance. And we’re pleased with the guidance to be able to, one, increase our anticipated subscription bookings mix and still really come in at what we anticipated on a revenue perspective for Q2.
So from that perspective, where it really supports and we think about it also from an annual basis, it really supports the fact that our pipeline is growing nicely, it’s actually – when you think about our subscription mix and the increased headwind for the quarter and for the full-year, we’re actually really raising our expectations for the business for the next nine months. So, we’re excited about what we’re able to guide to. And, Josh, is there a number like this quarter you gave the number of what’s the impact of accounting? Is there a number for next quarter? For the headwind? Yes. Yeah. The headwind is 10 – $9 million for Q2. Got it. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird. Jonathan, your line is open. Yeah, hi. Good morning. Hey, guys. So, last year you talked pretty consistently about strong pipeline growth, but you noted the challenges to deal sizes and also conversion rates, particularly within certain verticals. So, I’m just curious if you could comment on those dynamics entering 2021, where do you continue to potentially see challenges in the business? Yeah. Hey, Jonathan. I would say, we’re seeing a return to normalcy on that front and the ability to – for us to – the pipe was building great and I think this quarter we also showed strong execution on that pipe. And that – and, I would say, that from close rate perspective, we could probably talk about record close rates in this quarter. And so, more and more signs of return to normal. And then, of course, the more opportunity for acceleration because we have a growing SaaS portfolio in a growing number of customers that we can take them through the SaaS journey in cross-sell. That’s good to hear. The follow-up I have is on DevSecOps and I’m wondering, Udi, how you see the growing influence of that center as a buyer of security impacting privileged? Is it really starting to highlight the need for what you do more than what you’ve seen in the past? Yeah. I think this is probably one of the most strategic things we’ve – moves we made when we both organically and inorganically expanded and created the DevSecOps speedboat. There is no enterprise customer that doesn’t have – that movement happening. We’re on top of securing their human and putting human controls, they’re seeing the expansion of privilege in their application environment and the need to secure secrets. So, it’s a very strategic element. It was in many of our largest deals, included our DevSecOps solutions. And, I would say, it’s – it creates a great bridge for our customers to have an in-road to the developer side and the DevOps side. And so, our [CSO customers] are very pleased that they can build – they can bring this value to the developer audience and again keep them secure while making it very transparent for them to manage secrets. That’s great to hear. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton. Please state your company name, Josh. Your line is open. Yeah. This is Josh Tilton from Berenberg Capital Markets. Just two quick ones from me. I was hoping that you could comment on the pricing environment in Access Management over the last year. If I remember correctly, I believe Idaptive was using pricing as a differentiator. Have you been able to improve pricing at all since the acquisition? I think – thanks, Josh. I think we’re taking a different approach. And, of course, as a stand-alone that was a differentiator for Idaptive. The differentiator now is very much the fact that – if we land and Access customer, we can take them on the full Identity Security journey and into PAM. And so, in some cases, the pricing change also because we’ve included it in new packages. And in general, we’re going to differentiate on value. And just a follow-up on that. You mentioned, I believe you completed the integration of MSA with the Privilege portfolio. Do you guys have any indication of what percentage of customers are using PAM today without MSA? And also, what are you guys seeing as the uplift ASP if a PAM customer looks to implement MSA for that PAM product suite? Thanks. I don’t think I have that fully handy here. But it’s a big part of – yes, there are customers that – or many customers were the MFA projects were taking too long. And when we come in with the opportunity to put MFA in front of PAM it’s a great landing spot for them to secure probably the most important access they have in the organization, and then an opportunity for us to expand to all users. So, it’s in a big – it’s a big opportunity within the customer base. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Jonathan, your line is open. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with some of your commentary on the non-human opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about how big that market could be? And maybe, I guess, relative to the more traditional used cases, how big of an opportunity you see there? Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. I think in the past we’ve talked about the non-human opportunity being as big as the human side and I think every day that goes by is another shift left day for the world and technology. Applications are growing exponentially, no matter what industry it is.
So cross-industry we see them becoming more and more software companies. And we have that great bridge of securing one of the most important elements in DevSecOps. But win-win, transparent to the developer and a good control point for the security professionals. So, we see that only becoming more and more critical. And that’s why we, of course, put it in the speedboat – a whole speedboat behind it because of this critical opportunity. Got it. And then just relative to the shift to subscription, are you mainly seeing this as an opportunity to replace existing solutions or is there a lot of greenfield opportunity that’s coming from this as well? So, in terms of – there are multiple elements in the subscription transition, but if we talk about new logos, there are more and more types of organizations that are just happy to land in a SaaS delivery. And, like I mentioned earlier, we were pleasantly surprised that it’s continuously moving up the – up in terms of the type of enterprise. So, it gives us – from a new logo perspective, it gives us a way to bring greater time to – faster time to value for those customers and then bring them across the portfolio faster.
In terms of conversions, of course, there are conversions of – even though it’s a small piece, there are conversions of customers to subscription. And when we do that, we again want to bring them value and to get them into a bigger piece of the portfolio. And so, that’s where the packages kick in, where they’re actually getting more value and getting better security because they get the right products in place. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Alex, your line is open. Hi, team. You have Mike Cikos on the line here for Alex Henderson. I did want to follow up on this record pipeline that you guys have to see if you could give us maybe in order of magnitude or at least provide some additional color. I guess, with this model transition underway and the bigger push on subscription and higher adoption rates of SaaS, are you seeing, I guess, increased velocity in the sales cycles and customers moving quicker from the top of the funnel down to the final deal? Yeah. Thanks. I would say, we still talk about a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but beginning to see the advantages and value, and like you’re talking about of customers of higher velocity when it comes to SaaS customers and their ability to get faster time to value and then faster adoption and our ability to push cross-sell faster. We’re not changing our kind of our six- to nine-month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transitions. And I would add that, we’re seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that, Udi mentioned it before and I’ll mention it again, and when we think about the record pipeline, I’d also say what we like about it is that, it’s – first of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we’re talking about, whether it’s Privilege, Access or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we’re tracking very closely is, is this supporting our transition goals and we’re really pleased to see the pipeline supporting the transition goals, meaning that we’re seeing record increases in our SaaS pipelines, as well as our subscription packages, including and especially our new subscription packages. Your final question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik, your line is open. Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. First off, your contribution from subscription bookings, I think it was 20% in the year-ago quarter and expanded to 51%. It seems like that’s moving very quickly. What will it take for you to accelerate your timeline for reaching that 70% to 80%? I think you suggested it would be 8 to 10 quarters out. So, what do you think the likelihood of that happening before the end of fiscal 2022? And then secondly, I think you had indicated that your headwind projected for Q2 is about $9 million, I think, it was $11 million in the March quarter here. Why will it be coming down in the June quarter from the March quarter? Yeah. Thanks, Erik, for those questions. I’ll start with the second one. Basically, as we moved last year if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to – we started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. So, you know that’s impacting the math. We look at – when we look at the headwind we look at it year-on-year. So, we’re not doing it from a cumulative perspective. We’re looking at it as, okay, we’re taking this year’s Q2 versus the scenario from Q2 a year ago and already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that’s why we see a slight decline in the headwind, but we’re still supporting the strong revenue growth.
With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, we’re real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it’s certainly happening definitely within our original goalpost of 8 to 10 quarters. We’re able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think, you know Q1 is still one quarter of work, but we’ll see how Q2 goes, and we’ll be able to – I think based off for the first half of the year, really reevaluate again the full transition period. But I think in order to bring it in, we’ll want to see – we want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far we like what we see. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Great. Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone who joined us today. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees for contributing to our strong first quarter and supporting our transition to a subscription company. I am confident that as we execute our strategy, we will build even deeper relationship with our customers and partners. Again, thanks everybody for joining today.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi. Thanks Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We hope you and your families are all well. We had an amazing second quarter, one of the best in the company's history. Our subsequent transition rate out of the gates in the Second Quarter with the mix of subscription bookings reaching 65%. Despite that headwind created by the mix, we achieved total revenue of $117 million.
This revenue level paired with the mix over-achievement demonstrates that our bookings were considerably higher than anticipated in our guidance. In fact, the underlying business significantly accelerated in the second quarter, driven by record SaaS bookings and robust subscription demand. Due to our strong bookings, ARR grew by 35% to $315 million as of June 30. Even more importantly, our subscription ARR grew faster than 125% year-over-year. Recurring revenue reached $81 million, an increase of 32% compared to Q2 2020.
Subscription mix, ARR, and recurring revenue demonstrate the progress in the subscription transition, momentum in the business, and the incredible demand trends we are seeing for our Identity Security Platform, which is centered on PAM. I plan to frame our discussion on the quarter around the pillars of growth, subscription transition, innovation, and profitability. Firstly, on growth. Positive secular tailwinds and the execution of our land and expand strategy are contributing to the acceleration in our business.
Identity security is at the center of digital transformation, zero trusts, and hacker innovation, three of the most important and intertwined trends in cybersecurity. With digital transformation and the move to the cloud, privileged access is everywhere, and every identity across human users, applications, and bots can be privileged under certain conditions. If you think about zero trust, organizations around the world are no longer just strategizing about frameworks.
They are implementing programs and allocating budgets, taking an assumed breach mindset that shrugs nothing and verifies everything. Our techs are exploiting the changing IT landscape, and landmark reaches like SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, [Indiscernible] and Colonial Pipeline, identity compromise, and the abuse of privilege access are the common denominator. Weaponized software targeting supply chains and sophisticated ransomware attacks are examples of the severity of the threat landscape and are pushing our very security to the top of CIO and Cisco priority.
Our ability to deliver industrial-strength security and power business agility and growth and provide fast time to value is a unique and in-demand combination. This creates a strong market backdrop. Our go-to-market teams are executing and taking full advantage of these tailwinds to drive growth. They have quickly learned the land-and-expand approach focused on the value of subscription delivery, the ability to leverage a robust and growing partner network, and the selling process more aligned with our customers' needs that come with our industry-leading SaaS solutions and focused on subscription sales.
One of those important go-to-market focus areas was expanding our sales motion to include our identity securities vision. In January, we organized our sales team across the identity security pillars of PAM and our two-speed bots, Access and DevSecOps. As evidenced by the acceleration in our business, the increased focus and specialized resources are working. Productivity levels have increased in all regions, and our cross-sale activity has improved considerably. At the heart of our business is our robust PAM portfolio, and in Q2, PAM, and particularly Privileged Cloud, was the biggest driver of growth. The majority of our customers land with PAM We added more than a 185 new logos across verticals, geographies, and customer size.
In fact, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in manufacturing, professional services, and critical infrastructure landed in Privileged Cloud in the second quarter. A clear demonstration that large enterprise customers are increasingly protecting the keys to the kingdom, leveraging the cloud, our cloud. In fact, the success of PAM extended across all portfolio areas as we look across -- as we look at strong close rates and a meaningful increase in deal sizes as new customers made longer-term strategic purchasing decisions with a broader set of our solutions. Customers are implementing comprehensive identity security programs, including CyberArk everywhere initiatives, relying on CyberArk across our portfolio of solutions.
This is in part because of the maturity of our solutions, but also the flight to trust. In today's threat environment, customers increasingly want to work with partners who have real-world experience solving critical cyber security challenges. While there are multiple examples from Q2, one I will highlight demonstrates the increased velocity of our business and our improved expansion motion. A financial services company who went deep with privilege access in the first quarter, expanded quickly in Q2 to secure servers with endpoint privilege manager in a high 6-figure ACV. The increase in ransomware attacks by Colonial Pipeline is accelerating demand for endpoint privilege manager, which has been proven in our lab to be 100% effective in blocking more than 3 million types of ransomware and counting.
I want to highlight a few more customer examples from the second quarter that demonstrates the power of our identity security strategy. An existing hospital customer who had been locking -- who had been locking down endpoints with CyberArk since 2019 is now displacing their legacy time vendor to modernize their environment with Privilege Cloud. They are further expanding CyberArk footprint by implementing Conjur to secure the DevOps pipeline as well as our access solutions, including vendor access. Our [Indiscernible] integrations such as SailPoint and ServiceNow, as well as our ability to secure a broad set of cloud use cases, were key contributors to this great expansion due (ph).
One of our PAM financial services customers in Europe was modernizing its identity stack and fixed CyberArk, MFA, and SSO identity solutions in a highly competitive situation. They recognized the criticality of identities and wanted identity access from a trusted partner who would have empowered the business, provide strong security controls, and deliver value quickly. In the 7-figure manual view, a European professional services company embraced our identity security platform buying nearly all of our SaaS solutions across the portfolio. This new logo will benefit from increased security and ease-of-use across all identities, protecting unions and non-unions across Privilege, Access, and DevSecOps. The breadth of our portfolio and our ability to secure modern and traditional applications were key to winning this new logo.
In a highly competitive win against a well-recognized DevOps solution, an existing Endpoint Privilege Manager customer is trusting Conjur Secrets Manager to secure its CI/CD pipeline. With CyberArk, this Fortune 500 transportation company, not only one of the scalability and agility of puncture but also the peace of mind from knowing that the mission-critical applications running its business are truly secure. Attackers are increasingly targeting applications and developers, which is contributing to the strong momentum for Conjur Secrets Manager. We're typically the second call after an incident response front in a post-breach situation. And there are a number of examples every quarter.
In Q2, a leading company that had just been hit by ransomware purchased Privilege Cloud through AWS and was up and running in a matter of hours, quickly getting their business operational. Our partner ecosystem of advisory firms, sparse, and secret technology partners, is further extending our reach and driving scale in our go-to-market. Our advisory firm partners are investing in some of our practices in training and dedicated resources, another demonstration of the strong market demand trends in the industry. CQ partners like Red Hat, who we collaborate with on automation and DevOps, as well as AWS cloud base and UI path, differentiate our solutions in the field and allow our customers to maximize their IT investments. Moving on to the second strategic pillar, which is our subscription transition. We perform ahead of our expectations.
Our transition strategy was set in motion in January, and since then, customers, partners, and employees have embraced the new selling strategy. In just the second quarter of our active transition, we reached a 65% subscription booking mix much faster than we anticipated. Our transition continues to be SaaS-heavy, and we were thrilled to reach a new record for SaaS bookings across every one of our SaaS products, with particular strength in Privilege Cloud and Endpoint Privilege Manager. In fact, every geography and every SaaS product is on the increase in subscription mix compared to the first quarter of 2021 giving us confidence that the subscription pricing will be adopted across verticals and regions.
While the active subscription transition is relatively new, we already have more than 675 customers with over $100,000 in their [Indiscernible], an increase of 39% from June of last year. We also continue to see great progress in our customer success program, and we are well on our way towards delivering transformative value to our customers. We are thrilled with the progression of our subscription transition. And after analyzing the past forward. we are confident we will reach our goal of 85% of bookings from subscriptions and exit the transition by the end of 2022. Said another way, instead of an 8 to 10 quarter transition, we now expect to complete the transition in 8 quarters.
Moving on to our innovation pillar, which is the foundation of our strategy and strengthens our leadership position in the market. We were pleased to be named a leader in the July 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Privileged Access Management, positioned both highest in the ability to execute and further in the completeness of vision for the third time in a row. The power and differentiation of our data security strategy are demonstrated by Dynamic Privileged Access and secure web sessions, which we introduced at our Impact event in June. June. The response from our customers has been overwhelmingly positive.
Dynamic Privilege Access extended our existing just entire capabilities to multi-cloud and hybrid workloads. Every enterprise IT environment has both standing and Dynamic Privileged Access, and customers require a solution that secures both. Secure Web sessions are part of our Access speedboat and deliver continuous authentication and session protection, including session recording for all types of web applications, from business apps to cloud councils. This solution was described as a game-changer for identity security by customers who attended our event. We are the only vendor offering this essential capability required to achieve 0 trusts. I will wrap up with some comments on the profitability pillar.
Our go-to-market engine is firing on all cylinders, and our innovation machine is extending our leadership position. As we looked into the strong market fundamentals, acceleration of our business, and improved close rates and productivity, we made the decision to increase our investments in the second half of 2021, particularly in go-to-market, to drive growth in 2022 and beyond. We have not changed our philosophy around investments. We critically evaluate our investments to ensure we deliver a strong return and long-term value. And as a result, we expect to return to the profitability levels that we were on before we entered the transition period.
To recap, before looking ahead, we had an incredible second quarter, one of the best in the company's history. The underlying business accelerated, each of our SaaS solutions reached record bookings, identity security across PAM Access and DevSecOps are becoming a security requirement, pushed forward by major industry tailwinds; digital transformation, zero trusts, and hacker innovation, and our subscription transition strategy is delivering results. Our outperformance in the first half of the year gives us incredible confidence in our ability to execute, and the strong demand environment supports our growth.
As a result, we are raising the full-year booking assumptions underlying our guidance above and beyond our beat in Q2, which Josh will discuss in more detail. We are well on our way towards transforming the business into a fast-growing, durable subscription company with our cloud solutions leading the way. Which will unlock tremendous value for our company, our shareholders, our customers, and our partners. I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our results and outlook for the third quarter and full year. Josh? Thanks, Udi. So before we discuss the details of the quarter, we wanted to remind you that we posted slides to the website that will be helpful as we walk through our results. As Udi already mentioned, we had a great second quarter with an acceleration in the underlying business, particularly for PAM and all of our subscription transition metrics came in better than we expected. in terms of the headlight P&L, we delivered total revenue of $117 million with a 65% mix of subscription bookings. That's well ahead of our guidance framework of a 55% mix.
As Udi also mentioned, revenue above the midpoint with a higher subscription bookings mix was because of the stronger than anticipated total bookings for the quarter, above what we guided for in May. Subscription revenue reached $27.1 million and represented 23% of total revenue in the second quarter. That's an increase of 101% from $13.4 million in subscription revenue and only 13% of total revenue in the second quarter last year. Our combined maintenance and professional services revenue were $62.9 million, with 53.5 million coming from recurring maintenance and $9.3 million in services revenue.
Total recurring revenue in the second quarter reached $80.6 million or 69% of total revenue, growing 32% from $60.8 million and only 57% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year. The mix of subscription bookings as a percentage of new license bookings really demonstrates the pace and success of the transition. We're moving faster than we planned through the transition, as you can see by our 65% subscription bookings mix. Economically, the headwind created by the mix was approximately $13 million in the second quarter, when we compare it like-for-like to the mix in the second quarter last year.
Normalizing for the mix shift, the license portion of our business, our SaaS, On-Prem subscription, and perpetual would have grown over 35% in the second quarter, which really supports the growth we see in our business. Taking the headwind into consideration, total revenue growth would have grown 22% year on year. On June 30, 2021, our ARR was $315 million, growing 35% year on year and representing an acceleration from the organic growth rate in the first quarter of 2021. we closely monitor the subscription portion, which grew 128% year-on-year to approximately $109 million and represented over 35% of total ARR at the end of June. Sequentially, we added nearly $22 million of SaaS and subscription ARR in the second quarter compared to the first quarter this year. On an organic basis, this was the strongest sequential increase in subscription ARR in the company's history.
The maintenance ARR was $206 million on June 30, 2021. So we're thrilled with the new business momentum in terms of a number of new logos added and a healthy increase in new business deal sizes. A bit more detail, about 83% of our more than 185 new logos were subscriptions. That's compared to about 50% in the second quarter of last year. Geographically, the businesses -- the business continues to be well-diversified. The Americas generated $69.5 million in revenue, representing 59% of total revenue. The Americas again has the strongest percentage of subscription bookings during the quarter. EMEA had $36 million in revenue or 31% of the total, APJ generated $12 million in revenue or 10% of total revenue with an increasing mix of SaaS and subscription. All line items of the P&L will be discussed now on a non-GAAP basis.
Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our second-quarter gross profit was $97.9 million or an 84% gross margin compared to 85% gross margin in the second quarter last year. We continued to make disciplined investments in the business, resulting in operating expenses of $95.9 million, a 30% year-on-year growth, and operating income was $2 million in the quarter. 3 main items that impacted our operating income. First, the $13 million headwinds lowered our operating margin by about nine percentage points.
Second, higher expenses from foreign exchange rates lowered our operating income by about 2%. And third, a full quarter of expenses were adapted this year versus last year. On a like-for-like basis, neutralizing the headwind, FX, and adaptive, our operating margin would have been approximately 15% in the second quarter of 2021. Over 70% of our operating expenses are related to headcount. We executed even better than we expected against our aggressive hiring plan to invest in the business ending the second quarter with 1,969 employees worldwide. And of our total employee count, 881 employees are in Sales and Marketing. Net Income was $250,000 or $0.01 per diluted share for the second quarter.
In the first half of 2021, free cash flow was $45.2 million, or a 20% free cash flow margin. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet, and we now ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. We also increased deferred revenue by 22% year on year to $275 million on June 30. Our SaaS deferred revenue grew by 136% to $63.6 million, and that compared to only $27 million on June 30, 2020. Now, turning to our guidance. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue of $116 million to $124 million. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about 6 million to a non-GAAP operating income of $1 million for the third quarter.
We expect our EPS to range from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.19 to a loss of $0.02 per basic share. This guidance assumes about 70% of subscription bookings and revenue and profitability headwind of approximately $14 million for the third quarter of 2021. Our normalized total revenue growth for the third quarter, taking the calculated headwind into account, is over 25% at the midpoint of the range. And if you isolated our licensed lines of SaaS, On-Prem subscription, and perpetual, the normalized growth rate for the third quarter calculates to be 40% year on year. Our guidance also assumes 40.2 million weighted average, basic, and diluted shares.
Our guidance for the full year of 2021 reflects the robust industry tailwinds and strong close rates. We expect total revenue in the range of $484 million to $496 million, and the mix assumption underlying our guidance for the full year is 64% from subscription bookings, and our revenue headwind for the full year is now approximately $63 million. This represents a significant increase from our prior guidance, which assumed a mix of 57% from subscription bookings and a $45 million headwind. Given the transition, we wanted to provide more color on our growth rate, taking the calculated headwind into account, which would approximate 19% at the midpoint of the range for total revenue.
And a few isolate our license lines of SaaS subscription, and perpetual, the normalized growth rate would be over 25% for the full-year. I want to emphasize that the combination of higher bookings mix and revenue headwind represents a significant increase in the booking assumptions underlying our guidance for the full year. Now, moving down the P&L, we expect a non-GAAP operating income to be between $7 million to $17 million. We expect our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.01 to $0.26. And for the full year, we expect 40.8 million weighted average diluted shares and about $12 million in taxes.
We are increasing our investments in the second half of the year to ensure that we can capitalize on the growth opportunity, our leadership position, and our fundamental strength as a business. We also want to provide a few updates on the timing of the transition and free cash flow guardrails for the full year. As Udi mentioned on the timing of the transition, we now expect to complete the subscription transition in eight quarters. Meaning, we should crossover our targeted 85% threshold of bookings from subscription already by the fourth quarter of 2022.
Lastly, on cash flow. While we do not intend to guide for cash flow, we did want to provide more granularity, given that we're already halfway through the year. Currently, we expect our free cash flow to be between 5% and 10% of the non-GAAP net income margin for the full year, with third-quarter free cash flow lower than the second quarter of 2021 because of typical seasonality. Second-quarter was great. Growth is accelerating, and our subscription transition is well underway. We are confident that our investments will drive growth and innovation in 2022 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator? Thank you, sir. As a reminder, to ask a question, [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Okay. Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Udi, maybe just to start with you. It's great to see the overall revenue upside in the quarter, but I think what was really interesting was to see the revenue guide unchanged for the year despite the higher subscription mix and sort of all the commentary on better bookings.
So I was wondering if you could just maybe, double-click into what you feel like is driving that underlying better bookings backdrop, because I think we heard that last quarter as well. So could you just go one level deeper into whether this is coming from a change in the competitive environment or whether this is related to maybe some of the breach activity that we've seen? Curious what do you feel like is driving that better bookings activity? Absolutely, Saket. And it's good to talk to you here today. We've talked in the past a lot about building a record pipeline. I would say we are executing against this record pipeline.
So it's a combination of the demand environment, the market leadership and favorable competitive environment, and strong execution in how we organize to execute around it. The transition is really happening strongly as the sales team really embraced the SaaS subscription and we see increased demand and we're working on it and executing great.
I mentioned the speedboats really complementing our PAM core business and very pleased to see the manager Privilege Cloud move up to upmarket, like the examples I've given where large enterprises are also adopting Privilege Cloud which gives us the opportunity also for quick time to value for them.
So I would say all of the above; the execution against the growing demand environment, and I'd probably add that EPM specifically is getting strong demand driven by ransomware, but I will also say that the rest of the solutions are considered critical in this kind of threat environment and a strong pillar of zero trust. Got it. Got it. That's super helpful. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. I think we understand the revised profitability. It feels like you're investing really to -- for continued growth, if you will, I think going into future years.
Can you just go a little bit deeper into will all those investments be in go-to-market. Is there anything in that revised operating income guide that maybe has to do with the changing mix or just maybe one level deeper into the revised operating income guide because maybe for me, that was a little unexpected given the unchanged revenue guide. So just maybe one level deeper if you can. Yes. Thanks. And I will certainly go into that. So first of all, we did extra hires in Q2. We were able to -- even overachieved on our internal targets for hiring because we were considering a very tight and competitive job market out there and with over 160 net additions, we're starting into the H2 in a strong position from the hiring perspective and we will continue to be doing that as we go into the second half.
And it's going to be really stepping on the gas that go to market hires in the second half. And it's coming from -- and the other part that I would dive into the other part I would dive into is that we overachieved in Q2 bookings.
Our guidance, as you pointed out as well, and as we pointed out several times this morning, that we believe we're beating up our original internal forecasts on bookings for H2. And that's really going to drive up our variable amounts as well into H2.
So when we consider where we are on our position for hires going into the second half when we consider our targets for our go-to-market hires going into the second half and increased expenses related to the fact that we actually are booking more business in Q2 and are expecting to do some more in the second half, we're seeing a rise. And that's what's contributing to the under the hood to that change in the operating expenses. And I will just add that nothing changed in our approach to run a highly efficient, profitable business, But there -- as Josh mentioned, exiting Q2 with such growth and the faster transition to subscription and adoption across -- of SaaS by the enterprise and a favorable competitive landscape in market fundamentals, we believe that that really justify increased investment in go-to-market and scaling of the Company, that they'll support the acceleration of the business and build the momentum that we've been talking about today. Got it. Very helpful, guys. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So I want to ask the subscription transition question this way. Obviously the mix is much better than you originally expected, who is not choosing subscription? Especially when you talk about the new customers coming on, what's the profile of the Company that says, ""You know what, subscription is just not for me."" Yes. Sterling, I'll start. I would say that were primarily very pleasantly surprised by the adoption across regions and across verticals and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we even have critical infrastructure companies and large lot of global 2000 and 2500 adopting it.
And it's happening across the board and across geographies. As Josh mentioned, 83% of the new logos, were SaaS subscription, so it's really happening. If I were to point the verticals that we expect them to be laggards in the adoption, it's probably the global government vertical is where we expect them to be.
The later on the adoption and want to still kick off more in perpetual. And again, under government, you can also put some highly regulated verticals, but it's happening. And within the regions, APJ is adopting it, but well be slower in adopting a SaaS subscription. Makes sense. And then, Josh, one follow-up for you. I missed it if you said it, but you've given us kind of a great view on what revenue would have been if you didn't do the transition. But what about free cash flow? I think first half year-to-date, you're down about 5 million.
But in the perpetual maintenance, I would imagine you collect just a much bigger portion of the value than you do under subscription. Even if you don't have an exact number, can you just give us a framework of how to think about that? Yes. I mean, you're right on the SaaS, the subscription model, there's much more annual payments than in a classic perpetual maintenance model. And also let's remember that perpetual -- the perpetual piece is getting more money for the license portion as compared to a typical annual contract.
It's usually annual. The contracts could be two to three years breakeven before you get to the perpetual size. So I know the other piece, and obviously, I can't give you necessarily a framework, but there is some impact on cash flow relative to the mix success and subscription.
I would probably -- when we think about it, correlated to -- on the -- we've always been talking about cash flow being around 0% to 10% above Net Operating Margin but what we're seeing is still the same percentage over Net Operating Margin, but a lower Net Operating Margin. So that's where I would correlate the difference. Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho (ph). Hi, good morning. Let me echo my congratulations as well. Can you give us a little bit more color on the multi-product deals that you're seeing or platform purchases? And does SaaS make it easier for customers either to buy upfront or to add-on sort of additional products over time? Yes, absolutely, Jonathan. I think we gave some examples on the call. A customer that starts with the Privilege Cloud adds EPM faster. And we've seen it with the examples of customers going broad on the advanced security solutions.
So with the combined packages, we see everyone, every customer can land with third-party access, MFA and [Indiscernible] also. They get a good bite on the offering depending on how they land and then from there we can show value and expand. So it's definitely the power of the advanced security platform taking place. Got it. And are you seeing any evidence of potentially pent-up demand from COVID-19 or maybe companies that are taking a little bit more of a strategic review of their portfolio and they're now looking for either your SaaS solutions or the add-ons of some of these SaaS solutions on the Privilege Cloud side? Thank you. Absolutely the latter. I would say it's -- companies are being more strategic. They're in the new normal and it's time for them even with regards to SolarWinds and events of that kind. But the first was kind of reactionary.
What do we do to patch and solve and we're seeing customers across the board be very strategic across the -- how they're going to secure their future and looking to be more programmatic and definitely is faster in adopting in Cloud.
And we can see that also in the new logos where deal sizes have increased as they take a larger bite because they're being more [Indiscernible] can see it in our results for the third year in a row in the Gartner Magic Quadrant and really having the top leader position.
I think in the same time, we've seen the traditional PAM vendors switching on private equity and we're seeing disruption there. And so we're not waiting and pushing ahead on PAM. And then with our extension into identity security, we have the broad offering with PAM at the center, but the ability to push the full identity management suite and DevOps.
And in that realm, we obviously can counter the Access players and the DevOps players, but we win on having a security-first mindset with the customer and the fact that they trust us with PAM at the [Indiscernible]
The example that I alluded to and our win on the DevOps front is exactly where customers no longer -- especially after SolarWinds and the increased threat environment if they, I would say, more control shifting back to security-first mindset for the customer and here they wanted a security conduit to be the one securing and have the ability to secure all types of applications.
And we need to differentiate ourselves in the market with our secrets management that needed to be agnostic to what would be the chosen developer platform. Our partnership with Red Hat, and the ability to integrate all of that into their PAM. And so having the PAM platform and being able to secure throughout all types of applications was what led us to this win and many wins on this front. Okay. That's helpful, and I was going to ask you about Centrify, so I think you hit that. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. The deal you announced or I guess the transaction you announced, AWS purchase of Privilege Cloud or Privilege Cloud being purchased through AWS.
How significant is AWS as a channel? Is that more down-market, and how does that lead to follow-ons? Do you have a lot of visibility to increase the cash after Privilege Cloud is purchased through that channel? Thanks. I don't know. That's a great question and I will say that AWS is a new channel for us, but we're very excited about it because it compliments -- it's actually inclusive channel that works on top of our other channel partners, especially where our customers have existing AWS relationships and are able to buy through the marketplace.
So that was a great example we put out there where the demand was for CyberArk we helped the customer recover from ransomware into our Privilege Cloud and the ability for them to buy them through AWS really accelerated the whole cycle. And we have multiple integrations with AWS but we're moving up in the partnership with them and we're going to invest more in this go-to-market to be able to replicate down those wins. Again, in complement to our existing channels. That's very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver of Baird. Hey guys, congrats on the strong performance. So it's really great to hear how well Privilege Cloud is doing. But Udi, I'm curious if you can give us some color on adaptive, just -- it's been about a year since the acquisition. It seems like you've had some early traction there. But just, I'm just curious how you feel about the positioning there, especially with the security first messaging? I think it's -- we're very excited about the speedboat and how they're performing. And I would say this is a really a breakout quarter for them in the muscle of both landing new logos and also creating add-on opportunities within our customer base.
So I would say it's a newer part of the business, but the speedboat is well on its way with strong progress in the markets. We invested a lot with integrating our solutions and our ability for our customers to really see success from leveraging the connectivity to PAM, to vendor access, and the other things that we've brought to the table.
And the customers are very excited about what we announced at our impact events with secure web sessions and our ability to give them PAM life controls for all types of users. And so this will be available in the second half of the year and we expect that to give us an increased competitive advantage and a good why on why adopt Identity Security as a strategy. Yeah. No, that's great to hear, Udi. And that just -- I think you touched on some of these dynamics earlier, but when you look at net new era in the quarter, peeling back the layers, any seasonal impacts or dynamics or maintenance that we should be aware of in the quarter and as we're looking at 3Q? Okay. Jonathan, actually, I think there's nothing seasonal that I would point to. Everything on the maintenance side behaves according to plan and just we exceeded plan in terms of the business coming from SaaS and subscription.
I want to take this one opportunity though, to the question earlier around the percentage of ARR. For EPM I said it was about 20%. It's about 20% of the subscription ARR component that we have. So I just wanted to clarify that. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS. Hey, thank you. Just a quick question on perpetual and your expectations for the back-half year relative to the strongback kickbacks and 35% in arrow growth. Can you talk about if there's anything changing from an incentive standpoint from first half to the second half or is it just more of a go to market [Indiscernible] strive, doubles are coming online and customer demand is just organically going that way? So I think we talked about, we're expecting, again, a growing mix in Q3 with a 70% mix. And then in Q4, we're expecting more add-on business coming with perpetual. In terms of the teams, they're all incented to sell SaaS and subscription, we kicked that off in January.
They're all train -- all regions are running and pushing that. So the only nuance, which is a positive one, is we expect to add-on business from existing customers in Q4, which will be an increase in perpetual into that mix. So that would be add-on business, not any sort of conversion of maintenance revenue? It will be mostly add-on. There will be still even some new business because let's remember that the pipeline is still rolling out from a historical old pipeline going into the back half of this year, but it will be a combination, but mostly probably the add with some new business. Got it. Okay Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho. All right. Thank you for taking the questions. Guys, I know you introduced some new subscription packages at the beginning of the year and I would love to hear some more about how that's tracking so far. Yeah, I will say that all new pipeline is basically containing -- and of course deals that closed within the cycle is on the new packages that combine to restrict analytics, multi-factor authentication, and an often vendor access into the mix.
There is a higher value for our customer to adopt the new package of what they get from the get-go and what we're seeing both in pipeline and also in the first deals that were closed within a newly-created pipeline. All right. That's very helpful. Thanks, Udi. And then for Josh. So the acceleration of go-to-market investments in the second half, is this primarily greater sales capacity or will there be other aspects of go-to-market such as channel enablement, marketing, et cetera, that you might be significantly ramping as well? Yeah. Well, when we think about the incremental piece, it's really across all of the functions in go-to-market. It's heads and it's quota carriers, but definitely also related to overlays and channel managers and the likes, but really around the go-to-market engine. All right. Perfect. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick of Colliers. Thank you for taking my question. And good quarter. Could you just pull apart for me maybe the top five C3 players on your alliance that really help you drive revenue or cross-sell, up-sell within some of your accounts, thanks. Sure. I mentioned a few. I will put up Red Hat and SailPoint, and [Indiscernible] as well cloud-based, I'll probably add Proofpoint's in there as well, if I try -- if I go for a top 5. And with all of them, they have this really great collaboration in the field and also integration.
And on top of that, the CQ -- the power of the CQ over lines is really strong because there's variety. There are deals where customers want integration with their IoT devices and we have partners to support that, like Forescout.
And so it's also the power of the variety and also the focus on the top. And like I mentioned earlier we should add AWS in there as a thought partnering. And I gave example on the call with ServiceNow, so I'm beyond the five, right? Because there are multiple partners definitely. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Thank you. So your transition here has resulted in a pretty steep reduction in operating margins year-over-year from about 20% down to about 1%. Obviously that process continues out into '22.
And I know you don't give guidance for '22, but the street has a significant increase in EPS model for '22 yet I think your slide deck from your Analysts Day showed a decline in operating margins from '21 to '22.
Is a decline in operating margin still in order given the accelerated pace that you've already achieved, or alternatively, will that moderate a little bit more because you're already further into the process? If you could give us some directionality to margins for '22 based on your expectations around the transition, achieving 85% by the end of the year, fourth quarter, that would be very helpful. Thanks. So, thanks Alex. Nothing has changed in terms of the fundamental economics behind the transition of the model transition in the context that operating margin takes a hit as you transition through the model and get to the other side of 85% to 90% coming from bookings and it continues that way until you get to that point.
So what we talked about today is that we're excited that we're able to move that point up to more certainty, to being by the fourth quarter of 2022. So we do anticipate the operating margin to follow through our transition model to potentially go down through the transition into 2022.
What we liked though in terms of moving the transition table up, is that we'll be to now come out of the transition faster and typically you will then see the rebound of operating margin going up post the last transition quarter. So when we get to the end of '22, the way the model works on these transitions is then -- would then be able to rebound and go and return to the profitability earlier rather than later.
And I would add, we're still fundamentally sound on being able to achieve again, coming out of that transition, a couple of quarters on the other side of the transition to return to our rule 40 targets after that. And so basically moving it up to 8 quarters is basically moving -- is moving where we're going to come out back to profitability sooner. Super. And the accelerated hiring I think also adds to that pressure in '22 though, right? Yeah, but it's all part of a -- if we think about even the guidance for this year economically, our guide is still talking about, if you consider the headwind coming into 20% revenue growth with 13% operating margin, and obviously whatever we hire in this year is going to go into next year but fundamentally, we're still focused on being able to hit the transition and then afterward be able to rebound to a Rule of 40 Company going into the following year. Great transition. Thanks. Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO Udi Mokady for closing remarks. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees for contributing to our strong second quarter and supporting our fast transition to a subscription Company. I'm confident that as we execute our strategy, we will build even deeper relationships with our customers and partners. Again, thanks everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Erica Smith. Please go ahead, ma'am. Thank you, Lisa. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's third quarter 2021 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website, as well as risks regarding our ability to actively transition the business to a subscription model, the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies and our ability to adjust in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. We also want to remind you that we provide the calculated headwind calculation for additional color on the impact of our subscription bookings mix shift but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Q3 was another amazing quarter and we are thrilled with our results. If I could use only 1 word to characterize this quarter, it would be acceleration, acceleration in the demand environment, and the underlying growth of the company, specifically bookings and in the metrics that demonstrate the health of the business. As examples, subscription ARR growth accelerated to 131%, reaching $139 million. Total ARR growth accelerated to 38%, reaching $344 million. Recurring revenue growth accelerated to 41%, reaching $89 million and new logos added during the quarter accelerated to over 230.
Our standout performance in Q3, following an incredible second quarter was again driven by record SaaS bookings, record total bookings, the execution of our subscription transformation and robust demand for our Identity Security platform centered on Privileged Access Management. Customers are embracing the subscription model as evidenced by 72% of new license bookings coming from SaaS and subscription in the third quarter, ahead of our guidance framework. Even with the revenue headwind from this mix, we generated total revenue of $122 million, above our midpoint, demonstrating again that our bookings were considerably higher than anticipated in our guidance. One way to think about the growth of the business is to isolate the license line adjusted for the calculated revenue headwind. This would represent license growth of faster than 50% year-over-year, which is indicative of our overall growth. Simply put, it was a stellar quarter.
As we have talked about throughout the year, our subscription mix, ARR and recurring revenue demonstrates the progress in the subscription transition and the strong demand for our SaaS solutions in particular. The 4 pillars of growth, subscription transition, innovation and profitability provide a great backdrop for today's discussion.
Let me start with growth. I love starting here because our growth trajectory has never been stronger. Excellence in our execution and the strong secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud migration and attacker innovation contributed to the acceleration in our business. With the acceleration in attacker innovation, our customers now contend with operator-driven ransomware, malware as a service and the tax on automation and supply chains and the DevOps pipeline. It is no longer enough to have an assumed breach mindset. Instead, enterprises have to dig deeper and take and assume identity posture. They recognize that every identity across human users, applications and bots can be privileged under certain conditions. It is easy to see why customer and prospect interest in our solutions is at an all-time high.
Looking at our geographies, we had another perfect game across our major territories. When you adjust for the calculated revenue headwind, every region grew total revenue by over 27% with license revenue obviously growing even faster across the Americas, EMEA and APJ, which Josh will talk about more. New business accelerated, and we added more than 230 marquee customers, as I mentioned, from law firms to software companies, oil and gas to retailers, to large government agencies. We want customers across the spectrum, demonstrating that every organization regardless of size or vertical meets our identity security platform. We typically land with PAM and momentum for Privileged Cloud continues to build both in the mid-market and much deeper in the large enterprise. In fact, in the third quarter, a Fortune 30 company signed our largest annual contract for Privilege Cloud ever, a great win that demonstrates the increased adoption we are seeing in our enterprise customer base.
With our subscription model resonating and SaaS taking off, customers are adding both more users and more products faster. And for customers with large self-hosted footprints, they are expanding with Privilege Cloud to secure new business units that best set pipelines or applications. Endpoint Privilege Manager, or EPM, had another record quarter as the crippling effects of ransomware continue to drive demand. Not only is EPM an expansion opportunity within our customer base, but it is also proving to be a great landing spot for new logos like a large food retailer, a born in the cloud software company and a large local school system to just name a few of the Q3 wins.
The increased focus on specialized resources from the Access and DevSecOps speedboat continued to pay off this quarter. Productivity levels increased in all regions and our cross-sell activity has improved considerably. Access had another strong growth quarter in Q3 with both exciting enterprise wins in our base and a broader set of customer wins in our commercial and emerging markets. I will talk more about our innovations in a few minutes, but identity security where access is tightly alive with PAM is differentiating CyberArk with customers.
I want to highlight a few more customer examples from the third quarter. In a highly competitive deal, an existing financial services customer 1 is the benefits of our identity security platform and will be replacing a legacy access solution with CyberArk Identity. A new financial services customer will be using Privilege Cloud and Conjur to secure secrets. This organization recognizes that securing both human and nonhuman access was critical particularly as every company becomes a de facto software company. Our ability to secure applications anywhere is giving us a nice competitive edge in the DevSecOps space, a high-profile pharmaceutical company bought Privilege Cloud. But more importantly, is committed to implementing a comprehensive identity securing program and PAM is just the first step.
A large insurance company expanded with every 1 of our solutions. They began their journey with CyberArk in 2010, expanding their Privilege Access program along the way. In Q3, they went deep and brought with CyberArk embracing our identity security platform, buying Secrets Manager, Privilege Cloud, remote access, endpoint, Workforce Identity and Cloud Intolerance Manager. We pride ourselves on our culture, building strong lasting relationships and putting the customer at the center of everything we do. This win demonstrates the power of our portfolio, and it shows the criticality of our relationships with enterprise customers. Our partner ecosystem is further extending our reach and driving scale in our go-to-market. Our certification programs have been stepping up as we focus more and more on leveraging our partners to drive growth.
Year-to-date, through Q3, we certified close to 20% more professionals than we did in the full year 2020. This commitment to invest in comprehensive training programs is a testament to the opportunity and significant growth our channel partners expect. A number of our partners are going even deeper into identity security and acquiring companies, including The Herjavec Group and CDW making strategic acquisitions in our space.
Next, I would like to focus on the subscription transition. We made strong progress and outperformed our expectations in the third quarter. Our transition continues to be driven by strong demand for our SaaS solutions, and we reached another new record for SaaS bookings, with particular strength in Privileged Cloud, and endpoint privilege manager. We have completed 3/4 of our active subscription transition and the number of customers with over $100,000 in ARR is now more than 760 growing faster than 40% year-over-year.
As we expected when we began the subscription journey, customers are getting faster type of value and prioritizing our platform, which will result in higher lifetime value over time. We are thrilled with the progress of our subscription transition. And with our success year-to-date, we are confident we will exit the transition by the third quarter of 2022.
Our innovation pillar is the foundation of our strategy, continues to put more distance between us and the competition and further strengthens our leadership position. We announced earlier this week the general availability of Secure Web Sessions, in workforce and customer identity solution. Secure Web Sessions merges the worlds of access and PAM. We are now the only vendor in the market that can empower customers with continuous authentication and session protection, including session recording for all types of web applications from business apps to cloud consoles. We are pleased to see our innovation recognized by industry experts. We were named a leader in the Forrester Wave Identity-as-a-Service for enterprise and an overall privileged access management leader by KuppingerCole. And just yesterday, we announced that we were named the Only Visionary in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Access Management. We believe we are the undisputed leader in PAM and are leveraging this position to extend our expertise into access.
I will wrap up my discussion with some comments on the profitability pillar. As you've already seen from the acceleration in our business, our investments are paying off. The headwind on profitability from the subscription transition is obscuring the P&L. Given the strength of our bookings, which gives us more scale and our track record of delivering profitable growth, we are well positioned to return to strong profitability levels.
To sum up Q3 quickly. Our business is accelerating on the back of record year-over-year bookings growth. SaaS is leading the way and reached a new record quarter this quarter. Privileged Cloud is pushing into the large enterprise and EPM has moved into the mainstream security discussion. Our subscription transition is making strong progress. Our industry-leading idea security platform across PAM, Access and DevSecOps has never been more relevant.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide you our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Josh, over to you. Thanks, Udi. Before we discuss the details of the quarter, we would like to remind you that we posted slides to the website that will be helpful as we walk through our results. As Udi mentioned, we had a great third quarter, our license bookings growth meaningfully accelerated even in comparison to a strong Q2 2021. We also made significant progress executing both our subscription transition and our identity security strategy.
In terms of the headline P&L, we delivered total revenue of $121.6 million with a 72% mix of subscription bookings ahead of our guidance framework of a 70% mix. As you may remember from last quarter, revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and a higher subscription bookings mix demonstrates that our total bookings beat our expectations for the quarter. Subscription revenue, which includes our SaaS and on-premise subscription revenue reached $35.3 million and represented 29% of total revenue in the third quarter, increasing in 143% from $14.5 million and only 14% of total revenue in the third quarter last year. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $63.3 million with $53.6 million from recurring maintenance and $9.6 million in professional services revenue. We continue to have a strong renewal rate on our maintenance renewal business.
Recurring revenue, which includes our subscription and maintenance related on perpetual license revenue reached $88.9 million or 73% of total revenue, growing 41% year-on-year from $62.9 million and 59% of total revenue in the third quarter last year. With a 72% mix of subscription bookings, it is clear the subscription transition is ahead of schedule. Economically, the headwind created by the mix was approximately $16 million in the third quarter when we compare like-for-like to the mix of the third quarter 2020. Normalizing for the mix shift, growth in the license portion of our business, our SaaS, on-premise subscription and perpetual accelerated again in the third quarter to over 50% and is illustrated on the underlying growth in the business. Taking the calculated revenue headwind into consideration, total revenue growth accelerated to 29% year-on-year.
Moving on to the annual recurring revenue. We experienced our largest ever sequential increase in the subscription portion, adding about $29 million in the third quarter and reaching $139 million, representing over 40% of the total. Our total ARR was $344 million, growing 38% year-on-year, that's an acceleration from the second quarter of 2021. The maintenance portion was $206 million at September 30.
We had another great new business quarter, both in terms of new logos and business trends. We signed more than 230 new customers with 85% of them opting for subscription compared to about 59% in the third quarter of last year. New business deal sizes also increased again in the third quarter.
Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. The Americas generated $68.2 million in revenue, representing 56% of total revenue. The Americas, again, had the strongest percentage of subscription bookings during the quarter. EMEA had $39.7 million in revenue or 33% of total. APJ generated $13.7 million in revenue or 11% of total revenue with an increasing mix of SaaS and subscription.
If we look across the geographies, adjusted for the calculated revenue headwind created by the mix, each region would have grown by over 27% of total revenue, with our license line growing even faster than 50% in the Americas and APJ and approximately 30% in EMEA.
Online items on the P&L will now be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our third quarter gross profit was $102.5 million or 84% gross margin consistent with the 84% gross margin in the third quarter of last year. We continue to make investments to drive innovation and growth, resulting in operating expenses of $102.4 million. That's a 34% increase year-on-year and operating income was $130,000 in the quarter, which was better than the midpoint of our guidance. It is important to remember that our operating income is lowered by about $1.5 million from FX rates and approximately $16 million of headwind. On a like-for-like basis, neutralizing the calculated revenue headwind and foreign exchange, our operating margin would have been approximately 12% in the third quarter of 2021.
Over 70% of our operating expenses are related to headcount. So in the third quarter, we surpassed 2,000 CyberArk employees, ending the third quarter with 2,075 worldwide. Of our total employee count, 925 are in sales and marketing. Net loss for the third quarter was about $2.4 million or $0.06 per basic and diluted shares. In the first 9 months of 2021, free cash flow was $47.1 million or 13% free cash flow margin. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Turning to our guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the robust industry tailwinds, our record booking, strong execution year-to-date and improved productivity. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue of $140 million to $148 million. We expect a non-GAAP operating income of about $5.5 million to $11.5 million for the fourth quarter. We expect our EPS to range from non-GAAP net income of $0.06 to $0.21 per diluted share. This guidance assumes about a 68% of subscription bookings mix and a calculated revenue and profitability headwind of approximately $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.
So if you isolate our license lines of SaaS, on-premise subscription and perpetual, the normalized growth we are taking into account the calculated revenue headwind for the quarter is about 24% year-on-year. Similarly, for the total revenue, the growth rate would be about 19% at the midpoint of the range, taking the headwind into account. Our guidance also assumes 41.7 million diluted shares.
For the full year of 2021, we expect total revenue in the range of $491.6 million to $499.6 million. The mix assumption underlying our guidance for the full year is 65% from subscription bookings and our revenue headwind for the full year is now approximately $68 million. This represents an increase from our prior guidance, which assumed a mix of 64% from subscription bookings and a $63 million headwind to revenue.
Taking the calculated revenue headwinds into account, our revenue growth rate would be approximately 22% at the midpoint of the range. And if you isolate our license lines, SaaS and subscription and perpetual, the normalized growth rate is over 30% for the full year, taking the calculated hammer into account. I want to emphasize that increasing both our total revenue guidance and our mix indicates that we are again increasing the bookings assumptions underlying our guidance for the full year. This raise is above and beyond the bookings beat in the third quarter.
Now moving down the P&L. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $13.1 million to $19.1 million. We expect our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.25. For the full year, we expect about 40.9 million weighted average diluted shares and about $13.5 million in taxes.
We wanted to briefly mention our current thoughts on the timing of the transition and on ARR growth. Given our success year-to-date, we expect to exit the transition earlier, and we now expect to complete the transition in the third quarter of 2022 versus the fourth quarter of 2022 as we outlined in our August call. Also, given the acceleration of our growth and our record bookings this year, we expect annual recurring revenue to grow about 37% year-on-year. That's an increase from our prior framework of 35%. The third quarter was a great quarter and another important step in the execution of our subscription transition and our identity security strategy. Our business is accelerating, which you see in our results and recurring revenue growth rates. As we look ahead, we are in a great position to deliver long-term growth and profitability.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Udi, maybe just to start with you. It feels like you and the team have been talking about broader identity versus just Privilege here a lot more recently. I was just wondering if you could just talk about how the non-Privilege part of the business is doing. I know you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but maybe just go 1 level deeper. How is the non-Privilege part of the business doing with Access and DevSecOps, for example? And to what extent do you think customers want to buy both of these parts of the portfolio? Does that make sense? Yes, absolutely. Sure thing. So I would say we're excited by the performance of all parts of the business and the fact that Privilege Cloud SaaS is leading the way. But as I mentioned, identity security and our message is really resonating with customers. If you look at the other elements, what you're calling the non-Privilege, first of all, we had EPM have a record quarter this quarter and is proving to be also a new landing point or a landing spot for new customers and really gets also the drivers that are related to Zero Trust and ransomware. And then when we look at the Access of DevSecOps speedboats, they have the power of both appealing to our existing customer base and that is resonating with the identity security message, but also having that speedboat overlay effort that is getting them into new accounts and again, into the upsell. More and more of our customers are buying the wide portfolio. I gave the example of the customer that bought all of our products, that is happening. And I would say that in every conversation and pipeline build, it's across the entire portfolio. I think with some of the bundling, they're actually getting a taste of elements of access, for example, in early deals. And again, I'm excited that the Privileged Access Management piece is on fire and leads the way and with the customer loyalty, we have the opportunity to upsell and get those new landing spots. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. It sounds like we're going to exit the transition a quarter earlier than what you had originally expected. Can you just remind us sort of what that means from a mix? Or anything from a mix perspective or just anything we need to keep in mind from a modeling perspective, just kind of given that earlier exit? Yes. Thanks, Saket. I mean, the main thing is that when we talk about transitioning out of -- into a fully subscription company, we're talking -- we kind of put the threshold that when we get into past 85% of our bookings coming from SaaS and subscription. So when we talk today, about moving that quarter end from Q4 in the last call to now Q3, we're talking about kind of hitting that threshold of 85% or more -- bookings coming from coming from SaaS and subscription in the third quarter already. And what that means is that you'll continue to see the percentage going to perpetual decreasing particularly over next year. And then, of course, there will be after that kind of a tale of the remaining perpetual business happening after the third quarter. But it's really -- we set out a playbook at the beginning of the year, and we're really glad to be able to keep improving on that playbook quarter in, quarter out. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Maybe just on Secure Web Sessions to start. It seems like an interesting product. And you talked about that in the prepared remarks. I was just curious, kind of are there any particular users or verticals where you think something like this would be more demanded? No, absolutely. We're very excited about it. We see the proliferation of privilege that you have more and more cases where a business user is actually privileged and the organization is worried about having no control over the session. So I would say 1 major part is IT like functions in a business user, whether they're using HR applications or a business application like a Salesforce or a success factors and others. But then also the folks using web sessions for administrative like functions like the web consoles and others. So there are elements that are IT like and there are elements of business users. And in terms of verticals, we actually see it applying across verticals, all companies. Of course, the more regulated will tend to want to put those controls even faster. And the beauty of it is that it can run on any single sign-on solution that doesn't have to just attach to CyberArk, and it gives us the opportunity to sell the solution and apply these PAM like controls to all companies across the -- that even have identity management in place. That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. In the slide deck, you talked about the bookings by vertical. It's just interesting to see that over the last several quarters, banking and financials, it becomes a smaller part of the mix as other areas are growing faster and manufacturing stands out. So I'd love to hear more about what's leading to the success you're seeing in some of what I’ll call your less traditional verticals. No, absolutely. I think historically, CyberArk saw the more regulated verticals jumping into the fray earlier and the trend over the last couple of years is Privileged Access Management and identity security consider best practice across all verticals. And you see a catch-up. This quarter, we saw energy the energy vertical, global government, manufacturing more than doubled. And so I would say we're continuing to be applicable to all verticals. There are some verticals that are in a faster catch-up mode. And of course, we have a very strong customer base in the financial sector, and that will continue. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Udi, first question for you. I was wondering if you can comment a little bit about the growth and opportunity you're seeing in machine-to-machine identity, in particular, just given the rise of open source tools. Any sort of comment there? Yes. And I wanted to add on my earlier answer before, I talked a lot about the opportunity in our Access as we thought that that's very much in the secrets management world, there's growing awareness definitely after SolarWinds and like you mentioned, the proliferation of the DevOps pipeline as the place where attackers are going after. And if you stole a human secret or if you stole a strong machine-to-machine type secret, you can get similar access or even deeper. And so it's definitely applicable to all companies, and we're seeing that grow. We see more and more customers also want to leverage the fact that they can buy our secrets management solution and leverage Privilege Cloud as a solution to attach to. And of course, a lot of the self-hosted customers are expanding to secrets management, and we'll now consume this in the subscription model. So you're right, it's a growing trend where there are -- there's a proliferation of secrets across applications and machines. And if we had these special glasses, we would see, yes, a big proliferation of credentials on the human side, but an even faster and probably out of control on the development side and on the application side, and we're going after it. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up for for Josh. Just on the ARR, how should we think about the puts and takes with subscription versus maintenance? And then obviously, maintenance is going to be a bit of a drag just given the transition. So how should we think about kind of modeling that over the next few quarters? Yes, absolutely. We're going to see still a very high growth on the subscription piece of the ARR that we've been seeing. We saw it grow to 131% in the third quarter, and maintenance of the perpetual will kind of continue to trend kind of flat at some point as we get to the transition quarter, we'll start to go even could go potentially minus sequentially. So I think the way we kind of look at it is we can consider already the subscription piece of the ARR business are already crossing over the 50% in the first half of next year. Today, it's around 40% of the total ARR and growing to more than 50% of it in the first half of next year. And in terms of the exact timing of when the maintenance will start to go negative, it's later on in next year, and it really depends on the mix rate. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. I was wondering if I could follow up on Hamza's question actually. 4Q has historically been a relatively heavy perpetual license quarter. So maybe if you could give us a little bit more color around what the previous changes in incentive compensations to skew the efforts towards SaaS, what the impact is with regard to what you typically see or have typically seen on the perpetual side? And then how do we think about progress with the installed base with regard to kind of transitioning the SaaS. What do you see in your pipeline? And maybe any -- anything you can call out with regard to potential volatility on the perpetual side in fourth quarter? So Brian, I'll start with your second piece. I think the way we approach -- the way we approach this transition was always do right by the customer and follow the trend. I think we were even surprised like I alluded to the existing self-hosted customers are embracing and without us having to push them, they see that as part of their road map. So you see that in the right timing, they also consider and look for ways to adopt our privileged cold solution. Some examples, and like I gave in the script, are some very large CyberArk customers that were self-hosted that bought our Privilege Cloud for new business units or for M&A, where they want to put these controls faster and up and running quickly. And so they'll -- and others are excited to adopt other SaaS solutions like our EPM or identity and look at Privilege Cloud as the solution as they start to downsize their data center, but we will allow them to do it in the right time for them. And of course, every new solution out here has been SaaS, and we're seeing those adopted.
In terms of the incentive, we, of course, put out the program at the beginning of the year incentivizing the team to sell SaaS and subscription with that always do right by the customer. And so existing customers that have had on business lined up for Q4, we're definitely expecting that. Yes. So -- and I'll add, Brian, in addition, we set out to what Udi just said, we set out a clear playbook for transitioning and included the incentives to the sales teams, as Udi just pointed out, but it also included a full-blown education package of how do we move through going from selling perpetual to selling to SaaS and subscription. And for this year, we're really focused on incentivizing them to quote and to create new pipeline on the SaaS and subscription, which has been definitely happening for us. We've -- we see the majority of our new pipeline coming out as to asset subscription. And I think it's also indicative when we look at 85% of our new logos from the third quarter where SaaS and subscription-based new logos. Specifically around Q4, we do anticipate seeing more perpetual business in Q4. It's not really related to the -- to our compensation or incentive plans, it's just that Q4 is our largest quarter, and also we sell to enterprises. So there's typically budget flush and deals that are opening and closing in the fourth quarter, and those will be to be more add-on deals with existing customers and adding on more licenses in their current installed base, which is most likely going to be a perpetual installed base. So we do expect to see in the fourth quarter a tick up in perpetual. But then again, as we go into next year, we'll start to see more and more in SaaS and subscription because most of the new pipeline this year has been created in SaaS and subscription, and that hence our ability to move in our target to the third quarter of getting over 85%. Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just real quick for a follow-up. Given the pull forward in expectation for completion of your transition, thoughts on the -- how you think about spending, I mean, great innovation on the platform. We see the elevated R&D costs. Sales and marketing spend is also elevated relative to historical growth rates. But how do you think about when we might start to see to let an inflection back to kind of double-digit profitability in operating margins and better profitability given the shift in time line forward? Yes. I think it's basically a shift. I mean we -- the way the mechanics work and the transition is going to be all the way through the transition quarter, and the next 1 following is usually the trough of the operating margins. And then you start some slow increasing 1 to 2 quarters after year through the transition. So the early -- the faster we bring in the transition, then we get faster, we can get back there. But we can't control the fact that going through the transition to the end of that quarter. It's still going to take 1 to 2 quarters afterwards before we start to see it rising from there. The rise is not going to be in a single quarter, is going to be gradual over several quarters post that transition. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Just wanted to, I guess, start with EPM, just given the success that you're seeing there, is there any change to your thinking around how large EPM could be as a product area? Just want to get a sense for that. Jonathan, it's 1 of the areas where we're -- again, they're all our children, so we're excited about all of them. But EPM is 1 of those that has the -- it's a best practice of reducing risk and removing least privilege but it also is very effective against ransomware. So we think the opportunity is great. And we finally got to a point where the awareness is there for us to further step on the gas and leverage this growth engine. So I'm not going to -- we're not going to refine the TAM numbers we put out there because we saw this opportunity, but it is maturing and like I said, becoming a mainstream awareness that -- of a strong and important control to put in place, both as part of a wider Privileged Access Management program, but also stand-alone. We've put things in place that also bring it more as a landing spot for us, both in how our sales team works but also the type of channels that are expanding and taking us there and even down to the mid-market with channels like CDW that can bring this into the mid-market. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird. And congrats on the strong performance. Udi, it's great to see the success you're witnessing with Privilege Cloud. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more detail about the adoption trends you're seeing in terms of new customer acquisition versus installed base expansion and what you're seeing in terms of those adoption trends across commercial versus large enterprise? Yes. I would say that we're very excited to see the acceleration in the new logos. And part of that is, the solutions are more relevant before the attack surface is expanding and we've built this record pipeline over the past 18 months that we're converting. I think we're seeing in the logos more landing spots with EPM with -- and of course, with Access and with PAM. And the speedboat structure really provides a more subject matter experts to take the opportunity. And then as I mentioned before, we have been investing in the channel and the channel programs, and those are paying off for those landings. So those include the CDW, but they also include doing more with AWS and others.
Now with regards to enterprise versus commercial, if I understood it's really going after both enterprise has been our sweet spot, but with these expanded channels were able to go further down market and it's moving from the highly regulated to the less regulated part of the mid-market, which is exciting. And maybe you could talk about that push in the commercial. Where are you in terms of driving that enablement amongst your channel partners? Is this something that becomes more material as a driver to bookings as we look into 2022? I think we want to be -- we want to excel in both Enterprise is the holy grail for CyberArk, it's where we're coming from, and we have the strongest customer base. But we saw that double down our efforts on the commercial without distracting the enterprise focus again because it's incremental types of channels and a focus team that that is going after the commercial space. And so yes, you'll see it continue to be a major source of growth. But of course, the larger deals and the larger ASP is coming from the enterprise part of the business, which is really embracing the identity security messaging and appreciating the innovation we put in place. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about the adaptive customer base and what you're seeing out of these customers in terms of their willingness to upsell the PAM and just general recognition of your strategy of a privileged access centered identity security strategy. Yes, absolutely. I think the biggest motion is upselling the PAM customers on Access and our DevSecOps and Secrets Management. So that's the -- of course, the majority of our 7,000 customers, and we formed those deep relationships where they're happy to explore covering that proliferation of privilege into workforce users into their suppliers, into the third-party elements and to secrets management. The motion of the pure Idaptive customers from the acquisition, the most important piece over the last -- over the last year was to make sure they're happy and growing and then also introduce additional elements to them on the PAM side. But like I said, the bigger motion is expanding with our PAM customers across the portfolio. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. So Udi, I know that existing customers have a loyalty incentive to move to SaaS and with all of the success that you're seeing with respect to the overall subscription transition. I'm wondering if you're also seeing more migrations from on-premise to SaaS? Okay. Yes. Yes. So we incentivize, obviously, our salespeople, but #1 thing is to follow the -- and allow the customers to execute the strategy in their base. But of course, they see the new bundled packages, and that's incentivizing them to look at our subscription, which really -- even if they're an on-premise customer to get more value with add-on business coming into the subscription packages. The move from it for an on-prem customer to adopt -- to move to SaaS is more gradual among the enterprise while we find ourselves pleasantly surprised like some of the examples I gave in the Fortune 30 customer that more and more enterprises are also migrating taking on Privilege Cloud. We'll see that as a pathway over the year -- in the coming years. And 1 of the strength of CyberArk is really giving customers optionality on how to consume the identity security portfolio. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. So Udi, in your prepared remarks, you talked about SaaS driving more users and driving more users faster. Is that a SaaS adoption comments? Or is this democratization of Privilege by SaaS and the fact that there's broader applicability now, especially given the attack surface? I think we're seeing the classic benefits of SaaS, where there's quicker type of value. A customer does not have to install and go through the process of taking care of the infrastructure, and we deliver success packages. And so they get up and running. They see it's working. They see that it alleviated a lot of -- they gave them both security but also the ability to manage their infrastructure faster. And then you have a faster path to the upsell of more users of Privileged Cloud or at our business on other elements of the portfolio. So I would say the benefit of faster time to value, faster time to innovation and an overall quicker path to an add-on sale. But we -- but it's all very real in CyberArk. We put the customer in the center and the entire organization is all about creating customer value. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Great quarter. I guess now that you're getting close to the end of the transition with the big question is you're going to have a hard core of customers who are still stuck on perpetual and what is it that you're going to do about and meaning are you going to terminate what is the time line by which you will stop offering perpetual? And what are the odds that midpoint or late next year, you actually raise prices on your maintenance in order to push that last bastion of customers into the subscription model? Yes. We have -- I think our constitution puts the customer first. So -- and that customer loyalty has really worked for us. So I think it's going to be much more on the carrot side versus the stick for them to see more value in the subscription packages, a taste of other elements of the portfolio as they pick up elements of the subscription packages. And overall, we're seeing that they are open to it, especially as they are on a maintenance renewal with CyberArk and are open to expand and take on the subscription packages. And of course, let's remember that maintenance is a great recurring revenue for us as well. And the opportunity is out there to gradually bring them on to the subscription journey and definitely to lead with SaaS to the SaaS journey. And that's the -- and to the prior question, that's where they're going to see even greater value in the transition.
I don't know, Josh, if you want to add anything on. Yes. No, I think you covered the points and the main issue is that as they add on more and more sales, they're going to be really incented because of our great subscription packages to kind of move their current installed base to an add-on sales to be subscription based. And it's also a form of a tech upgrade for them if they want to now reverse and get that same tech upgrade for their installed base on perpetual. So we see it happening pretty naturally, but there will be a tail once for -- but it's happening naturally as we see it today. Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Trebnick with Colliers Securities. Udi, could you try to quantify the new business, how much is that really being driven by the acceleration or organizations to really undertake Zero Trust architectures? Yes. Sure, Catherine. I couldn't give a number, but I would say that all the strong business drivers out there, our business of Zero Trust and also the protection against ransomware are strong drivers for our business. And even in the executive order and other elements, it's very clear that least privilege and putting PAM controls is really a basic tenant to achieve Zero Trust. So I would say it's in every customer conversation, definitely at CIO and CSO so level. They like the connection of how CyberArk with PAM at the center, but also the full identity security approach is part of them getting to a Zero Trust or executing on the Zero Trust framework. So it's a great -- a great driver on top of all the enablement we provide and, of course, the proactive protection they can get with our solution. I was -- I want to touch the enablement side because I think the beauty of this portfolio is that we both are a proactive security layer, but we're also really allowing them to get digital transformation going and connect to their suppliers, connect their remote workforce, allow their IT to transform and modernize. And so it's all part of the supporting tailwinds for us, but Zero Trust frameworks are right out there. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolf Research. For my first one, I was kind of hoping when we think about the broader identity space, can you just comment on the demand environment, but specifically compare and contrast the demand for Privileged Access Management versus the demand for access management, and maybe how does this compare to 6 months or even a year ago? Yes. So I would say a year ago, we didn't have this combined motion of going after the existing customer base. I think we benefit from the 2 worlds right now where for a customer looking to put in that critical layer of Privileged Access Management, CyberArk is the market leader, go to us. We have the go to market, the reach and the opportunity to really capture that demand is strong and the strongest I can recall for Privileged Access Management. Access is a new motion for us and -- but it's a huge growing market because of the need to enable digital transformation. And we can write it -- and the way we're doing it is very much centered on our customer base that trust us on PAM. So I would say they're both in strong demand. PAM is definitely the 1 that resonates the most with the CISO is a layer that they must have and need to present to the Board. And I would say, even a basic pillar of their cybersecurity strategy. So PAM is more of cybersecurity driven. Our PAM customers trust us with the expansion to the rest of the portfolio, and Access gets the driver of digital transformation and enablement, which is also here to stay. Your next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim Securities. Can you comment on your Fed performance in this quarter? And any products that show strength in that vertical? Absolutely. So I would say the Federal for us, it was not -- we did see the same levels of budget flush like in previous years. We mostly attribute that to the new administration and budget, but the awareness is stronger than ever. I mentioned the executive order that touches elements of Zero Trust and least privilege and I would say a lot of engagement with various agencies and with our partners in the Federal market. I can share that the global government vertical, if we look at in a full bucket grew more than 100% for us in Q3. And it's very much led by Privileged Access Management as the major, I would say, grower in this segment, where many agencies, many governments still need to do the basics around Privilege Access Management. I also mentioned that the SLED vertical, the state and local and education vertical performed really well in the quarter. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. First question, I just wanted to touch on the cross-sell motion. Obviously, we're talking about customers once they come to SaaS or subscription are incentivized to continue down that track with their add-on sales. Curious, do you guys have enough data at this point to give us a sense for that cross-sell motion where customers are typically going to next? What's the -- where are they congregating to within CyberArk's portfolio? So it really varies on -- I would say that a PAM, a pure PAM customer would typically expand the EPM as the kind of the next stage of a PAM program. You've secured servers, but you left your endpoints and exposed with over privilege. So it's kind of the next step in the cross-sell. And I did mention earlier, but we're also partnering with the EDR and the XDR companies to actually make it. So the EPM list together and nicely with our partners on that front.
And then from that front, if they're executing on a PAM or an identity program, there's the expansion to secrets management because it's the other side of privilege and then securing their applications and then, of course, to access. And so I would say that if I had to generalize, that would be a course for a PAM customer. In a new account, we're actually seeing that we can land with multiple products as again, the awareness of both what's the best practice in PAM and the bundled elements of identity security we can land with more. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks, everyone. I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for contributing to our strong third quarter and supporting our transition to a modern subscription company. I'm confident that as we execute our strategy, we will build even deeper relationships with our customers and partners. Thanks, everyone. This concludes today's conference.

Welcome to CyberArk Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advise that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Erica Smith. Please go ahead. Thank you, April. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk’s fourth quarter and year end 2021 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s best judgment based on currently available information.
I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the first quarter and full year 2022. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and those referenced in today’s press release that are posted to CyberArk’s website, as well as risks regarding our ability to actively transition the business to a subscription model, the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies and our ability to adjust in response to the global -- to the COVID-19 pandemic. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today’s press release, as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today’s call.
We also want to remind you that we provide the calculated headwind for additional color on the impact of our subscription bookings mix shift, but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today’s call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. It was a record breaking year for CyberArk best characterized by transformation, outperformance and acceleration. Momentum continue to build as we move through 2021, culminating in a record fourth quarter. The most important takeaway from Q4 is that we experienced another step function increase in demand for our platform, with our SaaS solutions driving our performance.
We delivered the largest ever sequential increase in ARR of an incredible record Q3. Subscription ARR reached $183 million and growth accelerated to 146%. Total ARR reached $393 million and growth accelerated to 44%.
Again, in the fourth quarter, we significantly beat our bookings assumptions, resulting in total revenue of $151 million and the 71% of booking mix, with a $33 million calculated revenue headwind, all above the guidance framework. While subscription transition max the underlying growth of the business, if you adjust for maintenance bookings, our license line grew by about 40% in the fourth quarter.
Geographically we had another perfect game, every region outperformed our guidance framework. From every angle it was stellar quarter. Operations, we outperformed against our strategic imperatives to drive growth, execute our subscription transition, continue to deliver innovation and profitably scale our operations.
I will frame today’s discussion around these pillars starting with growth. We are one of the best -- we are in one of the best positions if not the best position to drive long-term sustainable growth. The strong secular tailwind of digital transformation, cloud migration and attacker innovation gathered more steam in the fourth quarter and continue to push Identity Security to the center of every customer discussion.
As we all know, 2021 kicked off under the dark cloud with SolarWinds and we ended the year with the Log4j vulnerability, with countless attacks in between. Most recently, Cisco published an advisory of a state sponsored advanced persistent threat or APT in this attack and others throughout the year. Stolen credentials were the common denominator leverage in the attacking. The threat landscape is the most aggressive that I’ve ever received. With our foundation intact, we are in the best position of any vendor to address the any security challenge.
Our results demonstrate that enterprises agreed. While post-breach activity is a small part of our business, we have been fully through engagements in the wake of these attacks, as the second call the hybrid mediation firms, because of our trusted advisor status and cybersecurity experts.
Beyond secular tailwinds we make the right strategic moves at the right time. Supercharging the acceleration of our business, we formally rolled out our Calculation Program early 2021, creating centers of excellence in PAM, Access and DevSecOps, unifying our experience under one umbrella our customer experience under one umbrella and driving the business towards a recurring revenue.
Each quarter in 2021 was significantly better than the previous, with our execution kicking into an even higher year, our Q4 often incredible third quarter, as I mentioned. Importantly, productivity is back well above 2019 levels. This combined with the increased sales capacity creates a strong foundation for growth in the quarters ahead.
SaaS reached -- yet another record with particular strength in Privileged Cloud, Endpoint Privilege Manager and CyberArk Identity. The growth in our Privilege Access Solutions outstripped industry estimates for 2021. On the Access and DevSecOps front the increased focus and specialized resources significantly improved our competitive position.
From a bookings perspective, Access more than doubled in 2021 and we have key competitive enterprise wins for Secrets Manager. We will talk about innovation little bit at Secure Web Sessions and Dynamic Privileged Access are game changers, moving us further ahead of competition.
Optimizing our go-to-market machine paved the way for our record new business this quarter, with more than 375 new logos added during the quarter, a material increase in new business deal sizes.
A few new ways to highlight, as part of this digital transformation, a large broadcaster bought our Identity Security platform because of its foundation in PAM, including Privileged Cloud, Endpoint Privilege Manager, Secrets Manager, Remote Access and Cloud Intolerance Manager.
A travel and transportation company that has outgrown a competitive PAM offering is moving to Privileged Cloud because of our scalability and SaaS types of value. This customer is one among many, turning to CyberArk to meet today’s rigors cyber insurance requirements and charity expected picked up in 2022.
The crippling effects of ransomware contributed to a record year for EPM and also the strong growth in PAM. Our two largest deals in the quarter were expansion from PAM into EPM. We signed our largest ever EPM deal with a European manufacturing company and the major deal into a large U.S. banks. In fact, EPM was a eight of our top 10 deals in the quarter.
With our subscription model resonating and SaaS taking off the velocity of our business is picking up steam with customers adding on both more users and more products SaaS. As examples, expanding from PAM to Identity a regional investment bank that has been work -- has been a CyberArk customer since 2012 and require the efficiency of workforce identity for all its users added to Secure Web Sessions.
As part of a broad PAM program, an existing insurance company -- customer needed a single pane of glass for managing all human and non-human identities, and expanded from core Privileged Access to the Secrets Manager.
Traditionally our customers have leveraged PAM as a jumping off point for their identity security programs, as our platform model is gaining momentum, we are excited to see newer EPM and Cyber Identity customers extended to PAM. In Q4, a global food manufacturing company, a CyberArk Identity customer extended their cyber program with Privileged Cloud, Remote Vendor Access and EPM.
Strengthening our partner program was another focus area in 2021. We are deepening our relationships across our first Global System Integrators and Advisories, Managed Security Service providers, Cloud Marketplace and CQ partners.
On the Cloud Marketplace side, our business with AWS continued to gain traction in the fourth quarter and our pipeline quadrupled. Marketplaces are a productive, efficient, highly scalable, complementary new route to market for CyberArk.
Moving to subscription transition, our transformation is well on its way. And as we mentioned, we outperformed again in the fourth quarter. Our SaaS products continue to lead the way and we are already seeing the flywheel effect. We are confident this will result in higher lifetime value.
We now have more than 890 customers with over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue. Given our success in 2021, we are accelerating the transition exit and expect to reach about 85% of bookings from subscription in the second quarter of 2022 or in just six quarters, which is well ahead of our initial timeline outlined in February of 2021.
Innovation is a core pillar of our growth strategy, and in 2021, we introduced Secure Web Sessions and Dynamic Privileged Access. The pace of demand for Secure Web Sessions is incredibly strong. In the first few weeks after GA, we have key ways and strong pipeline heading into 2022.
Secure Web Sessions harnesses the power of both IDaaS and PAM providing PAM security and controls with a frictionless user experience. It is an elegant solution and no other vendor in the market can provide this level of operational efficiency and security in a single platform.
We also won early Dynamic Privileges Access for EPA customers in Q4. EPA uniquely positioned CyberArk as the only vendor which secures both static and dynamic privileges regardless of environment, from born in the cloud, to hybrid, to self-hosted. We are hearing from customers that the combination of EPA and Secure Web Sessions changes the competitive landscape for Identity Security.
I will wrap up my discussion with some comments on profitability. Our investments in 2021 delivered exceptional returns. With our strong execution, the inflection in the demand environment and our incredibly favorable competitive positioning across PAM, Access and DevSecOps, we plan to invest in growth and innovation in 2020.
Our investments demonstrate the competence in our unprecedented opportunity as a data centric security models are now a requirement. Our approach to investment hasn’t changed. We invest in step with the demand, our focused on impactful spending and given our track record, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth.
Our priorities heading into 2022 include, complete our subscription transition by the second quarter, invest in our global sales organization, including our partner ecosystem to drive growth, protect our ARR by investing in customer success, support and services, and invest in research and development to enhance our data security platform and drive innovation. With our turbocharged performance in the fourth quarter, we are in an incredible position to execute against our massive opportunity.
I will now turn the call over to Josh who will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide you our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022. Over to you, Josh. Thanks, Udi. We’d like to remind you that we posted slides to the website that will be helpful as we walk through our results. So, as Udi mentioned, we had a record fourth quarter, tapping off an incredible year of acceleration, outperformance and transformation.
In terms of the headline P&L, we generated record total revenue above the high-end of the range of $151.3 million in the fourth quarter, with a 71% mix of subscription bookings. That is ahead of our guidance framework of the 68% mix. We were thrilled to again see both revenue and mix outperformance, really a great demonstration of the strength in our bookings.
Before digging deeper into the P&L revenue, I want to highlight our annual recurring revenue, which illustrates the step function change in the demand environment for the fourth quarter. We experienced our largest ever sequential increase adding $44 million to the subscription ARR in the fourth quarter alone. The subscription portion of our annual recurring revenue reached $183 million, representing over 46% of the total and year-over-year growth accelerating to 146%.
Just one year ago, the subscription portion was only $74 million or 27% of total. Our total ARR was $393 million. That is an acceleration to 44% year-on-year versus 38% year growth that we showed in the third quarter of 2021.
The maintenance portion was $210 million at December 31, and reflects our strong renewal rates. The acceleration in our ARR is driven by the strong demand environment, transformation of our business and great execution of our go-to-market engine, all of which sets us up very well for 2022 and beyond.
In addition, we are pleased with our increased visibility from the strong execution of our transition. We ended 2021 with remaining performance obligation of $516 million. That is 42% growth from year end 2020.
Moving to revenue, subscription revenue that includes SaaS and self-hosted subscription reached $47.6 million and represented 31% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. That’s increasing 142%. Consistent with our transition progress, perpetual license revenue declined to $38.7 million, our maintenance and professional services revenue was $65.1 million, with $55.3 million coming from recurring maintenance and $9.8 million in professional services revenue.
Recurring revenue defined as our total subscription plus our maintenance related to perpetual license revenue reached $102.9 million or 68% of total revenue, growing 48% year-on-year. We continue to have a SaaS revenue transition with nearly 50% of our total bookings coming from SaaS, with our mix reaching 71% in the fourth quarter, we have made great progress transforming CyberArk into a subscription company.
Economically, the headwind created by the mix was approximately $33 million in the fourth quarter, when we compare it like-for-like to the mix in the fourth quarter 2020. Normalizing for the mix shift growth in the license portion of the business, our SaaS, self-hosted subscription and perpetual would have grown about 40% and demonstrates the underlying growth in the business. Taking the calculated revenue into consideration, total revenue growth would have accelerated to 28% year-on-year.
New business also accelerated in the quarter, we signed more than 375 new customers and that’s a record. New business average deal size is also increased by just over 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand for SaaS in particular.
Geographically, the business is well diversified. The Americas generated $86.2 million in revenue, representing 57% of total revenue, the Americas again had the strongest percentage of SaaS bookings during the quarter. EMEA had $49.3 million in revenue or 33% of total revenue, with SaaS bookings more than doubling over the last year. APJ generated $15.8 billion in revenue or 10% of total revenue, with SaaS and subscription now over 50% of bookings for that quarter.
If we look across the geographies, adjusted for the calculated revenue headwind created by the mix each region would have grown by over 25% in license revenue, with our license line growing over 25% in EMEA, about 45% in the Americas and over 60% in APJ. Normalizing for the revenue headwind, our licensed line grew over 30% in each region on a full year basis.
All items of the P&L will now be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $130.1 million or an 86% gross margin. That’s compared with 88% gross margin in the fourth quarter last year, primarily the result of the increase in our SaaS business in 2021.
We continue to make investments to drive innovation and growth, resulting in operating expenses of $113.8 million, a 31% increase year-on-year and operating income of $16.3 million in the quarter, significantly beating the high-end of our guidance.
It is important to remember that our operating income is lowered by $2.2 million from foreign exchange and approximately $33 million calculated revenue headwind. Isolating for the calculated revenue headwind, our operating margin would have been approximately 26% and adjusting for the FX impact, the margin would have increased by another 2 points to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Net income was $11.8 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenue was over $500 million and that’s a great milestone for CyberArk, reaching $502.9 million, with a 66% subscription booking mix for the year.
This resulted in a $74 million calculated headwind for the full year and taking the economic impact from the headwind into consideration, the year-on-year comparison would be over 35% license revenue growth and 24% total revenue growth.
To underscore how great a year 2021 was for CyberArk, I wanted to reflect on the guidance we sat in February 2021. The top of our revenue range was $496 million and that assumed a 55% mix and a $39 million headwind.
We generated revenue above the range and our mix reached 66% or 11 percentage points above our framework, which resulted in a total calculated revenue headwind in 2021 of $74 million. The bookings underlying our results materially beat the assumptions in our guidance. As Udi mentioned, there was a step up function increase in demand for our solutions with momentum building both in our bookings and in our pipeline, as we moved through the year.
Moving to the full year P&L, operating expenses increased by 31%, as we invested to deliver against the strong demand. Operating income was $23.9 million and our EPS was $0.33 per diluted share for the full year.
We continue to attract and retain top talent, a testament to our culture and our success in the market, adding 450 new employees in 2021, the highest number in a single year. We ended December with over 2,100 employees worldwide, with 942 employees in sales and marketing.
For the full year 2021, free cash flow was $65.8 million or 13% free cash flow margin. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we now ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Turned into our guidance, our guidance for the first quarter of 2022 and a full year reflects the robust industry tailwinds, a record pipeline build, incredible execution and acceleration in our bookings. And so for the first quarter of 2022, we expect total revenue of $125 million to $133 million.
We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about $16 million to $9 million for the first quarter. We expect our EPS to range from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.42 per basic and diluted share to $0.25 per basic and diluted share. The guidance assumes a jump up to about 79% of subscription bookings mix, and a calculated revenue and profitability headwind of approximately $13 million for the first quarter of 2022.
So if you isolate our licensed lines of SaaS, self-hosted subscription and perpetual, the normalized growth rate taking into account the calculated revenue headwind for the first quarter, would be over 50% year-on-year for just the license portion.
Similarly, for the total revenue, the growth rate will be at 26% at the midpoint of the range taking the headwind into account. Our guidance also assumes 40.3 million basic and diluted shares and about $2 million in taxes.
Looking at the full year 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $580 million to $598 million. The mix assumption underlying our guidance for the full year is 85% from subscription bookings and our revenue headwind is approximately $53 million.
And now moving down the P&L, for the full year we expect non-GAAP operating loss to be between $34 million and $20 million. We expect our non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share to be in the range of $0.98 to $0.64, and for the full year, we expect about 14.7 million basic and diluted chairs and about $10 million in taxes.
For the full year, the increase in our expenses are related to four more major areas, increasing investments in our cloud infrastructure to support our record SaaS bookings in 2021, which will lower our gross margin for the full year to between about 80% and 81%. Changes in exchange rates are increasing our expenses by about $7 million over 2021 in particular for R&D and G&A. We are continuing to make critical investments in R&D, including our SaaS and self-hosted solutions.
And lastly, the investments in sales and marketing, we have deep conviction and the opportunity in our incredibly strong competitive position. More importantly, our productivity levels continue to increase, our win rates are strong and our pipeline is at record levels, which supports productively stepping up our investments to help ensure we capture the opportunity and sustain our strong growth in 2022 and beyond.
At our Investor Day in March of 2021, we discussed the trajectory of the transition, which we expected to take eight to 10 quarters and ARR are to grow at about 30% through the transition. Given our success in 2021, we now expect to hit our original transition target of about an 85% mix from subscription bookings already in the second quarter of this year or only six quarters from when the transition kicked off in the first quarter last year.
As we have consistently pulled in a subscription timeline, it impacts both the growth and profitability curves of the transition. The rebound in revenue is already starting in 2022 with 17% growth and about 32% growth in the licensed lines expected at the midpoint of the guidance range.
As with any transition, a faster timeline has an impact on the bottomline, creating a deeper near-term bottom in margins. While the shape of the transition in terms of revenue growth and operating margin is relatively consistent, the slope of the curves we talked about in March last year are steeper with a faster transition now.
Given the acceleration in our business, we expect annual recurring revenue to be between $530 million and $536 million at December 31, 2022 or 36% growth year-on-year at the midpoint. As we look into 2022, we do expect the maintenance portion of ARR to begin to decline, while this drag -- while this will drag the total growth rate we expect rapid growth in the subscription portion. With our strong performance in 2021, we are on our way to meet $1 billion ARR target, which we now believe we can achieve already by June of 2025.
In terms of free cash flow, we anticipate that will be in line with our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period. We also expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $15 million and $16 million, which represents just about 3 -- under 3% of revenue at the midpoint.
The fourth quarter was a standout quarter to round off an amazing year at CyberArk, the business is firing on all cylinders. As we look ahead, we expect to hit our subscription transition target goal much faster than we originally anticipated. Our sustainable growth drivers paired with outstanding execution from our team put us in a great position to deliver long-term growth and profitability.
I will now turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Great to see the ARR acceleration. Thank you, Saket. Maybe if I can just a two-part question that’s kind of related for both of you. Udi, again, on the ARR acceleration, just starting high level, what do you think is driving the demand? It sounds different? So I’m just kind of curious how you position that? And then, Josh, for you, the guide for next year assumes nice growth in net new, you touched on some of this in your prepared remarks, but can you just kind of lay out a little bit more about sort of what gives you the confidence in guiding to that, that healthy net new ARR. Sorry, there’s a lot there, but does all that make sense? Absolutely. So I will kick it off. We really executed, I would say, executed and fired all cylinders against a strong and growing demand environment. What we’re seeing is that companies are recognizing the importance of PAM and Identity Security as that layer in the platform you need and that assume breach environment in this heightened threat environment, whether either back to vulnerabilities like Log4j or SolarWinds and others you have to assume breach and we call it the assume identity, what are the attacker is going to go after, how will they propagate the attack and also identity is a landing point. And so conditions are aware of the importance of this layer with Privileged Access Management at the center and they was expanding to identity security controls and they partner with the market leader in the space that can support their complex hybrid environment and continuously invest in innovation. I would say that we’re in one of the most best competitive positions we’ve ever been. It’s very clear, if you look at the growth of the business in 2021 that in light of industry, industry reports, analysts reports that we’re taking market share. So going after this demand and executing against it and always innovating, because we see that we have their back for the long run. And Saket, I’ll add to the follow-up of your question, based off of what Udi just talked about in terms of the demand environment. I can look under the hood and we talked about record -- again record pipeline growth during last year. So we look at our pipeline levels and our win rates.
We also looked at the execution that we’re going, that we’re coming out of Q4 that we’re going into this year with and our productivity levels from our go-to-market teams in the last quarter and really over the last several quarters.
And I think the third point is that we talked about the hiring this year, we have built capacity to be able to meet that, that accelerating demand environment. And so, we really are confident about how we look at 2022. Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Your next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Hi. Good morning. Let me echo my congratulations on a very strong quarter as well. I guess one thing I wanted to understand a little bit better is, would you see this opportunity to incrementally invest on the sales and marketing side? Are there any particular geographies or verticals or that these new marketplaces. Can you just really help us understand, just given the strong backdrop, where you can have the most impact? Thank you. Yeah. Right now we’re seeing demand increase both in enterprise and in our commercial business, and we’re going across those two, I would say, as I mentioned, and globally, so the global opportunity across the organization. We, of course, the partners are writing stuff with us. There’s investing in everything has to do with increasing our work with the channel partners around the world.
And then, of course, everything that we’re doing around securing the ARR around customer success and walking our customers through this cycle. We’re very excited to see the platform in play and some of the examples I gave of customers really moving our cross products, if it’s taking more usage also growing cross product, and of course, we have the speedboats that are unique motion for us for both Access and DevSecOps and that’s another part of investment. So in all of the above and we’re confident that we are -- like, we saw in 2021 that we’ll see earnings coming from that. Your next question is from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on a question in line with what had Saket asked. So, Josh, for you, you obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the growth drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume maintenance -- let’s assume is just a flat, you’re guiding for about a 30% growth in net new sub ARR after what was a really strong acceleration in 2021. So I’m curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition? And put it bluntly, do you feel like you’ve given yourself enough wiggle room to really outperform like you did last year? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And I think you got it right. You -- it was important that you talked about the maintenance piece of the ARR as well, because we do actually and I call it out in my prepared remarks that we can and we will probably see -- start to see the decline even in -- on the maintenance ARR, but then the super growth rate on the subscription piece of the ARR.
And the competence, again, it’s really coming from, first of all, the faster transition and also the SaaS heavy side of the transition. And we’re seeing Privileged Cloud really being a big piece of that. And not just, we’re also seeing Privilege Cloud also going even further up market and we talked a little bit about our average deal size is going up as well, especially for new logos and it’s really tied to Privilege Cloud success also further up market and the value that our customers in the enterprise are seeing in the subscription packages and for the self-hosted as well.
So, I think that, the -- we feel confident about the ARR growth, about overachieving, we put out the number in our guidance, that we feel comfortable given, well -- given the information we have in front of us. We had great execution in 2021, but the -- for now the guide is the guide, but absolutely the demand environment is there for us to invest in. Your next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Hey. This is Doug on for Sterling. Thank you for taking my question. So in regards to the growth in subscription revenue, can you talk about how much of that is coming from new versus existing customers? Yeah. If we look at the -- if we look at our ARR incremental, we’re seeing about third of it coming from new customers and the balance coming from our existing customers. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Sterling. Your next question is from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to double click a little bit around the DevSecOps portfolio to understand, is it a lot of that coming from new customers? Is it an add-on? Is it being added into deals? So, is it the actual tip of the spear with new customer acquisition in some cases? Are you seeing it more as part of a suite as customers are looking at this more holistically? Thanks. Absolutely, Rob. Yeah. I would say tip of the spear are much or new tip of the spear are much more EPM and then CyberArk Identity as new landing places for us and strategically and that that was our plan. The Secrets Management and the DevSecOps portfolio is much more of an add-on business to our existing customers and expand from the humans to machine identities and the speedboat really supports that emotion with an overlay team to cater to those needs, and of course, customers want that full platform that covers both the human and machine. And so that’s primarily the case and it’s part of the CyberArk blueprint on how you guide customers to go deep in Identity Security. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Yes. Hi. This is Mike [ph] on for Gregg. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, have you made any changes to your sales incentives in 2022 to increase the emphasis of SaaS vis-à-vis perpetual licenses or perhaps even term licenses? Yeah. We made, I would say, the major transitions were in 2021. But I will say that we further ratcheted it up in 2022. And we recently had our global kickoff and it’s very clear that we are incentivizing our team to SaaS and subscription, okay. So I would say further -- and further ratcheted up on some of the things we put in motion in 2021 all ready. Great. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe just one for Udi and may be more of a longer term strategic type of a question. But if we think about the growing number of enterprise class companies with cloud native architecture, I’m thinking more like a, I don’t know, zoom or Airbnb. I know it’s early stages, but maybe you can hit on three areas in particular. I am curious to see how you’re seeing those types of customers invest in Privileged Cloud or Privileged Access differently than those more traditional hybrid models. How did their Privileged Access strategy and attacks evolve over time and how different is your go-to-market for those deals, as you’re establishing cyber to compete -- CyberArk to compete in those markets? No. Absolutely. I think one of the important strategic initiative for us is to cater to all types of enterprises, when we’re actually seeing a growing success in born in the cloud type entities, because we give them so much optionality, they can consume Privileged Cloud-as-a-service, they can consume our EPM as a landing point for least privilege on the Endpoint and also our new innovations around our like DPA, Dynamic Privileged Access allows them to manage workloads in the just in time environment.
So I would say with some of them the landing at the beginning part were may be different from a hybrid environment, they may look at more traditional core assets to start with first defending active directory, defending critical servers. But the opportunity is very large. They typically have a large number of users cloud native or born in the cloud with a large number of users both from privileged user definition, and of course, from a workforce definition, and a large number of machine identities that we can help solve with our Secrets Management. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Hi, guys. I have two questions. First is, can you talk about seasonality, I see that fourth quarter last year was also strong and I’m wondering if there is any new seasonality that we need to consider, the fourth quarter is becoming so strong? And then, second, was there any change in the channel or anything that could, demand is being created somehow, you spoke about very strong demand, I’m trying to understand if the demand just happen or you helped it through sales, channel relationship or anything that could explain this demand? And then I have a question on margins. Great. I’ll kick off maybe, Tal, with your second question on channel and hand it over to Josh to talk about seasonality. I think, as I started, first off, the biggest change is in the demand environment and there some trail and the importance of Privileged Access Management and Identity Security, as we have been investing in -- and taking a leadership position in what’s making money for our channels.
And in many of our large VARs out there, we will be in their top five, top 10 vendors and they’re giving it more attention advisories, building practices around CyberArk and new motions around, if you talk about some new motions around MSSP and what I mentioned with the AWS Marketplace.
So I would say, the ongoing investment and the growing priority within the customer and within the channel help us really to execute on the strong pipeline that we built. And yes, some new channel motions introduced as well. And on seasonality Tal, no, I think, we’re still very much an enterprise security software vendor and this is kind of the nature of the beast, and we’re seeing, I think, strong fourth quarters as we have for a while and we don’t necessarily anticipate a change at this point and I think it’s pretty much same. Got it. So, Josh, just on margins, so you are going through an investment phase now in cloud infrastructure. What’s the outlook? I’m not looking for specific numbers beyond, but what’s the outlook? Is this going to be multiple years of elevated investments or is it more of an initial investment followed by margin improvement as your volume goes up. I am trying to understand to what extent you need to invest over the next few years? Yeah. Excellent. I think this is -- we’ll continue to invest really into 2022 the same way that we’ve been looking at it over the last, since you’ve been following us, since the public offering, which is investing with the growth and the demand of the market and investing ahead of it to ensure that not only are we going to be able to meet the current years of growth, but when we look at, we always looking at kind of for multiple years and we want to set ourselves up for going into the following year to be able to meet the new capacity and the new growth for the following year as well.
So I don’t think anything’s really changed. There’s a specific incremental investment for 2022. There isn’t more, because we’re seeing a bigger demand and we’re scaling the company. And at this point, that’s what I would say, looking forward as well. Okay. Thanks. Your next question is from Adam Borg with Stifel. Great and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe for Udi on Endpoint Privileged Manager, it was great to hear the success and some of the deals you called out earlier. Maybe just remind us kind of where we stand now as in terms of the mix of ARR and what kind of uplift it provides relative to a traditional PAM deal? So, if you repeat the last part of the question. Yeah. Absolutely. And what kind of monopoly does EPM provide relative to, if you just started with core PAM or Privileged Cloud, what does EPM uplift look like? Yeah. So, first of all, in terms of the -- in terms of -- look, in terms of the outlook for the EPM is basically can be, when we looking at our SaaS perspective. Erica, you have that number? Sure. Yeah. I think he started off with what EPM was the percent of the ARR, which is about 22% and so it was right north of 20%. So, north of 20% now the EPM portion of the ARR. Great. I mean, it just -- yeah, no, no worries. And then any color on if a standard core PAS or Privileged Cloud deal is a dollar, what kind of uplift EPM was relative to that? Probably about, I would call it about half of that, an additional 50% on top of core PAS. Awesome. Thanks so much. The next question is from Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird. Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong performance. Udi, you’ve talked about PAM like controls for adaptive, Secure Web Sessions, particularly, which seems to be doing extremely well. I’m curious if you could just talk broadly, how you’re thinking about this identity security positioning strategically, just given the importance of Privilege? And what can we see in terms of additional security controls for the product portfolio to further differentiate? Yeah. So these are -- thanks Jonathan. These -- the fresh new things that we’ve rolled out are, like, I mentioned, Secure Web Sessions and Dynamic Privileged Access and you’ll see us -- and again, that’s -- Secure Web Sessions has been very new. But we’re seeing great excitement from customers to be able to defend the regular user. It could be somebody in HR, finance and others, but they’re able to both controls and protection over their session, that are PAM like, but in a transparent way to the user.
You’ve given even the ability to protect the session itself. So that’s new and you’ll see us extending that motion of bringing PAM like controls in a transparent way to the regular user. It also will take place and how we can -- we continue to advance our continuous authentication, making sure that we work in a continuous zero trust in that business verification model.
The other, I would say, long term and continuing investment we have is everything just in time to give more and more optionality for our customers to protect standing access, but more and more just in time scenarios, like, Dynamic Privileged Access, which is brand new and it’s a great differentiator for us. And stay tuned, I think, that’s going to be the -- why our customers select. They know that it’s coming from the makers of that, were now -- were not coming to you with solutions for your workforce, for your vendors, for your third parties, leveraging the same platform. That’s helpful. Thanks, Udi. Thank you. Your next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Yeah. Hey, guys. Great quarter. A couple for me, maybe Udi for you on the SaaS side. I want to double click on that a little bit. Is there any way you can unpack this for us a little bit in the context of how’s the adoption between new customers and existing ones. And with respect to new ones, are you -- is it bring it to the table new customers they didn’t have access to before, I’m just kind of trying to understand how this changes their landscape from a customer standpoint. And for you, Josh, just want to make sure on your guidance for the year, we’ve inflation all around. Are there any price increases that are -- that you’re implementing? And if so, how has they been worked into the guide? Thanks. Yeah. So I will say that the SaaS solutions definitely open up new -- have opened up and we’re seeing that roofing in new opportunities. If you take a look at the new logos, just the record new logos in Q4, about half of them would be, what we would call from the commercial market, which is are still kind of the small type of enterprise, but a new expansion [Technical Difficulty] really crossed verticals. So the ability to get into consumer Privileged Cloud and EPM SaaS, and of course, our CyberArk Identity, it opened up an opportunity further down market. But then I would say cross enterprise, the effect that they can get quicker time to value. It’s such an important layer against this threat environment, it just really expanded our opportunity to give so much optionality to the customer. So it’s really across the Board there. Yeah. And then with regard to the prices, Ittai, so basically, we didn’t do across the Board, because of inflation increases, but we did absolutely have some price increases across certain products and services and it is included in terms of the context of our guide as well. Very good. Thank you. Your next question is from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Good morning. Thank you for taking your questions. Josh, this one’s for you, just with respect to free cash flow. So it was nice to see the outperformance this quarter. But if you can help walk us through some of the thought process for calendar 2022 as you reinvest, as you accelerate the timeframe by which you are going to complete your subscription transition, as well as some of the drags on the perpetual maintenance or fading away. Anything you can help us vis-à-vis those factors and how we should be thinking about the shape and the complexion of free cash flow in 2022. That’d be really helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Great. The cash flow will -- we will definitely see some seasonality in the cash flow. We probably will see it being on the positive side in the beginning of the year in the early quarter, and then as we -- and then during the middle of the year, it’ll go down and then towards the end of the year, we can see again some improvement on the cash flow. So it’ll be kind of strong in the middle quarters. It will be weaker than towards the end. It could be stronger again. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Fatima. Thank you, Udi. Your next comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, historically, that’s kind of been the 800 pound gorilla in the room in the on-premise PAM market. But as you move to the Cloud, would you say your win rate suggests that you kind of maintain the status and you maybe become the 1000 pound gorilla. Any commentary on kind of the competitive environment and how your position has changed as the PAM moves to the cloud would be great? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. That’s one of the most exciting elements for us is that we are the market leader, no matter how you slice it in PAM and in Privileged Cloud, the solution basically has impact investments caught up and then went beyond what we offer on-prem. So the customers can really get the full solution with Privileged Cloud and we’re seeing great win rates and the ability for the customer, like, I said earlier to get quick time to value and expand faster.
So I don’t know what pounds to give it there. But I -- if we were to just slice it and say, hey, how is the leadership from a PAM perspective from -- in SaaS with a clear market leader is there just like we showed up on the Gartner Magic Quadrant three years in a row.
And in this space, we’re seeing that the PAM players have been continuously disrupted by PE and changing hands over the last couple years and really didn’t invest in R&D, while SaaS market continued to invest in R&D and innovation and continue to open up a stronger.
And then take it into the platform approach where we’re approaching everything as a platform sale and customers can say, well, we’re starting to do with Privileged Cloud, but while you’re -- you have been also security on the Endpoint and Secrets Management or on my workforce and vendors. And so that that’s really another great differentiator there for the SaaS motion. Udi, I want to interject here and make -- and just call out a correction. We said earlier that the EPM was 20% of total ARR and I want to make sure that it was clear that was 20% of subscription and our ARR was 40 PAM, so correct to that. Your next question is from Roger Boyd with UBS. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the nice end of the year. Udi, you’d mentioned the impact of the tighter cyber insurance market at the tailwind. I am just wondering also to what we’re seeing their higher premiums, lower capacity, is it possible to talk about maybe what percent of new deals you’re seeing being influenced by cyber insurance conditions and maybe how you expect that tailwind to hold up in 2022? No. Thanks for that. I would say it’s still not a percentage that we can put out there. It’s more anecdotal, but it’s coming up in conversation as another reason. So I don’t think we’re dependent on this driver in shape or form.
But it’s an additional driver that’s added to everything we’ve seen before, facility care and expanding that organizations needed. But now they’re already getting absolute for different elements of Identity Security, Privileged Access, Secrets Management, elements of MSA and protecting the workforce.
And the fact that they’re clearly asked for it as a condition for cyber insurance is, I would say, an additional tailwind. We definitely do expect it to persist. We think that is just emerging the cyber insurance companies and we know many of them they are finding that, all of their subscribers are in some shape or form getting attacked and they want to put meaningful layers in place to minimize damage and Privileged Access Management and Identity Security is one of those no brainer layers. Terrific. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Your next question is from Imtiaz with Guggenheim Partners. Yeah. Thanks. I have a question about adaptive, it’s almost six quarters since acquired the company, do you have any update on the ARR run rates for adaptive today. Then I have a follow up. I didn’t hear the end of that. As you… The adaptive -- ARR contribution from adaptive ARR, the adaptive product. Yeah. We are basically continuously increased after the first year, where we saw kind of the migration into CyberArk. We’ve now seen two quarters in a row where we just sequentially increased it by and I think it’s closing in on around the $20 million number. Got it. Thanks. And then for the ARR growth next year, as we complete the transition in the beginning of the middle of next year and the focus for the ARR growth, I guess, ramps up in the first half and then slows down, because now you are ending the transition and then ARR growth look much more with revenue growth, how do you think about the trajectory of ARR growth, I guess, first half and second half next year? I think you’re asking about whether or not there will be seasonality within the ARR growth. No, I think, we -- we are not guiding to ARR from quarter-to-quarter. But we continue to anticipate it growing the ARR every quarter, but we’re not going to talk about guiding for every quarter here. Your next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Great. Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape and not in the way that, I think, most people are thinking about it. So there’s a lot of blurring and swim lanes with people like SailPoint like and even HashiCorp getting into your space. But my sense is that that actually has resulted in an increase in demand for your products as the simulated awareness, but not necessarily impacted your share. And in fact, customers will see them come in hear the pitch and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the spin down initial versions of their products. So we’ve seen the stimulation in demand for Privileged Access as a result of the competitive, the lightweight competitive entry? Thanks, Alex, and I love your angle here. I think, first and foremost, increased demand environment and now increased leadership positions based on merit, having the better products will address all of these broad use cases and definitely Privileged Access Management and expanding to Identity.
I do agree that there has been more publicity to the space from that perspective with announcements of entry that -- a very early products where we do not see those products in the field and customers have heard of those preannouncements. And I don’t know how much we factor that into the awareness, but the awareness is off across the Board for Identity Security and that may be a probably some contributing factor. But the biggest thing are the demand drivers and all of these years of focusing on the customers and focusing on being a broad platform for Identity is bearing fruit for us in a very strong competitive position as strong as I can remember. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And I will now pass the call back over to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Great. Thank you very much. 2021 was an incredible year of transformation for CyberArk and I want to thank our customers, partners and our global, global employees for contributing to this historic year. Thank you very much. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all attendees are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Now, I would like to welcome Ms. Erica Smith. Ma'am, please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's first quarter 2022 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s best judgment based on currently available information.
I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the second quarter and the full year 2022. Our results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and those referenced in today’s press release that are posted to CyberArk’s website, as well as the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, its related impact on global economies and our ability to adjust in response to the pandemic. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made here in.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today’s press release, as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today’s call.
We also want to remind you that we provide the calculated revenue headwind for additional color on the impact of our subscription bookings mix, but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today’s call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks to everyone, for joining the call. We had a fantastic start to 2022. The business once again accelerated, momentum picked up additional speed, with our bookings growth rate accelerating off the record fourth quarter, a testament to our execution and the strong market fundamentals.
ARR continues to be the best metric to evaluate the health of the business. In Q1, subscription ARR reached $219 million and growth accelerated to 149% year-over-year. Total ARR reached $427 million and growth accelerated once again to 48%, and we have the best sequential increase in subscription ARR and total ARR outside of fourth quarter, outpacing our record-setting third quarter 2021 performance.
Josh will talk about it later, but given our incredible results we are raising our ARR guidance for the full year. We also achieved an important milestone, with the subscription booking mix reaching 86%, surpassing the transition target of 85%.
That achievement, paired with our great bookings in the quarter, demonstrate that our go-to-market organization has transformed into a subscription engine. We were thrilled to complete the transition in just five quarters, well ahead of our initial plan for an eight to 10-quarter transition.
Our strong bookings in the first quarter exceeded our guidance framework, so even with our significantly higher subscription mix, total revenue came in at $128 million creating a revenue headwind of about $21 million in the first quarter. Normalizing the mix of bookings to the first quarter of last year our total revenue line would have grown by about 32% in the first quarter with the license lines growing much faster.
Our results clearly demonstrate. First and foremost, Identity Security is more critical than ever, particularly given the significantly heightened threat landscape and geopolitical tensions. Second, demand for our Identity Security platform centered on privileged access continues to accelerate. And third, we are well positioned to execute against a multiyear durable growth opportunity.
I will frame today around the pillars of growth, subscription transition and innovation, starting with growth. Secular tailwinds of digital transformation, the adoption of zero trust and attacker innovation continue to push Identity Security to the center of every customer discussion. Geopolitical tensions, and Russia's invasion into Ukraine, have further heightened the incredibly severe threat landscape.
Our recent Identity Security threat landscape survey identified that the race to digitize created an explosion of human and machine identities and an acute cybersecurity debt. Unmanaged and unprotected identities are exposing organizations to significant risk, which could have crippling effects. Less than half of our respondents have Identity Security controls in place to protect their business-critical applications.
Another key statistic, over 70% of organizations surveyed experienced ransomware attacks in the past year, two each on average. Our survey results reinforce the durability of demand for Identity Security.
All of these factors came into play with customers and prospects in the first quarter. Privileged Cloud, Endpoint Privilege Manager and Access, all SaaS solutions more than doubled again. Momentum continued to build for CyberArk Identity with even more pickup in new logos, cross-sell and add-on deals in the first quarter.
In sequence management, we are increasingly securing across customers' application estates from DevOps, commercial off-the-shelf, self-hosted as well as Kubernetes and large-scale container environments. Geographically, we had strong contributions from all our regions with each exceeding our transition expectations.
New business doubled year-over-year. It was a great quarter. We signed nearly 250 new logos across customer sizes and verticals from airlines, cruise ships, schools and hospitals to board in the cloud software. Identity Security is becoming a universal requirement.
There were many great new business wins, but I want to highlight a few. In a 7-figure ACV deal, a major local government landed with Privilege Cloud and Endpoint Privilege Manager as part of its digital transformation to secure its Azure consoles Office 365, all network devices and much more. Scalability and protecting against ransomware attacks were key in this deal.
A travel and leisure company still grappling from the impact from the global pandemic picked up CyberArk because of our multiple deployment options, including remote access for both Sophos to Pen and Privilege Cloud. After trying to secure privilege with a homegrown solution, a board in the cloud cryptocurrency company landed with CyberArk to meet the increased compliance requirements in its industry. Superior security, customer integration and scalability were the deciding factors.
Cyber insurance continues to be a driver for our business. In one highly competitive access deal, a leading retail technology vendor picked CyberArk identity to meet its stringent cyber insurance requirements and aggressive Office 365 migration timeline.
We saw concrete examples of the heightened threat landscape and geopolitical tensions increasing the sense of urgency with some customers, including a major state transportation division that bought Privilege Cloud in response to the potential threat against critical infrastructure. We are also seeing increased velocity in our add-on business, customers adding more users and expanding to new solutions faster. As examples, a major health plan company is implementing a CyberArk Everywhere strategy to standardize on PAM, securing more privileged users and is also expanding into Secrets Manager for DevOps.
A Fortune 100 transportation company landed with PAM in 2018. The customer success team has built an amazing relationship with this customer and they will now leverage Endpoint Privilege Manager to secure across more than 75,000 endpoints, including 15,000 employees and 60,000 customer touch points. A state government expanded from Privilege Cloud to secure web sessions in the quarter to provide more visibility and protection across applications and users.
Our land and expand strategy is at work, and this customer is now evaluating a broad workforce identity rollout for our single sign-on and MFA. VARs global system integrators, advisories and manage security service providers are building CyberArk identity security practices across PAM, Access and DevSecOps. Enablement picked up significantly in the first quarter with both the number of CyberArk certified partners and the average number of certifications trending up.
Josh will get into the specifics of the transition dynamics, but I wanted to reiterate that we were thrilled to exceed our 85% booking target well ahead of our transition timeline and are now focused on operating and scaling as a subscription company. We are already seeing the flywheel effect in action. We now have more than 960 customers with over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, up over 50% from Q1 2021. We're even more thrilled that our transition is based on a strong SaaS foundation where we continue to see SaaS first in almost all regions.
On innovation, I want to highlight that while we have been transforming CyberArk into a subscription company, we have also been building the industry's most comprehensive, scalable identity security platform in the market. Our platform is centered on PAM to provide customers with the highest levels of security, but it extends well beyond to secure all human and machine identities. Along with the increasing demand for Privileged Cloud, our growth engines like Endpoint Privilege Manager, CyberArk Identity and Secrets Manager are making meaningful contributions to the business. Most visible is the strength of our subscription ARR.
We recently announced that CyberArk Identity achieved four lines of availability, which enhances security and risk mitigation and drive productivity gains. CyberArk Identity protects against the leading point of attack used in data breaches, compromised credentials. Our solution unifies SSO, adaptive MFA, user behavior analytics, life cycle management and directory services into one integrated solution.
CyberArk Identity, and Endpoint Privilege Manager also reached in-process status for FedRAMP high authorization. The government's most sensitive status for unclassified data in cloud environments, putting us in a great position to extend further into US Federal with new solutions.
In April, we rolled out EPM for Linux, significantly expanding our opportunity and building on the incredible growth in EPM. We are very excited to announce that we added Idaptive, a provider of advanced and modern no-code application integration and workflow automation to CyberArk. We acquired the company late in the first quarter and are looking forward to sharing more details about how we integrate their technology for access capabilities into our solution at Impact Life, our customer event in July.
With our roots in cybersecurity and our identity security platform centered on Privileged Access Management, we are in the best position of any vendor to help customers navigate the heightened threat landscape. We have an incredible opportunity to execute against this massive multiyear growth opportunity.
Before I hand over to Josh, I want to welcome to CyberArk a strong addition to the team in Simon Mouyal, who joins us as our Chief Marketing Officer. Simon brings 25 years of experience in driving strong growth, transformational change and leadership in SaaS companies. I'm excited to see how he and his team further improve our leadership position and continue to increase demand for our identity security platform.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our great financial results in more detail, and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, including raising our ARR guidance for the year. Over to you, Josh. Thanks, Udi. And we'd like to remind you first that we posted slides to the website that walk through our results. As Udi mentioned, we had a stellar first quarter to kick off the year. Momentum continues to build in our business, fueled by amazing execution and a strong demand environment.
In terms of the headline P&L, we generated total revenue of $127.6 million in the first quarter with an 86% mix of subscription bookings. We'll come back to the mix in a moment, but as a reminder, the combination of revenue in line with guidance and a mix higher than we anticipated demonstrates that total bookings again outperformed our guidance framework for the quarter.
Perhaps the best example of the momentum and the health of the business is the acceleration of our annual recurring revenue growth. Starting with the subscription portion, which reached $219 million and grew 149% year-on-year. The subscription portion now represents over 50% of total annual recurring revenue. And just a year ago, the subscription portion was only $88 million or just 30% of total.
We were thrilled with the sequential increase in the subscription portion of $36 million off the strong seasonality in enterprise software we saw in the fourth quarter. Total annual recurring revenue was $427 million as of March 31, with growth accelerating to 48% and year-on-year. The acceleration of the business in our first quarter off an incredible fourth quarter 2021 results when ARR grew also 44% really underscores that the business is firing on all cylinders.
Moving to revenue, subscription revenue generated from SaaS and self-hosted subscription contracts reached $51.9 million and represented 41% of total revenue in the first quarter. That's increasing 110% year-on-year. Consistent with the progression of our subscription transition, perpetual license revenue declined to $10.6 million. Our maintenance and services professional services revenue was $65.1 million with $54.9 million from recurring maintenance and $10.1 million in professional services revenue.
Recurring revenue, defined as our total subscription plus our maintenance related to the perpetual license revenue reached $106.9 million or 84% of total revenue, that's growing 40% year-on-year. With the strength of our execution, we are quickly approaching our target of more than 90% of revenue from recurring.
Our subscription bookings mix increased to 86% in the first quarter that's significantly ahead of our guidance of 79% bookings mix and now surpassing the subscription transition target of 85% we set. We reached our mix target in just five quarters, as Udi mentioned, well ahead of the 8 to 10 quarter subscription transition timeline that we outlined in the early 2021, substantially now completing the transition from a sales perspective.
Economically, the headwind created by the mix was approximately $21 million in the first quarter and when we compare it like-for-like to the first quarter of 2021 when the mix was only 51%.
Normalizing our growth for the mix shift in the subscription transition, the license portion of our business, our SaaS, self-hosted subscription and perpetual would have grown about 62%. Taking the calculated revenue headwind into consideration, total revenue growth would have accelerated to a strong 32% year-on-year.
Geographically, the business is well diversified. The Americas, in particular, had a standout quarter, generating $75 million in revenue, representing 59% of total revenue. The Americas, again, had the strongest percentage of SaaS bookings during the quarter.
EMEA had $39 million in revenue or 31% of total revenue, with SaaS bookings more than tripling over last year. APJ is also executing well with SaaS and subscription representing now nearly 75% of bookings, a great accomplishment for that region.
If we look across the geographies, adjusted for the calculated revenue headwind created by the mix, the Americas license revenue would have grown by over 100%, EMEA by over 30%, and APJ by about 10%.
All line items of the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our first quarter gross profit was $104.1 million or an 82% gross margin. That's compared with 85% gross margin in the first quarter last year, primarily the result of the increase in our SaaS business.
We continued to make investments to drive innovation and growth, resulting in operating expenses of $115.9 million, a 29% increase year-on-year and generating an operating loss of $11.8 million in the quarter.
Our operating results were lowered by $1.5 million from foreign exchange rates and the approximate $21 million calculated revenue headwind we discussed. Adjusting for the headwind and FX, operating margin would have been positive 6% in the first quarter.
Net loss was $11.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the first quarter. We continue to attract and retain top talent, a testament to our culture, and our success in the market, and we ended March with over 2,300 employees worldwide, that's including more than 1,000 employees in sales and marketing.
For the first quarter, free cash flow was $23 million or an 18% free cash flow margin. The strong cash flow is a result of our seasonally strong fourth quarter bookings, renewals, as well as just great collections. This cash flow contributed to our strong balance sheet and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Now, turning to our guidance, our guidance for the second quarter of 2022 and the full year reflects the robust industry tailwinds, execution and our growing ARR base.
For the second quarter 2022, we expect total revenue of $135 million to $141 million. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about $14.5 million to $9.5 million for the second quarter. We expect our earnings per share to range from non-GAAP net loss of $0.37 to $0.25 per basic and diluted share. This guidance assumes about 87% of subscription bookings mix and a calculated revenue and profitability headwind of approximately $15 million for the second quarter. Our guidance also assumes 40.6 million basic and diluted shares and about $2 million in taxes.
For the full year of 2022, we are raising the midpoint of our full year guidance and now expect total revenue in the range of $583.5 million to $598.5 million. We are also increasing the mix assumption underlying our guidance to 88% from subscription bookings, and our revenue headwind is also increasing now to approximately $61 million for the year. So for the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating loss to be between $33.5 million and $20.5 million. We expect our non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.60. For the full year, we expect about 40.7 million basic and diluted shares and about $10 million in taxes.
Given that we surpassed our subscription transition bookings mix of 85%, we want to reiterate the impact on the business for 2022. As we talked about last quarter, the faster SaaS-heavy transition is having an impact on the slope of revenue growth and profitability exiting the transition. For the next few quarters, we will continue to face a headwind to our revenue and profitability given last year's booking mix. Annual recurring revenue and the subscription portion of ARR are the best metrics to evaluate the health of the business.
As you saw from our guidance, revenue is rebounding already in 2022 with 18% growth at the midpoint of the guidance. We also want to reiterate that our approach to investment hasn't changed. The profitability of our operations is masked by the subscription transition, and we expect to return to the Rule of 40 once the transition dynamics play out. Given the acceleration of our business, we are increasing our full year guidance for annual recurring revenue, which we now expect to be between $535 million and $541 million at December 31, 2022. That's a 37% growth year-over-year at the midpoint.
We continue to expect maintenance ARR to decline, which impacts the total ARR growth rate. When you think about our guidance, it is important to note. First, the combination of higher mix headwind and revenue midpoint means we are increasing the booking assumptions underlying our guidance. And second, raising our full year ARR guidance after just the first quarter of the year demonstrates our confidence in the business and the strong demand we are seeing.
In terms of cash flow, while we had a seasonally very strong first quarter, we still anticipate that it will be in line with our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period. The first quarter was a standout quarter to kick off what I'm confident will be another stellar year for CyberArk. Our bookings mix target for the subscription transition is now behind us. We are focused on capitalizing on the massive opportunity in front of us.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open. Okay. Great. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Absolutely. Hey, Udi, maybe for you. Great to see the results, first of all, maybe you could just zoom out a little bit and just talk to us a little bit about the competitive environment, and to what extent you feel like the broader identity platform that CyberArk has is helping you competitively. Sure, thanks Saket, and great to hear from you. So I would say that honestly, this is one of the best, if not the best competitive positions we've ever been with in. On the PAM front, some of the traditional PAM vendors are, I would say, are still working through changing hands from private equity and the disruption there is long lasting. And particularly because they haven't been investing in R&D, and that starts to show up in sales cycles and in renewal opportunities.
And in this environment, in this threat landscape environment, it's just critical to make those investments and we're making sure that our identity security platform is -- we're investing in it, it's secure and we keep up with the pace of change in enterprise IT. So that's on the PAM front.
For Access, we see the IDaaS vendor, so Okta and Microsoft, in DevOps, we see Hashi. But our approach is fundamentally different. I think creating the speedboats or those business units we created in 2021 really made a difference. We're better at selling our platform to your question. And customers buy in on our security expertise with PAM, but they want to take the full journey for all identities, human and machine, with us across the platform.
And based on that expertise and the center of excellence we're selected, and I think we're also seeing it in the analyst reports out there, whether it's the Gartner Magic Quadrant for PAM and Forrester wafer for IDaaS. So I would say bottom line, the foundation in PAM really puts us in the best position to go after the full identity security opportunity. Got it, got it. Very clear. Josh, maybe for you for my follow-up. Great to see the full year go up, particularly the ARR. Just to make sure the question's asked, was there anything to note just on timing of deals? It felt like the beat in the quarter was stronger than what most were expecting on ARR. It feels like a portion of that is flowing through, not the entire thing. Again, understanding it's early in the year, so maybe that's the answer, but again, I just want to make sure the question was asked on how you sort of feel about the full year guide going up versus the beat in the quarter. Yes, hi, thanks, Saket and thanks for the question. The revenue in the quarter was impacted by really the great mix of outperforming on bookings, and the overall business that we saw from the first quarter. And our ability to raise for the year is because we outperformed in the first quarter, and we're increasing underlying booking assumptions for the year. And I think you also were alluding to it, but the fact that we're able to increase our guidance now for the ARR this early in the year really attest to our confidence in what we're seeing from the demand environment. Okay. Got it. I’ll get back in queue. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. And thanks very much for taking the question. This is either for either Udi or Josh, just on EMEA. So it's great to see the traction there, and you talked about bookings. I believe SaaS bookings up triple-digits, but just given the proximity to the war and your larger footprint, maybe just talk a little bit more about the demand trends you're seeing? And has anything changed either positively or negatively in the month of April? Sure, Udi here, and I'll kick it off. I would say we're fresh from actually meeting the EMEA leadership team in person and they are reporting strong demand and very strong pipeline. And if we talk about the macro attention, it's only creating a tailwind of urgency and the need to take a serious look at cybersecurity. So I think some of the trends we saw in the Americas in previous years of increased awareness are definitely reaching Europe. And for us, it's a well-performing region. That’s great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. So it was great to see a record new logos in 1Q, and you talked in the past about that improving velocity and probably the reduced friction in sales cycle. Just curious if you're starting to see a greater emphasis, more down market from your traditional, the enterprise stronghold and kind of what other investments you are making to better capitalize on that. Thanks again. Yes, so again, I would say on all fronts, both on the enterprise front and as we look in the commercial market, we're landing with SaaS. And we have more landing -- we have more landing spots with both Privilege Cloud, EPM and CyberArk Identity. In the commercial sector, as we call it, which is, again, the high end of the mid-market, certainly, they're embracing our SaaS solution and the fact that there is quick time to value, and you can see that, it's about two-thirds of those 250 new logos in Q1 came from that segment of the market. Excellent. Thanks, again. Your next question is from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Great. We'd love to touch on the new logo growth as well. Just given, I think what we've seen throughout the earnings season has been durability of spend, but it really feels like your business is seeing inflection here. So can you maybe speak -- you gave us the 250 number, but maybe speak a little bit to the pipeline that you're seeing as you head into the June quarter here. So we've been talking about the buildup of pipeline in the last several calls, and I think the great new business and the doubling of new business sales is actually executing on that record pipeline we've been talking about landing with more spots, like I just mentioned we're having more solutions is landing spot.
The channel strength and the channel pipeline, and also landing in larger deal sizes, which is often more products and more users. And I would say that the new business portion -- you're asking about the forward-looking pipeline, new business as the percent of pipeline continues to grow. So that trend continues, and it's that strong execution of the team against this demand environment. Great. Thank you for the color. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is no open. Hi. Good morning. And thank you taking my question. Maybe to kind of pivot off of Rob's question. Could you give us an understanding -- maybe a little bit of perspective, I guess, during the onset of pandemic, when you saw a little pullback in deal sizes and how the platform is being consumed, given the mix that you have now with greater SaaS mix and the greater awareness, how do you think about the durability of growth and if we were to head into a more challenging macro environment? Where do you think you might see either benefit or risk to the durability of growth with regard to how enterprises consume the platform? Absolutely. I would say, we're confident that we're looking at a durable long-term opportunity. We've done so much in these past two years to create a wide platform and increase our leadership position, expanding from PAM to Identity Security and having those initial, so many lending parts. If you look at the beginning, we talked about customers not being strategic. And if we talk about two years ago, are they thinking about this strategically, they definitely are. They see Identity Security and PAM at the center, as the vector of attack. And we're seeing that trickle across geography, across vertical. You see how diverse we are from a vertical perspective, and that's only strengthening.
And then the adoption of the SaaS solutions, as Josh mentioned, even in regions like APJ where we thought it would take longer here in Europe for the prior question, we just have, I would say, a stronger demand environment, a wider platform-based solution set to execute on that. And you have a management team that has seen different times and crossed those areas with great success. So we're very realistic. We look at numbers. When we allude to the strength of the pipeline and the demand environment, we really believe it's durable and strong. Great. That's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up, so I want to congratulate you on the CMO hire. I know, it's early days, but what do you anticipate you might see with regard to changes within the sales and marketing management structure of the company? And how are hiring trends, I guess, expected to be impacted due to the change? Yes, so we expect a smooth transition from an organizational perspective because this was highly embraced by the sales leadership team. And we all believe that we're -- back to your prior question, that we're actually in the best setup right now to step on that set of both on the gross marketing element, elevating our identity security posture and getting it out there, the leadership position that is reflected in the customer base and getting it out there and leveraging this flywheel effect that we're now seeing from that platform.
So we love that Simon comes from SaaS and in building great brands. And so it is basically hit the ground running. So our expectation is upwards and outwards. And like I mentioned, our next upcoming thing is our first event, our first live event out of the pandemic in July with our customers and prospects. Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Udi, I want to go back to the script. You talked about Linux support for EPM. I'm curious if you can characterize and quantify for us how much of that actually opens up incremental opportunity around endpoint privilege management that you previously weren't addressing? And how that might change the competitive or co-optitive dynamic with some of the traditionally defined endpoint security vendors.. And then I have a quick follow-up for Josh, please. First of all, great question, and I only have one sentence for it, but I'm super excited about EPM for Linux, because first of all, EPM is one of our strong performance and more than doubled for us along with the other SaaS solutions.
And I would say from a leadership position, it's just a great -- we're in a great place, but we've been addressing so far, Windows endpoints, Windows servers and endpoints and Mac endpoints, and this really takes us to the Linux platform, both servers and there are, of course, Linux endpoints as well and really taking us into our customers' cloud environments and for those who are hybrid to the data centers and giving them a UVA, that same easy to manage policies for lease privilege for the Linux environment, which is so important to -- in preventing ransomware and privilege escalation and all the, I would say, non-repeatable points of attack.
So I would say, it's within the huge TAM that we're addressing, but we went after the Windows environment first, and the team and our channels are very excited about this, and we'll make more of a splash at our Impact events.
From a competitive standpoint, I talked about standalone -- we have been fully partnering with the EDR vendors to date. EPM is not an EDR solution. It's an Identity Security solution for enforcing lease privilege on the endpoint. And we think that it applies just the same as we expand to the Linux environment. But from a standalone competitive standpoint, it gives us even additional advantage to do what we have today to be able to basically cover all platforms. And again, leverage the multiple learnings points we have. We have now to also Linux. And Josh, very quickly, I appreciate the EMEA demand environment and the feedback you're getting from the regional sales team, has been pretty robust and strong. But I was hoping you could more discreetly address any business activity in the conflict regions? And if there was any financial impact to your business vis-à-vis any suspension of operations, any write-down of business? Any quantification on your reserve current exposure would be very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, Fatima, thanks. That area, it's not impacting our results. It's already reflected in our guidance. We're not doing business there. And in total anyway, the whole area is less than 1%. So on the flip side, it's kind of a tailwind when you think about the geopolitical volatility, especially as it elevates cyber risk, but we don't see it being a material impact on us. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Very impressive acceleration in ARR, congrats as well on reaching subscription bookings transition so far, the target so far ahead of schedule. So, I had a question, Udi, on EPM as well. Can you maybe just expand on what has made EPM in particular, so much more valuable to the point where it's become a key driver of that acceleration that you've been showing? Yeah. I think it's -- the whole Zero Trust framework doesn't really work if someone can take over that end machine that somebody is establishing, that touch point or handshake with. The EPM really allows organizations to know that, okay, that endpoint will run with minimal privileges. We'll be in a lease provisional model and it's really foundational to Zero Trust. And then there's the additional added benefit discovered over the years. I mean it was -- at least it really prevents a malware from running and moving laterally and it's become an important force point for preventing ransomware from spreading.
And so we see those two major drivers and solutions to help basic cyber hygiene of running a lease privilege mode to support the Zero Trust framework and it helps prevent even ransomware landed. It helps to run most ransomware from landing, but even if it landed from proper gaming. And, of course, the many years of investing in making it super user-friendly is that it applies to all users in an organization, and they don't feel that, it's very transparent to the user. All right. That’s great. And then just as a follow-up, Udi, can you talk to how your global government business performed this quarter, as well as what your expectations are for this vertical over the rest of the year? Thank you. Yeah. No, absolutely. As you can see probably in the slides that we presented, the global government is nicely at 10% part of the pie. And really, I would say we're seeing steady adoption worldwide, and it continues to be an important vertical that we're investing in. I talked about the investment in the FedRAMP certifications to be able to begin to sell our SaaS solutions to the US federal government, but we're seeing adoption around the world both for SaaS solutions, but also for governments that do want our self-hosted. We're giving that optionality, and that's very important for them. And very often now, US certifications are giving us credit elsewhere around the world on our investments in the security and scalability of the platform. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So, really appreciate all the great detail earlier. Maybe just one for Josh. I'm curious as you think about your full year outlook, how are you handicapping for all the macro uncertainty out there? I get that security right now is fairly defensive given the geopolitical volatility. But in the past, CyberArk has had, I think, relatively longer sales cycles. And then in relation to that, how should we think about the seasonality in net new ARR for the rest of the year? Yeah. So thanks Hamza. I mean with regard to your first question, we're very confident about what's going on this year. Obviously, the economy will do what the economy was doing, but I think Udi addressed it earlier on today that we have a very strong, resilient type of a business model that is basically especially now with us hitting our subscription mix at over 85%, we're really now driving towards going through to the other side of the transition towards growth and profitability. And when we think about this year, the demand environment has not changed, and if anything, has strengthened in the course of time. I mean, I think we saw news even this morning of pretty material events in Costa Rica. And so we're continuing to invest.
However, I will point out that we're an experienced management team, and Udi already talked about this before. So we understand that we're constantly monitoring the situation, but at this point, we're very confident on where the business is, where our pipeline is and the demand environment around cyber. So it's sail ahead. And on the second question, remind me? There was a second question… On the ARR seasonality for the rest of the year. Yes, so I think clearly, we're -- as we get further and further into the year where the delta and with the delta on the mix, it gets smaller and smaller. So we have much bigger compares when we get into the second half of the year. So you're going to see a smaller growth in ARR, and we started off with a strong growth of 48% in the first quarter. So I think that it will go kind of in tandem with the narrowing of the headwind delta between the 80 -- the high 80s that we're doing in subscription business this year versus the 70s that we did last year. And so Q3 and Q4, we'll have the narrowest jump. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the results. I wanted to go back to the ARR raise first. Can you guys maybe just comment on how much of that is possible conservatism versus this dynamic of expanding subscription versus declining maintenance net new ARR that you guys baked into the guidance? Yes, I think we do anticipate some decline in the maintenance, which actually makes our expansion of that ARR guide even much more powerful because we have to make up for that maintenance reduction. And we're really excited about the fact that we're able to come in at a 37% guide for the ARR. And it's -- I would say that the increase is really reflective of a lot from the net new ARR business that we're doing. So, it's not -- it's around the new business that we're doing and the continued renewals and upsell of the existing customers. And when you guys -- could you possibly maybe just expand on what you're seeing in regards to maybe deal sizes and ASPs as you continue to be more successful with your bundling strategy? And maybe how did that is it all benefit growth in the quarter? Yes. We're actually seeing uptick as we have for several quarters in a row on deal size. And I think Udi alluded to it before, particularly on new biz, which really, really starting to surge this quarter. We saw an uptick on the new biz deal size. So I think -- and it's landing with more products and more users because of how we created the platform strength. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Your next question is from the line of Roger Boyd from UBS Securities. Your line is now open. Hey. Thank you and congrats on a nice quarter. Wondering if you could talk about the cloud marketplace, AWS marketplace, the size and growth of that pipeline and just how you expect that opportunity to evolve as you push further with Secrets management and add things like EPM for LAX? Thanks. Yes, I'm personally very, very bullish about that the partnership we're building with AWS, and it's kind of a new thing that evolved and started last year. If we look at -- just in Q1, we had great examples of that synergy where it actually complements what our channels are doing and we can streamline opportunities through the mutual AWS customers, and I will say, strong momentum continuing into Q1, and there's a strong pipe build for the rest of the year and for next year.
So we'll try to give more specific numbers, but I can tell you, I can definitely say that there's a strong pipeline built. And you're right that the additional solutions that we are rolling out create even more opportunity on that collaboration. There'll be -- there are some things in the works that we will elaborate in our customer event of more streamlined ways to partner up with AWS. Got it. Makes sense. One quick follow-up. Can you just talk about operational security, OT, the role of CyberArk plays in securing infrastructure? And what you're seeing in demand, just given the emphasis on protecting critical infrastructure worldwide. Yes, yes, we've seen -- I would say, when we -- and I think we even painted that in our last Investor Day that organizations usually leave that part to last, because it's a separate type of network, but we have multiple customers securing their operational technology environment with CyberArk, from electricity companies, energy companies, sometimes even remote locations in their environment.
And so, it's become a stage of, what we call, the CyberArk blueprint as customers roll out Identity Security and Privileged Access Management, they expand to their OT environment. Sometimes we have built-in integrations directly with the providers of, I would say, the endpoint on the operational side.
And sometimes we partner with gateway providers where they bridge us to be able to manage and rotate and secure identities for those environments. I agree with you, it's a growing concern for these infrastructure organizations, and we're an important part of the solution. Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Your next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. A lot of questions have been asked. But, Josh, I want to, just from a financial standpoint, it looks like perpetual is kind of coming down. So in your guide for the next quarter, can you help us kind of get our hands on what do you think perpetual revenue? What is your assumption for perpetual revenue as part of the overall pie?
And then, second question is around inflation. Clearly, everyone is carrying the higher expenses with inflation, we feel it everywhere. How do you think about price increases going forward in your products or perhaps on maintenance as well? I mean, it's the first time that maintenance is down quarter-over-quarter ARR. So I'm just kind of trying to understand, how you're going to play that price increase card going forward. I'll start with the second question, so I don't forget it. But -- so we do have price increases, particularly as we – particularly, around the maintenance and things that are also very personnel related. So in terms of services, in terms of maintenance, in terms of renewals, we have built in ways for price increases. I think also, when we think about our perpetual, those prices have increased as well. And we – every year, annually, look at price increases as it relates to the current inflation. But we have incorporated that, into our model for this year. And with regard to the perpetual revenue, I mean, we gave the kind of the mix at guiding for Q2. And a related headwind, I think the best way to look at it's probably similar to Q1. Very good. Excellent. Thank you. Yeah. Your next question is from the line of Eric Heath from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my question, and I'll echo my congrats as well. Udi, just curious to hear your thoughts maybe on the impact of the after security incident in the quarter, what that might have had an impact on the market more broadly? And maybe how it affected your business or customer conversations in the quarter? And more specifically, just curious, if you saw this provide a tailwind for your vendor access solution? Yeah. So I would say that, it underscores that every company has to be diligent on security. And so it became one of those things, one of those names that come up or an example of a brief that comes up on that importance of investing in security and also to your last point in ensuring the vendor access and third-party controls. We have a six to six month cycle. So it didn't have a Q1 impact, but I think the important thing is the momentum we're seeing in for our access solution is really because customers are requiring a security-first approach. It helps us emphasize you need a security-first approach and this foundation of, a, from the makers of PAM were coming from PAM security most users and third parties, we're well positioned. So I think the example – it can also lead to that growing awareness of the importance to – for securing third-party and vendor access. And the most important thing is that we're proud of our security-first approach to identity. Okay. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up. Just on Secrets Management. Just curious on an update the timing of the launch of the cloud version and how you might see that changing your competitive positioning or maybe an accelerating adoption of Secrets Management within your customer base? Yeah, so like, it's – we'll give more specific timing. It's going to be launched this year. It will take away some of the reduced the time to value for customers. So any time we do that, and we've done that across the portfolio, it helps in adoption and will give us a competitive edge. So, in terms of timing, the SaaS version will be within this year and stay tuned.
In the meantime, we're helping customers in their hybrid environment and signing up some great marquee accounts and again, especially in their modern Kubernetes container environments like I mentioned. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Trevor Walsh from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one quick one for you, Udi. I wanted to follow-up on one of the points you made during your prepared remarks around wins. You mentioned the cryptocurrency company that had actually replaced a homegrown solution. I just wanted to confirm or kind of make sure I'm clear. Was that a PAM-related homegrown solution, something we in the access space? If you could maybe give us some more detail there.
And then as a follow-up to that, is that a trend that you see just generally within the PAM part of the house of customers kind of having home-grown solutions. I mean, if you can give us some more color around that trend as you see it. It’s a great question. I actually would say that in the past, it was in our early years is when we saw that some of the highly regulated organizations we're making an attempt to create their own homegrown and we were rapidly replacing that, and we're familiar with our strength in the financial industry.
I think this was an example where kind of type of a born on modern environment company took a stab at building it on its own and just saw that it doesn't scale and it's not -- and it doesn't provide the security that they need. So, it was a great win for us. And just like we saw other great wins in the quarter in born-in-the-cloud type organizations where we can come in and be part of the solution. And of course, they're very similar to a financial organization and are very -- and are highly targeted. So, it was a great win for us. And actually, I'm hoping that one of the days we will be able to actually show a case study and disclose the customer name with their consent because it's definitely a great --. Good. Thanks again and good job on the quarter. Thank you very much. Your next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Justin on for Andy. Thanks for taking my question. You've talked about the strong pipeline. I was just wondering if you could quantify anything around how your win -- sorry, your win rates have been trending. And just any color you could add there? Thank you. Yeah. I don't have numerical. I would say, back to my initial comment, I was just going fast because we're at the end of the call. As I mentioned, competitive position is probably one of the best we've seen it in on the PAM front, so that's very strong. And for us, the world of access is an expansion. So we're very excited to see our win rates trend up and be very, very differentiated there. Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up question. Outside of PAM, what is typically the next add-on for the customers? So I would say that the landing spots are our Privilege Cloud EPM and CyberArk identity. And often, we see a combination of those in the land. And whatever was not part of that would be the run-off followed by Secrets Management as add-on business, especially in our strategic accounts that follow our blueprint and are expanding us to Secrets Management. But it rotates between Privilege Cloud landing with Privilege Cloud and EPM and/or CyberArk identity and expansion around there. And very often, we're coming in with a package that introduces them and given the flavor of the other solution -- and hence, that's why we talk about the velocity of add-on because they had a pace they're beginning to consume quick times of value and we can get that add-on business faster. There are no further questions. Mr. Udi Mokady, please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. We are thrilled to start 2022 with an incredible quarter with strong demand for Identity Security platform. And as always, I want to thank our customers and partners for being that cornerstone of our success. I also want to extend special appreciation to the entire CyberArk team who came together and worked hard to execute on this subscription transformation strategy and shifting us in five quarters. Amazing. Thank you. And with that, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CyberArk Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
At this time, I'd like to introduce Erica Smith, SVP, Investor Relations and EFG. Ms. Smith, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Rex. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's second quarter 2022 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information.
I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the third quarter, full year 2022 and beyond. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and those referenced in the press release today that are posted to CyberArk's website. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call.
We also want to remind you that we provide a calculated revenue headwind for additional color on the impact of our subscription bookings mix shift. But it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks to everyone, for joining the call. We had an outstanding second quarter, best categorize by momentum. Momentum for our Identity Security platform, momentum across our Solutions, PAM, Endpoint to Privilege Management and Access, momentum in the channel and momentum with new logos and an existing customers.
Before diving into the details, I want to provide a few financial metrics that underscore our stellar performance. ARR remains the best metric to measure our success. So, subscription ARR reached $255 million, drawing a 133% year-over-year demonstrating the continued acceleration of our subscription engine. Total ARR grew 48% year-over-year reaching $465 million. We are pleased with how quickly our recurring revenue business is scaling to our $1 billion ARR target.
And total revenue exceeded our guidance range coming in at $142 million, with growth accelerating to 21%. It is important to keep in mind that the subscription transition continues to impact our reported P&L. Or said another way, we are growing much faster than the 21% revenue growth we posted in Q2. In fact, our bookings were again well above our guidance framework, best evidenced by the combination of higher subscription bookings mix at 88%, revenue above the guidance range and nearly 50% ARR growth. The revenue headwind from the subscription bookings mix was about $16 million in the second quarter. Normalizing the mix to the second quarter of last year, our total revenue line would have grown by 35% this quarter. Josh will talk about it later. But given the strength of our execution, we are raising our full year revenue and ARR guidance.
Our pillars continue to be growth, innovation and profitability. Starting with growth. Over the last few weeks from the RSA conference to our recent Impact customer event, we met with hundreds of chief information security officers and senior security professionals. Nearly every discussion centered on the major challenges facing the industry. They are ready to digitize, adopting zero trust and staying ahead of attacker innovation are accelerating trends pushing Identity Security to the top of the CISO priority list.
Our strong secular tailwinds and execution have kicked our platform selling motion into a higher gear, which you see in some of the trends from the quarter. We surpassed 1,000 customers with over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, up over 50% from Q2 last year.
SaaS continues to serve as the foundation of our growth, leading the way in almost all regions. Our move to subscription business model is delivering transformative value both to us and to our customers. While PAM remains the predominant landing spot for customers, increasingly, new logos are beginning their Identity Security program with Endpoint and Access and then expanding back into PAM.
And when it comes to Access, our truly differentiated approach is resonating, delivering another strong quarter in Q2, we are creating seamless Access across the entire workforce. The combination of single sign-on and adaptive MFA with innovations like secure web session and workforce password management, all based on intelligent privileged controls is enhancing security and increasing productivity, a combination not replicated by any other vendor.
We had impressive diversification in our new logos, signing nearly 250 customers in the second quarter, up over 30% year-over-year and included enterprise wins like Fortune 500 manufacturing companies, banks, major retailers, critical infrastructure and energy and power companies.
Momentum continued to pick up in our commercial segment as well with wins like a next-gen cloud Fintech, a well-known conservation society and multiple school systems among many others. A few new business highlights include: in a greenfield PAM deal, a North American retailer had two catalysts for implementing Identity Security; digital transformation and cyber insurance requirements, one of the many examples of cyber insurance contributing to our business. This customer embraced our platform buying Privileged Cloud, Endpoint Privilege Manager, Access and Secrets Manager enterprise-wide, including protecting UiPath and ServiceNow through our CCube integrations.
A restaurant chain landed with adaptive MFA, SSO workforce password management and advanced life cycle management to help mitigate risk, expanding the PAM is next on its horizon. Our land and expand strategy is demonstrated across examples like a Fortune 500 manufacturing company landed with EPM in Q4 and after just two quarters is replacing a legacy PAM solution with our Privileged Cloud because of the amazing customer experience.
In a highly competitive Access deal, an existing PAM customer in the healthcare vertical expanded with single sign-on and MFA. The CISO cited key differentiators, such as our security first mindset and our unwavering commitment to maintaining the long-term vision and purpose.
A financial services company is expanding from PAM to protect Kubernetes at the edge and CI/CD pipelines with our secrets management solution. Secrets management has had a strong quarter and was included in eight of our top 10 largest wins. Momentum also continued across the partner ecosystem. We are particularly excited about strengthening our relationships with the SIs, managed security service providers and with AWS.
Our partners are building identity security practices with plans to significantly increase their business with CyberArk. Year-to-date, the number of CyberArk certified professionals has nearly tripled with the average number of certifications across our products also trending up, a very strong indicator of the momentum with partners. We also deepened our relationship with AWS Marketplace. The deals closed in Q2, and our strong pipeline give us confidence that AWS will be a contributor to our growth over the long term.
Moving on to the innovation, the cornerstone of our strategy. Our DNA is innovation, and we challenge ourselves every day to lead the industry. We were pleased to be named a leader in the July 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Privileged Access Management, positioned both highest in ability to execute and furthest in completeness of vision for the fourth time in a row. At our recent annual impact live customer event, we showcased the depth, breadth and considerable differentiation of our identity security platform. We hosted more than 1,000 people in person and 2,000 virtually at our marquee event and the feedback was incredible.
Customers and partners recognize that we are putting much more distance between us and the competition. The benefits of our security-first approach are well understood and increasingly a priority in this severe threat landscape. We also demonstrated how we can elegantly secure all identities across environments while driving the business forward.
A few highlights from the product announcements. Secrets Hub positions CyberArk as the backbone for secrets management for application -- for all application types across the enterprise. Developers seamlessly access secrets through familiar workflows in AWS. At the same time, the security team can secure and rotate all secrets in CyberArk, centralizing visibility and control with a single pane of glass across hybrid and cloud environments. This win-win solution increases alignment between cloud-native DevOps and Security. It is a game changer.
Conjur Cloud is now in early availability. In addition to faster deployment and tactive value with SaaS delivery, much of the power of Conjur Cloud comes from the tight integration into our identity security platform. In Access, we introduced identity flows, which streamlines workflow with advanced and modern no-code application integration and automation. And Identity compliance streamlines across streamlined access certifications campaigns with comprehensive, risk-driven identity analytics.
Secure Cloud Access marks the third solution, along with cloud Entitlements Manager and Dynamic Privileged Access in our cloud privileged security pillar. Going well beyond just in time, basic just in time, secure cloud access integrate session monitoring and enhanced lease privilege permissions for DevOps and cloud consoles. This functionality significantly enhances security and better allies to the principle of Zero Trust.
To accelerate our development in cloud security, in July, we acquired C3M, a provider of multi-cloud security and compliance solutions for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. We are pleased to welcome about 40 talented cloud security experts and are looking forward to working together to deliver against our cloud privileged security road map.
Moving on to profitability. Our reported P&L continues to be impacted by the subscription transition. We haven't changed our investment approach. We are delivering excellent returns, including rapid revenue growth rates and accelerated innovation. We expect to be a Rule of 40 company with strong growth, profitability and cash flow as we move past the subscription transition dynamics.
Before I turn it over to Josh, I wanted to talk about the macro environment. The broader economic uncertainty we are all hearing about has not impacted our business. We are watching very closely and analyzing the trends in our business more frequently. We continue to execute our strategy. Our close rates are strong. Our pipeline is at record levels, and we are seeing an acceleration in demand.
In fact, the first half of 2022 was one of the best in the company's history, and our Q2 performance demonstrates. First and foremost, Identity Security is more critical than ever. Second, our Identity Security platform is gaining momentum, and we are increasingly protecting across workforce identities, privileged users and machines.
Third, we are in the best competitive position in our history. And lastly, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute against a multi-year durable growth opportunity.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our great financial results in more detail and provide you with our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, including raising our total revenue and ARR guidance. Josh, off to you. Thanks, Udi. As in prior quarters, we posted slides to the website that walk through our results. As Udi mentioned just now, we had a stellar second quarter. Momentum continues to build in our business, fueled by amazing execution, strong secular tailwinds and a robust demand environment.
In terms of the headline P&L, total revenue exceeded guidance coming in at $142.3 million in the second quarter with growth accelerating sequentially to 21% year-on-year from the 13% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022. We are thrilled to begin exiting the revenue trough created by the subscription transition and be back again above 20% growth.
Annual recurring revenue continues to be the best metric to evaluate the business and remain incredibly strong in the second quarter, growing 48% year-on-year and reaching $465 million. The business continues to fire on all cylinders and grow at high rates. The subscription portion of ARR reached $255 million. That's increasing 133% and now represents 55% of our total ARR.
Just a year ago, the subscription portion was only $109 million or 35% of the total. The maintenance portion was $210 million at June 30 and in large part because of the timing of renewals.
Moving into the details. Subscription revenue generated from SaaS and self-hosted subscription contracts reached $66 million and represented 46% of total revenue in the second quarter, with growth accelerating to 144% year-on-year. Consistent with the progression of our business model to subscription, perpetual license revenue came in at about $11 million. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $65.3 million with $54.4 million from recurring maintenance and $10.9 million in professional services revenue.
Recurring revenue reached $120.4 million. That's 85% of total revenue with growth accelerating to 49% year-on-year. We are pleased to be quickly approaching our target of more than 90% of revenue coming from recurring.
Before moving on, I wanted to point out that we did have a negative currency impact, which lowered our total revenue by about $2 million in the second quarter, making our outperformance even that much more impressive. Our subscription bookings mix was 88% in the second quarter compared to our guidance of 87% booking mix. With our mix and revenue, both above expectations, highlights that total bookings again exceeded our guidance framework.
Economically, the headwind created by the mix was approximately $16 million in the second quarter, when we compare it like-for-like to the second quarter last year with only 65%. Taking the calculated revenue headwind into consideration, total revenue growth would have accelerated to 35% year-on-year.
As a reminder, our second quarter guidance implied about a 30% growth rate normalized for the transition. So exceeding that by a full five percentage points is just another indication of the strength of our outperformance in the second quarter.
Geographically, the business is well-diversified. The Americas revenue reached $84 million, representing 59% of total revenue. The Americas grew by 21% and again, had the strongest percentage of SaaS bookings during the quarter. EMEA also grew by 21% year-on-year with $44 million in revenue or 31% of total revenue. APJ grew by 25% to $15 million in revenue or 10% of total and continues to gain traction with subscription and SaaS ahead of our expectations. If we look across all the geographies normalizing for the mix, the Americas and EMEA revenue would have grown by approximately 35% and APJ by about 40%.
Now moving to the P&L. On line items in the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, and please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our second quarter gross profit was $116.9 million or an 82% gross margin. That's compared with 84% gross margin in Q2 last year, and it's primarily the result of the increase in our SaaS business. We continue to make investments to drive innovation and growth, resulting in operating expenses of $127.5 million, a 33% increase year-on-year and an operating loss of $10.7 million in the quarter.
Our operating results were lower by approximately $16 million from the calculated revenue headwind. Normalizing for this mix, operating margin would have been a positive 3% in the second quarter. As a reminder, this only level sets the mix to the prior year and not all the way back to the beginning of the transition, which would result in even a much higher operating margin. Net loss was about -- was $10.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the second quarter.
We continue to attract and retain top talent. That's a testament to our culture. We added just over 130 employees in the second quarter, ending June with over 2,400 employees worldwide, including about 1,100 in sales and marketing. For the first half of 2022, free cash flow was $6.6 million or 2% free cash flow margin, and we continue to have a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Turning to our guidance. Our guidance for the third quarter and the full year reflects robust industry tailwinds, strong execution and our growing ARR base. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect total revenue of $147 million to $153 million, which represents another sequential acceleration of our growth to 23% year-on-year at the midpoint.
We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about $11 million to $6 million for the third quarter, and we expect EPS to range from a non-GAAP net loss of $0.27 to $0.14 per basic and diluted share.
Our guidance assumes that our subscription bookings mix will remain over 85% and that the resulting calculated revenue and profitability headwind will be between $9 million and $11 million for the third quarter. If you normalize for the mix, our estimated revenue growth at the midpoint of the range is over 30%.
Since we have now exceeded our target for subscription bookings mix for the last two quarters, going forward in the second half of 2022, we will only start to provide a range for mix and headwind versus the specific targets. Our guidance also assumes 41.4 million basic and diluted shares and about $2 million in taxes.
For the full year of 2022, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance and now expect the total revenue in the range of $589 million to $601 million, our guidance assumes a subscription bookings mix in the high 80s and our revenue headwind of between $61 million and $63 million. So, if you normalize for the mix, our estimated revenue growth at the midpoint is over 30%.
For the full year, we are improving the range for our non-GAAP operating loss to be $30.5 million and $20.5 million, and we expect our non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.57. For the full year, we expect about 40.7 million basic and diluted shares and about $11 million in taxes.
We are pleased that our operating loss and EPS range are improving while facing currency headwinds and absorbing the increased operating expenses from the acquisitions of APi and C3M.
Our improved bottom line is further validation that our approach to profitability has not changed. Today, the profitability of our business is still masked by the subscription transition, and we expect to return to a Rule of 40 company over the transition -- once the transition dynamics play out.
We are also meaningfully increasing our full year guidance for ARR, which we now expect to be between $543 million and $549 million at December 31, 2022, or that's 38% to 40% year-on-year growth, respectively.
We are thrilled to raise our ARR guidance, which demonstrates the considerable strength we continue to see in our business. While we experienced over a $2 million sequential increase in maintenance ARR in the second quarter, we still anticipate that maintenance ARR will decline in the back half of the year. I would also add, we do not anticipate products from APi and C3M, to contribute to ARR or recognized revenue in 2022.
I did want to mention FX. While we do not plan to provide our results in constant currency, isolating the impact from FX reinforces the overall strength of our outperformance and our guidance raise. We expect to see a full year estimated currency impact to annual recurring revenue of about $5 million for the full year, and that's related to the pound and the euro.
We also estimate that the recent currency moves will lower our recognized revenue by about $5 million, and that the net impact will lower our operating income by about $3 million for the full year 2022. That's compared to the rate last year. These currency moves are already reflected in the guidance I provided just a few minutes ago.
Moving to free cash flow. We still anticipate that it will be in line with our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period.
Second quarter was another strong quarter. As Udi mentioned, our results demonstrate that momentum is in our business is still building. We are confident that demand for our Identity Security platform is highly durable. We remain focused on capitalizing on the massive opportunity in front of us that will deliver profitable growth and strong cash flow, creating long-term value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia. Your line is open. Okay. Great. Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions, here. Good morning, Saket. Hey, good morning, Udi. Maybe just to start with you, from a product perspective, it sounds like you're seeing more deals include Access and Conjur or secrets management rather given the competitors in those spaces, can you just talk about why you think CyberArk is winning? And whether you think the strength in cross-selling here is sustainable? Absolutely. I would say that, the go-to-market motion of selling Identity Security as a platform. And again, with our leadership position coming from a leadership position in Privileged Access Management, is really continuing to gain traction.
Customers are recognizing the need for a complete security solution all the way from human identities to workforce and machines. And to your point, we're seeing customers land with more solutions adding on more users faster. We had more than 60% of our new logos landed with multiple products in Q2.
Now, it's highly differentiated. On the Access side, we're highly differentiated with having security controls, rep around the various use cases with secure web sessions with workforce password management, which gives customers peace of mind that we're taking a security approach to access. And on the Secret side, customers are appreciating that we can support all types of applications and at scale. And with the new innovation like Secret hub that we announced that we're taking an approach that bridges to the DevOps, allowing them to work transparently, and with high productivity. So, all that is taking place, and definitely, we expect the – both the landing with more products and that cross-sell motion to continue. Got it. Got it. That's really helpful. Josh, maybe for you as a follow-up, just to address the topic of macro backdrop. Both of you have seen ebbs and flows in the macro backdrop before here at CyberArk. Josh, maybe for you, how are you handicapping that potential in the guide? Because it is a very strong guide, particularly when you adjust for FX, whether you have a quantitative answer there or a qualitative answer I think it'd just be helpful to hear kind of how you thought about that? Yeah. Thanks, Saket, for the question. And I think it's both quantitative and qualitative to a lot of extent. You heard our remarks already today. On a quantitative perspective, we're doing and looking at our guide in the same way we always have. We look at our historical trends, but we're also looking at the current pipeline, our current close rates and of course, quantitatively, I already discussed in my remarks kind of the impact of taking into consideration the change in FX how that's affected, how that's impacted our -- both our revenue, net income and our guidance, but we still were able to raise even with that FX impact.
From a qualitative perspective, I mean you heard a lot of comments by Udi and by myself, the macro environment, we're hearing still very strong feedback from customers, and we're seeing in terms of our responses on the pipeline that identity security is remaining a top priority and their budget seem to still be safe. So we're using that as well in our guide.
But we are an experienced team, all of us around this table and we have a lot of fingers on the pulse, and we're increasing our touch points all the time with the field, and we feel like we're in good shape and confident in the way we're looking at the second half. And I would say second that I love that we finished our transition, because it sets up -- with this high priority for Identity Security and private access management, it sets us up for this long-term durable growth including in this market environment. Very helpful. Thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala. Fodderwala, your line is open. Hey guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe jump off for either Udi or Josh. Can you talk a little bit about how the SaaS transition or the subscription transition overall has perhaps made you more resilient in this current macro backdrop? It seems like -- is there something going on in terms of shortening of sales cycles or more cross-sell, up-sell momentum through the partners even that's kind of separating your performance versus maybe prior macro cycles where you would have seen those headwinds more upfront? Yeah, absolutely. I think like I mentioned now, so it's -- we're pleased to be in this position where our market I would say, from a demand environment, we are in high priority and built such a big pipeline and then we can execute on it with the SaaS motion where we can land provide quick time to value so quickly to the customers and then get them into the add-on motion much faster.
And again, also the variety of landing spots that we now have across the portfolio, again, SaaS landing spots with EPM with access we now came out with Conjur SaaS and of course, with Privilege Cloud. So having that -- the multiple landing points all centralized platform is we're really benefit for this in this -- including in this environment. And I think like Josh emphasized, we really have strong controls into the field to see the increased demand, the record pipeline and so it's kind of a perfect way to execute with the SaaS platform on the opportunity. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Josh. I know it's really early. But when you look at the early cohorts of the subscription or SaaS customers that has started to come up for renewal. What are those like net expansion rates look like so far? Yeah, I mean you are right, Hamza, it's still early. But what we've seen now so far is really what we consider best-in-class in terms of what -- how we're getting renewals and also expanding and retention rates for them. But we're still early in that cycle in the first duration period of the transition. But we like what we see so far. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Josh, as you talk about making it through the revenue transition, but you obviously have a lag when it comes to operating profitability, free cash flow. Can you remind us how long that lag is? And when you expect to return to kind of that Rule of 40 company from a profitability standpoint? Thanks. Yes, Rob. Yes, you're right, we've always talked about kind of the lag being a couple of quarters past the transition. So we're not obviously guiding it into later years, but we definitely feel comfortable and confident that 2023 operating margin will already improve incrementally to 2022. And we're -- we believe that over the -- in the next couple of years, we will already be seeing Rule of 40 results. But stay tuned, we'll talk about out years as we finish up 2022. But we are confident that in a couple of quarters, the operating income margins will start to improve as it should coming out of the transition. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Udi, I wanted to go back to your comments in the script around CyberArk landing new logos within EPM and DAA [ph] and the suite of solutions. I thought that was really interesting because PAMs, of course, our flagship. So I'm curious to get your perspective on what it's going to take either from you from a sales execution standpoint or from a market level standpoint to get the AAM franchise to be as large as the PAM franchise? And then I have a follow-up for Josh, please. That's great. I would say we're seeing, like I said, landing with Privilege Cloud, EPM, Secret Management and Access. So those have all become landing spots from us. And in fact, the subscription ARR for all of these doubled in -- if you look at Q-over-Q in all of those solutions. So we're very excited how they're performing.
As you recall, we structured speed build structure to allow us to really execute on the opportunity and be very agile on both Access and our Secrets Management areas. I love your question. I mean that's the approach we have with Secrets Management. We believe that human identities, the non-human identities are fast expanding in the recent conference, we put out a survey that we have that there are 45 non-human identities for every human identity and enterprise. So those are exploding with digital transformation. And we're going after that with a single platform. So we see the opportunity we're executing on it.
Part of the how is what I mentioned the bridging the gap between security and DevOps, and we're doing it the CyberArk way, not coming in with a very strong security solution, but understanding that developers want to work transparently, the announcement of Secrets Hub, which is our first foray with Secrets Hub integrating with AWS, a key management solution so that the developer can develop on AWS and transparently work the same way while security gets our central backbone with CyberArk being behind the scenes rotating and managing all those secrets. So that's an example of how we're expanding and we're going to go after all of the cloud providers in the same fashion. I think you had a follow-on question. Hi, Rex. Gregg Moskowitz, your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations on a very good Q2. So the increased ARR guidance was impressive and especially on a constant currency basis, given the macro environment that we're in. So two questions here, if I may.
Udi, some security and broader software vendors who have recently reported earnings have spoken about longer sales cycles among larger enterprise customers. Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise. So I just wanted to confirm that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level?
And then secondly for Josh, did the prior ARR guidance, which I believe was $535 million to $541 million, does that not include any FX headwind? Just wanted to clarify that as well. Thanks. Great. So, Gregg, right -- you're correct. We are not seeing that. I think we're performing exceptionally well as we -- as we've shown in the results and have not seen any impact on close rates. And actually, I talked about the strong pipeline or on the speed of going through the cycle. So, things our business as usual. And I think it's really down to us being a very impactful security layer for our customers and our projects are important and going through.
As Josh mentioned, we keep a close eye. We're very connected to the field. And we're seeing the same cycles and priority actually continuing to move up. In some of the large deals, we've seen more approvals in the process, but it did not slow down the business. And again, Identity Security is a top priority. And Gregg, with response to the FX question. So the last ARR guide that we put out there included about $1 million to $2 million of FX impact considered that. All right. Super helpful. Thanks guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. Good morning and thank you for taking our questions, and really nice set of results here. Maybe, Josh, on year-end, really nice sequential increase in net new ARR. As we think about the guidance and the setup for the back half of the year, how do you think about seasonality a perhaps the mix of term and SaaS in there? And how do we get confidence? I mean, and it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of like how you're thinking about the guide and the level of confidence you have to hit that in considerations you might need to make as we fine-tune our model. Yes. Thanks, Brian. So level of confidence that we've been talking about it all morning, we're confident to guide for the increase, which is significant, as you pointed out. So – and it's going to come from the SaaS and subscription piece of the business. As we talked about, actually, the maintenance ARR could see some decline in the back half, and we'll go into more than make up for that with SaaS and Self-Hosted subscription
I think the business is continuing with two-thirds of it being SaaS heavy versus Self-Hosted. So I would continue to see that going into the second half. And in terms of seasonality, you're right, Q4 has the difficult compare. And of course, we're much – so I think that, it will be probably a slower growth rate than Q4 compared to Q3. Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned Marketplace as a traction there, it sounds like this quarter, particularly within identity, there's an increasing amount of business going around the resellers and through the marketplaces. I know it's kind of early stages for you, but could you give us maybe a sense of what you're seeing? And what are the dynamics of those deals, or is it enterprise just kind of truing up commitment, or is there kind of like new initial traction going through that channel? You're referring to our commentary on AWS marketplace? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I would say, it's down to the increased awareness of the ability of enterprises to leverage their relationship with AWS and – and procure, and I would say, leverage the faster process. We saw an incredible pipeline to build up. And I can say that, that in this first half, we had more business through AWS than in the entire year 2021, which was kind of the year that we announced the marketplace and that's augmenting the channel, and that's what we really love about is that we can work with our system integrators and with our VARs.
But the last mile can be fulfilled through that AWS resellers, AWS, I would say, streamlined process. So it's inclusive to the channel partners and its all part of an ecosystem that's working together. They actually really recognized that is also good for them. I mean, they being the VARs and the integrators, it's good for them to also partner on the AWS front. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the nice results. Udi, you had mentioned MSSP partners in your prepared remarks, which I think is a relatively new channel for CyberArk. You talked a little bit about the certifications of 3x, but can you just talk about the momentum you're seeing there the potential for that channel maybe as you work further into the commercial cohort? Yeah, exactly. We see that as a long-term important channel movement for us. Many of our existing partners are – and strong relationship partners are actually building managed security service provider's capability, because their customers are coming to them with that motion of shortage of staff, or as they go further down market, and they want them to manage it completely. And the Identity Security platform, our platform really resonates to that, that our partner can deliver value by – by being a managed service provider.
So I would say, it's a relatively early program, but we're seeing that kick in. We sometimes see large enterprises benefit from, for example, from a telco that launched in MSP and is managing end-to-end PAM for a customer or an MSP that launches and goes after and helps us go after the mid-market like you mentioned. So, it's a dual motion and we're making it continuously easier for these partners to learn how to onboard new customers and certify and leverage our platform. I would say it's early days, but on fast growth, and we'll see it be an important motion for us for many years. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg. Your line is open. Hey guys and thanks much for taking the question. Maybe just on cyber insurance. You talked about that in the script. I know we've talked about that in the past. And it just seems that there's more and more challenges and heightened awareness about organizations getting cyber insurance to begin with. So, love to hear more about the demand drivers of cyber insurance overall, what inning are we in with that? And even if there's regional differences between what you're seeing in the US and international? Thanks so much. Absolutely. So, I'll start with the innings. I think it's still early innings, but we added kind of to the list. We already have a lot of secular trends pushing offering what we would add it as an additional driver where customers are trying to obtain cyber insurance the requirement is for them to have privileged access management controls, MFA, single sign-on, really the important proactive security hygiene layers, and they know that CyberArk is market-leading and can be -- they can also achieve success with us. Of course, the insurers also view CyberArk as a market leader in the space.
So, we primarily -- like you mentioned, we primarily see it in the US. It's often this additional driver or accelerator on a deal or nothing. But when it shows up, it becomes an additional accelerator on a deal, but it's still early innings.
And then we're actually investing in educating the both insurers and of course, everything that we do around the broad customer base and prospect base because we believe it will trickle to additional markets like the European market where it will become a requirement. And with all the experience we have and insurance customers as customers themselves really the major ones that it gives us a great advantage in capitalizing on that. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho. Your line is open. Hi good morning and congrats on the strong quarter. I wonder, could you maybe quantify or help us understand how much of your existing license shifting from permanent license to SaaS? And maybe how that impacts ARR? Yes. It's still -- if we're talking about the notion of converting from perpetual to SaaS. It's still a very small percentage of the book. Of the ARR, it's still in single-digit percentages of the ARR growth that we're seeing is coming from conversion, -- which is a great upside for us because we're seeing the -- we're landing a lot of SaaS. The vast, vast majority of new logos are -- have been landing with SaaS and subscription, and we're working closely with the customer base to convert when they are ready to convert. Of course, we shortened maintenance cycles to usually be a year and it gives us more opportunities for those conversion conversations, but also existing on-prem customers are buying -- complementing and adding SaaS solutions to complement their on-premise solutions. So, we have all of that at the same time. And thanks for the congrats, Jonathan. Your next question comes from Eric Heath. Your line is open. Hey Udi, Josh, my congrats as well. So Udi, mean you continue think it's also pretty clear that PAM is kind of having a really strong kind of demand as well. So just curious your thoughts on kind of why PAM continue to see such strong demand and even accelerating demand? And I guess how CSOs thinking about PAM strategically as part of their kind of broader move to the cloud and zero trust architectures? Yes, it's exactly that. It's exactly that. It's become increasingly clear that you can't the CICO cannot sleep at night if they don't have controls over privileged access. We're basically an insider or an outsider can take over their entire infrastructure, turn off security controls. So, it becomes a fundamental layer one, before you can really put additional security layers in place.
And then in parallel, seeing the proliferation of privilege. So, it was maybe a little easier to map out where our organizations had privileged users to be managed in more on-prem infrastructure and with the proliferation and adoption of cloud and of course, more and more examples where a workforce employee or a developer has privileges, they need a holistic solution to go after all of this.
Now you can't achieve Zero Trust, if you don't if you don't have a privileged access management controls in place, if you don't apply lease privilege on the endpoint, which is our EPM. And it's been really – the market has been understanding that. Our strong channel network that we've built, including the big 4s and advisory firms that are educating CICOs out there and of course, the VARs and it's become a clear layer on how do you achieve an impactful layer.
And of course, every time a company does Red Teaming [ph] exercise or brings a third party to analyze their security posture. First and foremost, if they capture the flag and they achieve privileged access, it's game over. And so that's why it's so important for them to invest in this, and that's why it is in such a high priority. As a company, we're going after it, like Josh mentioned, we're investing in the opportunity, leveraging our market leadership positioning, leveraging the strong channel network to go after both the PAM and the broader identity security opportunity. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter as well. I just -- I wanted to follow up on Hamza's question, but I wanted to put the macro aside. How much easier for you guys has the cross-sell conversation become with customers simply because it's now just one SaaS-based platform or as a customer, I can just easily turn on additional functionality versus when you sold separate perpetual licenses? Yes. It's exactly that. The fact that they are onboarded on a SaaS platform, they can get early access. They can – to additional functionality for -- they see the light and we saw the light, like all of the investment in in pushing out and investing and creating the SaaS platform, leveraging our strong credibility out there in the market for our leadership is paying off to exactly that motion. This is why, I would say, in the last two years, we really invested in the team -- the customer success team to measure and continuously take the customer on these journeys to success so that they can expand within the solution they first acquired but also cross solution as they go with no need to set up infrastructure like you mentioned, with the -- really the power of SaaS. Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh. Your line is open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Udi, maybe just for you, a quick one. I appreciate the fact that the demand has remained strong and no aging of sales cycles, et cetera. But we move into 2023 and things potentially get more challenging for customers, how do you balance the innovation pillar versus growth as far as kind of maintaining your competitive edge around products and kind of engineering or versus the go-to-market team. And what -- how do you think about that as you might have to either tighten belts in certain places or kind of pick one over the other, or is there an option too? Thanks. Yes. No, there's -- Josh alluded to it, there's a real advantage of being experienced. I mean, we've been around. We've been around cycles. We're I would say we keep close attention to changing themes probably earlier than others do, and we're very, very diversified. So we're very diversified geographically. We're very diversified vertically. And now we have such a huge portfolio, a SaaS portfolio to go on the market with. So we have a lot of different levers.
As Josh mentioned, we're investing in the opportunity because we're seeing that high demand and record pipeline, and we'll continue to stay close to that. On the innovation side, it's been a big differentiator for us and customers appreciate that. So it kind of success breeds success. They see us coming out the first to come to market with any new innovation on the PAM side or an Identity Security side or secure web session, coming out with Secrets Hub.
The virus announcement we just did an impact are strengthening customer conviction to invest in us and go for the platform. So the short answer on we're going to continue to be to do both because that innovation leads to that success in this very important market. And of course, we've always stayed away from nice to have innovation. It's always been protecting against attacker innovation. So we'll always keep it real. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. I have two questions. One on the product side and one on the OpEx side. On the product side, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your success in penetrating the coding community and to what extent you're finding an ability to compete more aggressively on the coding infrastructure side of things. But the primary question is really on the impact of FX on operational costs. Can you talk a little bit about how you're structured against the currency changes? What -- to what extent that's going to play through the cost structure in the back half of the year, or if it's hedged how you would be impacted in 2023 if the exchange rate, particularly the shekel stay where they are today, how much of a benefit would that accrue? Great. So I'll start, and I'll hand it over to Josh to talk about FX. I think we're making great progress on penetrating the coding community but doing it the CyberArk way. So coming in with that credibility from the security teams, where the security team know that this is a solution that they trust, and increasingly making it more transparent to the coater. So reducing the need to even educate them.
Secrets Hub, of course, is a great example where in AWS -- where a developer using the AWS platform will not even feel or know that behind the scene CyberArk is the backbone that is managing secrets, but also before that, we made it continuously very, very native approach to the developers. I would say we're kind of digging the tunnel from both sides coming in from security, where it's our stronghold, but also having ease of use/transparency for developer. And again, we're very confident that executing on the Secrets Hub solution and doing more of that will really make it easy for developers to adopt. Yeah. Hi, Alex. With regard to the FX, so as I talked about earlier today, while we're getting about a $5 million hit on the P&L. From a revenue perspective, it's only a $3 million hit on the operating income, because we're getting this year some benefit on the expense side in sterling and euro by about $2 million in that guide. This shekel is not really moving for us this year relative to guide because we've been pretty well hedged for this year from the beginning of the year.
If we think about next year, again, on the shekel side, it really depends. I mean, we gotten a little bit of some benefit towards the beginning of next year because of where the shekel has weakened in the last quarter. But it's still too early to tell what will be the impact for all of next year because we typically won't go a hedge out further than nine to 12 months. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you think the acquisition of Ping Identity could have the same near-term impact that we saw when some of your primary PAM competitors were acquired in 2018, given the disruption that these acquisitions typically create. And then related to that, are customers asking CyberArk for a more integrated IGA solution to complete the platform? Thanks. Okay, Great. So we weren't seeing Ping a lot in competitive situations, but fully agree with the premise, and we've seen it again and again that as companies have been acquired by private equity, there was disruption out there. We've even seen channel partners really worry about those companies that that went private. Are they going to continue to invest in the enablement and all the things that the channels need for success. And, of course, customers want to know that in critical investments that they have a long-term partner out there. So there will be some disruption. And again, we're going after that market. We haven't seen them as much, but I agree on that premise.
And with regards to IGA, our approach, and you saw that we've released our Identity compliance or now started Identity compliance solution at impact. It's really taking care of, I would say, very focused use cases, allowing our PAM or Access customers to certify Access. And if they want a full fledged IGA solution, we continue to refer them to our partner SailPoint. I think in the long-term, we will see more convergence with more modern use cases and that we will be able to answer within the platform. There are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. Great. Thank you. We are thrilled with another stellar quarter and the momentum of our Identity Security platform. And as always, I want to thank our customers and partners for being the cornerstone of this success. I also want to extend special appreciation to the entire CyberArk team around the world for their hard work and strong execution this quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CyberArk Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Erica Smith, SVP, Investor Relations and ESG; you may begin your conference. Thank you, Rob. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's third quarter 2022 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the fourth quarter, full year 2022 and beyond. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to the CyberArk's website. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made herein.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. We also want to remind you that we provide the calculated headwind for additional color on the impact of our subscription bookings mix shift but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We had a strong third quarter, demonstrating the durability of demand for our solutions and the momentum we continue to see in our business. A number of key metrics underscore the strength of our results. Subscription ARR reached $301 million, up from $255 million at the end of Q2, the largest sequential increase in our history.
Total ARR reached $512 million with growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter to 49% year-over-year. While ARR remains the best metric to measure our success, the benefits of our subscription transition are kicking in on the top line with total revenue growth accelerating again to 26% and reaching $153 million in Q3. It is important to remember that the subscription transition continues to impact our reported P&L. For the quarter, the mix was about 87%, significantly higher than the 72% in the third quarter last year which created a revenue headwind of about $11 million. Normalizing the mix of the third quarter of last year, our total revenue line would have grown by 35% this quarter. With our strong execution year-to-date, the prioritization of our identity security platform, the demand for our SaaS solutions and ongoing secular tailwinds, we are significantly raising our full year ARR guidance to over 40% growth at the midpoint which Josh will talk about later in the call.
To frame our discussion today, we will focus on growth, innovation and profitability. Starting with growth. Strong secular tailwinds of digital transformation, the adoption of Zero Trust and attacker innovation continue to push Identity Security to the top of Chief Information Security Officers priority list. With the heightened threat landscape, attacker renovation is front and center in our discussions. And privileged escalations continue to be a common denominator in the attack chain. Another growing challenge is the pickup of MFA fatigue, where attackers in an data victim with prompts until the multifactor authentication request is approved. The increased use of MFA bypass techniques has clearly demonstrated the need for a more robust defense strategy through an integrated access, PAM and secrets management approach. This has been a strong pipeline generator for CyberArk and our Identity Security platform.
Digging into our results; on the product side, momentum continued across our solution set. We were particularly pleased with the performance of CyberArk Identity, PAM and the EPM in the third quarter. On the new business front, we had a strong new logo quarter signing nearly 230 new customers. A few examples include: in a 7-figure rip and replace deal, a Fortune 100 retailer landed with PAM, Secrets Management and EPM. This customer embraced the breadth of our Identity Security platform and will leverage CyberArk to scale its growing IT environment, help protect across human and machine identities, lock down thousands of endpoints and protect against ransomware. The race to digitize is not just expanding the attack surface but also accelerating the adoption of Zero Trust. And in Q3, we were chosen as the enterprise-wide foundation of a global manufacturer Zero Trust framework with Privilege Cloud and EPM, with plans to expand to Secrets management.
Based on a Board level mandate, a major born in the cloud manufacturing company landed with Privilege Cloud and EPM demonstrating that Identity Security is front and center in the highest level of strategic discussions. A European government agency landed with our workforce password manager to give all its employees increased security controls on their personal passwords from CyberArk with our deep expertise in PAM. This is just 1 example of the robust demand for workforce password management in recent months. Our subscription transformation is increasing the velocity of add-on business and cross-selling across the portfolio. This is contributing to the greater than 50% increase in the number of customers with more than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue to nearly 1,200 customers at the end of September. A few expansion examples include: a leading energy company in APJ, landed with PAM previously and is now expanding across the portfolio with EPM and sequence management as well as with additional Privilege Cloud users.
In Q3, a large retailer became our second largest privileged cloud customer with a major expansion deal, bringing its ACV to well over $1 million. A long-standing Fortune 500 PAM customer, who had expanded to secure Secrets management in 2021, further deepened its relationship with CyberArk in Q3. As part of its Zero Trust initiative, this customer will lock down over 45,000 endpoints with EPM. We have spoken about it in the past. While the industry has been talking about Zero Trust for a few years, enterprises today increasingly are increasingly executing Zero Trust strategies which is contributing to our growth. Our channel program is key to our success and partners continue to scale their identity security practices. We have added new routes to market, enhance collaboration and improved channel program efficiencies across our VARs, advisories and MSPs.
Moving on to innovation, the cornerstone of our strategy and leadership position in identity security. During the third quarter, we began taking our CyberArk Impact customer event on a world tour to 16 cities in 14 countries. In our discussions at these events, the new innovations we announced last quarter are gaining traction in the field. CyberArk Identity Compliance is now generally available and makes it easier for organizations to enforce and demonstrate compliance by continuously discovering access, streamlining certifications and providing comprehensive identity analytics.
In early October, we also rolled out a user-friendly way to help lock the MFA fatigue technique from gaining unauthorized access to protective systems. Customers are also excited about Secret Hub and Conjur Cloud which strengthen our ability to secure both human and machinery daily. Profitability is the final pillar I will discuss today. While our reported P&L continues to be impacted by the subscription transition, we haven't changed our investment approach. We are delivering excellent returns, including accelerated innovation as well as a rapid revenue and booking growth. We continue to expect to be a Rule of 40 company as we move past the subscription transition dynamics.
Before I turn it over to Josh, I wanted to update you on what we are seeing with regards to the macro environment. The broader macroeconomic uncertainty did not have a significant impact on our business in the third quarter which you see in our nearly 50% growth in ARR, revenue acceleration and the increase in our ARR guidance. Our solutions are mission-critical and identity security is being prioritized. We have seen incremental FX headwinds and some large deals require incremental approvals but this did not meaningfully slow down sales cycles in the third quarter. Our pipeline and demand are robust and we continue to watch the situation very closely and are analyzing the trends in our business more frequently.
In closing, the top line benefits of our subscription transition are kicking in and our identity security platform continues to gain momentum. Our performance, in particular, our strong ARR growth demonstrates that we are in the best competitive position we have ever been in. Given our experience and durability of our business, we are confident that we can execute against a multiyear durable growth opportunity and deliver best-in-class profitability and cash flow over the long term.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our strong financial results in more detail and provide you with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Off to you, Josh. Thanks, Udi. And as Udi just mentioned, we had a strong third quarter which is reflected in our key metrics.
Growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 49% year-on-year and ARR passed the milestone of over $0.5 billion to $512 million. With our continued strong growth, we are on our way towards passing the $1 billion ARR target. The subscription portion of annual recurring revenue reached $301 million, that's increasing 117% and now represents 59% of our total ARR. Just a year ago, the subscription portion was only $139 million and just 40% of total. The maintenance portion was $211 million at September 30. Total revenue came in at the top of the range with $153 million. Total revenue growth again accelerated sequentially to 26% year-on-year. That's up 21% growth in the second quarter of 2022. Keep in mind that FX impacted our revenue and bookings growth this quarter, about $2 million in total revenue and on ARR of about $2.5 million.
Moving into the details. Subscription revenue reached $74.2 million, growing 110% year-on-year, representing 49% of total revenue in the third quarter. Consistent with our move to a subscription business model, perpetual license revenue came in at $13.8 million. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $64.6 million. That's $54.2 million coming from recurring maintenance and $10.4 million in professional services revenue. Recurring revenue reached $128.5 million, that's 84% of total revenue, growing 44% year-on-year from the $89 million in the third quarter last year. Subscription bookings mix came in at 87%. That's just above our expectations for the third quarter. Economically, the revenue headwind created by the mix was approximately $11 million in the third quarter when we compare it like-for-like to the third quarter of 2021 when the mix was just 72%.
Taking the calculated revenue headwind into consideration, total revenue would have grown by 35% year-on-year, validating that we continue to take market share in Identity Security. Geographically, the business is well diversified. The Americas revenue reached $94 million, representing 61% of total revenue. The Americas growth accelerated to 37%, EMEA grew by 10% year-on-year with $43 million or 29% of total revenue. It's important to keep in mind that EMEA results were impacted by 2 factors: first, the higher subscription mix; and second, $2 million of currency headwind. APJ grew by 13% to $15.5 million in revenue or 10% of total. If we normalize for the mix, the Americas would have grown by 45% year-on-year, EMEA would have grown by approximately 21% and APJ by approximately 25%. We are also pleased with the great progress APJ is making increasing its subscription mix which now reached over 80% in the last quarter.
All line items of the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our third quarter gross profit was $126 million. That's an 83% gross margin compared with 84% gross margin last year. We are pleased with our gross margin outperformance in a large part because we have closely managed the expenses related to SaaS. While we continue to make investments to drive innovation and growth, we are also demonstrating our ongoing operational rigor. Our investments resulted in operating expenses of $130 million, a 27% increase year-on-year which resulted in a $4 million operating loss still coming in significantly better than our guidance.
One thing to point out, our headwind adjusted revenue growth rate of 35% is meaningfully outpacing our 27% operating expense growth rate. That's another proof point of the leverage underlying our business. We are still being impacted by the mix shift towards ratable revenue which lowered our operating results. Normalizing for that mix, operating margin would have been positive 4% in the third quarter. As a reminder, this only level sets the mix to the prior year and not all the way back to the beginning of the transition. If you level set our mix to 2020, CyberArk is operating as a Rule of 40 company today which was part of our execution strategy.
A guiding tenet of our subscription transition was to rigorously manage our business and expense levels that we continue to operate efficiently and invest productively. We are delivering on that. Net loss was about $2.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the third quarter, also significantly better than our guidance. We continue to attract and retain top talent. That's a testament to our culture, ending September with over 2,600 employees worldwide, including approximately 40 related to the acquisition of C3M, the majority of which are in R&D. We ended the quarter with about 1,100 people in sales and marketing. For the first 9 months of 2022, free cash flow was $20.4 million or a 5% free cash flow margin which is meaningfully ahead of the free cash flow guardrails we set for the full year and demonstrates the strength of our subscription model.
Now turning to our guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year reflect robust industry tailwinds, strong execution and our growing ARR base. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect total revenue of $169.9 million to $176.9 million which represents about 15% year-on-year at the midpoint. And we expect non-GAAP operating income of about $2 million to $8 million for the fourth quarter. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from $0.07 to $0.20 per diluted share. Our guidance assumes an increase in subscription bookings mix and that it still remains over 85%. The resulting calculated revenue and profitability headwind is expected to be between $17 million and $18 million for the fourth quarter. If you normalize for the mix, our estimated revenue growth at the midpoint of the range is over 25%. Our guidance also assumes 45.8 million diluted shares and about $4.3 million in taxes.
For the full year 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $592.5 million to $599.5 million. Our guidance assumes a revenue headwind of between $66 million and $67 million and the increase in the headwind reflects a higher mix and bookings assumption underlying our fourth quarter forecast. If you normalize for the mix, our estimated revenue growth at the midpoint is over 30%. We are very pleased to increase the midpoint of our headwind adjusted full year guidance range despite the increase in FX headwinds which I will discuss in a minute.
For the full year, the range for our non-GAAP operating loss to be between $24.5 million and $18.5 million, we expect our non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.39. For the full year, we expect about $40.7 million basic and diluted shares and about $11 million in taxes. We are also increasing our full year guidance for the annual recurring revenue which we now expect to be between $552 million and $558 million at December 31 or between 40% and 42% year-on-year growth, respectively. We are thrilled to raise our ARR guidance. It demonstrates the considerable strength we continue to see in our business.
I did want to update you on our expectations for impact from FX. We can expect to see a full year estimated currency impact to ARR of about $7 million related to the pound and the euro which is about $2 million higher than we discussed last quarter because of further currency movements. We also estimate the impact from currency moves will lower our recognized revenue by about $6 million which is $1 million more than we discussed in August. These currency moves are already reflected in the guidance I provided a few moments ago.
Moving to free cash flow; we anticipate that it will be about 6 to 10 percentage points above our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period. Third quarter was another strong quarter. We are confident that demand for our Identity Security platform is highly durable. We remain focused on capitalizing on the massive opportunity in front of us that will deliver profitable growth and strong cash flow, creating long-term value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Okay, great. Solid set of results. Yes, I see you too, Udi, maybe we'll just start with you. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the performance of the business outside of traditional PAM. In several of your examples, I mean, there was EPM, there were secrets. There was a little bit of access as well. Maybe the question is, Udi, to what extent are these non-PAM products becoming landing points? And how often are you able to cross-sell traditional PAM along with that? Does that make sense? Absolutely. I think we talked about that our excitement last time about having more landing points in our new logos and we're increasingly landing with both access and EPM actually as landing point for us and then expanding back into PAM which gives us a very strong durable growth opportunity. Of course, the majority of new logos are still landing with PAM but then we see the huge opportunity in cross-selling them into access and EPM. And yes, we gave examples here also on the access side, like the customer example with workforce password management and others and the speed bolts really working well. Got it. Got it. That's great. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. Maybe just dig into maintenance ARR a little bit. I think that's been up sequentially for a couple of quarters. Can you just talk about sort of what's driving that? And how should we sort of think about when that realistically starts to decline sequentially. Yes. Thanks, Saket. Thanks for joining the call. Yes, we actually have done really well on the maintenance this year. Basically, it's because we're preserving still higher renewal rates for those customers. But we do anticipate already even in the fourth quarter that we can see a small decline of a couple of million dollars in that maintenance ARR. And we anticipate as we move into next year as well, we'll continue to see a decline on the ARR piece of the maintenance. As you can see from the transition that we're really reducing dramatically the bookings that are going towards a perpetual business. And even across now, I talked about it in my prepared remarks, even into APJ now area, we're well over 80% of the bookings going to SaaS and subscription. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala. Please provide your company name, please. This is Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. So just 1 question for you. It seems like the consistent theme in the last 6 or 7 quarters has been the priority level of privilege access management is higher than it's ever been. And can you talk a little bit about how you are now able to attract customers that perhaps you weren't able to a couple of years ago, beyond the large enterprise in particular. Is it regulatory requirements? Is it the fact that the SaaS model is making it easier for you to go after those customers as new channels? Maybe just talk a little bit about how the value proposition is now attracting a broader base today? Sure thing, as good to speak to you today. So definitely, if we were to block the demand drivers for CyberArk, we would see them increase over time and privileged access management and identity security continuously rising to the top priority. I think the biggest drivers overall is the attackers and the attack landscape where almost any attack that you analysts [Technical Difficulty]. Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost connection with the speaker. Please stay on the line. We'll be back in a moment. All right. So sorry about that. It looks like there was a disconnect and we're back in, happy to continue answering your question, Udi here. So I talked about the growth drivers continuously growing over time. And of course, with attackers going after credentials and identities, privileged access management and identity security are really rising to the -- at the top of growth a priority list for our customers. And of course, it became a cross-vertical opportunity where it's really across the board from that growth driver and, of course, additional growth drivers that we've been collecting over time, like regulations that you alluded to, like cyber insurance and even answering insider threat.
And then like you mentioned, Hamza, the ability to deliver that in SaaS is really making our offering accessible to a broad variety of customers out there. And of course, the global reach of our sales team and the channel enables that. We've been diversifying our channel advisories, value-added sellers and also MSPs to be able to answer that demand. So that combo is really working for us and puts us in that strength, both high priority in the CISO and the buyer list and execution strength. And again, sorry, that we got disconnected for a second. And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Udi, I think you made the comments in and around the best competitive position you've been in some time. Can you talk a little bit about your win rates, I guess, touching on where competition is, number one? And then number two, can you address size of land and if you're seeing that expand here versus what you've had historically given that you're bundling in or selling additional products? Yes. I think we look across both PAM and across our offerings where we see that we're in a better position in terms of leadership and the acknowledgment by customers that any innovation is going to come from CyberArk. And of course, the ability to consume and our delivery of everything in SaaS. So we're definitely seeing continued very strong win rates in PAM. CyberArk is the 1 invited to, of course, any PAM makeup. And with the increased innovation and the broadening of our suite, we're just seeing that -- those continued win rates go up. So that's in PAM. In Identity, we're just excited, like for my prior answer, we saw ARR there double and we're continuously invited and being perceived as the differentiated security-driven identity solution.
If you care about security and you want to address all identities, you go with CyberArk. And again, this is just a huge opportunity ahead of us in identity. And then with regards to the deal sizes, I think over the last year, we've seen our deal sizes continuously walk up, particularly when we land with more products. I was asked earlier about how we land our ability to land with identity and with EPM but the most beautiful landing is when we land with multiple products. And your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Maybe just for Udi on M&A. You made a few of these small tuck-in deals with recently 3PM that you referenced earlier. I was thinking just given all the changes happening in the broader identity landscape, your solid execution, potentially valuation dynamics, how you're thinking about M&A going forward and even appetite for larger M&A from here? Yes. I think we're a very strategy first company that's the approach that Clarence on our team is driving. And so we continuously map out the opportunities and look at build versus buy and that's how we've been very prudent and very, I would say, deliberate in the acquisitions we've done so far. I think as I alluded in the past, we think that in this environment, we're going to have even more opportunities of entry and things that will be applicable to us but it will always have to be because it's dear to our strategy and it's near to our customers. And right now, we really have a wide portfolio and are focused on delivering that to our customers. We'll always have that strong muscle of looking for opportunities to exercise on that -- on those strategic opportunities. Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Cowen & Company. Congrats on the strong execution and on guidance. Udi, 1 of the key takeaways you highlighted on your presentation under the key takeaways applied is that it kind of increased velocity of cross and upsell customers coming back faster after the initial land. Maybe can you put maybe some sort of a qualitative time frame addressing the pace in between the initial land and then kind of the expand? And secondly, what's driving that accelerated pace? Is that the macro on the 1 hand or kind of strictly the model transition or both? Yes. In terms of what's driving it, it's really the ability for us to the more of a platform selling and the fact that we have a platform that services the customer and of course, in SaaS, their ability to realize quick time to value with us, an opportunity for both upsell and get better -- faster into to consuming our offering and then cross-sell with our solutions. And again, with an easier way for the customer to get the value as they go with the cross-sell. And yes, like we mentioned, we saw it -- it take 50% year-over-year, bringing us to now 1,200 customers with over 100,000 in ARR. So we're excited about that. And it's our ability to address their needs that's driving that. We're much closer to them. And we have the telemetry to know how they're using the product and past investments in customer success, that's all been kicking in to increase that velocity. Understood. And maybe, Josh, trends from a geographic perspective, U.S., EMEA, everything appears to be absolutely stable. Maybe just some additional color on what's going on APAC? Yes. Thanks, Shaul. Yes, as I pointed out in my remarks, we had really good growth across all the regions. And particularly when you consider kind of the mix shift changes that we saw in EMEA and APJ, where both of them now are selling well over 80% in SaaS and subscription and had the kind of the largest headwinds. And even they are both at about 25%. In EMEA, we did have some FX hit, obviously, there in that region. So if you add the FX and if you add the mix, then you would get to about a 25% growth rate for EMEA on a quarter or year-on-year basis. And overall, I think the beauty of CyberArk and you've been following us a long time, so is that we've been diversified along the same kind of lines of close to 60% in Americas and 30% in EMEA and the balance in APJ now for a long time and we're seeing kind of all regions growing with the business. And your next question comes from the line of Eric Heath from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Congrats on an impressive set of results, Udi and Josh. I guess I'll ask on secrets management. Just curious what's been the customer response, particularly from maybe the developer crowd, if you will, following your recent announcements of your native integration with AWS secret management solution? And then if you could just kind of give us an updated view on the competitive landscape between yourselves and HashiCorp in the space, that would be great. Sure. And I love the question because we also had so much opportunity to see it on the road. I mentioned our impact on the road with customer events across city. So we first announced our integration with AWS in July and our Boston event and then have been taking on the road. And yes, we see, first of all, the relief on the security side where they -- it relieves our security buyer from having to educate and force change on the developer and the developer is able to work natively. And similarly, we're hearing that from developers that CyberArk is now enabling them to adopt our secrets management without changing the way they work. And we've only just begun. We're going to take this to -- we started with AWS but we're going to take this to the other cloud platform and we want to be that backbone that central for the organization for both human and secrets.
In terms of the competitive dynamic with Hashi, I think that's the prime competitor we see in that space and we're coming in from those different motions. We come in through security, we come in from -- as the business driver is really -- we want to enable the developers but security want to secure the organization and we're having a great win rate and definitely within the strong customer base. It's -- we have that opportunity for expansion. We have some low-hanging ways to land in the organization and deliver value and then we expand to their critical applications. But this will be continuously a competitive edge for us, the ability to be both trusted by security because of the strong platform that also serves humans and then also be easy to adopt by the developer because they can work natively. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Let me echo my congratulations as well. One of the things that you talked about was MFA fatigue. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on how CyberArk helps solve that challenge for customers -- and maybe how often this is serving as a new driver for business. Thanks, Jonathan. And it's actually brand new. I think for those who -- I would refer also anyone who wants to read, we put out a blog that analyzes the recent Uber reach. And that's an example where, again, legitimate user was inundated by MFA and eventually ended up accepting the hacker challenge and that was the entry point. But beyond that, it was all about credential theft on the inside. So we see ourselves as really a big part of the solution, both on the front end and I'll talk about our solution for that. But then I say if I think. But even more importantly, being that backbone that even if you enter the organization, the CyberArk Identity Security platform will prevent the ceiling of credential, the lateral movement, the privilege escalation that, for example, was seen in that attack.
And then because as a response to that, we actually were very agile and we rolled out functionality that basically adds no friction to the user but helps combat the MFA fatigue. It's a number recognition system where a user logging into CyberArk is shown a unique number on the log-in screen. And if you're not in front of the screen, if you're not a legitimate user, you're not going to be able to feed that and put the matching number into the CyberArk identity, mobile authenticator. So it gives peace of mind to the security professionals that their end users can't just say accept, they have to be the right human in front of the machine to do that. So that specifically is our solution.
Yes, we're seeing it is driving demand for -- we need a security approach to this identity challenge. It's not just managing identities, we need security companies to go after that. So it's -- we're seeing that as part of the demand and it's a differentiator for the CyberArk brand. And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver from Cantor Fitzgerald. Congrats, guys. So Udi, the question I have is around Privilege controls like secure web session, dynamic privilege access just in terms of the opportunity you might be seeing to leverage those capabilities to drive new lands and then to potentially replace existing IAM solutions. And I realize that this motion is still early and most likely a lot easier to just sell Privilege Cloud into greenfield opportunities. But what do you think of that expansion opportunity led by those privileged controls? That's a great question. It was part of our strategy to be the identity security company can be differentiated on the fact that we come in and add security controls. Even if you have and Identity and Access Management solution, that's specifically to our secure web sessions. Like you said, it's early but we're seeing that differentiated and as a place for us to land and customers that have basic single sign-on in place. And then over time and upon renewal, we can expand with them to the broad identity suite and also the broad offering from CyberArk. Dynamic Privileged Access is a very light way to add on to our PAM and the differentiator in the market where we give a very simple way to manage a modern environment. So it's in everything we do. It's in every I would say, sales process today and gives us -- these offerings gives us also a way to get a healthy premium over standard identity solutions and really push that strategy that this is the identity security vendor. Yes. That's helpful. A quick follow-up is related to channel. Could you just update us on the channel motion as it relates to your SaaS offerings. And it also see in terms of the opportunity to engage with SIs in public cloud providers beyond what you're doing with secrets with the public cloud guys? Okay. So it's been very strategic for us. As we move through this whole transition in a SaaS first transition to bring our channel partners on board with us. It's in our training and in everything we do, it was central to our partner event around impact that our channels will be trained on the SaaS offering and that's what they expected. They also like the quick time to value that you get with SaaS and they're embracing the SaaS solutions. And so I would say that that's across the full channel landscape, even all the way to the advisories. They get it. If the customer is consuming or adopting SaaS then there's a faster time to value. With regards to the SIs around the world, we're seeing them really both with their seats, I would say, in our trainings and getting certified in the sense of, well, CyberArk is really building a healthy long-term company here. And we can count on them to build a business practice. So they're building business practices around us. And they can see the same motion that we talked about here and the growth that we talked about today, is also reflecting in their results, the ability to cross-sell and all of that is reflecting.
On -- with regards to AWS in addition to the Secrets Hub, extending to the ability to work natively with AWS we're active on the AWS marketplace, like we mentioned in the past and we continue to see that as a good way an expansion in deals complementary to our other partners and we're seeing that marketplace momentum building up. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Congrats on the results. My first 1 is, every vendor in identity seems to be scrambling to kind of replicate this complete identity platform that you guys have built. So maybe how is that helping you kind of evangelize the sale of a complete identity platform? And what specifically are you guys doing to capitalize on this lead that you have over the other vendors in the market? No. Great question. I think -- and I mentioned it sometimes in my face-to-face meeting with investment that I would not start differently with our journey. I mean, coming as the experts in PAM, tackling the most difficult problem in identity and the most sought after attack vector for the attackers and then expanding to identity and doing that all on the SaaS platform is a unique CyberArk benefit. We really came into identity as a cybersecurity company versus coming to security as an identity management company. And we think that, that's the credible and the right motion customers can tell when there's the cybersecurity expertise behind it. And of course, the leg up is there's a lot of disruption in our competitive base, all the private equity takedowns are causing a lot of distraction, both in PAM vendors [Technical Difficulty]. Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost connection with the speakers. Please remain on the line. All right. So I think I pretty much wrapped up. Sorry about that. I think we're pretty much wrapped up the question there and we are definitely seeing that competitive opportunity and our stepping on the sales and marketing panel. And again, in a prudent, smart way, like Josh was alluding to capture that opportunity. And a lot of it is also I would say, in a flywheel effect with the customer base. We have a strong customer base. We have a strong channel base and it gives us that flywheel affect to leverage. That was great. I just have 1 follow-up, if I could and I apologize if it was already addressed but how was your federal business in the quarter? I wouldn't say that it was -- we didn't expect it to be an outstanding quarter. I would just say it wasn't outside. But the global government continues to be about 10% of our business. I would say, in general, we're seeing that the federal cycles can be a little slow. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Bulian from Citigroup. And we'll move on to the next question from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. This is Hersha [ph] on for Ittai. Congrats on the results. I just wanted to ask about the Cloud Entitlements Manager solution which is still relatively new. How has early adoption fared here? And how large do you think this opportunity is relative to other solutions like EPM and access? Well, we -- as we presented at our impact events, we actually view that as a component in a larger pillar that we call cloud private security which we think is big. And that that includes our solution for secure cloud access. Everything that has to do with managing transparent and easy access to the cloud environment, the cloud consoles. With regards to CM, it's a component there. It's very much about identifying over privilege in cloud and it's a leading the rest of the solution in that pillar. So I would say, one, it's early. And two, it's going to be a component of a much larger pillar which yes, definitely could be as big as EPM and as we continue to evolve there on that pillar. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the product mix of net new ARR for the quarter, were there any products that had a significant change in contribution when you compare it to 2Q? No, I would say the subscription ARR split is like we discussed last time, they're all growing which is the good news. I would say the PAM ARR is about 55%. EPM is probably about 20%, identity is about 15%, secrets management is about 10% of that subscription ARR piece of the pie. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. This is Justin Donati on for Andy. You talked a lot about your land and expand motion here on the call. So I'm just wondering if you could provide any update on either your closing rates or your pipeline between new versus existing customers? Yes. I don't know that I have kind of a ready information there. I would say that we're building a robust pipeline on both fronts and that's kind of our go-to-market approach. Our reps have a portfolio of both existing customers and new customers to go after and of course, leveraging the channel partnerships, the TQ lines that we have for landing the new logos. I would just say that it's continued to be a robust diversified pipeline. Great. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Regarding your large customers over $100,000 in ARR. Can you just update us on how many solutions on average those customers are using? Again, I probably don't have -- I would say that you can have easily have a PAM customer that exceeded that. But we value the most, the landing and the growth and also includes a cross-sell. So the majority would have at least 2 products in the mix. And of course, this is like the over 100,000 ARR we have some very significant ones and the large ones, we, over time, see them not just upsell but also get cross-sell solutions in there. And your next question comes from the line of Tima Bolani from Citigroup. We'll go on to our next question from Trevor Walsh from JMP Securities. Udi, you had a brief mention of Zero Trust as being an influencer. And I was wondering if you could maybe give a little color around how that influenced the strong performance, if at all, as far as new customer logos 230 or so for the quarter which was we thought was strong. So is there a dynamic there where that type of architecture around Zero Trust is actually driving that -- those engagements on the identity piece? Or is that more maybe current PAM customers coming in and looking to support their Zero Trust plans with what they've already got going with you guys? How is that -- I guess, how are those engagements happening on the cost? That's a great question. And I would say that it's happening in both. I see it in both existing customers. When we do our executive briefing center with the customer base, they are replaying back to us but this is how they presented to their Board and the management that PAM and identity security part of their Zero Trust, how can you achieve 0 trust with excess privileges. So everything the least privileged motion is really critical to that. And so we hear that from the customer base. And yes, our field and channels are definitely seeing that it's part of the decision-making in the land or in the pickup of the new logos that it's -- they're looking for impactful solutions, again, to prevent breaches, prevent in an assumed breach prevent any lateral movement and massive impact of the breach and as a way for them to show that they really reduced the massive amount of risk and executing on Zero Trust strategy. So yes, it's definitely in both. And Your next question comes from the line of Brian Colley from Stephens. So clearly, you all have a lot of strong tailwinds driving momentum in the business right now. I kind of wanted to hone in on some and see if you could maybe just rank order what you see as kind of the 3 biggest growth drivers or tailwinds for the business right now? And then kind of looking forward, maybe rank order kind of what you see as various growth drivers moving into 2023, if it's changed at all between whether it's multiproduct adoption, new logos, or greenfield PAM wins with new customers? Okay. So in terms of business drivers, I would really put up that it's considered -- we're considered a must-have for achieving Zero Trust and preventing breaches. So we kind of love the Zero Trust and attacker innovation and really having a meaningful impact there. That's in terms of business -- business drivers and then definitely add underneath that various areas where there's a compliance need insider threat prevention but attacker innovation and, I would say, followed by digital transformation, like the attack surface is growing so much. And then how do we prevent breaches on that growing attack surface. That's from a business driver.
I would say the result, it's go-to-market execution against this ever-growing demand. So we're a high priority and we're executing, like I mentioned, both on the channel front, our sales team in both new logos and add-on business. Leveraging the speed builds that we put in place to upsell or cross-sell our speed builds solutions in secrets management and identity and we're continuously taking market share as we do this. Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about your efforts with the channel expansion, can you just help us frame up kind of what innings you think you're in on that front? I mean it seems like it's clearly already driving an increase in new logo wins and incremental business. I'm curious if you think we're kind of still in the early innings of that and whether it could potentially drive further acceleration from here kind of what percentage of new deals are the channel contributing to today? Yes. I would say that in the past, I talked about that we were like a notch one on really kicking off the channel opportunity. The team has really been executing well. I'm hearing from the CEO of our channel partners that -- and I would love hearing that we are in their top 10, 10 producers, the top 5 producers and we want to continuously move up there. CyberArk wants to be the top winner for -- and again, the top provider in terms of our -- the business for our general partners. And I think we continuously see that probably more than 70% of the business is with our channel partners. So it's a growing motion. You -- like I said earlier, it's kind of as a flywheel effect, you see that as they succeed, they invest more, they invest more in training. We talked about the growth in the -- on the amount of CyberArk certified personnel.
And so I wouldn't give it -- I would put something in the middle of the inning, because we moved it along from our execution and really working with the best of the best across the world but there's so much opportunity as we leverage this flywheel. And on top of everything I mentioned, we're in the early innings with the MSSPs and that's a big opportunity. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Udi Mokady. I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks. Great. Thank you very much. We had another strong quarter, demonstrating durable demand for our solutions and momentum in our business. And as always, I want to thank our customers and partners and our dear global employees for being the cornerstone of our success. Thank you very much. And again, I want to thank the team for the hard work and strong execution this quarter. Talk soon. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2022 CyberArk Software Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].
Erica Smith, SVP, Investor Relations and ESG. You may begin your conference. Thank you, Chantal. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. With me on the call today are Udi Mokady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt Cohen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Josh Siegel, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information.
I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the first quarter full year 2023 and beyond. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to the website.
CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call.
We also want to remind you that we provide the calculated revenue headwind for additional color on the impact of our subscription mix shift, but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Udi Mokady. Udi? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We had another strong quarter to cap off an amazing year, where we outperformed, executed and delivered against each of our key strategic initiatives in 2022. We optimized our go-to-market engine, expanded our channel partnerships and enhanced our platform selling motion. Our breakaway innovation extended our solutions well beyond PAM and resulted in CyberArk being recognized as the leader in Identity Security. We are in a great competitive position, and we are taking market share, not only in PAM, but across our product portfolio.
We entered 2023 with a more durable, more resilient and highly visible business model. CyberArk is in a position of strength well on our way to our $1 billion ARR target, and we have already reset our sights well beyond that. Because of this execution, as we are gearing up for 2023, we recognized that CyberArk was in the best possible position to make the executive changes we announced this morning. In early April, I will move into the Executive Chair role and Matt Cohen, our Chief Operating Officer, will become our CEO. Matt is an incredible leader, and I can't imagine a better person to be the next CEO of CyberArk.
Since joining the company, he had a tremendous value and has been instrumental to our success. He experimented the subscription transition, transformed our go-to-market engine and has inspired people across the organization to deliver well ahead of expectations. With his support and leadership, we have delivered tremendous results and the company is set up for long-term success. While my role with CyberArk is changing as Executive Chair, I'll stay very active, working with Matt and the management team, I will focus on shaping our future by aligning our long-term strategy to our mission, preserving CyberArk's unique culture and brand and fostering relationships with key customers and partners. It is very important to me that we get this right and that we have a smooth transition, continuity of leadership and that we don't skip a beat in our execution.
I believe that our plan accomplishes these objectives. Personally, Matt and I have formed a strong partnership based on shared values, a commitment to our mission and friendship. We will continue to work together closely to ensure CyberArk executes and that we deliver our vision. Matt has joined us today, and I'm going to hand it over to him for a few comments.
Matt? Thank you, Udi. It is the honor of a lifetime to be named the next CEO of CyberArk. Udi, along with Josh, the leadership team and every site of our employees have worked hard to build an amazing company. Udi has been a mentor and become a dear friend over the last 3 years. He is a special leader with genuine empathy and measurable energy and deep passion for our mission, our culture and our people. I am looking so forward to working with him to scale CyberArk, drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value. I will also focus on preserving the company's culture, which has been so critical to CyberArk's success. Our leadership team is completely aligned on our plan for 2023 and our long-term vision and our massive opportunity. Our future has never been brighter, and I am humbled to lead CyberArk's next chapter.
I will now turn the call back to Udi to talk about the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Matt. Moving into the quarter. Our performance demonstrates a few key points: First, the power of our business model; second, the durability of demand for our Identity Security platform; and lastly, the strength of our execution. The financial highlights include: subscription ARR reached $364 million, growing 99% year-over-year. We also added a record $63 million in net new subscription ARR from the end of Q3. Total ARR reached $570 million, growing 45% year-over-year, well ahead of our November guidance.
ARR is still the best metric to measure our success. We ended the year with more than 1,300 customers, with over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, growing more than 40% year-over-year. Total revenue came in at $169 million for the fourth quarter, with a subscription booking mix of 90% in Q4, well ahead of our guidance framework. The mix created a revenue headwind of about $24 million. Normalizing the mix for the fourth quarter of last year, our revenue would have grown by 27% this quarter.
The license portion of our business, our SaaS subscription and would have grown about 42%. As we talk about the quarter, I will frame today's discussion around growth, innovation and profitability. Persistent secular tailwinds are contributing to our growth. I've spoken to dozens of customers and partners in the last few months, and they all face similar challenges. Digital transformation is leading to an explosion of identities, both human and machine.
Implementing Zero Trust strategies remains complex and time consuming. And attacker innovation is only accelerated with the emergence of new technology and new attack vectors. Take ChatGPT, our lab team posted breakthrough research on ChatGPT, which can dynamically mutate malware, making it incredibly hard to detect and stop. With examples like this, there is a little debate that identity is the attack surface and taking an assumed breach mindset is the best way to protect the enterprise.
In the fourth quarter, we landed with more than 380 new customers. And for the full year, we added more than 1,100 new logos, an all-time record for CyberArk. We continue to see strong diversity in our business and are signing customers from health care and biotech, hotel, fashion brands, hospitals, manufacturing, banking and insurance companies. A few examples include: a multinational health care company couldn't scale with its existing PAM point solution, particularly given the increasing number of machine identities within the organization.
In a 7-figure rip and replace deal, the customer will protect human and machine identities with our modern Privilege Cloud and Secrets Management solutions. A large hotel chain is building its enterprise-wide Identity Security program on our platform. During the quarter, this cloud-first organization landed with Privilege Cloud, Workforce Password Management and Dynamic Privileged Access as its first steps with plans to expand to MFA and single sign-on in 2023. We Cyber insurance was once again a driver in Q4 across many examples, including a prominent clothing brand buying Privilege Cloud to meet the insurance requirements and lower premiums.
Our subscription transition is increasing the velocity of add-on business, particularly with our SaaS solutions. A few examples. A major hotel chain is accelerating its cloud-first strategy with CyberArk expanding coverage from PAM, CyberArk Identity and Secrets Management to Endpoint Privilege Manager. A Global 2000 financial services company was our first Conjur Cloud customer and also Secret Hub. As customers implement Zero Trust strategies, they want the peace of mind with a single pane of glass into all privileged activity, visibility that only CyberArk can provide today.
A Fortune 500 health care company expanded its Identity Security program and decided Cloud Entitlements Manager, Endpoint Privilege Manager and Dynamic Privileged Access as game changers for securing its cloud-first environment. We are seeing returns from strengthening our partner program in 2022. The new routes to market, enhance collaboration and improve efficiency across the ecosystem increased our momentum and significantly expanded our reach. As an example, the number of unique CyberArk certified partners grew by over 90%, and the certifications across our platform continue to grow, a great indication for future growth in our Access and Secrets Management solutions.
Before moving into innovation, we wanted to comment on the macro environment. While Identity Security remains top priority, more approvals continue to be required in deals, consistent with what we saw in prior quarters. The demand trends, deal progression, win rates, renewal rates and sales cycles remain healthy across the board, which we see in our strong ARR growth.
On the innovation side, we were thrilled to be named a leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management in early Q4, making us the only company to be named a leader by Gartner for both PAM and Access Management. We are already benefiting from the Magic Quadrant with the pipeline for our CyberArk Identity reaching new record. We believe this is another important validation of our strategy to deliver the most complete Identity Security platform in the market.
The enhancements of CyberArk Identity, like flows and our innovations in PAM, including broader threat detection and response on VMs and self-hosted machines differentiate us in the field. Innovation continues to be the cornerstone of our success. In addition, we won our first deals for AWS Secret Hub and Conjur Cloud during the fourth quarter.
Josh will cover profitability in more detail. But as we look into 2023, we will continue to invest with discipline and expect to leverage each of our operating expense lines. Most importantly, we plan to be agile in our investment plans and have the flexibility to make adjustments as we move through the year. When looking through the transition dynamics, we are operating CyberArk as a Rule of 40 company today and remain committed to delivering profitable growth.
To ensure we capitalize on our growth opportunity, we expanded our management team adding Chris Kelly as CRO. Chris joined us from Adobe, where he scaled the Global Customer Solutions business. Chris is already making an impact. He hit the ground running and participated in our global kickoff last month. He fit seamlessly into the cyber culture and is fully supported by each of our 3 theater heads.
As we look into the coming year, our top priorities for 2023 include accelerate our Identity Security platform sales motion across PAM, EPM, Access and Secrets Management, further leverage the channel and marketing alignment to extend our reach, enhance our customer success organization at scale to ensure we protect and expand our base of ARR and deliver cutting edge innovation and extend our leadership position in Identity Security.
With our execution over the years, CyberArk is in a position of strength. We have a strong experienced management team focused on executing our strategy. We have a massive market opportunity and are taking market share. Our Identity Security platform is mission-critical, and our solutions are being prioritized even in today's challenging macro environment. I have never been more energized or enthusiastic about CyberArk, our leadership position, our team, our culture, and our future.
We have put in place a best-in-class transition that will help ensure that we deliver against this massive opportunity. I'm looking forward to working closely with Matt, the Board and the entire CyberArk team as we build CyberArk to a $1 billion ARR company and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our strong financial results in more detail and provide you with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023.
Josh up to you. Thanks, Udi. As Udi mentioned, we were pleased with the durable demand for our solutions. Customers are embracing our Identity Security platform and our subscription model is delivered, resulting in annual recurring revenue growing 45% and reaching $570 million. That's well ahead of our guidance. The subscription portion reached $364 million, increasing 99% and now represents 64% of our total. We had another record quarter for net new subscriptions and total ARR driven by the strong demand for our solutions, particularly for SaaS.
Our progress is clear when you compare today to a year ago when the subscription portion was only $183 million, then just 46% of total and half of our year-end 2022 amount. Our guidance in February of last year estimated just 35% to 36% growth in total ARR to outperform and grow nearly 10 percentage points faster showcases the strength of our execution throughout the year. We have convincingly flipped our business to a fully recurring model, a key multiyear goal we set just under 2 years ago in our March 2021 Investor Day.
The maintenance portion was $206 million at year-end. The year-over-year and sequential decline in maintenance ARR was due to the decline in the perpetual license sales expected and included in our guidance. We continue to see very strong renewal rates of more than 90% for our perpetual maintenance business. In addition, our visibility continues to increase with the remaining performance obligations now at $730 million at year-end. That's increasing 38% from December 2021. Total revenue of $169 million, grew 12% year-on-year and was impacted by our subscription bookings mix, which hit a record 90% for the fourth quarter. That's well above the guidance framework we provided.
Economically, the revenue headwind created by the mix and duration was approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter. That's when we compare like-for-like to the fourth quarter 2021 when the mix was just 71%, taking the calculated revenue headwind into consideration, total revenue would have grown by 27% year-on-year. And if you include the $1.5 million in currency impact as well, we would have grown by 28%. If you isolate just the license portion of revenue adjusted for headwinds, our license revenue grew by 42% in the fourth quarter.
On the macro environment, during the quarter, we continue to experience more approval of deal cycles. And in addition, some existing customers also wanted shorter commitments, opting for 1-year versus 3-year deals related to self-hosted subscription or our term-based license contracts, which impacted our duration, recognized revenue and long-term deferred in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with our bookings and to see Identity Security programs being prioritized.
Momentum in our business continued, and the demand environment is resilient with budgets being allocated as evidenced by the significant ARR outperformance and the strength of our new logos.
Moving into the details of the revenue line for the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue reached $88.5 million, growing 86% year-on-year, representing 52% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our move to a subscription business model, perpetual license revenue came in at about $14.6 million.
Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $66.1 million, that's $54.1 million coming from recurring maintenance and the balance of $12 million in professional services revenue. Recurring revenue reached $142.6 million or 84% of total revenue, growing 39% year-on-year from $102.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. The Americas revenue reached $99.5 million, growing 15% year-on-year. EMEA grew by 5% year-on-year to $51.8 million and APJ grew by 13% to $17.8 million of revenue.
Normalizing for the mix and the duration, the Americas would have grown by 31% year-over-year and APJ by 30%. Normalizing the headwind and FX, EMEA would have grown by about 24% in the fourth quarter. All line items of the P&L that I'll discuss now are on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $140.2 million or 83% gross margin compared with 86% in fourth quarter last year. The lower year-on-year gross margin is in large part due to the significantly increased portion of SaaS revenues and the result of the declining of the perpetual license sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. While we continue to make disciplined investments to drive innovation and growth, our results demonstrate our operational rigor as evidenced by our operating expenses increasing 20% to $136.1 million, resulting in income of $4.1 million, and that compared to our headwinds adjusted revenue growth of 27% in the fourth quarter. We are still being impacted by the mix shift towards ratable revenue, which lowered our operating results.
Normalizing for the headwinds, our operating margin would have been positive 14% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this only level set to the mix to the prior year, not all the way back to the beginning of the transition. Net income was $7.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share, beating our guide for the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenue was $591.7 million, accelerated to 18% year-on-year growth versus the 8% last year.
For the full year, subscription bookings mix was 88%, which was higher than we were expecting and which resulted in approximately a $72 million headwind for the full year. This compared to a 66% subscription bookings mix for the full year 2021. Normalizing for the headwind, the total revenue would have grown 32% year-on-year. And for the full years -- for the full year, Americas would have grown by 23%, EMEA by 9% and APJ by 12%. Normalizing for the headwind for Americas -- normalizing for that headwind, though, the Americas grew by 38%, EMEA by 23% and APJ by 28% year-on-year.
Moving down the P&L for the full year. Our gross margin for the year was better than we expected at 82% as we closely manage the expenses related to SaaS. Operating loss was $22.4 million. Normalizing for the headwind, operating margin would have been a positive 7% for the full year. Our net loss was $0.44 per basic and diluted share, which was also impacted by the same revenue headwind of $72 million for the full year.
We also observed an FX impact for the full year of approximately $6 million on revenue, $7 million on ARR and $2 million on operating income. We continue to attract and retain top talent ending December with over 2,750 employees worldwide, including nearly 1, 160 in sales and marketing. For the full year, free cash flow was $37.2 million or 6% free cash flow margin, which came in nicely ahead of the free cash flow guardrails we set for the full year and demonstrates the strength of our subscription model.
Turning to our guidance. Our guidance for the first year -- for the first quarter and the full year 2023, balances, the strong competitive position and the durable demand for our platform against the uncertainty in the macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue of $160 million to $164 million, which represents 27% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about $15.5 million to $12.5 million for the first quarter, and we expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from a net loss of $0.30 to $0.23 per basic and diluted share.
Our guidance also assumes 41.3 million weighted average basic and diluted shares and about $4 million in taxes. For the full year 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $724 million to $736 million. that's representing growth of between 22% and 24%, an acceleration from our 18% growth rate in 2022 and consistent with the playbook we outlined when we kicked off our subscription transition. For the full year, we expect our operating results to range between an operating loss of $5 million and an operating income of $5 million. We expect a range of net income per share of $0. 07 to $0. 28. And for the full year, we expect about 46.1 million weighted average diluted shares. We also expect about $20 million in taxes.
For the full year, we expect annual recurring revenue to be between $730 million and $740 million at December 31, 2023, or between 28% and 30% year-over-year growth. To help model the expenses for the year, we expect to see an increase in marketing expenses in the second quarter related to our Global Impact Customer event and its World Tour, leading to a seasonally lower operating income in the second quarter. For the full year, we plan to leverage our P&L with each operating expense line growing at a slower rate in 2023 compared to 2022.
The increase in our expenses fall into 3 main categories: increasing investments in our cloud infrastructure to support our record SaaS bookings in 2022, which we expect to -- which we expect will lower our gross margin for the full year to between 80% and 81%; second, making critical investments in R&D, including our SaaS and self-hosted solutions; and lastly, the investments in sales and marketing, we have deep conviction in the opportunity and our incredibly strong competitive position.
As we think about our guidance for the year, we plan to be agile on our investments. If we see the demand environment change, we will adjust our hiring and investment plans for 2023.
Moving to free cash flow margin. We anticipate that it will be approximately equal to our non-GAAP net income margin over a 12-month period. We remain focused on capitalizing on the massive opportunity in front of us that will deliver profitable growth and strong cash flow, creating long-term value for shareholders.
If we sum up 2022, we were pleased to complete our subscription transition ahead of schedule already in the first quarter. The benefits of our subscription engine are already starting to kick in. Revenue growth accelerated to 18% in 2022, and there is further acceleration expected in 2023. As you saw from the guidance I just provided, we expect operating margins to have bottomed out in 2022 and to modestly improve in 2023. And what's even more exciting is that we expect even more meaningful improvement once we get beyond 2023 and the flywheel effect fully kicks in.
Before I turn the call over for QA, I'd also like to congratulate Matt, we are aligned on our vision for execution and strategy and very much look forward to continue working closely with him in his new role.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for QA. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Let me just start by saying, Udi, it's been a pleasure working with you. Wish you best of luck as Executive Chair, very happy you're still staying with the company. And Matt, very much look forward to working with you as well after all the work that you've done through this transition. Thank you so much, Saket. Thank you, Saket. Maybe -- yes, absolutely. Maybe shifting to the business, Udi, maybe starting with you. I was wondering if you could just zoom out and talk about why you think Privileged Account Management seems to be bucking the trend in this macro. There are more headcount reductions happening in certain areas of the economy, not all security companies are seeing this type of ARR. I'm curious why you think PAM or just maybe even just the broader identity as a category seems to be doing better? Obviously, we're very excited that we continue to outperform and the 45% growth in ARR. Privileged Access Management is one of the few critical security layers that really make a difference in enterprise security. I would categorize it in one of the few that are on the must have side of enterprise buying decisions. And no matter how you dissect every attack that's in the news, there's -- that point of no return is when they elevated privileges, moved laterally, captured identities. And CyberArk captures both the human and machine identities in our PAM platform and in our Identity Security platform.
And today, it's become clear that Identity is not just the new perimeter. Identity is the attack surface. And so it's one of the few things that enterprises do today. And of course, we pioneered the space. We're a market leader in the space. And the flip side of it is also executing on that opportunity that we created through our best-in-class go-to-market team, our channels and of course, delivering great solutions, all of these years. And I would say that the team is executing and firing all cylinders against a growing opportunity. That makes a lot of sense. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. Great to see the ARR guide for next year. I was wondering if you could just go one little deeper into some of your assumptions in terms of macro in terms of close rates, in terms of maintenance ARR, there's obviously a lot that goes into that ARR forecast. Is there anything you just want us to know given the -- what is still arguably an uncertain macro? Yes. Thanks, Saket. And you're right, there are a couple of dynamics that play for ARR. First of all, as we've been kind of talking about over the last year, we do expect maintenance ARR to decrease. It started to last year in 2022, and we can see it's decreasing of a couple of million dollars a quarter into 2023. And so effectively, you're seeing that we're guiding generally to a flat net new subscription ARR for 2023.
The other dynamic is, if all things are held equal, if we look at our win rates, our pipeline and in the macro, we actually believe we can grow faster than that. But given the current macro and where we are in the year, I think we believe this is really the right starting point as we guide for 2023. But if I were to end, I'd say we're actually really confident in the underlying demand environment, and we have the pipeline to actually support a faster growth than in the ARR side. Your next question is from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Congratulations, Udi, and look forward to working with you, Matt. Just for Udi, it seems like CyberArk is really separating itself from the pack from a lot of your competitors, which have been acquired and others that may be facing their own execution challenges. CyberArk has been a profitable company in the past. But just given that the opportunity that you're seeing and the success that you're seeing in multiple Identity categories, how do you think about just doubling down investment and continuing to just accelerate your share gain versus getting back to those very high margins that you saw prior to the transition? Yes. So thanks, Hamza. I think we've been very prudent in leveraging our market leadership in the space and in pioneering. I think as both Josh and I said, we're creating a plan that's very agile. We're going after this opportunity. We do want to return back to the beautiful profitability we had before the transition. And then -- and of course, coming to it with that position of strong -- of fully ratable revenue. But we are investing where we see the strong ROI coming, and we have a plan that's going to keep us agile on this front, and that includes PAM that includes going after the Access opportunity now that we're a leader in the Magic Quadrant there and includes going after the Secrets Management angle as well and of course, EPM. So we do have those great growth engines. SaaS delivered, and we'll invest, we'll do it like the CyberArk, agile but prudent. Got it. Josh, on that front, can you give any color around the percentage of ARR that's coming from some of the different categories like Access Management, PAM, et cetera? I think you've done that in the past as well. Yes. If we kind of look at the ARR pie, it's been pretty consistent. PAM is still around 55% of that subscription ARR, with EPM coming in a second at 2 0%, Access at 15% and Secrets around 10%. Your next question is from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. In the prepared remarks, you did talk about the record new logo additions that you had during the year and talked about optimized go-to-market extended channel partnerships. Maybe focus a little bit on the channel front with the new partners, what is their contribution to net new ARR at this point? And how do you expect that to ramp throughout '23 and into the future? Yes. I would say definitely strong contributors to the growth and in capturing the new logos. And especially as we expanded and have more and more channels trained on the new solutions also helping us land with Access and other fronts. I don't have the metric handy of how much do we attribute. But again, the majority of our sales involve channels. And probably 70%, 80% of our business, we attribute through direct work with channels. So there are definitely strong contributors to this net ARR.
And I think, like I mentioned in the remarks, it's strategic for us to have them embracing our broad portfolio, and we see that through their certifications and training and through sales that they're continuously expanding beyond PAM with us also to Access and Secretes Management. And quickly for Josh, as you contemplate the profitable growth and the return of margin moving forward, having gone through the transition, how should we think about free cash flow and any hints there in terms of modeling it? Yes. Thanks, Rob. And as I talked about earlier in the remarks, we're -- I would look at over a 12-month period because we get a lot of seasonality and fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. But on a 12-month period for 2023, we're looking at free cash flow at non-GAAP net income margin level.
And then I think if I would add to that, because you also talked about kind of post transition as we kind of continue on through the transition, we certainly would expect to see that as expansion of free cash flow in the out years as our -- as we get to already back into '24 and '25, and we're post now roundtripping our full ARR base. Your next question is from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please go ahead. And Udi, sad to see you go, but I'm looking forward to getting Matt hard times from here. So maybe I'll start with you. Just with respect to the model transition, as you essentially move it into Phase 2 of the transition with continued ARR growth, I'm curious what sort of changes if at all, that you're thinking about making by way of go-to-market bundling pricing strategy? So any of those inputs potentially changing the way you scale the ARR base from here? And would love to hear Matt chime in too, if relevant. And a follow-up for Josh, please. So it's Udi, first of all, thanks, Fatima. I'm staying, but I'm looking forward to giving Matt a hard time. And let's start with that. Maybe Matt, you take this. Sure, Udi. Thanks. I think as we look at 2023, we kind of just see continued momentum in the go-to-market channels that we've already put into place. We've started to rely and kind of build a much stronger engine in the marketing organization to help us with the kind of demand generation, and we continue to put more focus and frankly, more resources on that ability to be able to drive pipe that way. Certainly, our bundles have been a piece of the success over the last couple of years where we have our core PAM-C come with a little bit of identity and a little bit of other areas that help to drive and see those products in.
We're certainly instituting a price increase in 2023 here, kind of matched to the inflationary environment that we've seen, and that will help us kind of get a little bit of uptick. And then as we were just talking about, we push on the channel partner program and making sure that these -- what we keep referring to is new routes to market, the focus with the MSP program, the distributors, even the marketplaces that are out there and leveraging them to help us drive demand.
But I look at 2023 kind of as a continuation of what we've been doing because we've been seeing such success with that. Your next question is from the line of Eric Heath with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt, congratulations on the new appointment there. Udi, I guess both a question for you and Matt. Looking forward, I mean, I guess, how do you think of CyberArk success? How much is predicated on successful moving into Access Management beyond, call it, Broader Privilege Access? And how meaningful do you push into that market over the next few years, given it is a more competitive market, and there's really a couple of large vendors that kind of already are large incumbents in the space. So how do you think about that initiative over the next couple of years? . Yes, absolutely. I think the beauty of the CyberArk chart right now is that we have such a great opportunity in PAM itself as such a critical layer of security and then this growth engine in Access, in Access, our business almost doubled in ARR. We're seeing a record pipeline or improving win rates. I mentioned that now with the Magic Quadrant, we're also invited to more and more RFPs. So the way we look at it is great upside for us in expanding into access. We are and we will and that we're doing it differentiated.
You mentioned competition. We're coming to it as from the makers of PAM, those who really pioneered the hardest layer of security in identity, the hardest part of identity coming into securing all types of identities, the human workforce users, the third-party supplier, the machine identities and coming to it from that position of strength and trust as the security vendor. So we are going after it. And -- but we're going after it in a differentiated way. We have a great customer base to leverage. We have new lending -- new ways to land and so it is an upside along with, of course, the other growth entrants like Secrets Management. And I would just add here that I think increasingly, it's an Identity Security story with our customers, and we're able to talk to them about our platform, we're able to talk to them about all the solutions working together to drive value and to protect their environments. And so when we think about our recent Global kickoff that we just had where we had all our sellers together, the main story that we were training on is how to position the full Identity Security story. And that brings us then obviously with the foundation in PAM, but outside into these other areas in our conversations with our customers. Your next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Congrats, Udi. Congrats, Matt. Best wishes to you looking forward to working with Matt. Udi, what a ride. I actually had a question about machine identity, I think you just mentioned that you and Matt. At a recent conference, you made some, I would even say, both statement about machine identity the opportunity and CyberArk taking pretty much a nice share longer term within this market.
Can you talk to us about what you see within the machine identity now you guys are doing absolutely great on the human side. But what should we be expecting out of CyberArk going forward within the machine identity arena? Yes, absolutely, Shaul. And again, thanks for the warm words. I think what we discovered in our surveys and also in the field is that with digital transformation and with cloud adoption, organizations are creating a multitude more machine identities than they have human identities even to the factor of 45 times more machines than you and that's what I mentioned in the conference.
And as Matt mentioned earlier, we're going after this with a platform sale that covers both the human and machine under identity Security. And it's becoming this gaming hall. By the way, in some of the recent breaches the point of no return is -- was when the attacker achieved privileged access through credentials that were identities, and we're able to get into systems that way. And so our strategy is to do that with our platform and to make it easier and easier for the developers to adopt our solutions as we announced that at our last Big Impact event. And as we mentioned, we're seeing our first customers adopted. We announced Secrets Hub, which make it very completely transparent to the developer to work natively in the cloud environment.
The first announcement was with AWS Secret Store, where CyberArk is the backbone securing Secrets for all types of applications, both on-premise cloud environments and it's transparent to the developers. So that's going to be our strategy going forward. Make it easy for the developer, but provide the security professionals, the single pane of glass, the -- and be the backbone to securing all types of credentials and identities. Your next question is from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And Matt, congratulations from me as well. Hopefully, Udi, we still get to engage with you on a regularly frequent basis. So nice to see that you're sticking with the company, and we'll remain engaged. I guess for me, I'd like to maybe see if we can like dig into ARR a little bit. It looks like you had some nice new logo adds. It's almost like the new customer cadence didn't flinch in this macro and then net new ARR or the ARR contribution from those new adds.
It seems like you're landing at a greater pace or at a greater amount for new logos. But I know you also mentioned some -- I think, Udi, you mentioned some shorter duration incidents in with revenue. Maybe could you dig in there a little bit and offset where are you seeing the headwinds outside of shorter duration? And what do you attribute the larger, I guess, land rates with new logos, too? So I'll start, Josh, and maybe you want to what to step in. And thank you, Brian. I would say from the new logos, we see that half of them land with PAM and additional solutions. So the platform sale is working. So we see that contribution of the wider portfolio to a growing deal size in our landing spot. And of course, it's a great for us as we work on the renewals and expansion in our ARR model. And again, that was something we've been proving throughout the years. Matt mentioned some of the bundling that we've done and that's all contributing to a better land.
And I think like I've mentioned in other calls, we have more landing points. And of course, PAM is still the majority. And back to the first question for the day, PAM being so critical, but we're able to land with PAM plus additional solutions. And you asked about the duration. So Josh off to you. Yes. So Brian, when we think about the duration, it actually doesn't impact at all the ARR. The duration is we refer to as part of the headwind because it's part of our self-hosted term-based license contracts. And as you know, as duration goes down, you would recognize less in the end period. So we saw duration come in during the fourth quarter on those term-based license contracts, which had some headwind on our recognized revenue for the fourth quarter, but it's just a matter of when we'll recognize it and we'll just recognize more of it down the road upon renewals.
So we think that certainly the shorter duration was kind of attributed to customers looking at their budgets and their intent for buying and deciding that they were going for 1 year instead of longer term. But from our perspective, given our very high renewal rates, particularly on all of our products that we're good with that because it's not an impact on the business. It's just purely creating more ratability. Your next question is from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead. And congrats to both Udi and Matt. Maybe for Josh, you've talked in the past about a single-digit growth rate from ARR coming from converting the existing maintenance base to subscription and SaaS. And I was just curious kind of was that true for all of fiscal '22? And how should we think about the conversion mix in the context of fiscal '23 guidance? Yes, Adam. It actually was pretty consistent all through 2022. And if we look at it from an annual basis, it was exactly that kind of a single-digit percentage of the AR growth rate coming from conversions. And we're really happy with that because it really shows, first of all that we're getting a lot of new customers. And we're also getting a lot of add-ons coming in off of their existing installed base. And it continues to provide a lot of engagement with our existing customers going forward. So yes, it remains around just the single digits. Great. Any expectations for that to change in fiscal '23? No, at this point, we don't see signals for that. But clearly, we're monitoring it. And I think -- and our guide obviously contemplates our estimates for that. Your next question is from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Udi and Matt, I want to echo my congrats on your respective moves. and congrats on what overall looks like a very smooth transition. Maybe for Udi or for Matt, you've consistently talked about a SaaS heavy transition. And it looks like that was even more so the case in 4Q with SaaS growing nicely above 100%. Any high-level thoughts on the expectations of Privilege Cloud versus term-based license '23?
And specifically, what are you hearing from customers around demand for self-hosted versus SaaS and the feature there? Yes, sure. This is Matt here. So I think that we continue to be really enthused by the momentum in Privilege Cloud. We see, obviously, most of our new logos that are choosing to land with PAM, they land with Privilege Cloud. It's definitely the default option the customers get to value significantly quicker. They're able to get to an expand motion for us in a faster rate, which is good for the lifetime value coming out of the customer. So we continue to see that kind of happen. There's pockets where there's holdouts certain geographies or regions around the world or maybe the access to the data center isn't as normalized or some government accounts.
But we definitely see Privilege Cloud as kind of the leading entity for us moving forward. And mainly the self-based subscription -- or sorry, on-prem subscription is generally to existing customers who are buying more seats who aren't quite ready yet to lift and shift over to the SaaS environment. And I think that trend will continue to play out and accelerate over the next couple of years. At this point, to your last kind of point of your question, we are seeing not only full parity with our Privileged Cloud offering but we're actually seeing differentiation in our Privilege Cloud offering, where the kind of integration of our Dynamic Privilege Access into the Privilege Cloud offering, the ability to be able to actually offer even better threat analytics that really starts to set the stage for, I think, that being the premium offering that we have out in the market. Your next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Udi, if you need a partner for your next fishing trip, you know who to call. I have two questions. The first one is pricing. You mentioned that there is a pricing increase in 2023. What's the impact on your revenues on your ARR? How long does it take to translate the pricing increase to revenue growth and ARR? And the second question is -- let's do it one by one. That's right. Okay. So Tal, on that, it's going to be really a small amount during 2023. Any price increase impacting ARR and revenue, especially because we have more and more being ratable. So it's not a significant piece of the raise in the guide. Got it. The second question is to Matt. And Matt, every CEO brings new spirit and new kind of changes. What is your agenda? What do you see as your main focus areas for 2023 and beyond? Yes, I appreciate the question. I think that when you look at what has worked so well for Udi and I is that we do share a similar view on the market, on the importance of culture and the importance of the teams that we've built here. And we've been so kind of intricately linked from a standpoint of coming up with the strategy that we have today. So I think what I promise to the team and to Udi really is a continuation of the great momentum that we have. We feel like we've never been in a better position in a better place. .
And we have a special opportunity here in the market and a group of special people here at the company. And so I'm kind of excited to continue the spirit, as you said, of where we've been and to bring it forward for the years ahead. And are there any areas where you're going to focus on more to try and even accelerate the growth? Or any things that you're going to focus in -- focus on especially to kind of try and bring either new revenues, new areas? Or is it going to be more of the same, basically? Yes. I mean, we believe that this kind of shift up into the Identity Security vision, the Identity Security platform and our ability to be able to go out there and help our customers across the entire identity landscape, human and nonhuman machine into access, into all the new areas we've been that the market opportunity for us remains huge. And we can go and tap into that over the next couple of years. We don't need to pivot to a new strategy. We need to go and execute or continue to execute against the current strategy to go get that opportunity. Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. Udi, let me echo my congratulations as well. It's been a pleasure for all of these years. And Matt, congrats on the new opportunity. Just wanted to maybe dig a little bit more into sort of the new Secrets Management products that you guys referenced. Just -- what's been the initial reception from customers there? How do you think about sort of the total market opportunity? And how does this maybe augment your existing Secrets Management strategy? Absolutely, Jonathan. And thank you for those warm words, and thank you for getting to know me when we were an unknown category as we were pioneering time as a private company. Yes. I still remember the days of $20 million in ARR. So it's good to see the growth. Great. So to your question, I think the two that I would highlight is that we released Conjur Cloud. So the ability to consume Secrets Management as a service, where our customer can hit the ground running and they don't have to set of infrastructure, we have our first customers on that and the reception. That optionality is really well received by customers. They can still decide to have it on-premise or they can now have Conjur as a service, which really breakthrough innovation in the market.
And the second one that I mentioned earlier, and it's very strategic process to is Secrets Hub. We're on top of our solution for, I would say, native applications And for dynamic applications, we allow organizations that decide to use the native cloud Secret Store and CyberArk as the backbone. That was announced that had impact and is very well received. The first the cloud supported is AWS, and we will follow with Azure and GCP. And again, customers are eager. And again, have started with the AWS aspect it also further strengthens our partnership with AWS.
And so those are being well accepted. And in terms of the opportunity, it's really -- we've highlighted the multibillion opportunity in Identity Security and the machine identity is a big part of that. And we have a unique angle to take after it because we are coming as the trusted security provider, but understanding the unique needs of the developer. So bridging between security and developers is a very large opportunity. Your next question is from the line of Josh Wood Tilton with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. And Udi, it has been an absolute privilege. No intended. And Matt, congrats on the appointment. Just a quick one for me. I think in the prepared remarks, you guys touched on this tailwind from cyber insurance. Is there any way you can dive one level deeper on that? And just maybe how long do you think this tailwind could last? I think it's going to -- so thanks for the question and onwards. I think it's going to last because we're seeing just the early parts of it. It's mostly in North America. We believe similar drivers will show up in Europe and in the rest of the world. The insurers are -- they found themselves like every company in the world, every organization is being attacked. It's a given -- and we've recently showed in a conference that companies are being attacked multiple times, even after they recover.
So the insurance providers had to step up and take an approach of we're going to enforce important layers that make a difference before we ensure your to lower the premium. So I think it's going to be another of those drivers that will last as long as that cyber insurance will exist and it's going to exist, it's becoming kind of table stakes at companies. And it gives an opportunity for CyberArk and companies like us, they also further partner with the insurance companies to educate their customers and make it very seamless for them to get on board.
And the fact that we now have the SaaS optionality really serves that well that they -- when they need to meet the requirement, they can join CyberArk and be up and running fast and get that insurance set up. Your next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. And congratulations, Udi, on everything you've achieved thus far in building such a terrific company. Congrats to Matt as well in an extremely well-deserved promotion. Udi, as you know, CyberArk is one of a select few software vendors that was able to execute at a very high level throughout all of 2022. Many investors wonder if you can continue to defy gravity in this environment. So it might be helpful just to hear a bit more from you on your confidence level and repeating this in 2023, even if we were to assume that the macro gets a little tougher from here? Yes. I would say that we're extremely confident. I think we've built a plan and like we mentioned, Matt and Josh and I and the executive team, we built a plan that factored the macro. Macro was in the room as we worked on the plan and really also very data-driven, analyzing our pipeline, analyzing our continued contribution from channels. And so we're very confident in the opportunity we have into this year. And for our ability to push those levers that we put in place.
I mean, a lot of the components in CyberArk are actually behaving like growth engines, also like start-ups within the company, like the way the access business is growing. So we have the growth edge, we have the PAM market become -- it's a no greater security layer, and we're taking it all over the world. And so yes, I would answer that. And Josh, do you have a numerical answer for that? No. I think you said it well in terms of how we built our expectations for the year. I would also add that in our 2023 guide, it actually even includes a $20 million headwind when we think about the kind of the last a bit of the transition as we go from kind of the high 80% mix in 2022 to well over 90% mix into 2023. And so I think when you combine all that, I think that we're confident about where we're headed. And if our business trends remain as they are, well, we have the durability of demand and pipeline to support possibly even faster growth. This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Udi Mokady for closing remarks. All right. Udi Mokady for the record, but it's all good. So I really want to thank everyone for the warm congrats that we saw throughout the call, we all really appreciate and the support of , as you saw in journey. We're just getting started. We're very excited about the year ahead. And again, we had another strong quarter, demonstrating that durable demand that we talked about and our platform selling momentum in the market positioning us very well for 2023. So thank you to our customers, first and foremost, and partners that are the cornerstone of our success. And I want to extend special appreciation to the entire CyberArk crew around the world. for the hard work and strong execution, very mission-driven team. So thank you very much.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CyberArk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].
Erica Smith, SVP, Investor Relations and ESG. You may begin your conference. Thank you, Rob. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's First Quarter 2023 Financial Results. With me on the call today are Matt Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the second quarter full year 2023 and beyond. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted on CyberArk's website. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release, as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. We also want to remind you that we provide information for additional color regarding subscription mix bookings, but it should not be viewed as comparable to or a substitute for reported GAAP revenues or other GAAP metrics. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Matt? Thanks, Erica. And thanks, everyone, for joining my first earnings call at CyberArk's CEO. Since starting my new role about six weeks ago, I have met extensively with our team and with customers and partners from around the world. The support, passion, and commitment to our mission is palpable. My meetings reinforce that we have amazing people, an impressive base of customers and partners. And we are the only vendor tackling the critical security challenge of applying privileged controls to all human and machine identities through a unified identity security platform. We are adding the mission-critical controls that stop attacks from progressing, a requirement in today's threat landscape.
Because of our unique value proposition, CyberArk is being prioritized even in today's macroeconomic backdrop, and I am pleased with how we are navigating the current environment. Subscription ARR reached $403 million and grew 84% year-over-year. Total ARR reached $604 million and grew 42% year-over-year. Total revenue growth accelerated to 27% and came in at $161.7 million for the first quarter, and our subscription bookings mix reached 95%, an all-time high, driven by demand for our SaaS solutions and our platform selling motion.
Before getting into the details of the quarter, I wanted to talk about the macro environment itself. We are pleased that our SaaS and subscription bookings outperformed the macro assumptions embedded in our Q1 guidance. We did continue to see longer cycles in Q1 and select larger deals downsized, reducing the scope of these initial engagements, but we are confident that identity security programs are moving forward because many of those customers are already back in the pipeline, and we expect expansion opportunities as we move through the year.
The strength of our subscription ARR, our ARR guidance, and our ability to maintain our full-year revenue guidance despite a material increase in subscription bookings mix speaks to the durability of demand and the prioritization of our identity security platform.
Deals are progressing through the pipeline, and we are seeing record pipeline growth across the entire portfolio with strong momentum in our Access, EPM, and Secrets business as well as for our Privilege Cloud offering.
Moving on to the quarter, we will frame the discussion, as always, around growth, innovation, and profitability. The persistent secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud migration, and attacker innovation are only accelerating. AI is a new powerful example of technology that will shape the cyber landscape.
With weaponized AI, organizations become even more vulnerable to attacks that are difficult, if not impossible to detect an assumed breach posture, including, implementing privilege controls and lease privilege is one of the best ways to protect against these emerging threats.
At our Impact customer event taking place in just under two weeks, you will not only hear about AI as an attack vector, but also how we can leverage AI to make our customers more secure. Recently conducted a survey of 1,500 cybersecurity professionals and 92% consider identity security is mission-critical, but only 9% stated that they had a comprehensive strategy in place. There is an enormous gap between the level of identity protection and the maturity of organizations. And massive opportunity for us at CyberArk.
We have architected our platform strategy to capitalize on these secular tailwinds and our go-to-market engine is built to scale CyberArk well beyond our $1 billion ARR target. Our recent innovations are gaining traction, workforce password management, secure web sessions, privileged life cycle management, compliance, flows, Conjur Cloud, and Secret Hub, all had key wins in the quarter and are contributing to customer excitement. Our land and expand motion begins with new logos, and we signed over 200 customers in the first quarter.
A few key Q1 wins include a major insurance company, we're struggling to scale and secure its cloud-first strategy with a point PAM provider. This customer wanted deeper protection and to increase security and control by layering privileged controls across every identity. Our identity security platform will be deployed globally, including secure web sessions, identity flows, identity compliance, and of course, Privilege Cloud.
For many customers, the AWS marketplace is reducing friction in our sales cycle, in the first quarter, a leading health-care provider leverage this new route to market to buy workforce password management as well as Privilege Cloud and secrets management to secure the DevOps pipeline. Regulation, compliance, and cyber insurance are broad drivers that contributed to our results, including wins in the banking, insurance, and health-care verticals.
Early in Q2, we formalized the cyber insurance referral program with a leading company and already we're receiving opportunities in the pipe. In addition to signing marquee customers, we had a strong expansion quarter for SaaS and subscriptions.
Our land and expand motion is accelerating across the identity security platform, and the most visible metric is the over 40% increase in customers with more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, which reached 1,400 customers at the end of Q1. A few examples include an existing IT software company, that purchased identity flows to automate PAM workflows in order to increase efficiency and also expanded its protection with workforce password management to provide peace of mind by not only managing but securing employee passwords.
A Fortune 100 transportation company who has been a long-time PAM customer and began protecting end-points in the second half of 2022, cited the threat of weaponized AI and our ability to protect against ransomware as key motivators and a significant Q1 expansion deal.
The channel is extending our market reach with more feet on the street and momentum is building with partner certifications in CyberArk Identity and now also in Secrets Management. While still a relatively small contributor to our overall business, MSPs across APJ, EMEA, and Americas are helping us move down market and reach customers who rely on managed services to secure and scale their environments.
On the innovation side, we were recognized by KuppingerCole as a leader in privileged access management, further validation of the strength of our solutions. Workforce password management is another example where we are setting the pace of innovation in identity security. In the first quarter, we announced that Workforce password management used in conjunction with secure web sessions create an industry-first way of accessing sensitive applications.
The platform effect is accelerating. Today, early access customers are leveraging EPM and Privilege Cloud to discover, review, and automatically onboard all local Windows and MacOS endpoint privileged accounts. This enhanced capability improves security and lowers risk of credential theft and privilege escalation at the endpoint.
Josh will cover profitability in just a few moments, but I wanted to reiterate that as we look into 2023, we will continue to invest with discipline and leverage each of our operating expense lines this year and beyond. Importantly, with our growth, we have the ability to be agile in our investment plans and make adjustments as we move through the year.
As I've done around with investors, I've been asked about what will I be changing as CEO, as we talked about in February with Udi, at the highest level, we're not changing the strategy. We have all the ingredients to execute and deliver growth and profitability. That said, there remains areas where we can improve our execution and drive the next level of performance.
One key focus area is harnessing the data that comes with the subscription transition to drive expansion opportunities, boost productivity, and deliver operational excellence. This data, combined with the same rigorous programmatic execution that allowed us to shift our entire business model in only five quarters will empower the company to take customer success to the next level, increase our sales and marketing productivity and drive more efficiency through our innovation engine as we enhance our identity security platform.
A second focus area and one that we are all laser-focused on is our role as the leader in identity security and fully realizing this tremendous opportunity. Consolidation of trust for identity is underway within our customers. Identity is more critical than ever, and organizations are increasingly moving towards trusted partners that can secure the broadest set of use across identities and environments. With this in mind, we are accelerating our platform selling motion, our new platform services, and how we leverage our robust partner ecosystem to extend our reach and drive our growth.
Securing all identities, not just managing human access is a requirement at the center of our customers' cybersecurity strategies. And with our approach based on privileged controls, we are best positioned to capture the market. We are becoming the platform of choice for customers and driving deep alignment across the organization while creating a disciplined execution machine will help ensure we extend our commanding lead in the identity security market.
In the first quarter, we made great progress executing our strategy, and we delivered strong results as we navigated a challenging macro environment. We are executing and on pace to accelerate growth, improve profitability and generate strong cash flow for the year.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter, the increase in our full-year ARR guidance, and what is essentially a guidance raise for the full 2023 when you look through the subscription bookings mix headwind. Josh? Thanks, Matt. In the first quarter, we delivered exceptional ARR growth once again. Annual recurring revenue grew 42%, reaching $604 million at March 31, and the subscription portion reached $403 million. That's increasing 84%, representing 67% of our total ARR. We also added $39 million of net new subscription ARR from Q4 2022, which is higher than the sequential increase of the $36 million in the first quarter of last year.
Demand for our SaaS offerings drove our subscription bookings mix up to an all-time high of 95% of total bookings, above our guidance framework of 93%. The 95% compares to only 86% in the first quarter of last year. The maintenance portion of ARR was $202 million at March 31. The decline in maintenance was due to lower perpetual license sales over the last two years as a result of our subscription transition. Like-for-like conversion activity still only represented a single-digit percent of our year-on-year ARR growth.
Total revenue was $161.7 million with growth accelerating to 27% year-on-year. While our record subscription bookings mix resulted in strong ARR growth, it also lowered our total recognized revenue in the first quarter. Normalizing for the higher mix than we assumed in our guidance framework, our recognized revenue would have been at the high end of our guidance range.
Like every company, we are also navigating the current macroeconomic environment. As Matt mentioned, longer approved sales cycles persisted towards the end of the quarter, select large deals were downsized as customers bought for their immediate needs versus longer-term planning, which would have contributed to more upside in our performance. For [indiscernible] subscription deals, duration again came in at the lower bound of our range, putting pressure on long-term deferred and recognized revenue. While we signed 200 new logos in the quarter, it was a more challenging environment for new customer acquisition, primarily in our corporate or mid-market segment.
Looking across the metrics, our strong ARR and record pipeline growth illustrate that we are navigating the current macro environment, customers are moving forward with their identity security programs, and that we remain a priority.
Moving into the details of the revenue lines for the first quarter. Subscription revenue reached $92.7 million, growing 78% year-on-year and representing 57% of total revenue in the first quarter. Consistent with our move to our subscription business model, perpetual license revenue did decline coming in at $3.9 million. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $65.1 million with $53.2 million from recurring maintenance and $11.9 million in services revenue.
The recurring revenue portion reached $145.9 million, now hitting 90% of total revenue. That's growing 37% year-on-year from $106.9 million in the first quarter last year. Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. Americas revenue reached $98.4 million, growing 31% year-on-year, APJ grew by 28% to $16.8 million, and EMEA grew by 18% year-on-year to $46.5 million in revenue.
The EMEA region continued to experience some FX headwinds and had a nearly 10 percentage point increase in subscription bookings mix to 93%, and in the first quarter. That's compared to 84% in the first quarter last year, creating a meaningful recognized revenue headwind in the quarter.
All line items of the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our first quarter gross profit was $131.5 million or an 81% gross margin. That's compared with 82% gross margin in the first quarter last year as a result of lower perpetual revenue and higher SaaS business.
Our operating expenses increased by 24% to $144.1 million, and that resulted in an operating loss of $12.6 million. Net loss was $6.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share, while overall profitability continues to be significantly impacted by the mix shift to recurring revenue. Our margin profile has begun to improve as we have planned.
We ended March with over 2,860 employees worldwide, including nearly 1,230 in sales and marketing. For the first three months of 2023, free cash flow was $4 million or a 3% free cash flow margin.
Turning to our guidance. Our guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2023 balances our strong competitive position, the increased headwind created from our higher-than-expected subscription bookings mix, and the durable demand for our platform against the uncertainty in the macro environment.
For the second quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue of $170 million to $175 million, which represents 21% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect the subscription mix to be in the mid-90% range and our perpetual license revenue to be similar to the levels we saw in the first quarter. The mix we are assuming for the second quarter is higher than our initial guidance in February, increasing the headwind to reported revenue.
We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of about -- of $10.5 million to $6.5 million for the second quarter, and we expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from a net loss of $0.19 to net loss of $0.09 per basic and diluted shares. Our guidance also assumes 41.7 million weighted average basic and diluted shares and about $5.1 million in taxes.
For the full year 2023, given the increase in our subscription bookings mix in the first quarter and our expectation that it will remain at this level for the rest of the year, we are still maintaining our guidance for total revenue in the range of $724 million to $736 million. The subscription bookings mix assumption for the full-year is now about 95%. That's compared to prior expectation in the low 90% range.
Maintaining our revenue guidance for the year at a higher mix is essentially a meaningful raise of our full year revenue guidance given the more ratable revenue of our SaaS and subscription bookings. We are maintaining our full year operating results to be in the range of an operating loss of $5 million, and operating income of $5 million and we are improving our EPS range to a net income per share of $0.16 to $0.38 because of increased interest income for the first quarter. We expect about 46.3 million weighted average diluted shares and about $21.5 million in taxes for the full year of 2023.
On the back of our strong ARR growth and subscription bookings increased in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for annual recurring revenue to be between $735 million and $745 million at December 31, 2023, or about a 30% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range.
Our free cash flow came in at 3% free cash flow margin. As a result of our performance in the first quarter, we are revising the guardrails for free cash flow margin for the full year 2023 upward to the range of non-GAAP net income margin to 5%, above our non-GAAP net income margin. We expect there to be fluctuations between the quarters and in -- for example, in the second quarter, we have cash expenses from our impact customer event and other seasonal expenses that will affect our free cash flow.
Overall, we were pleased with our execution, particularly in this macro environment. The strength of our demand and prioritization of our identity security platform are evidenced by accelerating revenue growth, strong net subscription ARR, overall ARR growth, and record pipeline build with 90% of our revenue now recurring, we have a more resilient business model that is beginning to deliver strong growth, operating leverage and improving cash flows.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, congrats on your first six weeks as CEO. Thanks, Saket. Good to hear from you. Yes. Matt, maybe we'll start there since the last couple of months have been interesting to say the least for security. I know you spend a lot of time with customers. So maybe the question is, can we just talk about how the March quarter progressed in terms of linearity and conversations? It's just been such mixed results from other March quarter security companies. Curious what you saw just in terms of progression? And maybe if you can comment on just anything that you're seeing more recently? Yes, sure. I mean I think as we talked about, we're really pleased with the results on the quarter when we look back into the quarter and try to analyze what's occurring, we continue to see this phenomenon where when we show up and we're having these conversations with customers, we are at the top of the list of conversations they want to have.
There's a prioritization process, obviously, across the entire tech stack but even within cybersecurity and when we are a mission-critical solution for these organizations. And so, while macros are on the mind of everybody, when we're having conversations with the customers, they understand the importance of their investments in these areas. They understand that actually, this is something they need to be implementing and implementing fast in order to secure in this threat landscape. And overall, we just feel this level of partnership and awareness within our customer base.
As we mentioned in the prepared remarks here, we do see approval cycles take a little bit longer. One of the thing I tell the sales team all the time is, since we're selling something that's needed, let's make sure that we're going out and actually addressing people who might pop up in the approval cycle.
Even some of our sponsors are -- are not always aware of who's going to show up. So, we talk to the teams about actually engage with them early, talk about who else might come in. And let's go pre-brief them in that conversation. Make sure they're aware. So that when it gets to their approval level, they're able to actually sign off on it. And we see that type of behavior and execution help us throughout the length of the quarter.
We also talked for a second there about this kind of downsizing of deals, and I just want to hit that head-on. What that kind of looks like is more of a -- maybe there's a 400-seat expansion deal for PAM. And when the customer gets there, they realize that there's 300 seats that they can buy right now, they need right now because identities are proliferating.
And maybe there's 100 seats that they need in the summer. And so, they'll buy the 300 now, and then they'll push off the 100 to later in the summer. Now we never want to see deals go a little smaller and definitely limit a little bit of our upside. But what that actually opens up for us and as a selling team, it's actually an exciting fact is a compelling event in the summer to readdress the customer not only now for those 100 seats, but for any other needs that they have and as a sales team, you're always looking for those moments to kind of open up so that you can go back in.
So, across the board, that's kind of my sense of what's going on. It's a nice place to be being the type of security company we are, even in this tough macro environment. Yes, absolutely, Matt, and it shows. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. A lot of focus on the financial services vertical in security this quarter. Can we just talk about how that vertical specifically performed? And Josh, if you could maybe go one level deeper into that exposure because, of course, not all financial institutions are created equal. Can you just maybe talk about how much of that mix is regional banks versus other types of financial institutions? Yes. Thanks, Saket. Actually, I'll start off by saying our financial vertical was up year-on-year. So -- and overall, what I would also say is that we actually closed deals in kind of the regional bank level, even in the end of the quarter. So, I think from our perspective, financials is an important vertical for us from the small to the large enterprise.
Clearly, the majority of our business is going to be coming from mid- to large enterprises from the banks. They have a much larger footprint and a much larger footprint and are going broader across our entire portfolio. So, when we look at our pipeline, it's going to be coming from the larger size of the financial enterprises.
And I think the other thing that I would say is that as we look into our pipe going forward, we're not seeing any degradation of the financial service -- financial customer pipeline. And I think out in the field, we're not seeing any tapering off of engagement with large financials and with the regional financials as well. And your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd from UBS Securities. Your line is open. Thank you. Maybe a higher-level question for Matt. Matt, I'd be curious, I mean, you have tons of opportunities in Access and EPM and Secrets Management. But where do you think we are in kind of the PAM adoption curve? And any view on what you're seeing in terms of greenfield, brownfield, shift to SaaS in this kind of environment would be helpful as well? Thanks. Yes. I think sometimes we get so excited about the newer areas that we forget to talk about the opportunity in PAM. I think that when we are continually excited about is both the new opportunities, the new prospects out there, not even just in the low end of the market, but even in the kind of sweet spot of the enterprise space.
We see the kind of movement towards more mature PAM programs and all that brings. And then within our base, we actually feel that we're underpenetrated. And the reason for that is that when we started out, there was only a certain type of user that needed a privileged account. And so, if you were that type of user within the core IT department, we were going to sell you a license.
And now as we start to see this notion of any user can become privileged at any time, the business user actually needs Privileged Access Management, a lot of functions outside of core IT need it, as well as the developer and the development community, the DevOps group. You start to understand a little bit more about how much more room there is to run within our customer base themselves.
And so when you combine both the room to run in the customer base, as we broaden the circle of users that we can bring under the PAM umbrella, and we look out and see both midsized enterprise all the way down to mid-market, really starting to adopt new and modern PAM approaches, it really speaks to the market opportunity that's ahead of us and our ability as the leader in PAM to go out and capitalize on it. Great. Thanks. And Josh, just a quick one on the guide. You raised the full-year ARR guide, but I think the deceleration looks a little steeper than we were modeling from the 42% growth in 1Q. Can you just walk us through your assumptions in the macro environment there? And any change that you might be seeing as a little more conservative versus a quarter ago? Thanks. Yes, sure, Roger. We're still keeping consistent on our -- on the trends around close rates in light of the macro with new logos, probably potentially being harder and longer approval cycles that Matt was referring to before, and so we're still persisting with that within our guide. But at the same time, we're seeing record pipeline being generated and so that's what gave us the confidence. That's what gives us the confidence to be able to raise the guide effectively, not just on the ARR that you pointed out, but by keeping the revenue guide at the same level despite really increasing the mix of SaaS subscription by a couple of percentage points. And your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is open. Thanks, for taking my question. Maybe for you, Matt. I know you talked a little bit about this in the script, but would love to hear anything more about the platform motion, how that's progressing, and we'll hear more about that at the customer event in a couple weeks. And then I have a follow-up. Sure, Adam, and thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So, I do get excited about this platform selling motion because I think it represents kind of the maturity or the nature of the market now that we're selling into. We talk a lot about this idea that there is multiple types of identities that need to be secured and multiple types of environments that they're going after that need to be protected.
And so when you start to think about this idea again of human and machine identities and you think about core PAM users and as well as business users or the general workforce, and then you move over into the endpoint and least privilege at the end-point and the complexity of protecting all of those identities as they go after not just now on premium infrastructure, but hybrid and cloud infrastructure, customers are waking up to the fact that you can't plug in multiple point solutions to be able to solve all those problems. They actually want an integrated approach that they can count on to make sure that all identities are secured.
And so, our entire approach with the platform is meeting that market need, talking to the customers in that context to make sure that actually, we can actually do things that those point solutions even when netted together, can't do because it's one integrated motion. So, as you know, we've been focused on ramping up the sales team and making sure that they can position that.
Our marketing team is out there messaging that. And I just get really excited by the opportunity of ours to be able to go do that. You heard us use this phrase in the prepared remarks around consolidation of trust. And what we mean by that is that the customer themselves are looking to consolidate their vendors down to partners that they can trust and we feel like we're well positioned in that environment, well positioned within this identity space to take advantage of that market trend. Super helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. You did talk about adding over 200 new logos in the quarter, a little bit down year-on-year. You talked about the tough macro and record pipeline. So, as I think about 2023, are we really looking at this as more of an upsell year? And if so, are we reorienting any go-to-market efforts back to the base? Thanks. Yes, sure. No problem. So, when we think about new logos, I want to just paint a couple of different things here. One is, obviously, there is the new logo’s absolute number. And for sure, we saw some pressure there, particularly, by the way, down market in our mid-market space, where deals started to slip out a little bit around new logo acquisition.
But there's some other trends within our customer business, a new logo business that I think are important to understand. One is the actual deal size of the logos that we are closing is getting bigger, not smaller. The ability to be able to sell multiple products to those new logos beyond PAM, it continues to trend in the right direction. And overall, the contribution, the net ARR contribution from new logos actually was really strong in the quarter.
So, although the absolute number of new logos, and we always want to be planting as many seats as possible for the future, although that occurred in the quarter, we actually are pretty happy with the contribution from the new business. And so, we don't actually see a need to shift our overall go-to-market approach.
We can go focus on building and planting pipeline for new logos, even if it closes a little bit slower, it will come to us eventually. At the same time, as we can upsell and cross-sell with -- upsell and cross-sell within the base.
The final thing I'll just say is within our new logo business within our customer business, our win rates continue to be really strong. So, although, again, the overall number at 200, maybe a little bit less than we would have liked. Overall, we're actually really happy with the new customer business that we're seeing. Helpful. Thanks, again. And your next question comes from the line of Angie Song from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Congratulations, Matt, on your first few weeks as CEO. I'm speaking on behalf of Hamza Fodderwala here at Morgan Stanley. So, I guess, Matt, just a question for you. It's been a couple of months since the transition of CEO has been announced. So, could you just talk to us about your top three priorities for the company as CyberArk scaled beyond that $1 billion in ARR by around like fiscal year '25? Yes, sure. No. I always love to talk about that. And I think it's been a really fun last six weeks or so. I've had the opportunity to kind of travel around the world and go see employees in different locations. I was able to spend my first day as CEO over in our Israel headquarters and meet with our amazing R&D organization and talent there.
And around each one of those conversations when I meet with the customers, as I visit, it comes back to the same things and that's what sets our priority. Increasingly, again, as I was just talking about, they're looking for a platform provider. They're looking for someone that can secure not just privileged users traditional PAM, but that it can actually secure the workforce, to cure the human -- the nonhuman identities. Even more and more secure their cloud environments, and so the first priority for sure is our expansion, continued expansion to own our leadership position in identity security. And that really is the anchor point for everything else that we go and look at.
We have a second focus, and it's core to us, which is to get our go-to-market engine ramped up, fully ramped from a productivity perspective, from a contribution of marketing from a modern way of doing the sales process so that we can take advantage of that market. And that becomes a continuation of something that obviously I was working on for several years, but our ability to be able to go do that.
And then the third thing, and it's important for us because it's fundamental to our DNA is to make sure that we're scaling efficiently through these next couple of years. We want to make sure that we're delivering the right level of profit back into the investor community to our shareholders.
And the best way to do that is to exit the subscription transition fully, which obviously we're ramping our way through, and get the leverage back into the business so that we're not just growing the top line, but we're able to deliver a strong cash flow number into the shareholder base. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Just one for me. I want to touch a little bit around the partner ecosystem, the indirect contribution you guys see overall, and maybe some of the green shoots and opportunities. I know you mentioned AWS Marketplace, but -- just are you seeing channel Swift expansion through some of these CSPs? Thanks. Yes, sure. No, Rob. Thanks. Great. Great question. And I think one of our differentiators in the market is our partner ecosystem. We've always had a strong indirect component to our business. We run generally speaking, in the upper 70s, sometimes even touching below 80% of business that's run through our partner ecosystem. And as you kind of mentioned, we've seen an increasing kind of shift in how those partners are going to market.
One, they're following suit with us. They're leading with SaaS. They're able to actually get outside of PAM and actually embracing Access and Secrets Management. So, they're bringing the full CyberArk story to market. But we also see newer types of partners emerge. And we did mention the AWS marketplace, which is a great way to kind of lubricate the sales process and actually partake of one might call found money in this macroeconomic environment because they already have purchased those AWS credits that they can use.
But we also see, as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, the emergence of the MSP or MSSP program. And I think that actually is taking on two flavors. One, it allows us to go down market more effectively. But we see even in the enterprise space that more and more IT organizations and security organizations really do not want to be in the business of managing their solution stack.
And so, they're looking to even bigger SIs, telcos to actually one-off managed service their security environment, and we have great partnerships, as many of you know, with the biggest SIs. We've built up the telco program, and we have the MSPs. So as that market starts to mature and accelerate, we can take advantage of it.
Now it's a minimal part of the overall business at the moment, but it's one of the areas that we're exceptionally excited about as we move forward. And your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is open. I have two questions. One is, we hosted Microsoft on Friday, and we see them in more and more and more markets in cybersecurity, extremely successful business. And I'm wondering how do you see Microsoft, if at all, in the market? And how is competition against them?
And the second question is for Josh. Great success on revenues, great sustainability, and stability, but margins are still negative. What's the outlook for margins? Great. I'll take the first one, Josh. So, Microsoft, as you said, is a formidable software organization, and they've built up a strong cybersecurity core within their overall approach. They've been, frankly, in a kind of competition motion with us for a very long time. They're a good partner in a lot of ways. And sometimes we see them show up within our customer base.
What we've seen though is that the minute the conversation kind of turns to core security, like real security, for example, PAM, there really isn't a choice that comes up between Microsoft versus CyberArk. The CISOs, understand that they do PAM right, to do core security right, they actually need the type of depth of solution that only CyberArk can provide.
I think we also see them kind of emerge in other areas of the business that we took the fight to them, if you will, when we entered into Access. And for basic MFA and single sign-on, I think they are a very credible force out there. And as you've heard us talk about before, when we're competing in the Access market versus Microsoft or Okta for that matter, our differentiation, again, is the applicability of privileged controls or deeper security even the commoditized MFA or SSO market.
And what that means is we bring solutions like secure web sessions or workforce password management that become the security bodyguards that can sit against a single sign or MFA solution, where there's comparability between their solution and ours.
You even saw them lately enter in and kind of validate the EPM or the endpoint privilege management market. Actually, to be honest, that's kind of thrilling for me because the biggest problem we have on EPM is not customers once they understand it, wanting to buy our solution. It's getting customers to be aware to begin with if they need the solution.
And Microsoft entering into a market like that is actually wonderful news for publicity. When we get into a deep conversation about features and functions and capabilities, I think our solutions come out on top. And so that's my view on the Microsoft landscape. Again, I'm very respectful of them. And I think they kind of help the market overall, but we feel pretty confident when we're head to head against them. And Tal, to your second question, so -- we're pleased that we're following our playbook, right, through the transition and which kind of drove the shift in our margins negative through last year. We're excited that this year, we're already now that we're post transition, getting our first year back for improvement to breakeven for our guidance.
And then we anticipate to continue to expand that gross margin next year '24 and further into '25. So -- we're on the right track for continuing following our playbook, post-transition, getting the benefit of the accelerated revenue on the top line. And then as Matt pointed out earlier in one of the earlier answers, we are totally focused on making sure that we think about scaling efficiently and that's going to drive those expansions of the margins already this year that you're seeing in the guide and then next year and going forward. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Heath from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Congrats on a strong quarter here. Our conversation on the margins. A couple of things. I mean it's great to see the maintenance of the margins just given the increased mix shift to the ratable side of the business. But Curious, one, just bigger picture, is there any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year? Just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one.
And a follow-up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin. So just curious the change has there given some of the -- what seems like duration pressure that hidden billings a little bit? Sure, Eric. I'll take the first part here, and as it relates to the hiring plan. And I think we continue to calibrate our investment versus the opportunity. And we talked about it at the last earnings call, which is this year, we would see a little bit less overall headcount percentage increase versus what maybe we saw in 2022, and that was because we were taking into account both the macro backdrop and also our need to drive leverage back into the business.
And I think we continue to see that play out. We added roughly 95% license in Q1, and we will look towards the rest of the year and continue to make strategic investments in go-to-market where we feel like there is opportunity to go capture. And then throughout the rest of the company to round out our ability to be able to, for example, deliver on the identity security platform vision, drive and support the scaling of the overall operations.
So, I think we're measured in our headcount. Our headcount hiring were consistent with what we were talking about. And our belief is, going forward, this is a lever that we can pull in any direction that we need to. So, we're very agile in our approach, and we'll make the decisions really quarter-by-quarter, should we accelerate more? Should we cut back a little less? And that's the beauty of the model that we're operating under. Yes, Eric. And with regard to the cash flow, first of all, we're pleased that we're able to come in already now in the second quarter and start to -- and start to go up on our cash flow margin guidance to, as you pointed out, net income margin to net income plus -- net income margin plus 5% on a non-GAAP basis. And I really think it's -- we have more visibility than we did three months ago, and Q1 tracked well.
And I think it's a reflection of one where Q1 ended up. But also, as we look at the guide and we look at our pipeline going forward, and our success with renewals and our expectations there, we feel comfortable that we'll be even in a better place on cash flow than we said three months ago. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I guess maybe for Matt, what might be helpful is in the onset of the pandemic, we saw a pretty meaningful pause in spend, and we saw a downsizing deal facing shorter contract durations. Could you maybe compare and contrast what you're seeing now versus what you're seeing then or you call right after that, we had like SolarWinds and [indiscernible] and everyone kind of like trued up realize the value of PAM and kind of trued up the deals and you saw a reacceleration. But how does the -- I guess, recognition of the critical nature of PAM and the process of approval and coverage inside your customer base, how do things differ now compared to when we saw that pause a few years ago? Yes. As we look back on the Q1 and out towards the year ahead, we just -- we don't see that pause in business. We see our ability to be able to generate a record pipeline. We see our ability to be able to go out and be at the top of the list of priority at our customers. We see the conversations continuing to progress as we've been talking about.
And I do think I pull it back to where you hit, which is we are in a different place in terms of our portfolio, our solutions and the maturity of the market, and an understanding of the critical nature of the solutions that we sell. The recognition of what it really means to secure identities and the importance of identity in the attack vector is in protecting against the attack vector it's just tremendously better. It's a good position to be in.
And I think we show up now with a broad base of solutions and a platform to sell. And it lends itself to better customer conversations and a better market backdrop despite obviously, macros being on everybody's mind. Right. That makes sense. And maybe we could just circle back to one of the comments made on his expansion. Any impact this quarter or recently from headcount reductions in your customer base and how they might be thinking about rationalizing their labor footprint and how that might impact your business? No. We're lucky from that perspective, as I said, that the notion of privileged accounts and privilege identities proliferate regardless. And so, when you look at customers that may or may not be in difficult economic situations in certain verticals or industries, I don't think there's a correlation between their decision on headcount and what they need to buy from CyberArk. So that's not one of the things that we worry too much about. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you. So, in the past, the company has emphasized the sales motion for adaptive or access is largely installed base adoption. So, the question I have is, given your large enterprise installed base, I would think that some portion, if not a large portion of those organizations have an existing IAM solution.
So how do you see that? How much of that might be green field? And then also, if you could also just touch on the go-to-market strategy given the two large and successful incumbents within that market already? Yes, sure. So, I think as we talk about the Access business for us continues to accelerate in a nice way and become a more meaningful piece of our overall business. And I think that when you look within the customer base, it is somewhat surprising to people how many customers are either completely on legacy solutions or more often than not, actually have multiple solutions throughout different divisions, through acquisition, through other kinds of vendor sprawl that's happened within their organizations on the access side.
And so, we do feel like there is this rich opportunity within our customer base to rip and replace legacy solutions. Obviously competing against those two significant competitors in that space, but not having to replace those competitors in that space in order to be able to win. From time to time, we're in a conversation about a replacement for sure. But it really is the opportunity here to go in and rip and replace those solutions.
I also want to emphasize the notion and will connect to your point of how we differentiate or compete, that our solutions in that portfolio, for example, secure web sessions can sit on top of any [indiscernible] and so even if there is an embedded Microsoft account, we can go in and still talk to them about our overall identity security story, and we can talk to them about how they can still take advantage of a more secure way of doing single sign-on and connect it back to privilege controls and back to the overall identity security platform.
And so that becomes our special sauce when we're differentiating. It's not my SSO is better than your SSO. It's my identity security platform with strong SSO and MFA that can keep you more secure than their SSO, and MFA. And again, that's becoming more and more of our talk track. Our team is becoming more and more comfortable with that talk track and that will be what drives the growth going forward as we continue to increase our position in that space. Again, as you said, two very formidable competitors directly in the Access space. Your next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Your line is open. This is Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the first quarter, Matt. So, one for you and one quick follow-up for Josh. Matt, you mentioned about AI that's sharing the cyber landscape and weaponized AI in particular, organizations becoming more vulnerable to attacks that are difficult to detect. You gave an example of a customer; the Fortune 100 transportation company cited the threat and was a key motivator in the expansion deal. Can you talk a little bit more about AI as a driver this past quarter? And in terms of the pipeline, what do you see in terms of the opportunity ahead? And then one quick follow-up for Josh. Yes. I think in any market, there are things that help to educate the market sometimes through fear that gets the market more ready and understanding of new solutions that they need. And I think AI, because it's captivated so much attention, helps with that from a market perspective. For sure, we and we're going to talk about it at our impact event which hopefully many of you will join. We're going to talk about this idea of what does a weaponized AI look like and what is the attack path and what can you do about it?
But the reason why we're emphasizing it is not because right now, the notion of weaponized AI is the single most important attack path for organizations. But what it does is it wakes organizations up to the notion that detecting threats is not enough. We actually need to control the threat. And the only way to be able to do that in some cases is by controlling or securing identities.
And so, I'll give an example here, which is at the endpoint, and this is what the customer that you're referring to was talking about. At the endpoint, you would be silly to not have an EDR in solved. Let's be clear. We believe in it, if our own IT department was installing a new environment, they're going to put an EDR of some sort on the location.
But if you can get around that EDR or more significantly, if you can turn off that EDR because there's local privilege controls and local admin controls sitting at that end-point, then that EDR is relatively useless. And AI is a way that you can weaponize that approach and figure out your attack path to be able to get in, get credentials, and actually turn off the EDR itself so that no longer can detect.
Our EPM solution, removes the ability to be able to make changes on the local endpoint, on the local desktop, and on the local server. And by doing that, you're actually ensuring your investment in your EDR system because you're now going to make sure that it's there, it's available to do what it does really well, which is to detect and respond.
And so, the AI concept is more of a concept at this point in time, although we'll talk through some more details but what it does is, it wakes organizations up it shakes them and says, assume breach, assume that they're going to get in. Now what do you do to control? And that's where CyberArk comes in because we're all about security and control. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. So, I just wanted to trying to go back to gross margin, it was slightly better than expected. Do you think an increase in discounting might have prevented some of the downsizing of deals? And is that a tool you would consider using to get some of these deals over the finish line throughout the course of the summer? Andrew, I don't think that, that I think you're referring kind of to our pricing in -- with regard to the gross margin? Yes. I mean I just -- yes, I mean if the deals were downsized. I'm just wondering if you could offered any better, more aggressive pricing on it to help get the full deal size? I'll let Matt take that in a second. I think, from our perspective, gross margin, we would not have seen that as necessarily the tactic. I'll let Matt talk on the pricing. Yes. Listen, I think that we're operating in a tough macro environment, and we're always price conscious across the board, and we're understanding with our customers when the budget is a core concern, and we're working with those customers to make sure that we can fit within their budget, while we're getting as a partner or as a vendor, our value. We continue to see good pricing even in this environment. By the way, we see good pricing on our renewals within this environment.
And ultimately, we don't want to force or give away seats. If we feel confident that those seats are still going to come our way just a month or two months or five months later, certainly, for certain customers, you're trying to get them to buy in, and you're trying to get them to take their first bite.
And when that happens, you're aggressive or you work with them on price. But overall, I'm pretty confident in how we approach the market from a pricing perspective. We're flexible when we need to be. But at the end of the day, we're actually creating a business for the long run, and we want to make sure that we're delivering value and then we're receiving the right level of value back in the deals that we sell. And we have reached the end of our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Matt Cohen, for some final closing remarks. Thanks. So, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment and our customers and partners for their continued support. As I said, it's been a wonderful six weeks so far. We're looking forward to seeing many of you, hopefully, all of you over a week from now at our customer impact event, where we're going to be able to talk about the latest and greatest of our identity security platform and update everybody on the latest and greatest of the company.
So, until then, thanks for the call today. Take care. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","a webcast of today's earnings call is also available on our website in the IR section .

A webcast of this call is available on our website in the Investor Relations section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Matt? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone for joining the call today. Momentum continues to build across our business. Our strong second quarter performance underscores the three key reasons we are winning. First, the power of our Identity Security platform to drive our land and expand motion. Our comprehensive portfolio and the depth of our SaaS solutions are continuing to increase the velocity in our business.
Second, Identity Security is a non-negotiable requirement for organizations. This is only amplified by the ever increasing importance of protecting hybrid and cloud native environments. And third, we are executing against our strategic imperatives: accelerating our platform selling motion, extending our reach through the channel, enhancing our customer success organization and delivering cutting edge innovation. The strength of our execution and the durability of demand is evident in our performance.
Subscription ARR reached $451 million growing 77% year-over-year. Total ARR reached $653 million growing 40%. We added a robust $49 million in net new ARR. And we exceeded our guidance range across revenue, operating loss and EPS with total revenue growing 24% to $176 million, non-GAAP operating loss coming in at $6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03, all above the range.
I’m incredibly proud of how we are navigating the macroeconomic backdrop. Our go-to-market teams continue to adjust their selling approach to overcome the increased deal scrutiny and longer approval cycles that we have seen for several quarters, enabling us to deliver a really well executed performance. We had a strong new business quarter and customers continue to broaden their CyberArk relationships, buying new users and expanding to new solutions across the platform.
Our pipeline continues to build at a record pace. Deals are progressing and our win rates are really strong. We hosted our Impact customer event in May. It was great to see so many of you, who attended in person and we appreciate those who tuned into the virtual sessions. Impact in Boston is our marquee event, but we are also hosting our Impact world tour across 20 cities across the world throughout the summer and fall.
Over the last few months, we have touched thousands of customers, prospects and partners as part of this program. The feedback is resoundingly positive. We are helping customers mitigate risk and drive efficiency, as they manage the explosion of new identities, new environments and new attack methods.
Moving on to the details of the quarter. We will frame the discussion around growth, innovation and profitability. Starting with our growth drivers. A typical organization has thousands of unique identities and those identities have more access today than ever before. In our recently released Identity Security Threat Landscape Report, every organization we surveyed expects an identity related compromise in the year ahead and more than half say this will happen as part of a digital transformation initiative.
Generative AI is compounding these trends. Attackers are innovating faster than ever and are more sophisticated, further elevating the urgency for comprehensive identity security. As a result, organizations are consolidating across security vendors based on trust, what we refer to as a consolidation of trust. They are choosing long-term partners like CyberArk because of deep domain expertise, leadership position, breadth of platform and superior technology.
Our differentiation includes our ability to secure all identities, human and machine, as they access all environments, including hybrid and multi-cloud environments while applying our comprehensive intelligent privileged controls across standing access, just-in-time access and our zero standing privilege approach. Our most recent product introduction, Secure Cloud Access, which provides secure native access with zero standing privileges across multi-cloud environments is resonating with customers.
When combined with just-in-time access for cloud workloads, it creates the ability for a customer for -- it creates the ability for customers to reimagine their PAM programs. In addition, when Secure Cloud Access is combined with Secrets Hub and Conjur Cloud, developers and the security teams can innovate even faster in the cloud. For the workforce, we take this one step further, providing privileged controls to the enterprise with secure web sessions and workforce password management.
These are great examples of how our platform is delivering compelling value to customers and driving our long-term growth. Our innovation engine and go-to-market execution contributed to our strong new business quarter and 235 new logos. While PAM continues to be the primary landing spot, our platform has been key to our success with customers increasingly landing with two or more solutions.
Digging into a few wins in the quarter, driven by cyber insurance requirements, an industry leading Fortune 500 transportation company wanted a solution that would evolve and scale with the company's cloud strategy. In addition to Privilege Cloud, the customer will centrally secure human and non-human privilege access across its global multi-cloud infrastructure with Secure Cloud Access and Secrets Hub.
As part of its zero trust strategy, a leading cybersecurity company landed with our Endpoint Privilege Manager to remove local admin rights from all endpoints and help mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks. A leading telecommunication provider in South America is embracing our Identity Security platform to achieve operational efficiencies and measurable risk reduction. This customer is consolidating vendors and will be using the CyberArk platform, including PAM, Endpoint Privilege Manager, and Secrets Manager across all seven of its companies.
The velocity of our business is also picking up as customers achieve faster time to value with our SaaS solutions. The success of our land and expand motion is represented by the nearly 40% increase in customers with more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to approximately 1,500 at the end of Q2. A few examples include: a Global 500 energy company embraced our Identity Security vision and expanded from a large PAM footprint to DevOps and cloud security in Q2, with Conjur Cloud, Secrets Hub and Secure Cloud Access.
An auto manufacturing company who bought CyberArk PAM in the third quarter of 2022 was looking to expand with a modern identity security partner. During the second quarter, they bought more Privilege Cloud and added workforce password manager as its first CyberArk identity solution. Accenture is one of our most successful advisory partners with a strong CyberArk Identity Security practice. Given their deep understanding of the security market, we are pleased they will expand their use of CyberArk Privilege Cloud to deliver advanced cybersecurity controls for clients and also utilize it themselves. We look forward to continuing to extend our relationship with Accenture.
The channel is extending our market reach with more feet on the street and more services power. Certifications for Endpoint Privilege Manager, CyberArk Identity and Secrets Management are growing quickly. MSPs remain a key pillar for the future growth and we are gaining traction with GuidePoint, Kendra (ph), NTT, among others, who delivered key wins in Q2 and are helping us reach new customer segments. In fact, BT, a leading British multi-national telecommunications company, needed a modern, scalable security partner as it rapidly scales its global managed services operations to help ensure their customers' critical identities are protected. During the second quarter, they made the strategic decision to leverage CyberArk Identity as their key access solution.
Moving on to innovation. At our Impact customer event in May, we were excited to share how we are at the leading edge of innovation in Identity Security, including the introduction of AI-powered automation and policy creation for EPM, to help reduce risk and implement lease privilege at the endpoint. CyberArk has a long track record of working to stay ahead of both the competition and attackers.
Today, the attackers are leveraging AI to exponentially increase their effectiveness. And capacity to change tactics and techniques and procedures continues to increase. While attack methods are evolving rapidly, the common denominator in these attacks remains identities. We are harnessing generative AI to develop new security solutions and enhancements for our customers, innovation to combat innovation.
We have a team dedicated to integrating AI across our product portfolio as well as new innovations, and we are looking forward to sharing information about our initiatives later in the year. At Impact, we also launched Secrets Hub for Azure and PAM self-hosted. Since launching last year, security professionals love the security controls, while developers can continue their workflow, but with frictionless protection, making CyberArk the Secrets backbone of the enterprise.
CyberArk Secure Browser was one of the highlights of the event. Secure Browser is purpose built for the enterprise and deliver security, privacy and productivity. It can act as a front end to CyberArk's Identity Security platform, while also securing the overall browsing experience for privileged users. One of the areas that our customers are most intrigued by, is the ability to stop session hijacking, an increasingly dangerous form of attack, where hackers are looking to steal cookies and takeover sessions to harvest critical data and IP.
Moving on to profitability. As the dynamics of the subscription transition begin to subside, we are marching towards our Rule of 40 goal, as you see in our full year bottom line raise. Our Identity Security platform will not only help increase our go-to-market productivity, but also drive operating leverage by supporting rapid cost effective innovation across all of our product groups. We have always made disciplined investments to support our growth, and I remain very confident in the long-term profit goals we put out at our Investor Day just a few months ago.
In summary, our go-to-market organization and innovation engine are delivering. We are accelerating our platform selling motion, our new platform services and how we leverage our robust partner relationships to extend our reach and drive our growth. We are thrilled with the early adoption of our cloud security solutions and the momentum we are seeing in the market. Securing all identities, not just managing human access is a requirement at the center of our customers' cybersecurity strategies.
As we look ahead, the momentum in our business, strong execution in the first half and disciplined investment approach positioned us to confidently raise our full year guidance for ARR and improve our operating profitability.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our outperformance in more detail and provide you with our guidance for the third quarter of the year. Thanks, Matt. We delivered yet another strong quarter, beating our guidance across the board. ARR grew an exceptional 40% and reached $653 million at June 30, while the subscription portion increased 77% and reached $451 million. Momentum continues to pick up.
And in the second quarter, we had $49 million in net new subscription ARR. This represents the largest amount of net new subscription ARR outside the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2022. As Matt mentioned already, our Identity Security strategy is resonating with customers, embracing our SaaS solutions and expanding across our platform. The maintenance portion of annual recurring revenue was $201 million at June 30.
In the second quarter, we were thrilled, particularly in today's macro environment to capture an increase in annual maintenance rates, which combined with our strong continuous renewal rates, demonstrate that our solutions are mission-critical and deliver amazing value to our customers. Like-for-like, the conversion activity still just represents a single digit percent of our year-on-year ARR growth.
Total revenue exceeded our guidance and came in at $175.8 million with growth of 24% year-on-year. Year-to-date, our total revenue grew 25%, that's an acceleration from 17% in the first half of last year. Our subscription bookings mix came in at 95% in the quarter, that's compared to 88% in the second quarter of last year. Our growth was well balanced across new and expansion business. Self-hosted subscription duration again came in at the lower bound of our range, continuing to put pressure on recognized revenue and that's about $3 million.
Moving into the details of the revenue lines for the second quarter. Subscription revenue reached $106.2 (ph) million, growing 61% year-on-year and representing 60% of total revenue in the second quarter. Consistent with our move to a subscription business model, perpetual license revenue came in at $5.1 million. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $64.6 million, with $51.6 million coming from recurring maintenance and $13 million in professional services revenue.
The recurring revenue portion reached $157.8 million or 90% of total revenue, that's growing 31% year-on-year from the $120.4 million or just 85% of total revenue in the second quarter last year. Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. The Americas revenue reached $107.1 million, growing 28% year-on-year. APJ grew by 24% to $18.3 million in revenues, and EMEA grew by 15% year-on-year to $50.4 million in revenue. The EMEA region had nearly a 13 percentage point increase in subscription bookings mix to 95% in the second quarter from about 82% in the second quarter last year, creating a meaningful recognized revenue headwind in the quarter.
All line items in the P&L will now be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. Our second quarter gross profit was $143.3 million or an 81% gross margin compared to the 82% gross margin in the second quarter last year. Our operating loss of $5.6 million came in better than the top end of our guidance. As a reminder, we incurred expenses from our Impact event in the second quarter of approximately $4 million. Even with the increase in expenses from Impact, we are demonstrating leverage in our business with our revenue growing 24% and operating expenses increasing only 17% year-on-year.
Net income exceeded guidance coming in at $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share. We ended June with over 2,950 employees worldwide, including 1,300 in sales and marketing. For the six months of 2023, free cash flow was a negative $8.6 million or a negative 2.5% free cash flow margin. As a reminder, we expected operating margin free cash flow to be lower sequentially in the second quarter as a result of the Impact customer event and other seasonal expenses.
Turning to our guidance. For the third quarter and the full year 2023, our guidance reflects our strong execution, leading competitive position and platform selling motion and that's balanced against still the uncertainty in the macro environment. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue of $181.5 million to $186.5 million, which represents 21% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect the subscription mix will continue to be above the 95% level. We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $4 million to $8 million for the third quarter. And we expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from $0.19 to $0.27 per diluted share. Our guidance assumes 46.8 million weighted average diluted shares and about $6 million in taxes.
For the full year 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $726 million to $736 million, representing 24% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range and an acceleration from the 18% for full year last year. We are significantly raising our full year operating results to be in the range of breakeven to operating income of $9 million. We expect our EPS range to be $0.44 to $0.63 per diluted share. And we expect about 46.4 million of weighted average diluted shares and about $24 million in taxes for the full year of 2023.
On the back of a strong ARR growth, we are also raising our guidance for annual recurring revenue to now be between $743 million and $753 million at December 31, 2023, that's about a 31% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. Overall, we were pleased with our execution, particularly in this macro environment. Our subscription transition is playing out against our playbook. Revenue in the first six months of the year accelerated to 25% growth and our operating margin is improving. As we talked about at our Investor Day, we are driving towards our near and long term goals as momentum in our business continues to build.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Saket Kalia at Barclays. Okay. Great. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey, Matt. Hey, Josh. Good morning. Great to hear from you. Same here. Matt, maybe to start with you. It's just great to see the resilience of the subscription ARR line, just to the point made earlier in this macro and the continued sort of net new ARR growth. Maybe the question that's most appropriate to start with is, why do you think this space, identity, PAM, et cetera., is just doing so much better than other areas of security? Do you feel like that's CyberArk specific? Do you think that identity in general is just a healthier area of security spending? Any thoughts on why you feel like CyberArk and identity in general is just doing so much better? Thanks. No. It's a great question and it starts with this idea that we are so thrilled with the results to see the kind of continued ARR growth that we're able to achieve. And I think when we look at it internally, we kind of map it back to three main causes of our success from this perspective. One certainly is the market we play in, as you mentioned. We talk a lot about this idea that at the core of where the attackers are trying to get to is identities. And as identities proliferate through organizations, the cybersecurity strategies need to evolve, and they need to focus in on identity as the centerpiece of the overall strategy. And so that's maybe the market we play in and the particular area of cyber that we chose to participate in.
But I think the other two reasons which are CyberArk specific are really driving the success. One is, this ability for us to be able to differentiate in the market with our Identity Security platform, the ability to be able to protect any identity, human and non-human machine identities, regular workforce users as well as the most privileged users sitting in IT and be able to do that all from one platform with one solution set. I think that resonates with our customers as they build their longer-term plans and point them in the direction of CyberArk.
And then the third area and a lot of the team members listen to this call, and I'll tell you, they're doing a phenomenal job executing out there. They are adjusting their execution to the macro environment. We talked about this a little bit before, but they come in and they've changed their value story to make it easier for the customer to buy. They're mapping to the Board initiatives that are out there. For example, they're able to pivot a lot of their story to deal with people like Josh sitting next to me, the CFO in the company and actually pitch a value story for them to go side-by-side with how we're talking to IT, to the CIO and to the CISO. And so I think phenomenal execution kind of rounds out the picture that starts with participating in a great market and having a differentiated solution. Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. Great to see the upside on the income statement this quarter, both in revenue and operating income. And also great to see the operating income guide go up so much for the year, I think more than this quarter's beat. Maybe the question for you, though, is I think we're taking the revenue guide up slightly at the bottom end. Maybe the question is, what were some of the puts and takes that you sort of considered when thinking about how just the ARR success is going to flow through to the revenue line? Does that make sense? Yeah. It does, Saket and thanks for the question. And yes, we are thrilled that we were able to raise the ARR guide for the full year by $7 million. And we're also happy that we were able to pass and eke (ph) up the revenue full year as well. And when we think about kind of the take then on the ARR, one of the things that we want to preserve for the back half is that we -- our pipeline has been growing at record levels. And -- but we're also seeing it very heavily weighted towards SaaS. And so we want to -- while we are getting that increase in the ARR, we also want to preserve that the second half could eke up even above our 95% of SaaS and subscription mix and we want to consider that. And I think where it could -- where we'll definitely see it roll into though is into 2024. We'll move next to Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Hi, there. Let me congratulate my -- the strong performance on the quarter. I wanted to maybe dig into maybe individual products. Was there anything that sort of surprised you in terms of strength in the quarter or that stood out relative to your expectations? Hey, Jonathan. It's Matt here. So listen, I think across the board, it was a strong quarter. We saw a really good performance back in the PAM business itself, particularly on the Privilege Cloud front. We saw strong ARR growth in EPM and in Secrets in the identity and access space, especially in some of the areas that we say differentiate us there, Secure Web Sessions, workforce password manager and some of the areas there. So I think it was one of the quarters where we were kind of strong across the board.
We highlighted in the prepared remarks some of the newer stuff because I think maybe that's where we were a little more surprised kind of the intake of our Secure Cloud Access solution for protecting native cloud environments, maybe took us a little bit by surprise in terms of how quickly it's being brought into deals even more so into the pipeline of deals looking forward. We saw the SaaS side of the Secrets business, Conjur Cloud and Secrets Hub start to take off. And so, I would tell you it was a strong quarter across the board and with really nice signs on some of the newer innovations that we were able to talk about at Impact. We'll go next to Rob Owens at Piper Sandler. Great and thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, you did note some downsizing of deals. And just curious, given the puts and takes with the economy what you guys are seeing now in terms of deal size. Yeah. So I think we talked about it a little bit in depth last quarter and we talked about two things, the downsizing of deals, we also talked about, though, that the component parts that were or downside maybe were put into the back half of the year pipeline and we're ready for expansion motion. The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that.
I think what I would say as it related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal upfront for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budget, based upon a better understanding of what they needed to procure and maybe weren't seeking out the supersize deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution and the ability to be able to kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect.
So I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. We feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment. And I wouldn't say there's been any change in trends of a dramatic nature. Great. And I guess building on that, if I look at ARR and ARR guide for the second half, this year implies about 45% of your ARR would come in the first half of the year, 55% in the back half. That's about a 5-point shift from last year, which was 40-60. So what's implied in that ARR guidance as we kind of contemplate the second half and any help around Q3 versus Q4 would be great. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Rob. So I mean, essentially, we're -- the guiding implies a flat net new ARR for subscription business because we anticipate definitely some reduction on the maintenance side of the ARR, that can even get to $10 million for the second half. So we're looking at flat on the net new ARR and we were glad that we were able to achieve -- overachieve on the net new ARR for the first half and then the take is the decline in the maintenance business ARR for the second half. And then I would just add that I think we see a normal seasonal kind of split between Q3 and Q4, consistent with prior years. Great. Thank you, guys. We'll go next to Angie Song at Morgan Stanley. Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for taking my question today. So could you just talk a little bit about the success that you've been seeing with bundling? What percentage of customers bought multiple products this quarter? Yeah. So we continue to see not just through bundling, by the way, but just through selection in the deal process, we continue to see customers purchase multiple solutions. When we talk about new logos, generally speaking, it's greater than 50%. It can even tick up higher than that, that are buying more than one solution on their landing spot. And certainly, that trend continues if not more in the base as we expand our customers kind of in that land-and-expand motion. So what we generally see though is that the customers have a prioritization process.
At one level, they're focused in on core PAM controls. And then they're looking ahead to what are they going to do next or what are they going to do in parallel. And for some customers, it's about locking down the least privilege on the endpoint, and so EPM becomes a priority. For other customers, they're seeing this need to really understand the nonhuman component, the machine identities, and so secret management becomes a priority kind of side-by-side with PAM.
And then for some, they're really looking to swap out their legacy IDP and thinking about access and their understanding that actually they can do that with the Identity Security platform from CyberArk. So each customer pool would be a little bit different. But in general, customers are wanting to either start or expand with more than just PAM and we're really happy with that. We also do, do a nice job, though, of seeding some of our more innovative products into our packages.
When you buy Privilege Cloud, you get a little bit of workforce password management, you get a little bit of the identity suite. And that helps us so that when we go back for the expansion motion, the customers are already familiar with our products and they're ready to adopt and expand later. So that's a little bit around how we see that world, packaging, but also just the very nature of how customers are buying more than one product from us. We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz at Mizuho. Thank you very much for taking the question and nice job executing in the Q2. Matt, I think everyone would agree that generative AI is spawning more cyberattacks and that this is only going to increase. And you spoke in your prepared remarks about innovations that you're working on in this area. But is gen AI something that you look at as an incremental revenue opportunity for CyberArk? What are your thoughts here? Yes. It's an interesting topic and one that comes up in almost every conversation at this point in time. And the nice thing about what we're talking about is it's very practical and real. We're not talking about some mythical thing. We're talking about what's happening out there in enterprises today. Our threat landscape, talking with CISOs and security practitioners of thousands of enterprises around the world, it was over 85% of them that were anticipating a generative AI-based attack in the year ahead. So on that kind of offensive side, we certainly see this ability for attackers to innovate and innovate by really making their existing attack methods more effective.
And I think that kind of sets the stage to a degree for how we will operate from a defensive perspective. If they're making their existing attacks which are generally targeting identities more effective with AI then we need to make our existing solutions AI-enabled to be able to protect against those attacks. And I said it in the prepared remarks, but fight innovation with innovation. So for sure, there will be some new pockets of innovation or creativity where we might create some new solutions that harness the power of the data we’re collecting to be able to do analytics better and provide that insight into the product suite.
But in general, I would tell you our strategy is let’s go make our solutions more effective, let’s go make our solutions easier to deploy so that they can cover more identities. And let’s make sure that we understand how attackers are using AI and defend against that using what we believe is the primary mechanism we have, which is intelligent privilege controls. We'll go next to Brian Essex at JPMorgan. Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I want to follow up on Rob's question, particularly with regard to some of the dynamics around ARR and conversions. I notice you had a little bit of spike in perpetual this quarter. But -- and Josh, I think you noted, what, about 4 points help on conversions for subscription ARR. So I guess -- and I also caught the comment that the $10 million, I think, decline anticipated for maintenance in the back half of the year. So maybe if you could unpack a little bit how conversions from the installed base are trending, how you're approaching those and what expectations might be in the future quarters for that versus new logo adds? Sure. And I'll start, and then maybe Josh will jump in and add some color. But first of all, I want to just say the perpetual business itself didn’t grow. It actually was pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. And that's what we're seeing now, which is really kind of an absolute number versus even a percentage. And as we look out into the pipe going forward, we see perpetual at the best flat and maybe even trailing down a little bit as we go forward. So the perpetual business definitely is seeing its last notes here at CyberArk. And I think we're good with that, obviously.
I think from a conversion perspective, I'm not sure Josh actually gave a number, but he talked about single-digit impact from conversions in terms of our overall growth. And I think that continues to be the case. You've heard me talk about this maybe before, but we believe fundamentally that we're getting such a big upside when people do convert, meaning not what we charge for the like-for-like, although that's incremental as well. We get 2x to 3x on maintenance rates for like-to-like conversion.
We also create such a strong compelling buying opportunity to expand into new products and even to upsell existing products that we're not coming at customers with a stick and saying you have to convert. We're actually approaching them and figuring out when it makes sense to slot it into their road map. And since we're such a core security control and we want customers primarily to go to SaaS, it takes a little bit of planning to figure out when that customer should go. And I think it's going to materialize over the next two to three years, and it's not going to be any big jump in any given quarter as we kind of move forward.
So I think that's how we see the kind of conversion activity happening. I would say on the maintenance ARR decline, what we are seeing is not -- that's not due to some big uptick in conversions. That's due to the fact that we're not selling much perpetual anymore. And just think about we were 95% in this quarter and the year before, we were in the upper 80s. You're starting to really tick down in the new maintenance that's coming in. And when we look towards the back half of the year, where we see 95% or better, we are anticipating the maintenance ARR coming down pretty strongly in respect of that kind of tail off.
Now in Q2, we were able to see some nice realization from a captured rate perspective. Renewal rates overall were actually in the best shape they've been. Price increase has started to materialize its way through and helped us to the tune of maybe $1 million. So we didn't see as much tail-off here in Q2, but we – what we definitely see it starting to kick in, in the back half of the year. We'll take our next question from Eric Heath at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Thanks for taking the question and great to see the great results there. Just a two-parter for me, Matt and Josh, if I could. Just first, any uptick in noise in the market or any change in sales cycles at all that relates to Hashi (ph) self-managed boundary offering or boxes upcoming PAM lease? And secondary, I just wanted to ask on M&A, Matt. Just if there's any areas of interest for you as you look to kind of accelerate the product road map and that's it? Thanks. Yeah. Sure. Great questions. And from a competitive landscape perspective, we haven't seen any change and that would be across the entire portfolio. Specific to the two areas you talked about, from a Secrets Management, Hashi perspective, Hashi vault and then kind of on the PAM side with Hashi boundary, we don't see any difference in the competitive dynamic there. And I'll just take a second there to maybe double-click and try to help explain a little bit of our competitive posture against Hashi.
What happens with these development groups that are going on, and Hashi offers a fabulous developer platform across the board. Developers get started. They're using the Hashi tool set, and they need to actually manage secrets in a local vault. So they -- they're at least no longer hard coding secrets into the applications they're building. And they're setting up a Hashi vault instance, for example, locally for their work group as they work on their project.
And what happens at enterprises is that one Hashi vault becomes multiple Hashi vaults. And then there's other development efforts going on, and it's in AWS secret store or Microsoft key vault. And you end up with this kind of vault sprawl across the enterprise. At some point in time, security gets involved and says, great that you're not hard coding your passwords anymore into your applications. But how do we actually manage policy on the back end at an enterprise grade, at an enterprise scale?
How do we make sure that those passwords are actually being rotated? How do we make sure that the other policies are being implemented and now they have a decision to make. Do they actually go and upgrade and basically swap out tool sets to a more bigger offering from Hashi or do they bring in a security vendor that they're already used to dealing with on their PAM portfolio and expand with us into secrets?
And that's the competitive fight that we have, and it's a competitive fight that we're very confident in that we can become the enterprise backbone for secrets, not only in those modern scenarios, but also back into the legacy applications that we're able to provide options around and in the multi-cloud environments that we're able to deliver secrets through with our Secrets Hub.
Now as they move into boundary, it's not really PAM. And it would be the same answer then that I would pivot on over into what we're seeing around Okta, which is they are coming at it from an ease-of-use perspective and a light use case scenario perspective. And I think it maybe has some room to play down market for people who are just getting started on their PAM journey. But we don't see that as a current competitive threat within our market.
Our enterprise customers are not talking about pitches around Okta's PAM solution. And we'll keep an eye on it when it finally comes out and see what it looks like and we'll be ready to respond. But I give you a little bit of a longer answer here because it's an area that we feel we're strongly positioned against and we continue to see that dynamic be beneficial for us.
From the second question perspective, I think when we think about M&A, it's kind of similar to some answers we've given in the past. We continue to look at -- we have a clear vision for our Identity Security platform and where it will go over the next three to five years. And we always are looking and trying to understand, is there an inorganic method to significantly accelerate any component parts of that Identity Security vision. We're sitting on a $50 billion TAM. So we don't need to go someplace else with our acquisition strategy, but we might need to accelerate key component parts.
And you hear us talk about cloud and you hear us talk about access and endpoint in these nonhuman areas. And they're really exciting areas and we're always looking to see if there's a good match between us and something out in the market with a realistic valuation that can help accelerate our organic road map and get us to market faster and that's how we think about the kind of M&A approach going forward. We'll take our next question from Roger Boyd at UBS. Great. Thanks for taking the question and again, congrats on the very nice execution. This is definitely a difficult environment for customer additions. But Matt, I think you mentioned 235 in the quarter, which is certainly an impressive result. Last quarter, you made the comment that you're expecting maybe fewer but bigger lands this year. Wondering if that was still the case this quarter? And then again, with the record pipeline, any color on what you're expecting from a new logo perspective through the end of the year. Thanks. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. And I think it's a really important point because it's really sequentially up 15% new logos from Q1 to Q2 and that's a good sign for us. We did see in Q1, we mentioned it that it was harder to go land. And I think in any macro environment that's a headwind. You're always a little harder to close the deals with a new customer. They take a little bit longer. We definitely saw an uptick here in Q2, which is nice. We certainly expect it to continue into Q3 and Q4.
But the secondary point you made absolutely played out once again, which is our average selling price and average deal size for those new logos was up pretty dramatically in Q2 and helped fuel our results. And so the ones we are landing are landing with much more of the Identity Security portfolio and they're making a bigger bet on CyberArk. And so that's why we look at the new logo quarter and really the new business quarter in Q2 and we're really, really happy with the step function change we saw versus Q1. We'll go next to Joshua Tilton at Wolfe Research. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll echo my congrats on a great quarter. I actually just had one for me. How -- any updates on how we should think about free cash flow for the balance of the year and maybe what are some of the puts and takes around outperforming free cash flow in the back half? Yeah, Josh. Thanks for the question. This is -- we're, first of all, we're glad we're in line with our expectations as we reported through the first half of the year. And I think that -- and we're certainly in line with where we are for full year -- with full year expectations. I think when you ask about puts and takes, this is still a transition year. And so some of the puts and takes are around duration on the self-hosted and of course, on the maintenance as well, which can create some headwind or tailwind on the free cash flow as it relates to billings. And we see in both of them, certainly in Q2, we saw some reduction in duration around the subscription, and I talked about that as it impacted revenue.
And anyway, maintenance, we're seeing a decline over already for the last year. Since we started our transition for the last two years, we're seeing the decline where we did a lot of three year deals going down out to one year deal. And that's our initiative to renew maintenance contracts only on a one year basis as opposed to a three year basis. So we're in line with what we expect for this year, and those are the puts. Yeah. And I would just add, just jumping in, I think for sure, first of all, like Josh said, the quarter played out as we expected. I think we were pretty clear upfront that this was going to be a not the strongest cash flow quarter, given the dynamic of our quarterization of expenses and some other areas around insurance and other areas that we talked about. But I want to reiterate that I said in the prepared remarks, I'll say it again, that the cash flow story starts to kick in, in 2024 and accelerate in 2025 into 2027. And we are extremely confident in the $200 million of cash flow that we put out for 2025, the $375 million in cash flow for 2027 and we're right on track with that as we get into next year and expand from there. Super helpful. Thank you again. We'll take our next question from Adam Borg at Stifel. Awesome and thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just for Matt on the channel and the MSP opportunity in particular, you talked about that a little bit in the script. Maybe talk more about the opportunity for partners to introduce managed PAM offerings and how that could broaden your reach even more down market? And then I have a follow-up. Yeah. I mean, I think this MSP market for us is, I don't know how to describe it other than its captivated us. I think we've been always looking at it. You heard me talk this quarter with some excitement. You'll hear me talk about it now. I think it's because it's actually broader than what we thought. I think when you start out, you think MSPs, you think down market, oh, it's going to help us reach a bunch of new logos. I think what we're seeing actually is it playing out on the dynamic across upper end of the enterprise, enterprise, corporate all the way down.
And it's because this growing trend that organizations really can't afford to sustain and support the vast (ph) spend on IT, specifically on cyber that's going on within their enterprises. And so there's a recent Gartner report that came out that estimated something like 30% or 40% of the cyber spend will move to MSP in the next three years. And I think that trend line kind of feels real to us. The exciting piece is what you just said, which is if you get into the MSPs as the backbone of their offering and they build and embed their value-added services around it; it’s a very sticky approach. And so we see our MSPs, not only by the way, wanting to bring our priv-cloud. It's generally a SaaS motion, wanting to bring our priv-cloud to market.
We see, as we mentioned, about BT looking over into our access solution portfolio. We see an increasing uptake on our Secrets Management and non-human side. And so we really believe that actually, it's a great way to reach all types of customers, obviously, to go out and find new customer segments down market, but also to get the broader portfolio adopted out into the market. And I think you can hear it as I start talking, I just think it's going to be such a strong growth driver for us going forward. Early days, but I can point to specific wins in Q2 that we would not have had if we didn't have the great MSP partnerships that we built up. That's great. I appreciate that. Maybe just as a quick follow-up just on the vertical mix in the quarter. I did see that financial services still your top mix, but I think it did tick down sequentially. I do think the definition may have changed as well. Maybe anything to call out there on what you're seeing in your largest vertical. Again, really appreciate it. Thanks. Yeah. I'll just jump in. I mean, our big growth verticals were manufacturing and we also saw a nice growth in retail as well and probably followed up by pharma. Banking was -- and financial is still strong in our vertical mix. And overall, we always like to go back to the fact that we're really well diversified across many verticals. I think we have nine verticals that are 5% more of the business of the pie and we see them move around in the quarters. But overall, we continue to be really strong across no matter where the enterprise sits. Great. Thanks so much for the color. We'll go next to Trevor Walsh at JMP Securities. Great. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. Matt, maybe best for you, but Josh, feel free to chime in as well. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the telco deal in South America and it was more of a consolidation play. Just curious if you can dive in a little bit deeper there. Was that -- was there a displacement involved or if there were, how many other tools approximately maybe without naming names, of course, but just give us a sense maybe when you do see that consolidation motion kind of how it's playing out, kind of what's the critical mass of tools around identity that might be there to start and what's going to look like when the customer gets to their -- kind of their end state? Thanks. Yeah. Sure. On that particular deal, it was consistent with what we would normally see on a bigger enterprise offering, which is, yeah, we're displacing a legacy PAM tool and consolidating in access and in secrets in that particular case. I think what we see in general when we land a new enterprise logo is that customers are foundational on our privileged controls on our PAM offering. And then as I mentioned earlier, they're partaking up a couple of other solutions in order to be able to get started on their journey. We use this phrase and we use it a lot because it's the foundation of how we view the market, which is it's a consolidation of trust that is happening.
And that can happen with a new logo. That can also happen with an existing customer as we expand the footprint. And it's the idea that it's not about just that we offer all of these things in the market and maybe we can give a better price point because you're buying it from one vendor. That's the traditional vendor consolidation and one throat to choke. It's really the idea that our customers trust us as a core security control in their stack. They know that we're security first. They know that actually our mindset every day when we wake up is that we're in partnership with them to secure their enterprise.
And so, as they look to understand within the identity space how they can consolidate, how they can get to a vendor that they trust in this increasingly threat landscape that's again hard to operate in, they look and they say, oh, I know CyberArk. I trust CyberArk, come talk to CyberArk. And that's a really interesting place to be too, because we're actually receiving the inbound and saying, hey, can you come talk to us versus having to always be out there positioning ourselves. So it's a great position to be in and that was an excellent deal that we're really proud of that they delivered down there in the LatAm team. We'll go next to Alex Henderson at Needham & Company. Great. Thanks and thanks for the consistency in strong execution, you guys have been delivering quarter after quarter after quarter. I was hoping you could move to a little bit broader view of the world from -- than just looking at what CyberArk is seeing and talk to us about what you're hearing from the C-suite at your customers and in the marketplace. There seems to be two specific dynamics that have set up the fear after the Fortinet print that people are cutting back on spending. Conversely, the software companies seem to be talking about an improved normalization and stability. So what are you seeing from the aggregate C-suite about what their intentions are on overall spending on security? Thanks. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I'll comment to my vantage point. And really, it's coming from my conversations, like you said, with the C-suite of customers that still happens day in and day out. And what we see out there is that the C-suite understands that the threat landscape is getting worse. They understand that work-from-home or now hybrid work makes things harder. They understand that digital transformation can't slow down. More and more, they're understanding that all this great work that's being done by developers to build modern applications are being done kind of outside the purview of the security organization and the controls that have been put in place.
And so what you see is, I think, actually awareness of the need of the cybersecurity spend, full stop, not CyberArk spend, but cybersecurity spend is going up. It's even more on the Board agenda. And you see regulation coming out here in the U.S. that actually even pushes that even further to say around disclosure requirements and making the Board maybe even more aware. So I think cyber as a topic, believe it or not, continues to elevate in its importance. I think then in this macro environment, the C-suite does have to make difficult decisions and they need to prioritize.
And to be honest, that's where they look towards the experts in their organization to say, how can we do primary risk reduction? Where is the threats most severe? And what are the tool sets either I have in-house or I need in-house that are going to drive us to a better security posture? And I think then in those cases, they're certainly willing to spend. And we saw it in our results. We see it in our pipeline and I think that then becomes to a degree within cyber spend haves and have nots for the time being because in a more tight environment, they are going to make more discriminating choices. We're lucky to be part of the choice and we're happy with that position. We'll move next to Rudy Kessinger at D.A. Davidson. Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one for me. Matt, you talked about this a little bit, but I think it's applied more to the new customer side. You've talked about 50%, 60% landing with two plus products. I guess I'm curious with the existing customers, how much emphasis are you putting on the cross-sell motion? Take the conversions out of it. You've talked about building those road maps with those perpetual customers to migrate them potentially with multiple products. But if you look at your existing subscription customers, what kind of expansion rates are you seeing with that installed base and how much emphasis are you placing on the cross-sell motion? Yeah. No, I think it's some level of the backbone of our growth story. We still see, by the way, strong upsell of PAM seats. They own some, and they're expanding to more. And as more users become privileged, they need to expand out. But I would tell you that the sales team is eating their dinners off of the cross-sell motion because it is the compelling story in the market. It's the compelling story of our Identity Security platform. Hey, you're protecting IT, protect the workforce. You're protecting the on-prem environment, protect the cloud, protect the hybrid and lift-and-shift environments. You're doing human. Now you need to start doing non-human and machine identities.
So I would tell you that we are thrilled, I would use that word, with our expansion selling capabilities, our expansion selling performance. And I think that's what sets us up for such a strong future. I think at our Investor Day, we talked about an $8 billion TAM within our installed base. And those motions, to be honest, are easier than going and landing a new logo. And so when we have that kind of well lubricated and working, the growth story really takes off from the base. We'll take our final question from Andrew Nowinski at Wells Fargo. Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So there were many instances this quarter where I think privilege escalation was used as part of that move it file transfer breach. I'm wondering if that had a positive impact on your quarter or the pipeline. And then I was also hoping you could comment on the Fed -- the pipeline you have in the Fed, given that we're heading into the fiscal year in there? Thank you. Yeah. Sure. I'll take them, and Josh will sit to my side not talking too much. But I think when we think about the kind of threat landscape, listen, when we understand a little bit more about any of these well-publicized breaches, it comes back to privilege escalation. It comes back to credential theft. It comes back to the things that we at CyberArk do. And so I would tell you that it's always a help. It always is a tailwind. It never drives a deal in the quarter, more or less. Obviously, there's a few deals that come with someone who's particularly breached, and they need to recover quickly and that's a quick sales cycle.
But it's the second part of what you said. It drives the pipeline expansion, the pipeline growth that we see out there in the market because any of these breaches -- by the way, same thing we would say about generative AI. It causes organizations to have to think the way we want them to think, which is assume breach. And the minute you assume breach as an organization, it's not enough to detect. It's not enough to lock down the perimeter. You have to actually implement controls that stops somebody once they get inside because you have to assume they're already inside. And the move it breach and kind of the play out of that just reemphasizes that factor.
To your second question here before we wrap, we continue to see a Fed environment that's consistent with what we've seen before. Now we talked about before, it's kind of become more ordinary course of business that happens each quarter versus some big buildup that happens at the end of the year. People are having to buy each quarter because the priority is evident. So we embedded our Fed business into our guidance for Q3. We're happy with our overall Fed business, our overall global government, which I think is 11% of our overall vertical mix. By the way, I would highlight we see a strong growth potential in the SLED business, the state and local areas. We closed a really nice deal in Q2 at a state entity. It was a large deal adopting the full Identity Security suite. So we see that as a growth driver as well even when you get beyond the traditional federal market. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matt Cohen for closing remarks. Yeah. So I want to end by really thanking our employees for their hard work, their commitment. You heard me talk about their execution and I'm incredibly proud by everything that everybody does at CyberArk. I want to thank our partners for helping us drive the business and of course, our customers. And thank you for all the informative questions and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

I will now turn the conference over to Erica Smith, SVP, Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead. Thank you, Jay. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results. With me on the call today are Matt Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the fourth quarter full year 2023 and beyond.
Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website.
CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. A webcast of today's call is available on our website in the Investor Relations section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Matt? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. I want to start off by saying our hearts go out to Israel and the Global Israeli community as they navigate through this incredibly difficult time. The atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel are horrific and as an organization, we condemn these barbaric acts. The health and safety of our team continues to be our top priority. We are providing all of our employees with the flexibility required to care for their well-being for their families and for their communities.
The resiliency and spirit of our team has been nothing short of remarkable. The outreach and support from our customers, our partners, and the Wall Street community has helped us all through the last few weeks, and we greatly appreciate it.
Moving into the quarter. We had 1 of the best quarters in the company's history. We saw a significant step up in demand for our platform. Our go-to-market teams continue to deliver and identity security remains a top priority for global CISOs. In the third quarter, our bookings growth accelerated and total bookings significantly outpaced our guidance framework. Demand served across our platform, resulting in stellar results that beat our guidance across the board.
Subscription ARR reached $504 million, growing 68% year-over-year. Total ARR reached $705 million, growing 38%. We added a robust $52 million in net new ARR and we exceeded our guidance range across revenue, operating income and EPS, with total revenue accelerating to 25% growth, reaching $191 million.
Non-GAAP operating income came in at approximately $17 million, and we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42. Throughout the year, our team has personified excellence in execution, and we have navigated the macroeconomic landscape exceptionally well. While uncertainty persisted in the third quarter, we experienced a firming of the macro environment compared to the last few quarters. Our execution was even stronger in Q3 as seen in our meaningful top and bottom line outperformance and the significant step-up in our ARR guidance for the full year 2023.
Our close rates improved and we had strong conversion of our record pipeline. While we didn't see any outside deals in the third quarter, there was a healthy increase in 7-figure ACV contracts as customers are more than willing to allocate significant portions of their cybersecurity budgets to our mission-critical solutions. In addition to strong execution across our go-to-market and product development teams, we continue to benefit from robust secular tailwinds that are becoming even stronger. The exponential growth of identities, cloud migration and the elevated threat landscape are all contributing to the momentum in our business.
One thing remains constant in cybersecurity incidents. All roads in the attack chain lead to identity. The MGM incident is 1 of the most recent examples of identity and privilege access being leveraged to move laterally regardless of environment and how attackers can inflict devastating damage, including a complete shutdown of an organization. As identities across the enterprise become more powerful, cybersecurity leaders recognize that to be secure all identities need the right level of privileged controls.
Organizations are also grappling with how to assign privileges and provision access to provide each identity with the right level of security at the right time. We are the only company with an identity security platform that can offer our customers the flexibility to provide standing access, just-in-time access or 0 standing privileges, depending on the type of identity and the nature of the targets they need to access. What differentiates our platform even further is that we can do this across hybrid and cloud-native environments.
Based on our truly differentiated capabilities, our platform selling motion continues to gain traction and all our solutions are being adopted by customers at an accelerated pace, driving strong growth. This includes PAM, which despite having a much bigger base, it's still 1 of our fastest-growing areas. Equally exciting, customers today understand that EDR is not enough and they need endpoint privilege manager to lock down every endpoint with the least privileged approach.
Our access solutions remain both in expansion and landing opportunity. Conjur Cloud and Secrets Hub are leading a SaaS first strategy for our secrets management business, an equally exciting, the early momentum we are seeing with secure cloud access remains very strong and opens up an entirely new group of identities for CyberArk within the developer community.
We have an all-star lineup making up our portfolio. We are empowering our customers throughout their digital transformation journeys by securing access to their cloud environments and protecting their developer communities and the applications they are building, all without getting in the way of innovation. Ensuring every identity across the workforce is truly secure sets us apart and is helping us achieve these strong results.
Digging into some of the key deals in the quarter. The threat landscape is driving customers to adopt our robust identity security platform and has pushed CyberArk into the top competitive position. We had a strong new business quarter and signed about 230 new logos with customers increasingly landing with 2 or more solutions. A few great wins in the quarter included Pro desk and international government agency recognizing the mission-critical nature of Identity Security and went deep with CyberArk from the start, landing with PAM, EPM, access and secrets in a 7-figure deal.
A manufacturing company landed with PAM, vendor PAM and access. Our platform capabilities were a key differentiator over competing identity vendors, influence from both an advisory firm and a channel partner demonstrates the powerful combination of our platform and partner network in this great new logo win. Glasgow, Caledonian University was looking for a modernization and upgrade of their identity stack driven by a need for stronger security controls.
Recognizing the need to look at identities holistically, they brought CyberArk security first mindset on board broadly adopting Privilege Cloud, identity, workforce password manager and secure web sessions. The velocity of our business is picking up as customers achieve faster time to value with our SaaS solutions. One thing I want to drive home is that our expansion business is coming both from our new solutions as well as expanding TAM within our existing customers. The land and expand motion is built into our model and its success is represented by the 33% increase in customers with more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to 1,585 customers at the end of Q3. We're seeing even faster growth in the larger cohort of customers with over $500,000 ARR.
A few examples of expansion deals include a long-term CyberArk PAM customer in financial services, needed an additional layer of security for its broader workforce. This quarter, they added CyberArk identity, secure web sessions and Workforce Password Manager, taking the first step into our SaaS capabilities with discussions already underway to go deeper across the platform. We had a great quarter for our secrets management business. In a 7-figure ACV deal, a Fortune 500 financial services company who added Secrets management for the first time for a subsidiary at the end of 2022 is now deploying CyberArk as the de facto provider for all its data centers globally. This is another example of CyberArk serving as the secrets backbone for the enterprise.
With the recent uptick in high-profile breach activity, EPM remains a must-have. Adding to its existing CyberArk portfolio in a 7-figure ACV add-on deal, this Fortune 100 retailer was looking to deploy EPM across all its workstations and servers, allowing consistent policy adoption. Removing local admin rights and running in lease privilege at the endpoint delivered measurable risk reduction across the enterprise. We continue to see great alignment and momentum in the channel partners and partnerships providing new valuable routes to market that allow us to extend our footprint even more effectively and reach new customer segments. The number of certifications and unique certified partners continue to show healthy growth across PAM, access and secrets management. The partner community is a big part of our growth, and we are thrilled with the depth of our relationships. And while MSPs are still a small percentage of our business today, momentum is continuing to pick up. Our MSPs deals are on average about 50% larger in size than traditional channel deals with a faster sales cycle.
In the third quarter, a Nordic MSP doubled the number of PAM and workforce password manager users after an initial purchase in March. Their managed service operations have expanded significantly as they build out their identity security offering. Results like this are becoming commonplace and our MSP pipeline continues to see strong growth.
Moving on to innovation. In early September, we launched our Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence. The center builds on our long track record of using artificial intelligence and machine learning to fortify and expand generative AI and ML capabilities across our identity security platform. We are harnessing these capabilities to drive risk analysis and risk reduction, threat detection to simplify the user experience through automation and optimize policy to be more effective and boost productivity. AI is also being weaponized by attackers, which is increasing the severity of the threat landscape. The CyberArk Labs team was founded on the principle of thinking like an attacker, and is providing ongoing research in how generative AI is driving attacker innovation.
The Labs team is working closely with the Center of Excellence, and together, they are fighting attacker innovation with innovation of our own to more effectively secure our global customers. In early October, we announced new risk-based controls for identities in the cloud, strengthening our Secure Cloud Access solution. These enhanced capabilities enable just-in-time access with 0 standing privilege to a diverse set of cloud services that sit behind the cloud management consoles for all cloud service providers.
These services run in multi-cloud environments with no added friction to the user experience. While many other vendors focus on visibility in the cloud, no other vendor can bring privileged controls to the cloud like CyberArk can. We were excited once again to be named a leader for PAM by 2 major industry analysts, including in the Forrester Wave for Privileged Identity Management. Our Identity Security platform received a top score in the current offering category and the highest possible score in 16 criteria including lease privilege access, just-in-time access, development and DevOps support, threat detection and response, innovation and partner ecosystem.
As you have heard from us for a while now, the investment in our identity security platform has dramatically increased our ability to innovate and bring new integrated services to market at an even faster rate, while driving down our overall cost of development. The threat landscape is evolving quickly, but we are well positioned to live our mission of securing our customers around the world against cyber threats with constant innovation and security first solutions.
Switching gears to profitability. The effects of our subscription transition are entering its final phase. Our top line growth is accelerating and our outperformance in Q3 shows the inherent operating leverage in our business. We are marching towards our goal of returning to a rule of 40 company or even beyond. We are striking the right balance between investing in growth and innovation and driving profitability.
In addition, the final piece of the transition is cash flow, which we expect to expand in 2024. With our stellar performance in the quarter, I remain very confident in the long-term targets we outlined earlier in the year.
To sum up my discussion today, we posted a stellar quarter with our business accelerating, our industry-leading platform drove strong new and add-on business. We offer a must-have layer of security that is truly differentiated in the market. Our competitive position has never been stronger, and you are seeing the momentum in our business. We are the only vendor in the market today who has a full identity security platform, one that can apply the right level of controls over any identity regardless of environment.
I'll now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our outperformance in more detail and how the significant increase in our full year revenue, operating income and ARR guidance demonstrates the confidence in our execution and the durability of the demand environment. Josh? Thanks, Matt. We posted outstanding results in the third quarter and beat our guidance across all metrics. Our bookings outperformance compared to our guidance framework for the third quarter resulted in top line revenue growth accelerating to 25% coming in at a record $191.2 million. We were particularly pleased with our results because of our subscription bookings mix in the third quarter was 97% that's higher than our guidance framework of 95% evidence that the booking strength was even more impressive than the top line outperformance. Our business continues to be driven by upsell, cross-sell and new logos, landing with a bigger piece of our identity security platform.
ARR demonstrates the momentum in our business and reached $705 million at September 30, growing 38%. The subscription portion increased 68% and reached $504 million. The strong $53 million in net new subscription ARR shows the step-up in demand for our identity security platform as customers increasingly move to protect all identities with intelligent privileged controls. The maintenance portion of ARR was just over $200 million at September 30. Strong renewal rates persisted in the third quarter, and we were able to capture price increases resulting in a relatively flat maintenance ARR compared to the second quarter.
Like-for-like conversion activity still only represents a single-digit percent of our year-on-year ARR growth. Moving into the details of the revenue lines for the third quarter. Subscription revenue reached $122.9 million with growth accelerating to 65% year-on-year and representing 64% of total revenue in the third quarter. Perpetual license revenue came in at $4.1 million. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $64.3 million. Of that, $51.5 million came from recurring maintenance.
The consistent maintenance revenue is because of our strong renewal rates and the uplift in prices we are capturing for our mission, critical software, professional services and professional services revenue was $12.8 million in the third quarter. Recurring revenue reached $174.4 million and is now 91% of total revenue compared to 84% in the third quarter last year, demonstrating the subscription engine we have built. Recurring revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-on-year.
Geographically, the business continues to be well diversified. The Americas revenue reached $112.4 million, growing 20% year-on-year. APJ grew by 21% to $18.7 million and EMEA grew by 38% year-on-year to $60.1 million in revenue. One thing to note is that every 1 of our major territories had a subscription mix of over 94%. All line items of the P&L will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our third quarter gross profit was $158.2 million or 83% gross margin, consistent with the third quarter last year. Our operating income of $16.9 million far exceeded the top end of our guidance. We are pleased that our commitment to the profitability and leverage is now paying off. Sequentially, our operating expenses declined from the second quarter of 2023, primarily because of our Impact Customer Conference. As a reminder, in 2022 we hosted our Impact customer event in the third quarter and it fell in the second quarter of this year. That's affecting the year-on-year comparison in addition to the sequential.
Net income came in at $19.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, also significantly outperforming our guidance. For the first 9 months of 2023, free cash flow was $5.1 million or 1% free cash flow margin. We ended September with approximately 3,000 employees worldwide, including 1,320 in sales and marketing.
Turning to our guidance. For the fourth quarter and the full year 2023, our guidance reflects our strong execution and durable demand, while still balanced against the continued uncertainty in the broader environment. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue of $206.5 million to $211.5 million, which represents 24% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect the subscription mix to be about 95%, and we expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $19 million to $23 million for the fourth quarter, and we expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from $0.41 to $0.50 per diluted share. Our guidance also assumes 47.1 million weighted average diluted shares and about $11.6 million in taxes.
For the full year of 2023, we are raising our guidance for total revenue to be in the range of $735 million to $740 million that's representing 25% and growth year-on-year at the midpoint of the range and an acceleration from the 18% in 2022. We are significantly raising our profitability outlook and now expect our full year operating income to be in the range of $17.7 million to $21.7 million. We expect our EPS range to be $0.72 to $0.80 per diluted share, and we expect about 46.5 million weighted average diluted shares and about $32 million in taxes for the full year of 2023.
Now that we are in the fourth quarter, we wanted to frame up the cash flow guide rails, which translates to a range of $33 million to $38 million for the full year 2023. We are also significantly raising our guidance for the annual recurring revenue by about $15 million to now be between $758 million and $768 million in this December 31, 2023, or about 34% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range.
Overall, we were thrilled with another quarter of strong execution and see a step-up in momentum and demand for our solutions and platform. Recurring revenue is now the lion's share of our business and its acceleration this quarter demonstrates that demand for our platform is building. At the same time, we are driving leverage in our model, resulting in our significantly improved profitability and cash flow.
Now I want to take a moment and echo math sentiment and that we are fully supporting everyone affected by the horrific attacks on Israel. We are grateful for those bravely serving Israel, and our thoughts and prayers are with them.
Before moving on to the QA, I also wanted to address some of the questions we have been getting about our operations in Israel and the employees who are being called to military duty. Organizationally, about 1,000 employees or 30% of our total team is based in Israel with the biggest group being in R&D and product management and then HR, finance, IT and legal teams. At this time, just under 3% of our global employees have been called up into the reserves. As a global company, business continuity has always been foundational to our strategy, and we are moving the business forward even in these unprecedented times.
We remain confident in our ability to hit our short- and long-term goals. Our team has been incredible and I'm proud of what they are accomplishing together as we navigate this challenging time. We all stand united in support of our Israeli employees around the world, and we will emerge stronger as an organization and a community.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Okay. Great. Great to see the momentum and also wanted to echo those thoughts there, Josh, to all your employees in Israel as well. Thank you, Saket. Thank you. Thank you. For sure. Matt, maybe just to start with you. A lot of great stuff to talk about. But maybe we can touch on maybe some of the recent events in the identity space broadly. Specifically, I'd love to touch on whether you think the MGM Caesars breach is driving maybe additional interest in PAM broadly? And what do you think some of the vulnerabilities for other identity players are maybe driving interest in CyberArk's broader identity platform. Does that make sense? It does. And I think it's a key element, actually, of our continued performance and our continued results. Like when we think about kind of the threat landscape today, and we'll talk generally to begin with, we said it in the prepared remarks, all roads lead towards identity. When you start to digest or dissect some of these breaches themselves, you start to see that they all start kind of with a profiling and understanding a phishing attack that goes out after weakness in an employee, maybe it's MFA fatigue, maybe it's tricking a help desk. And ultimately, organizations see quite quickly that MFA, multifactor authentication is not enough. When you track the pathways that then are occurring in these breaches, ultimately, you see the lateral movement to a privileged account and then the privileged account being exploited, which allows the data infiltration and the ability to be able to recap it within an organization. And this is actually not new news. When you track any major breach of the last decade, it comes back to the need to be able to protect every identity within an organization, human or nonhuman and apply the right level of privilege controls and organizations that just stop at basic security controls are not really secure in this day and age.
And so I think when you look at our results, you see CISOs who have understood this not because of a recent breach, but understood it for years, getting more support from their C-suite from their Boards. As they understand the dire consequences of not implementing a broader identity security strategy. Now we see it obviously in customer breaches. We see it in breaches that have occurred throughout the industry, the identity industry, they all actually have the similar foundation, which is we need to make sure that the privilege controls are placed against all identities. And I think our customers understand that we're the only company out there that's able to bring a security-first identity security story that they can trust and trust to be able to consolidate their offerings on to the CyberArk platform. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. It's great to see the maintenance error hold in with -- I mean you called out strong retention and price increases as well. The question is, how do you think about maintenance ARR going forward, just tactically, but also strategically, when do you think these customers maybe start to convert to subscription or SaaS in a bigger way? Yes. Thanks, Saket. So when we think about Q4, I mean, we think about a decline in the mandate ARR, probably in the mid-single digits -- going -- and that would kind of give us about just over a $10 million type of a decline in the last -- for the 12-month period. And I think as we see it kind of playing out into 2024, I think that we'll probably see as -- right now, we're above the -- and already Q3, or 98%, we're looking at kind of just in the 95-plus range for the full year this year in terms of SaaS and subscription. So already next year, it will be above that. So really, the perpetual business is really evaporating for next year. So we should expect to see, I would call, a larger decline compared to the low double digits this year, but not a falloff just kind of continuing to increase the number. And I think the strategy is we're really focused on doing what's right for the customer and what's right and best for the customer.
And so clearly, as customers are part of the cloud journey for moving their PAM and their identity security to the cloud, we are absolutely part of that program. And then we also are -- as the customer wants to upgrade and update their current hosted environment, we're there, but we're not necessarily forcing a change to move it. But we do anticipate it growing because the perpetual business is evaporating. And over time, more and more customers will be moving to the SaaS environment, and we'll be there for that. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. You we'd like to echo our thoughts relative to your employees and the people of Israel, tough situation. Wanted to drill down, Josh, a little bit and just 1 question from me into the free cash flow guide. I realize that there was puts and takes with previous guide around duration of maintenance contracts. But it looks like some of that previous guidance of that net income margin spread relative to free cash flow aren't necessarily going to hold. So can you unpack that for us and help us get to an understanding of a free cash flow for this year and where it's coming in? And then any thoughts relative to how that might accelerate next year in terms of that spread? Yes. Thanks, Rob. So actually, I think when we looked at the -- at the third quarter, free cash flow was in line with our expectations. And we basically -- and Matt alluded to it in his prepared remarks, when we think about cash flow, it's kind of the last piece of the transition coming out going from perpetual SaaS and subscription. We really hit first on the revenue acceleration in the transition. And then it moved, as you started to see during this year into the operating income, and we'll see more of that expansion going into next year. And when we think about cash flow, is the third piece of the puzzle and it's really because when we're thinking about that transition, we're dropping down from a perpetual sale, which also comes with a maintenance, one or multiple year contract that's all paid upfront, now going to either a SaaS or a subscription contract, which is being typically paid in a 1-year contract upfront.
So we are starting to -- we started to see the beginning pieces of it this year, but we see the real inflection as we go through the full renewals, and we are able to enjoy the SaaS subscription play instead of without the perpetual, we'll start to see the compare really go strong in next year and '24 and '25 and confident about the numbers that we've set out in our long-term targets. And then just just to emphasize, I think we set out guardrails that came in and basically, our guidance, which is cash flow in line with our net income margin is where we see it kind of playing out. So on the lower end of the guardrails, but within those guardrails for the rest of this year. And then I just want to reiterate what Josh said, which is we see an inflection point going into next year, and we're extremely confident in the cash flow targets that we put out there for the long-range model for 2025 and 2027. Nothing's changed there. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS. Great. Congrats on the quarter and again, echo thoughts on your employees and everybody in Israel. I wonder if you could talk about new logos. I think -- I apologize if I missed. I don't think I heard a new logo of disclosure, but I think for the past few quarters, you've talked about the fact that it's a tougher environment for that, but that the the customers you are landing bigger with the platform. It clearly sounds like that was the case in 3Q, but I love any thoughts on how you're thinking about new logo contribution is maybe around the corner into next year? Yes, sure. So I think we did mention it, but I'll mention again, which is we did about 230 new logos in the quarter. That is basically flat year-over-year. And as we've talked about, I think we're pretty actually excited by that number. We're continuing to be able to land new customers. It's remember, we're primarily serving either the enterprise or the upper end of the mid-market. And we've been able to successfully continue to land customers with PAM, increasingly with more than 1 product, 2 or more. We've landed customers this quarter with EPM and with access, and we see that business for us as really a great feeder system for our future growth, giving our land and expand motion.
I will also emphasize and I think you hinted at it in the call, we continue to see that the deal size of our new logos is increasing dramatically. And we actually are up well above our growth rate in terms of the overall size of the contribution of those new logos from a booking perspective. So we think this is a healthy new logo quarter in this environment. Certainly, it does have a little bit of a slower close rate because of the macros, but we're excited by the performance in the queue. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. And I also want to extend my support to all your family's friends in Israel. Josh, I'll hope to see you there next year. Look forward to it. Yes. Matt, maybe a question for you on a more high level. CISOs are dealing with a lot going into next year, you've got a rising threat environment. You've got these new SEC rules. Now they can be held personally liable for breaches. I'm curious, as customers think about their budgets for next year, what are you hearing for them? What is the priority level and what are the main concerns from CISOs right now, whether it be related to identity security or just more broadly? Yes, Hamzah. I think you captured it well. the job of a CISO is not an easy job. I spend a lot of my time with them. And they're stressed, impressed beyond belief as they try to figure out how to counter all of the factors that you described, both from the threat environment and from the regulations. I think when we talk, and we're having, again, really genuine, transparent conversations, they're trying to understand, as always, what are the priorities that are going to have the most amount of impact on risk. And they could do 800 things. So they could do everything that you could imagine, but they have to boil it down to the programs and projects that are going to make sure that they can answer to their Board why they're more risk reduced this year than the year before and so on.
And when they look at that, they really do inherently understand this concept that all roads lead to identity. And so everything they're thinking about is about locking down their overall posture around identity, identity security. Now you can do EDR on the endpoint to make sure that you're able to detect and respond to things that are coming in from the outside, and that's still a priority for our CISOs and for our customers. But when they're thinking about what can have the biggest impact, what can reduce risk the most. It's really their identity projects, which is why we see ourselves be prioritized. And why, as CECLs look towards their next year's budgets and we have those budget conversations obviously already started, they're prioritizing our spend into their overall budget plan, and we're talking with them about their road map, not just for the quarter we're in, but for the year or 2 years ahead.
And it is a journey to lock down identities and cover all identities, human and nonhuman to cover both on-prem and in the cloud. And so we see a road map that materializes over an 18, 24-month period that allows us to continually work with these customers to help protect them and secure them. And so it is actually a great bidirectional conversation that we're having, and we feel like we're at the top of the list. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. And [indiscernible] everyone's comments, our thoughts are with you. Matt, Josh had a couple of questions, Matt, to you. On the go-to-market side, where is your priority right now, expansion with existing customers given the massive growth in the portfolio and what you have to offer or going after new customers. Clearly, everyone would have had -- would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your sales force right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the 3-year mark of the real big shift in subscription. And so I'm kind of wondering if there -- there's a cohort of large customers that were on 3 or perhaps even 5-year contracts with you that are now coming for renewal, is there a risk that they -- not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted the cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they shift from 1 tool to another. Help me understand that transition. Why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step-downs? Sorry for the long question. No, no, it's good questions. And again, thanks for the support. On the go-to-market side, I think the answer is both, and let me now dig into that a little bit. So we believe that the sales team incredibly well equipped to do the upsell and cross-sell motion. We have deep relationships with our customers. We have the conversations that I was describing in the prior answer. And so our sales team is really empowered to focus most of their feet on the street motion to the cross-sell and upsell motion. At the same time, we've invested heavily in our marketing organization in both the demand gen programs, the brand campaigns, the ability to be able to ramp up more SDRs, sales development reps who are doing some of the cold calling and outbound calling.
All of that allows us to use the marketing engine to actually go generate the new logos and actually set up the meetings, get them qualified before we hand them over to the sales force. Then we get a sales team involved and obviously, they can help participate in moving it through the pipe. So we've kind of set up this really strong engine where everybody knows their role, marketing is primarily focused on making sure we drive new logos, building the pipeline for the future, making sure 2024 and 2025 are going to be incredibly successful.
And the sales team is out there leveraging their relationships to drive upsell and cross-sell. And then there's a third dynamic here on the go-to-market perspective, which is our partner organization, which mirrors us in that respect. And so by driving up our relationships with advisory firms with the MSP providers, with our traditional reselling partners, they're out there in the market, helping to push not only PAM, which is what we would have said 2 years ago, but the entire identity security story. And by that, we get exponential feet on the street who can drive our go-to-market motion.
And so all of that together is really how we're focused. We continue to layer in capacity to make sure we have enough direct sales capacity. We continue to layer in investment in certification and ramping up partners, and we spend money in marketing. And together, that's what's driving our go-to-market engine itself. And Ittai, as it relates again to the maintenance. So absolutely, we believe 2024 will be a larger number than what we've seen in reduction in 2023. But we think it's not going to be like a huge step down. And we're seeing that because conversion still today are only as we talked about earlier in the prepared remarks, there's still only a single-digit percentage of our ARR growth. We also have, obviously, a good view on our pipeline for where conversions are going and certainly in the next -- for the next 2 to 3 quarters. And we feel that, yes, we are going to have more conversions, and we have less perpetual. So that's why it's it's going to increase over 2023. But the good news about CyberArk, and you've been following us for a long time is that we actually are not a large deal dependent type company. We do a lot of -- we have a lot of large transactions, but we're very diversified across the world, across verticals, across deal sizes and so we don't see necessarily the floor dropping off on maintenance. And by the way, to the extent that it's as a result of moving to SaaS, it's actually still good for the business.
So SaaS dollars and SaaS deployments would be excellent for the business even as it moves more and more in that direction. So I think overall, we'll come back in February with maybe a tighter view on where we see 2024. But at this point, we're kind of seeing it along the lines of what we've seen in 2023 with a site with a continued increase on an annual basis for 2024. And just 1 add for me on top of what Josh said, which was strong and accurate was is this idea of what are we actually going to do with this base of maintenance paying customers. And Josh mentioned it, which is when we convert them, great, we get this really nice uplift, 3x uplift and they're expanding their footprint and they're buying more stuff. So I don't really want to force them through forced migration if they're not ready because I don't want to really miss out on that uplift. But a second really important point is it those customers who are still sitting on perpetual assets for their PAM solution are buying our newer solutions in a SaaS motion. So it's not stopping those customers from expanding their footprint with CyberArk with SaaS solutions, probably if that wasn't the case, we pushed them a little bit harder. But since the cross-sell and upsell can still happen into that base with our greatest SaaS products, I'm happy to leave them there until they're ready to move. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan JPMorgan. I'd also like to echo my support for your friends and colleagues in Israel. It's great to see the strong net new ARR growth as well as a large deal momentum. But maybe to follow up on the question that was just asked. Could you touch a bit on a mix of term in subscription ARR. And then strategically, as we track your progress towards your calendar '27 goals, are you seeing traction in opportunity down market as SaaS continues to gain traction on your platform? Or is SaaS going to be -- continue to be more of a, I guess, larger enterprise opportunity with the ability to drive easier and more cost-effective adoption? Yes. Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the support. I think when we think about the SaaS term-based license or subscription mix, it continues to be about 2/3, 1/3, and that's kind of held up throughout the transition. So I don't think we see a major shift in that at the moment. Obviously, as more and more of the pure new product sell, the SaaS number will tick up, but it's 2/3, 1/3 is good for modeling purposes. In terms of our ability to go down market, it's very clear when we go down market, that is a SaaS sell. In fact, the SaaS mix there would be well over 80% on SaaS offering actually probably looking a little higher than that when we're selling down market.
So we lead with SaaS, customers only want SaaS when we're going down into what we call our corporate market, which is customers that are about $500 million to $1.5 billion in annual revenue. That's our down market and for that market, they're adopting SaaS solutions. And we love it because it's a quick adoption and then a quick ability to be able to expand them over time. Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim. I'm sorry. This is John Diffuse for Ray McDonagh. At and Josh, I don't normally try to repeat what everyone else is saying, but it's important to just express our thoughts and prayers with your employees and the people. Guys, you continue to put up impressive top line momentum in an environment would, frankly, most aren't even in the Security segment. And we really appreciate the bottom line discipline.
But I have a question sort of following up Ittai's question on go-to-market. And it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of '23. It's very good reason because people have spent a lot on security throughout '23. Are you hearing this at all? And if so, are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into '24 at the end of the year? Or is budget getting pulled into '23 from '24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks. And again, thanks for the support. We really do appreciate it. So listen, I think when we look at our go-to-market environment, we continue to see actually strengthening. And we've talked about a strong environment for us to be able to execute -- our ability to execute throughout the whole year. And you heard me mention that in Q3, we saw it become even better for us. I think we talk about it in 2 lights. One is better for us in terms of the customers are more willing to spend their budgets and better for us in terms of the team is executing even more efficiently, more effectively within -- with our customers.
I would actually say we see a little bit of the opposite of what you're describing. We see budgets kind of firming up. We have good line of sight to those budgets, which goes into how we look at the year and frankly, how we think about next year. We also see deal sizes increasing, not going down. We saw close rates going up, not even staying flat, but going up. So our overall productivity goes up. We saw again another quarter of amazing pipeline build. A lot of that pipeline will come to realization in 2024, might not be in Q4 here. But -- so I think when we look at the environment, we talk to stressed out CISO, so stressed is the right word. But we see the fact that what we're working with them around is not a budget optional decision. It's where you want to spend money if you have any money at all. And I think that is what's driving our success, and it drives our outlook going forward. and it drives our confidence in the overall market that we're playing in, in the identity security market itself. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Sending my well wishes to you and the entire CyberArk family. Either for Matt or Josh, feel free to jump all this one. I wanted to get a sense of sales cycle trends within the new logo and expansion activity that you're very strongly executing on. And really, the spirit of the question is you've got a much more expanded portfolio. So how are you managing the extension of sales cycles that typically come with the sale of a broader portfolio. Yes. Thank you, and thanks for the support. I think we always have had enterprise grade is how I describe it, sales cycles. We've always had to sell over multiple quarters even when we were just selling PAM because it was a big program, and it was a significant sale. And so I think we're pretty used to longer sales cycles as we moved to a platform selling motion, broader portfolio. We haven't seen any real elongation in our overall sales cycle. On the flip side, we haven't seen it kind of really dramatically come down in its time lines, either even though we've moved to a SaaS sale, which traditionally might bring some of those sales cycles in.
So I think we're operating consistently with what we've always done, which is expansion sales cycles are shorter. New logo sales cycles take a little bit more time. In the early part of the year, especially in the Q1, as we talked about, sales cycles for new logos were a little bit longer. We've continued to see our ability to firm that up over time here. And so I think when we look at the Q3 performance as a whole, it's consistent with a firming up environment. And again, I know I say this a lot, but they're near and dear to my heart. Our go-to-market team continues to execute at just phenomenal rates to be able to make sure that they bring the deals in when they say they're going to bring the deals in. Your next question comes from the line of Junaid Siddiqui of Truist Securities. You highlighted secure cloud access that you just launched recently. I was just curious about some of the other new products that you launched that impact like Secure Browser. What's been a positive surprise to you in terms of how quickly they're being adopted by customers and contributing to growth? Sure. So on Secure Browser, we have not released that for general availability yet that will come out towards the end of this year here. We continue to have really, really strong conversations with customers about it, both has a more secure way of browsing and also as a front-end user interface for the identity security platform that we offer out into the market. And by the way, we see -- and you see it in some of the recent breaches, that the notion of session hijacking is 1 of the most risky new attack methods that's accelerating in the market and our Secure Browser, which allows for cookie list browsing really protects against session hijacking. But I would say on the browser front, way too early to comment in terms of -- it's not even out in the main market yet.
As we talk about secure cloud access, I get kind of unbridled enthusiasm here. And why is that? Because it's bringing the best of PAM, the best of the idea of privilege controls, session management, session isolation recording. It's bringing that to a brand-new population. And what we need to understand about the cloud security market overall that everybody is talking about is most of what's being done in the cloud security market is around posture management, it's around discovery, it's around visibility. It's because over time, as these developers have gotten so many extra privileges, people want to understand what's going on. It's the Wild West and that's a good first step, and there's a lot of really, really strong companies that are focusing in that area. We're unique in the cloud space in that we're not all that concerned about visibility and about discovery. Other people can do that. What we want to be able to do is lock down control in the cloud. We want to take all of these thousands of developers who have unfettered access to the AWS or Microsoft, cloud services, the platform itself. And we want to make sure that those users can still innovate, they can still build. They can still troubleshoot, but they have privileged controls applied when they're doing it. And we do it uniquely with this idea of 0 standing privilege so that the actual account of the developer, their account, Federated account has no privileges, for example, in the AWS console. So when it's sitting there on the side, it's secure. When they go to log into the console, that's when the privileges are applied just in time.
They're able to execute their work and then it's removed immediately as soon as they log out, and it's controlled with workflows with time-bound access. Now I went a little deeper there on that because I love the question, but I also went a little deeper there for people to understand the opportunity that arises for us as everybody thinks about cloud security, for us to bring what we do best, which is privileged controls, locking down access to this entire population that needs to be secured. And so that's really an exciting motion for us. We had some great wins actually in the quarter. still very tiny business. It's only 1 or 2 quarters in, but you can hear the optimism for me around this piece of our business as I'm describing our unique approach. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Awesome. And again, I'll come my thoughts about the entire Israeli team and the community of his [indiscernible] broadly. Real quickly on the government opportunity. So it was 8% mix of ARR in the quarter. Maybe just talk a little bit more about how federal played out in the quarter and how you think about government more broadly over the next 12 months? Thanks, Adam, and thanks for the support. Listen, I think when we -- and we've been talking about this for a little while here, right? We're very happy with our position within federal government here in the U.S., the global government where we see a lot of momentum even in the state and local government that falls up into our SLED business. What we see across the board is whereas in the past, a lot of the budget purchases were at the point of kind of year-end budget flush, we've seen because of the criticality of identity security that the actual purchases are much more spread out throughout the year. And they're coming in conjunction with need and actual deployment plans to get them into place. That actually is a much more exciting place for us to be in. It allows us to be able to have a thriving and healthy global government business all year around. And it allows us to be able to invest in the ability to bring new solutions to that customer population, including our investment in getting our EPM and identity and [ bring ] cloud into the Fed ramp process over time here, it's our ability to be able to actually expand beyond our strong PAM footprint in a lot of these agencies and accounts.
And so when we look at government, in fact, we highlighted a government account in the script that actually is outside of the U.S. But when we look at government, we see the threat landscape actually expanding on them exponentially even more than some of the private sector. and their recognition of the need for proper identity security solutions continues on. So we think there's a long runway of growth within the government sector. And we're really happy with our results from that perspective. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Colley of Stephens. And certainly like to echo my support as well for the team in Israel and the people more [indiscernible]. I'm curious if you saw any divergence and demand trends this quarter between the enterprise and mid-market segments of your business. We've heard some other cybersecurity companies said they started seeing some softness in the third quarter in the mid-market. So I'm wondering if that's something you saw materialize in any way. So we didn't see any change in that environment. I think we've talked about the idea that the mid-market is more affected by macros than the enterprise space. But we haven't seen any real change or diversion -- any change in that from that perspective. I think 1 of the things that we have to keep reminding everybody around and it's different than some of our other cybersecurity peers is that we're really not playing in the low end of the mid-market. And I know I said it a couple of minutes ago, but I'll say it again, our mid-market, what we call corporate customers are $500 million to $1.5 billion. CyberArk would be a mid-market account for CyberArk. And so I think those organizations, especially the ones in the upper end there kind of mirror in their behaviors, what we're seeing in the enterprise space, and that continues on in the third quarter. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Great. I'm rarely hear somebody talk about an ""amazing pipeline build"". And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the composite of that. How much of that is driven off of just simply the broader adoption of the platform existing customers and the like. Much of that is driven off of the the recent new product and technologies that were announced and the reaction from your trade show mid-summer. And the reason I ask the question is, obviously, with the 6-months plus sales cycle. I assume that, that mid-summer build might be helping visibility? Sure, sure. So listen, I think when we think about our pipeline, it's a little bit of check, check, check, all of the above. We see our pipeline being affected by the ability to be able to sell a much broader portfolio. And in fact, while the PAM pipeline continues to grow in a really nice way, and you saw that in our results this quarter, we see the solutions outside of PAM, they're growing at a faster rate. we see our access business continue to grow. Our secrets business continue to grow. As I mentioned, we see some nice pipeline build around our Secure Cloud Access, EPM continues to be a bright spot for us.
So we definitely see the kind of mix of the portfolio coming to play to help build the year-over-year growth rate in pipeline. And whenever I'm talking about pipeline, I'm always talking about year-over-year growth, not just an absolute number. Now in addition to all of that, we also see the way the pipeline getting built to be in a much more healthy manner. Meaning, if you rewind rewound a couple of years ago, all pipeline came from sales. And now we start to see actually that our routes of pipeline build, what's marketing-generated pipe, what's channel-generated pipe -- we see those starting to kick into high gear and that broadens our ability to have a better go-to-market engine. And so when you combine a broader portfolio that seems to resonate with customers, with broader routes to market that actually can build pipeline, that's how you end up in the situation that we've been in for several quarters where we've talked about our pipeline kind of building at a really strong rate. The events that we put on are wonderful, and we didn't just do the by the way, the event in last spring. We've been doing a world tour at '15, '17, whatever it is countries around the [indiscernible] track because we've been traveling so much. And each 1 helps us to tell the story and help customers understand why identity security is so important and why CyberArk, who they should choose. And that all goes together to put us in a healthy position as a company where we had a a really great quarter that we could talk to.
We were able to guide forward with the guidance we put out there, and we look towards next year with optimism. And for sure, we look towards our 2025 and 2027 targets with a strong degree of confidence in our ability to be able to go ahead. We've run out of time for questions. So I will now turn the call over to CEO, Matt Cohen for closing remarks. Thanks, everybody, and thanks again for everybody's support to us personally. It means the world I want to finish by where I started by saying our #1 priority is our employees, their health, their well-being. They've done such a tremendous job of working under these challenging conditions. And I'm really proud proud to be part of this company and work with such amazing people. We continue together to make sure we focus all together on our customers and securing them against the cyber threats that are out there. Thanks, and talk soon. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CyberArk Software Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Erica Smith, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Dennis. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's strong fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. With me on the call today are Matt Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the first quarter, full year 2024 and beyond. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to our website. CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call.
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Matt? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We had an amazing fourth quarter to round out a momentous year for CyberArk. Early in the year, we were nimble and adjusted our selling motion in light of the macroeconomic backdrop. And in the fourth quarter, it continued to pay off resulting in another great growth quarter. We entered 2024, a fully recurring revenue company with over 95% of our bookings coming from subscription. .
Demand for our Identity Security platform accelerated in 2023, and we end the year having solidified our leadership position in the market. We delivered a record-breaking fourth quarter, beating our guidance across all metrics. Subscription ARR reached $582 million, growing 60% year-over-year. Total AR reached $774 million, growing 36% year-over-year. We were thrilled to add record sequential net new subscription and total ARR and we exceeded our guidance range across revenue, operating income and EPS.
Total revenue growth accelerated to 32%, reaching $223 million. Non-GAAP operating income came in at approximately $35 million, and we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81. We also consistently outperformed throughout the year, and delivered total revenue of $752 million with growth accelerating to 27%, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $33 million or a 4% operating margin well above the breakeven we guided for at the beginning of 2023.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.12 and while we did not guide for cash flow, we were thrilled to generate $51 million in free cash flow or a 7% margin for the full year 2023. Our performance speaks volumes about our execution. We fine tuned our go-to-market motion, including platform selling, channel strategy and customer success. We improved the alignment between sales and marketing, generating record high-quality pipeline across all our solutions.
And lastly, R&D delivered against our mission to secure all identities with the right level of privileged controls to our groundbreaking identity security platform. In addition to strong execution, we're benefiting from durable demand trends driven by the proliferation of new identities, new environments and new attack methods. Throughout 2023, organizations were reminded yet again that there is one constant in cyber attacks. All roads lead to identity.
In the context of these urgent trends, the mission-critical nature of our platform becomes apparent. CyberArk is the only vendor with a platform that can effectively and securely address the new world security requirements, which center on controls. Given our groundbreaking innovation, and the changes in our business over the last few years, I'm going to break from our typical quarterly call cadence to outline how our identity security solutions are helping customers solve these challenges, which also speaks to the massive growth for CyberArk.
Every organization today has a spectrum of identities from core IT to developers to machines and across the entire workforce. And the number of identities is increasing at an exponential rate. Access for each of these identities has its own unique level of risk and complexity, requiring different levels of controls. Let me take you through this spectrum of identities and what we are seeing from customers and how that has expanded our addressable market.
A CyberArk customer typically starts with core privileged access management and is focused on securing standing access for IT users who have high levels of privileges like a database or application administrator or maybe a cloud operations team. As they deploy, they follow a road map that brings a growing number of users within central IT, but also third-party vendors and even shadow IT organizations under PAM security controls. As a result, there's a continuous expansion of the number of users leveraging PAM.
Adoption begins to accelerate when PAM is delivered as a service, given an easier adoption path and lower cost of ownership. It accelerates even further when we help customers tackle new use cases through revolutionary new access methods like just-in-time or dynamic access. Just-in-time access cuts the adoption curve down even further by allowing federated access to databases, cloud workloads and other modern targets, while also increasing the security controls by signing entitlements dynamically at the time of access.
The modern TAM program has evolved dramatically in the last few years and has opened up a significant expansion opportunity for CyberArk even within the extended IT organization. You see this in our healthy PAM ARR growth rates that have continued to persist. But moving beyond IT for a second, one of the fastest growing areas for human identities is the expanding developer community. Our Secure Cloud Access solution brings privileged controls to the cloud and has meaningfully expanded our TAM to include developers as well as engineering teams and data scientists.
We provide native access for developers with a zero standing privilege approach. This innovative solution greatly and measurably reduces risk and organizations can quickly go from dabbling in discovery to actual control of developers as they access their cloud environments. Always on entitlements to cloud environments are a security nightmare, yet innovation speed is the true promise of modern cloud programs.
Secure Cloud Access or SCA ensures that our customers never have to choose between security and innovation speed. While SCA is one of our newest offerings, we had a strong quarter in Q4, and pipeline continues to build. This is one of the areas we are most excited about as we enter 2024. But as these developers work in the cloud, they are focused on creating or extending applications, workloads and APIs that need access to critical data infrastructure and other cloud workloads. This results in the rise of machine identities.
Machine identities represent one of the riskiest and most complex components of the modern enterprise to protect these machines and the secrets that they use customers turn to our secrets management solution. Our secrets management solution securely and centrally manage secrets at enterprise scale, all while avoiding Vault sprawl. It satisfies the CISO's requirements while never impeding the developers' workflows, machine identities are exploding and our ability to bring together human and machine elevates the conversations with our customers.
As we think about our fourth quarter results, Secrets Manager was included in 6 of our top 10 deals, and we are pleased with the early success of Conjur Cloud. We have covered IT. We've covered developers and machines, but now I want to move on to the part of the enterprise that is in need of an entirely new approach to identity security, securing workforce identities. Legacy approaches of MFA and SSO are workforce requirements. But on their own, they provide limited security, evidence time and time again in major breaches.
Any identity can become privileged, causing CISOs to reconsider the way they secure the workforce. Leveraging intelligent privileged controls, CyberArk has reinvented workforce identity by building on top of traditional MFA and SSO with market-leading innovations like Secure Web sessions, Workforce Password Manager, and CyberArk Secure Browser. When combined with MFA and SSO into one unified solution we have created a more holistic and comprehensive approach to securing the workforce, where intelligent Privilege controls once again are making the enterprise more secure. This approach is paying off and we had a record fourth quarter for our workforce solutions.
It's worth pausing for a moment to discuss our CyberArk Secure Browser. Our Secure Browser is built with native integrations to all of our workforce capabilities, and will help customers protect against one of the fastest rising attack methods, which is cookie harvesting and browser-based attacks. It's also built to be the gateway to all our solutions, allowing easy access to all enterprise targets and providing a seamless user experience to our entire Identity Security platform.
Our workforce solutions, however, do not stop there. The modern workforce logs into desktops, laptops and servers every day as part of their regular workflow. These endpoints need their own form of intelligent Privilege controls. Endpoint Privilege Manager or EPM, is seamlessly integrated with our workforce solutions and our Browser as well. We are doing this to implement lease privilege and secure the endpoint. Lease privilege access is a foundational security control. Every endpoint needs EPM to be truly secured.
Despite the great growth over the last few years, we still have a tremendous opportunity within our installed base to further cross-sell EPM. And we also see EPM as a strong landing spot for new logos. As we kick off 2024, I wanted to make sure our investors understood how we are setting the pace of innovation, how our solutions work together and how our identity security platform delivers value by dynamically adjusting the level of controls based upon complexity and risk. We are delivering a game changer in the market. We are driving operational efficiency and at the same time, focusing on Privileged controls that help customers to save from cyber threats and move their business forward.
If we move back into the fourth quarter for a second. On the new business side, we signed about 340 new logos in the fourth quarter. As customers prioritize in-depth security controls in this severe threat landscape, new logos are increasingly landed with 2 or more solutions. In fact, in Q4, a number of our largest new customers landed with 5 or more solutions, contributing to the significant increase in new business deal sizes.
A few of the new logo highlights in the quarter include as the education sector continues to be targeted by bad actors, evolving practices to align with industry-leading security controls are top of mind. This quarter, the London School of Economics, a leading business school globally was looking to significantly and measurably improve its security posture. In this new logo win, they went broad across the platform with PAM, EPM and Secrets Management.
In an example of the power of our ecosystem, a partner introduced a Fortune 100 financial services customer to CyberArk. This all SaaS 7-figure ACV deal was closed through the AWS Marketplace. We are thrilled to see this customer applying a CyberArk everywhere approach out of the gate securing Privileged access, Secrets, Endpoint, third-party vendors and workforce identities. Our focus on moving from land into expand motion is built into our platform strategy and is contributing to our outperformance.
A few examples of expansion deals from the quarter include a government agency that landed with CyberArk last quarter, returned this quarter for more users and more products across our platform, buying PAM, EPM, Secrets, Identity Flows, Identity Compliance, Secure Web session and a 7-figure ACV deal. A major Fortune 100 U.S. retailer chose CyberArk as their trusted strategic adviser in 2020, looking for defense and depth, they are consolidating spend with CyberArk. And in another 7-figure ACV deal extended their protection with more Privileged users, Secrets Management, workforce and customer identity, remote access and secure cloud access.
To summarize, all the land and expand deals demonstrate that every vertical, every business across all sizes have identity security challenges that our platform can help address. Touching briefly on profitability, throughout the year, we demonstrated leverage in our business with each operating expense line improving as a percent of revenue. For the year, we grew revenue over 27% while our non-GAAP operating expenses grew just over 15%. We are striking the right balance between investing in growth and innovation and driving profitability and cash flow.
With our stellar performance in 2023 and the strong guidance you will hear from Josh in just a few minutes, I remain very confident in the long-term targets we have set. As we look ahead, our top priorities for 2024 are expanding our leadership position in driving identity security growth, delivering cutting-edge innovation and strengthening our industry-leading platform, leveraging data and analytics to scale our business, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning and delivering outstanding customer experience and value across the customer journey.
I'm also very excited to welcome Eduarda Camacho as our Chief Operating Officer. I have worked closely with her for more than 20 years and have tremendous respect for her and her ability to drive customer outcomes and to lead our go-to-market strategy and field execution. I also want to thank Chris Kelly for his contribution to CyberArk. He'll stay with CyberArk through the end of March to ensure a seamless transition, and we wish him well for the future.
We are in a position of strength as the leader in identity security and our competitive position is incredibly strong. We are addressing a critical customer need with our platform and the threat landscape is keeping Identity Security a top priority at our customers. As I reflect on our accomplishments in 2023, I am even more enthusiastic about CyberArk's future coming into 2024. I did want to pause here to talk about October 7 and how we responded. I am so very proud of our global team and how they team together after the October 7 [ mass attack ]. As families, friends, colleagues and entire communities continue to navigate through great tragedy, loss and increased stress, our culture and team are what drive our success.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will discuss our record financial results and provide you with our outlook for 2024 in more detail. Thanks, Matt. We posted outstanding results in the fourth quarter and beat our guidance across all metrics. Total revenue growth accelerated again this quarter to 32%, coming in at a record $223.1 million and significantly exceeding our guidance. Our Identity Security platform continues to drive momentum of upsell, cross-sell and new logos. This allowed us to meet the strategic financial objectives we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year, durable top line growth, improved operating leverage and strong free cash flow generation.
Demonstrating the continued momentum in our business, ARR reached $774 million at year-end, growing 36% year-on-year and coming in above the high end of our guidance range. The subscription portion increased 60% and reached $582 million and is now 75% of total ARR. We added a record $78 million in net new subscription ARR as customers are consolidating on CyberArk and continue to land and expand with more of our platform. In addition, we had a record quarter for SaaS bookings, both in absolute dollars and mix of our bookings. Compared to year-end 2022, we added an impressive $218 million of net new subscription ARR, also a record.
The maintenance portion of annual recurring revenue declined slightly to $192 million at December 31, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to see strong renewal rates and like-for-like conversion activities still only represents a single-digit percent of our year-on-year ARR growth. Our strong execution is also demonstrated by the 30% increase in customers with more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to over 1,700 at the end of the fourth quarter. The cohort of customers with more than $500,000 in ARR also grew over 45% to now being nearly 300 customers.
The biggest driver of this cohort is the upsell of additional users and cross-sell of new solutions across the platform. Matt touched upon our strong execution, and I wanted to briefly touch on the macro. Our solutions continue to be prioritized and budgets allocated, close rates remain strong, productivity improved and deals progressed nicely as we converted our pipeline, including several 7-figure ACV deals. We continue as well to build a strong new pipeline to support our future growth.
Moving into the details of the revenue lines for the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue reached $201.5 million, again, making up 90% of total revenue. That's compared to 84% in the fourth quarter last year. Recurring revenue growth accelerated to 41% year-on-year, showing the momentum in our SaaS portfolio continues to gain steam. With total subscription bookings mix of 95% on the full year and our recurring revenue reaching 90% of the total in each of the quarters of 2023, it is safe to say we are now a fully recurring revenue company.
Digging into the specifics, our subscription revenue line reached $150.3 million with growth accelerating to 70% year-on-year and representing 67% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Our maintenance and professional services revenue was $64.8 million. Of that, $51.2 million coming from recurring maintenance and with professional services revenue at $13.6 million for the quarter. Geographically, each of our major territories grew revenue faster than 30% in the fourth quarter. The Americas revenue was $130.3 million, that's growing 31% year-on-year, and the Americas had a record with SaaS reaching over 70% of bookings in the quarter.
EMEA grew by 33% year-on-year to $68.7 million in revenue and APJ grew by 35% to $24.1 million in revenue. Diversification has always been a foundation of our strategy, and it is great to see the strength across all of our geographies in the fourth quarter. We also see that universal strength reflected in the full year with the Americas, EMEA and APJ each growing 27% year-on-year. All line items of the P&L now will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $189.7 million. That's an 85% gross margin compared to the 83% in the fourth quarter last year. The expansion of our gross margin is due to revenue outperformance and tight management of our cloud costs. Our operating income of $34.7 million significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance. Our operating leverage was driven by disciplined investments and our revenue outperformance. Net income came in at $38.1 million, that's $0.81 per diluted share, also significantly outperforming our guidance.
Moving on to review the full year 2023. We began the year expecting 29% growth in ARR, 23% revenue growth and hitting breakeven operating margin. We finished a great year. ARR grew 36%, revenue came in at $752 million, with growth accelerating now to 27% and we returned to meaningful profitability, delivering non-GAAP operating income of $33.5 million or about 4% operating margin for the full year, and we continue to march towards Rule of 40. Our EPS came in at $1.12 per diluted share.
We ended December with approximately 3,000 employees worldwide, including over 1,320 in sales and marketing. For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $51.3 million or a 7% free cash flow margin. As a reminder, we still consider free cash flow to be the last piece of our model to inflect after the subscription transition, and we are confident that we are just at the beginning of this expansion with our 2023 results. Turning to our guidance.
For the first quarter and the full year 2024, our guidance reflects the momentum we're seeing in the business, combined with our confidence to meet the 2024 priorities that Matt outlined earlier. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $209 million to $215 million which represents 31% year-on-year growth at the midpoint, and we expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $7.5 million to $12.5 million for the first quarter. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to range from $0.21 to $0.31 per diluted share.
Our guidance assumes 47.8 million weighted average diluted shares and about $10.5 million in taxes. For the full year 2024, we expect total revenue in a range of $920 million to $930 million, representing 23% growth year-on-year at the midpoint of the range. Reflecting our continued commitment to operating leverage, we expect our full year operating income now to be in the range of $75.5 million to $84.5 million. We expect our EPS to be between $1.63 to $1.81 per diluted share, we expect about 48 million weighted average diluted shares and about $46.5 million in taxes for the full year 2024.
We expect annual recurring revenue to be between $968 million and $983 million at December 31, 2024, or about 26% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We are also issuing guidance for free cash flow for the first time and expect free cash flow to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million for the full year 2024, and we remain confident about the long-term target that we outlined at Investor Day. I also want to provide a few pointers to help model our expenses for the year. While we expect to continue to invest in our innovation engine and in sales and marketing in absolute dollars, we do expect to see an improvement in both line items as a percentage of revenue.
We will once again hold our impact customer event and our IMPACT World Tour in the second quarter in 2024 begin our IMPACT World Tour in the second quarter of 2024, increasing our marketing expenses for that quarter. Our CapEx is expected to be 1.5% of total revenue. So to sum up, we are thrilled to deliver another stellar quarter and amazing full year results showing continued demand for our platform. The execution of our land and expand motion and durable tailwinds that have made identity security a must have. As a recurring revenue company and the leader in Identity Security, CyberArk is well positioned to drive leverage in our model across all areas, and deliver the expanded profitability and cash flow levels in 2024 I just discussed. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Matt, maybe to start with you. I'd love to dig into your prepared remarks on the workforce or single sign on market, very helpful, by the way, prepared remarks. The question is, given some of the noise in that market competitively, how do you think CyberArk is positioned? And what are you seeing in the pipeline there for just the broader identity platform? Does that make sense? It does, and it's a great question. And I think the first thing I would say is independent of the competitive environment and some of the things that are happening there, we feel really strongly, as I kind of outlined that our approach to workforce security is differentiated that is actually unique in the market. And that -- while MFA and SSO as I said in the prepared remarks, are important. You must have them. They're no longer sufficient for how you actually cover the workforce from an identity security perspective.
And so our notion of a holistic or a unified solution that brings together but also brings in our workforce password management, our layers of security that sit within secure web sessions and the browser as the access point, actually, for us, kind of reinvent that space and puts us in a place where we can take some of the -- what we would consider kind of legacy approaches that are out there in the market. and put them on their heels in terms of our ability to have a conversation there. Then when you connect that back to the identity security platform and the idea that you can actually manage those users in the same way or at the same time as you do your highly Privileged users, it takes a differentiation even further.
So we feel like we're in kind of entering a sweet spot in terms of our ability to compete in that market. We see it building in our pipeline. And certainly, the competitive atmos out there for us hasn't really ever been better than we're seeing right now as we go into 2024. Got it. Got it, very clear. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. Great to see the free cash flow inflect this year, and I appreciate the guide. And I know it's early to talk about that metric beyond 2024. But maybe anecdotally, what are some of the puts and takes for free cash flow beyond 2024 structurally that you want us to think about with that metric? Yes. Thanks, Saket. I think it's mostly around puts as we think about the next couple of years, and it's really the expanding leverage that we're getting in the operating income that we're seeing at each of the years on our road to Rule of 40. And then, of course, it's the flywheel effect that we are going to increasingly get this year.
And then again in 2025, which is really reflecting the renewals, the full-blown renewals of having already gone through round tripping the SaaS and subscription bookings that we built up in the last couple of years. And so that gives us the strong confidence that we're on track to hitting our medium goals there. Your next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Thank you. Congrats on results and guidance. Matt, let me also echo my congrats on those kind of well prepared remarks, taking us through a customer journey as it pertains to CyberArk's expanding platform. maybe building on that journey. You just put out a press release on Indiana University Hospital, expanding relation with CyberArk maybe a good opportunity here to share with us what is it that they're doing with CyberArk on top of their core PAM deployment? And where else can they expand with you guys in the coming years? And I have a follow-up? Yes. Thanks, Shaul, and thanks for the comments on the remarks. And what I really do want to do is help everybody understand the full market opportunity that's before us as we go after the spectrum of identities, and we kind of move beyond where people have traditionally thought of us, which is in IT, it just opens up such a remarkable opportunity for us to expand as we cover the overall enterprise. When we think about that particular customer example, it's a good indicator of what we see the board when a customer starts to partake of our SaaS platform. It kind of fits the bill, if you will, of the descriptions that I was walking everybody through.
And the idea here is the more solutions people get started on the more identities they can start to bring into the platform. But even when customers like that get started with multiple solutions, there's such an expansion opportunity as we build out the longer-term road map for them as they bring on more identities. I think a good way to think about the market for us is every proliferation of identity, whether it be human or nonhuman or machine equals another point for us here at CyberArk, another area that we can secure. And so if you take a customer like that, that's also sitting in health care, that's definitely under attack day in and day out by ransomware and other really kind of terrible threats they can expand for years to come as we start to help them bring all aspects of their enterprise all their identities into the platform.
So it's a great example actually for us and health care certainly is a vertical that we see exploding for us in the coming years. Got it. Got it. And for my next question, either you or Josh, a macro-driven one. I haven't heard you mentioning the term elongated sales cycle. I think maybe you're like amongst a handful of companies implying, stabilizing or a better than period stabilizing macro environment rather than alluding to elongated sales cycle. Why is that? Are things actually becoming better and you guys, unlike other companies are not covering your behind them as kind of adding those elongated sales cycle commentary? Yes, I'll take that one. And it is something that we're particularly both proud of and excited about. And throughout the whole year, you've heard us kind of talk about that, which is -- listen, it is a tough macro. There is no question about it. When I talk with my colleagues and talk to the C-suite at our customers, they're living through tough budget cycles. That being said, everybody has money to spend on what's most important. And generally speaking, cyber is more important than the rest of the kind of tech stack. But within cyber, there are areas that actually are prioritized.
And we've been lucky to be one of those areas throughout the year, where when customers are putting together their budgets, they don't have the luxury of really avoiding spending on Identity Security and when they're going to spend, they're going to spend with us. And so that opens the door, if you will, for a much more fertile ground for us to go harvest in within our customer base and even out into the broader market. Now what we also are, as I said, proud about is that we actually adjusted our execution arm to make sure that we were checking the extra boxes.
We trained the team early on to bring the CFO into the discussion to make sure the Joshes of the world were actually part of the discussion early. Don't avoid them. Bring them in so they understand the value statement. We help them understand how to structure deals more appropriately for these macros. And so between the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the phenomenal execution of our teams, we've been able to navigate a tough macro throughout the year but do it much more effectively.
Now I would say we start to see some shoring up of those macros as we get towards the back half of the year here as we look forward. So that's encouraging for us as we look out. But generally speaking, I think it is a testament to the role of Identity Security and the security stack today. Your next question is from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citigroup. Matt, just to start with you, talked a lot about the momentum you're seeing with the new customers coming into the CyberArk installed base family and landing with multiple solutions. But what I wanted to peek your brain on is we're now essentially going to anniversary between's mark yout of when you did the massive  SaaS transition. So I'd love any high-level commentary from you on potential wave or renewal cycle name could look like in terms of buying behavior and patterns. >And then I have a quick follow-up for Josh, please.? Yes. So great question. I think what we see, first of all, is that as we go out and we are landing these logos that the time to next purchase continues to compress. So we can land somebody into Q1, and we can get a follow-on deal in Q3. or Q4. And so even before we get to the first anniversary of a renewal date, we're able to drive the land and expand motion. And to be honest, that's one of the things that gets us most excited because the flywheel of the sales process continues to accelerate.
Now that being said, as you mentioned, all of these contracts as they start to come up for renewal also creates a compelling event for an expansion play. And we think of that as a prime opportunity to not only upsell on the existing suite they have, but to introduce the new solutions and to cross-sell into the base. And we see that kind of sales methodology change kind of kick in more and more over the last couple of quarters, where we're actually enabling our sales team on the conversation of -- it's a different conversation at the point of renewal of just understanding what have they consumed, read the telemetry, get the upsell in there because that's a basic motion you should be able to do always.
And then understand through adoption curves and road maps that we've seen with other customers, what's the next best solution to introduce and make sure it's part of the renewal cycle when the wallet is already open. And again, that's something that the sales team has really improved at the -- becoming more profession and we'll continue to improve that as they become even more proficient in this SaaS selling motion. I appreciate that. Josh, on a related matter, as we work through the maturation, if you will, of the base as it relates to converting some of your customers on the predecessor perpetual form factors and you get any prior customers sitting on perpetual maintenance. I'm curious if you can help characterize what proportion of ARR growth is going to be coming from simply converting the prio-perpetual maintenance customer and customers? And any impact that had in this quarter to growth . Yes. Thanks, Fatima. I think as we look at conversions and we go back already a whole bunch of quarters into '23 and even into '22. We're still seeing it really reflecting single digits, mid-single digits of our ARR growth coming from conversions. I think as we look into 2024, We're not really changing that view. We think it should behave similarly to what we saw in '23 and already at the end '22. And I'll just add on top of that, just one element from a strategy perspective, if you will, which is -- when you analyze this base of customers and you try to understand, okay, what's their buying patterns, the first thing you're looking at is while they're still on maintenance, are they buying other solutions? Is there any less expansion that we're seeing in that base versus the rest of the base? And the answer was yes.
Then you're really wanting to push them as hard and fast as possible to get them to move because otherwise, you're gated yourself on your expansion in those accounts. When we actually analyze the maintenance paying base, their expansion sales, the rate at which they're buying the new solutions is not that much different than people who are sitting in a subscription model or on the SaaS platform. And so that gives us a little bit more leeway to be flexible with that customer base to keep them happy on that self-hosted or perpetual product and move when they're ready and in fact, move them to SaaS when they're ready, not move them over to an on-prem subscription because when we move them to SaaS, the upsell is significantly higher.
So strategically, as Josh said, I don't think you're going to see us be that aggressive in 2025. I think you'll see customers start to migrate because their own plans call for SaaS. But we're really excited by our ability to be able to drive NRR out of any base that we have. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Matt, when you speak to the full identity market opportunity, what are your thoughts around IGA? Is it an IGA light approach? Or is it something that you're going to look to dive into more fully? Rob, great question. And I think we still see fundamentally that the siloed nature of PAM access and is at the detriment of customers in their security posture. And that organizations that implement kind of in that silo are not taking the most robust security posture that they can. So we increasingly focusing in on adding to our identity management stack and being able to manage the modern IGA workflows that sit out there in combination with our SEA solution, even in combination with our PAM customer base.
And so I think you'll see us continue to invest in that. Now again, if somebody needs to go and do a large-scale IGA deployment across all legacy assets that sit in the data center, we have a great partnership with SailPoint and we're fine with SailPoint taking that bigger business. But as you move these workloads to the cloud, as you move into a modern real estate, we increasingly believe that in order to win that we need a hybrid approach.
And every solution that we bring to market from this point forward, and the team knows they hear from me all the time, has to have components of governance, components of access and components of privilege controls, that is what makes us unique. That's what makes our platform unique. And I think you'll hear us talking more about that in the days to come. Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Congratulations on the strong results and guidance. Yes, I just wanted to understood a little bit more about your secure cloud access product. And what is going to give us some additional detail on how big of an opportunity you think this could become? Thanks, Jonathan, and thanks for asking about my little favorite area here, so he gave me a chance to pontificate a little bit about it. But listen, we believe fundamentally that the idea here in the cloud that customers have moved fast and for good reason into their cloud real estate. And as they moved, they granted unfettered access to all of these users out there in the developer community in order to facilitate speed. And that leads to a world of over entitlement and frankly, lack of control.
Now we have a lot of vendors out there that really look at discovery and trying to understand what that cloud real estate looks like, even presenting ways of managing posture and managing the overall cloud environment. And we think that's important, by the way, and we partner with some of them to make sure that we can tap into the great data that they're able to harvest. But ultimately, like the on-prem world, security comes back to control.
And so our [ SCA ] solution is built on the idea that you need to have the same levels, the same concepts of control in your cloud estate as you did on-prem. You need to make sure that you're actually isolating sessions. You need to make sure that you understand and controlling entitlements, you need to actually make sure that there is the ability to be able to record, especially in audited industries. And so our SCA solution takes all the principles of PAM. But then what it does, it says, actually, in that environment, you don't need standing access. You can actually have entitlements or privileges assigned at the point of access.
So a cloud user, a developer can use their federated access, their personal accounts, they can log into the cloud console, they can start to work in the cloud services, and we can apply the right level of entitlements and privileges right at that time for a period of time. And the minute they log out, we can remove those entitlements so that when that account is sitting inactive, it is actually a 0 Privileged account, and we can drive a least privileged approach. We believe, fundamentally, and as you can hear, I get excited when I talk about it, that moving into this control area of the cloud is an underrepresented piece of the market. It's not actually represented in the TAMs of all these other cloud security vendors that are out there and that we're uniquely positioned to actually capitalize on that.
So while it's early days, and while we're a couple of quarters into the market, I would tell you that at our enterprise accounts, the numbers of conversations that are actually leading with, how do we secure our cloud is remarkable to me, and that then sets up a long-term TAM for us in this area that I believe can be a meaningful -- significantly meaningful contribution to our ARR growth. Your next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. A few questions. The first one is, can you take us through a journey of a client? You spoke a lot about it, the journey of a client from a point of view of synergy with existing customers. I'm assuming that customers first land with the PAM. What happens when they want to go to different products? Where is the synergy? Is there any synergy in terms of products or sales motion or management, et cetera. What's the incentive for them to continue with you with your other products?  Let's take it one by one. . Sure. So I think when we think about that synergy or we think about that expand motion, if you will, it really depends on the priorities of the organization, and I'll give you like 2 different examples. You might be sitting in an organization where they have invested heavily in their nonhuman identities and their machines and their ability to build out a modern application environment. And in that case, if that's the priority of the organization, it's the most likely next step from someone who secures IT and their PAM users to actually move over and secure the nonhuman identities.
And the synergy is, hey, we can take a least privileged approach, we can help them understand how to create these controls that I'm talking about but we can do it in a developer friendly or a native way, especially with our Secrets Hub product and our easy to deploy Conjur Cloud product. And so you see some customers where that might be the first path they go towards expansion. An alternative is you might be sitting in an area of high attacks around ransomware. And you might be health care, it might be financial services. And in those areas, okay, they've locked down their core controls and IT. Now they need to secure their end points. They need to secure their servers.
And the natural extension is to move into EPM. And in that case, that's the next expand motion for that customer. And then there's a third type of customer, to be honest, that actually buys a little bit of everything, and they start to deploy in pockets in different work groups, in different areas of the enterprise, and then they look to upsell or expand over time within a broader set of 3, 4 or 5 solutions. So the other way to answer the question is there is no one typical pattern the underlying element though that drives the success is a unified platform with single shared services, a unified audit an ability to be able to run identity across all of that.
The ability to run threat analytics across all of that. And so the idea being these customers, although they're not fully consolidating day 1 across the platform, they're future-proofed in terms of the consolidation aims they have for the longer term. I think there was another question. And in these cases, do you replace an existing vendor? Or is it kind of a greenfield where you bring new features to areas where there's no such features You have to compete with a legacy vendor or an existing vendor that is already there? Yes. I think, again, it depends. When you move into access in general, we're competing with something that's there. In a lot of cases, it's legacy and it's things that are outdated and not ready for the modern stack. When you move into EPM, sometimes it's greenfield, actually, the concept of lease privilege on the endpoint is a new concept for them. And they're sitting with their endpoints unprotected, maybe just having invested in EDR or XDR, but not understanding yet the power of the EPM agent.
When you move into the secret space, generally speaking, they're working at the work group level, maybe they're using some open source tools. At the work group level, but now they're trying to make an enterprise buy. So you're replacing or you're sitting on top of that open source or for example, you're sitting on top of the cloud services providers and the native secret stores. In the cloud space, for sure, you're going in greenfield, this idea of control and the developer themselves, that's something that's new.
So I took you around really quickly there, the real estate, but I think that represents the kind of things that we see out there in the market. Your next question is from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Matt, I thought it was very interesting you talked a lot about new identities in your prepared remarks. How do you see the potential for copilot accounts to maybe act as a tailwind to either PAM or just the broader identity market is organizations pilot to secure what feels like a pretty big wave of incremental credentials that's about to hit the market? Yes, Josh, it's a really good question, and it speaks to the larger point, which is any identity needs the level of identity security, right? And we believe that we can bring all of them into our platform. So if we take the co-pilot example, it's almost like a hybrid of a human identity and a machine identity all in one. With, generally speaking, granted large swaths of privilege that mirror the human machine that it's meant to augment or in some cases, replace.
And so as AI technology kind of takes off, it creates a lot of vectors for growth. It creates vectors as we kind of compete our bat against the attack vectors fueled by AI. It allows us to be able to build AI into our products to make them more effective, to make them better able to secure environment. And then also is the tools themselves that need to be secured. And co-pilot is a great example of that where we're going to end up with multiple new identities.
And we're going to need to secure it just as if it was a new developer coming on or if it's a new member of the workforce coming on and I think that speaks to the market we're in, where if you're in the identity security market, the number of identities is your market and any increase is a good thing. Your next question is from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Sorry about that. I had 1 question around distribution for Matt. It seems like you're going after a really broad opportunity in the prepared remarks were really helpful. I'm curious how you plan to continue to improve on the sales velocity to go from 9,000, 10,000, 20,000 customers over time? Or do you feel like there's more opportunity still within the installed base, and that's going to be driving the majority of growth going forward? Yes. Hamza, thanks for the question. And I wanted to highlight the opportunity within the base because I think it's important that everybody understands how the expansion happens, but you can get me equally excited about our ability to be able to go and grab new logos. And if you were talking with our wonderful CMO, he walks around with a new logo T-shirt on every day because that's what he's going off and trying to drive for us and build up that channel.
Now as you said, it's not just about what we do direct. It's about our channel partners in that space. We have the best channel partners in the world, whether it's the CSIs. You heard an example of where one of them was able to bring us into a Fortune 100 account this quarter, whether it's the reselling partners that are out there that are increasingly turning their attention to driving new logos or if it's an area which I'm even more excited about, which is the MSP programs.
And as you start to embed your entire platform into the MSPs and you start to be able to have them represent you within their vast customer base, even in the enterprise and down market, that becomes a flywheel of its own in terms of the ability to be able to go after new logos and to be able to go after new logos with all of the product set. So I do think you're hitting on a key point here, which is the channel and the force multiplying effect of our channel is a critical ingredient of driving the productivity growth that we want to see, and we continue to want to see more productivity and then also our ability to be able to get outside of our base and really capture this opportunity in the broader market. Your next question is from the line of Ray McDonough with Guggenheim Securities. Maybe one for Matt, if I could get a follow-up for Josh after. But Matt, I wanted to follow up on your answer to Hamza's question around the MSP opportunity. What specifically are you doing to enable the channel from a product perspective to help them -- help you attack that market? And then how much of the demand and the need for cyber insurance plays into the roll down market and what those MSPs can help you achieve in terms of penetration? Yes. Great follow-up by the way. And I think there is investments in the product to make it serve the MSP market better. We've got a whole wing of product management that's actually just thinking about the MSP market and what needs to happen. And some of that we've built and some of it is still being built.
The idea of easier reporting, the ability of easier way to manage tenancy within the platform. The idea of even on the finance side, which is in the product, but in the organization to be able to bill more effectively and more flexibly. All these things are part of our MSP program holistically. We think of it as a market for us, and we run it like that where we're tracking the contribution and what do we need to do throughout the entire parts of CyberArk concluding product to serve that market.
And so I think that's one of the big shifts we've made in the last 18 months is to think of it that way. It's not just a little bit of an offshoot of the channel partner program. It's its own thing. I think to your point, there is intersections all the time between the growth drivers of our business. On one end, you've got cyber insurance with absolutely in the lower end of the enterprise and in the mid-market, is a driver of people towards PAM, towards Identity Security. It's a factor in whether somebody can get cyber insurance.
And by the way, it's a factor in what their premium would look like. Then those companies are looking for an easy way to procure it. They might be procuring it, by the way, not even only through MSPs, they might be procuring it through their AWS marketplace and leveraging some of those lubricated routes to market. But in addition then, MSPs can manage the whole system for them obscuring them from any of the complexity and make sure that they're able to stand it up quickly and meet the cyber insurance requirements.
And we could take any one of the tailwinds that we talk about and routes to market that we talk about, and there's always that juxtaposition and the one you're picking on is a particularly nice one for us as we move forward. This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to the CEO, Matt Cohen for any closing remarks. So thank you to everybody. I want to finish up here by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication. It's only because of them that we're able to talk about the success we had in 2023 and our optimism for the future. I want to thank our customers and partners for their support and partnership.
And personally, I also want to thank Udi for his mentorship and support over the last year. I look forward to continuing to partner with him on the long-term strategy in his role as Executive Chair. But personally, I have a big thank you to him to add into the talk track here.
With that being said, we look forward to seeing you all and talking to you all real soon. Take care. This concludes the CyberArk Software Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2024 CyberArk Software Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
I would now like to turn the call over to Erica Smith, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Kath. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's strong first quarter 2024 financial results. With me on the call today are Matt Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the second quarter full year 2024 and beyond.
Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website.
We expressly disclaim any application or undertaking to release publicly any statements or revisions to any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the Investor Relations section.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Matt? Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. I want to start by acknowledging CyberArk's 25th anniversary, which we celebrated just a few weeks ago. Udi Mokady, Cyberark's Founder and Executive Chair is a visionary who, along with the founding team, identified a market need and fit out to secure the most valuable information within the world's most complex global organizations.
Along the way, CyberArk pioneered the privileged access management market, a segment of identity that has become a critical security layer and consistently moved up the CISO's priority list. Since its founding, CyberArk has grown and evolved in many ways. Our success was driven by an unwavering commitment to our mission of securing the world against cyber threats. So together, we can move fearlessly forward. To execute our mission, we consistently delivered a cutting-edge innovation and transformative value to all our customers. Perhaps most importantly, in a world of constantly escalating threats. We have been relentlessly focused on the security first mindset in every decision we make since day 1 of our founding.
As a result of our strong execution and the trust that our security first mindset has created with customers and partners, 25 years later, we are broadly recognized as the leader in identity security. Today, our unique value proposition to secure all identities with the right level of privileged controls on our identity security platform is resonating with customers.
I am confident that we are only scratching the surface of this large and rapidly growing market opportunity. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate that we built on the momentum we experienced throughout 2023. The durability of demand for our solutions and our execution is highlighted by subscription ARR of $621 million, growing 54% year-over-year. Total ARR of $811 million, growing 34% year-over-year. And Q1 results significantly exceeded guidance across revenue, operating income and EPS.
Total revenue growth accelerated to 37%, reaching approximately $222 million. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $33 million, a big improvement from a loss of $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, highlighting the operating live beverage in our business model. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.75, up significantly from a loss of $0.17 in the year ago period. We are thrilled to report $67 million in free cash flow for the quarter significantly up from $4 million in Q1 of last year and a proof point of our commitment to profitable growth.
The strength of our results and business momentum gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the full year 2024 on all metrics, which Josh will talk about later. Our ongoing success is fueled by a number of secular tailwinds, including the pace of attacker innovation, digital transformation, ongoing migration to the cloud and exponential increases in human and machine identities. Identity is the common denominator in every major cybersecurity breach. Our research has shown that over 90% of organizations have suffered from an identity-related cyber attack, a significant increase from about 60% in the prior year.
Last quarter, we discussed the extensive security challenges faced by CIOs and CISOs and safeguarding the entire spectrum of identities across IT, developers, workforce and machines. In today's severe threat landscape, customers recognize that merely managing identities without privileged security controls is a risk they cannot afford. The security risks are further exasperated by the rise of AI proliferation of machine identities and increased elevation of access for human identities.
As a result, organizations need to undergo a paradigm shift in identity security. They can no longer rely on yesterday's solutions and approaches to address today's problems. We at CyberArk are helping customers secure all identities, human and machine as they access all environments, including hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Our differentiation comes from our deep domain expertise and privileged access and retailer privileged controls for each identity group to mitigate risk effectively.
We discover, secure and manage across the entire life cycle of each identity group. We are the vendor best positioned to apply comprehensive intelligent privilege controls across standing access, just-in-time access and a zero standing privilege approach, all from a unified identity security platform. Our land and expand motion and the subscription flywheel continues to gain momentum. It all begins with new logos, and we signed nearly 200 customers in the first quarter. While the majority of customers land with PAM, approximately half of these new logos bought two or more solutions with many choosing to secure multiple identity groups from day 1. This speaks volumes about the power of our platform and the importance of identity security.
A few exciting new logo examples from the quarter included a deal that perfectly showcases our platform selling motion and new routes to market, which was a financial services company that landed with PAM, EPM for workstations and servers, Conjur Cloud and identity flows in a large 7-figure ACV deal that closed to the Azure marketplace. The PAM market has evolved well beyond securing only high-risk IT personnel. Today, modern PAM programs protect a much broader group of privileged users, including developers, shadow IT and database and cloud administrators.
As an example, we have a great customer -- we have great customers in the government and healthcare verticals. And this quarter, we are excited about our new relationship with NHS resolution. A body of the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care. They kicked off their relationship with CyberArk with Privilege Cloud and Secure Cloud access and are planning to grow their footprint in the future. Each workforce identity is more powerful today than ever and traditional MFA and SSO solutions are easily circumvented. We reimagined workforce identity by wrapping MFA and SSO with more controls to our secure web sessions, workforce password manager, EPM and our new secure browser.
This quarter, a large logistics company, pick CyberArk for PAM and workforce identity after a head-to-head competition with a leading IDAS vendor. Our best-in-class security and breadth of our platform were the deciding factors in winning this amazing new logo. Our customer base is also an important growth vector for CyberArk and our platform selling motion is accelerating expansion deals. Overall, we had a strong quarter of expansion within our base across all our solutions with particular strength in our sequence management business.
The world of securing machine identities is changing rapidly. Organizations are grappling with a larger variety and an ever-growing number of machines from applications to bots to workloads to IoT devices. Each one of these machines needs to be secured and managed across the life cycle of multiple identity components from secrets to digital keys to certificates. The proliferation of AI is further accelerating the growth and complexity of machine identities. This is becoming a top security challenge. Traditionally, managing machines often sits outside the security teams remit of control.
However, this practice exponentially increases risk and is unsustainable in today's threat landscape. Customers increasingly realize they need to scale their machine identity security programs beyond local vaults, loosely enforced policies and open source tools. They need an enterprise-ready machine identity security approach that can scale and is tied into their human identity security program through a single platform.
One great win that exhibited all I am describing was with a CyberArk customer who has been with us since 2018. We expanded our long-standing relationship with the Department for Work and Pensions in the U.K. with an expanded program while kicking off a robust secrets management program. With CyberArk as a key strategic partner, they are focused on aligning their identity security road map for human and machine identities supporting the U.K. government's focus on a stronger cybersecurity posture.
We talked earlier about how we are protecting the workforce using a reimagined approach that goes beyond SSO and MFA. And for this approach, it needs to extend also to the endpoint, the most common entry point for attackers. By removing local administration rights and enforcing lease privilege and detecting identity-based threats targeting the workstations and servers, organizations can reduce the endpoint attack surface. This strategy also protects organizations from attackers who turn off EDR agents and proceed quietly without being detected, which is one of the main reasons a multinational food company in Latam signed a high 6-figure ACV EPM deal in the first quarter. This customer is looking to deploy CyberArk everywhere as part of its broader identity strategy.
During the past few years, EPM experienced strong growth and recently surpassed $100 million in ARR. This achievement is a testament to the solution's ability to extend adenine security and zero trust to workstations and servers. We are excited about the potential for further growth in our EPM business, both with new and existing customers. We also talked though about the exploding population of developers and the need to start securing them as privilege identities without interfering with their speed of innovation.
Our Secure Cloud Access solution or SCA, provides best-in-class privileged controls to hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It applies the principle of least privilege access by granting just in our permissions with zero standing privileges while still allowing developers, data scientists and cloud engineers to work natively and efficiently without having to change their preferred workflows.
We are incredibly excited about the solution. And in the first quarter, we continue to see excellent traction with the offering. And a deal with a major retailer, the customer broadly deployed CyberArk SaaS solutions and a continued move to the cloud, but they cited secure cloud access as the most important differentiator and signed a high 6-figure ACV deal that also include Privilege Cloud, secrets and workforce identity.
Q1 was an exciting quarter for our focus on innovation and new releases. Last year, we discussed our plans to expand our routes to market and increase our market reach through MSPs. According to Gartner, 40% of security customers are expected to consume solutions to a managed service by 2026. To accelerate this channel, we recently launched the CyberArk MSP console. By providing MSPs with a single command center, this console is a key step in helping our MSP partners build managed services that secure their customers' human and nonhuman identities. We are also very excited about the general availability of CyberArk Secure Browser, the industry's first identity-centric secure browser. It is purpose built for a cloud-first world and protects our customers against emerging threats while enabling productivity and ease of use across all CyberArk solutions.
Secure Browser is designed to help protect customers from fast-growing attack methods like cookie harvesting and browser-based attacks, both at and beyond [ Logan ]. It is natively integrated with our workforce solutions, providing a seamless unified user experience and serves also as a direct access portal to our entire platform. We believe Secure Browser will not only enhance security for our customers, but also drive adoption of our solutions.
Lastly, CyberArk has recently received FedRAMP high authorization for two of its SaaS solutions, Endpoint Privilege Manager and workforce identity. Our investment in FedRAMP High highlights CyberArk's commitment to help the public sector implement strategies that adhere to zero trust principles and move to a more secure and efficient future. As excited as I am to talk about all these great developments, I'm even more excited by what we have in store for our customers and all of you at impact in Nashville in just a few weeks.
We have a tremendous lineup of truly innovative developments to talk about. So please tune in, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. Josh will go deep deeper into the P&L in just a moment, but I wanted to emphasize that although most of my comments this morning focused on the potential for tremendous growth, we remain equally committed to delivering profitability and cash flow. This was evident in our Q1 results, and we remain well on track to deliver on the long-term targets we introduced last year.
In summary, our momentum from 2023 continued in the first quarter, and we kicked off the year with a strong first quarter. I will leave you with four main takeaways. First, demand for our solutions remain strong, and identity security is at the top of CISO's priority list.
Second, our unified identity security platform is meeting a clear customer requirement to apply the right level of privileged controls to every identity, human and machine. Third, our security-first approach is a clear differentiator for CyberArk in the market, helping us win deals. And fourth, we have a long runway for growth and are making disciplined investments to capture a bigger share of a large and growing market opportunity.
Josh, I'll turn the call over to you. Thanks, Matt. Q1, another strong quarter for CyberArk. We exceeded expectations across all of our guided metrics. We reported strong ARR and revenue growth drove significant operating margin expansion and generated healthy free cash flow. Our strong results highlight the durability of demand for our solutions, the ongoing adoption of our broader identity security platform and the power of our business model as we scale.
Moving into the results. Total revenue growth accelerated to 37% year-on-year, reaching $221.6 million and significantly exceeding the top end of our guidance demonstrating the continued momentum in our business, ARR reached $811 million, that's growing 34% year-on-year. We added $37 million in net new ARR, and that's compared to the $34 million in the first quarter of last year. Subscription ARR grew 54% and reached $621 million and is now 77% of total annual recurring revenue. Maintenance ARR was $190 million and like-for-like conversion activity still represents about a single digit of our year-on-year growth. Our strategy of upselling and cross-selling new solutions has been a significant factor in our strong growth.
This is demonstrated by the fact that at the end of the first quarter, the cohort of customers with an ARR of more than $100,000, grew to over 1,780 customers and for the cohort of more than $500,000 ARR, they grew to over 300 customers.
Now moving into the details of the revenue lines. For the first quarter, recurring revenue reached $205.8 million, growing 41% year-on-year and accounted for 93% of total revenue. That's compared to 90% in the first quarter last year. Subscription revenue was $156.2 million, growing 69% year-on-year and representing 71% of total revenue, while the primary driver of our outperformance was bookings, we did experience an increase in average contract duration on our self-hosted subscription deals relative to our guidance.
Maintenance and services revenue was $62.4 million. Of that, recurring maintenance revenue was $49.6 million. Our maintenance renewal rates remained strong and in line with historic levels. Professional services revenue was $12.8 million. From a geographic perspective, all regions showed healthy growth, Americas revenue was $124.5 million, growing 27% year-on-year. EMEA revenue was $74 million, up 59% year-on-year, partly benefiting from our bookings and the longer duration that I spoke about earlier. APJ revenue was $23 million, growing 37% year-on-year.
Moving to the P&L, all line items will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release. First quarter gross profit was $185.7 million or 83.8% gross margin compared to 81.3% in the first quarter last year. The expansion of our gross margin, primarily driven by revenue outperformance. In the first quarter, our operating income was $33 million. The operating income outperformance was driven by three main factors: the revenue outperformance, the timing of certain marketing-related expenses that we now expect to incur in the second quarter, and three, we did experience a slower hiring pace, particularly in R&D.
Net income came in at $35 million or $0.75 per diluted share, also significantly outperforming our guidance. We ended March with 3,070 employees worldwide including approximately 1,300 in sales and marketing. We continue to see healthy growth in our quota-carrying sales reps, particularly our fully ramped ones. We were thrilled to deliver strong cash flow of free cash flow, $66.8 million in the quarter. While we do not guide to cash flow quarterly, I would remind investors that cash flow is seasonally stronger for us in the first quarter and particularly this year, the strong cash flow is partly a function of strong bookings and renewals in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the remainder of the year, we expect cash flow to follow typical seasonal patterns that's lower in the second and third quarters and an uptick from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.
Turning now to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $215 million to $221 million, which represents 24% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We do expect SaaS to make up a bigger portion of our overall subscription mix in the second quarter, impacting recognized revenue in period. We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $12 million to $17 million for the second quarter. As a reminder, we will hold our Impact customer events in a couple of weeks, and our Impact World Tour will also begin in June increasing our planned marketing expenses for the quarter. We are also seeing a stronger hiring pace, which is reflected in our guidance.
We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.44 per diluted share. Our guidance also assumes 48.1 million weighted average diluted shares and about $10.2 million in taxes. For the full year 2024, we are increasing guidance across all our metrics. We now expect total revenue in the range of $928 million to $938 million, representing 24% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. And as we look at our pipeline for the remainder of the year, SaaS continues to lead the way. Reflecting our continued commitment to driving operating leverage, we are increasing our full year operating income to a range of $90.5 million to $99.5 million.
We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the -- between $1.88 to $2.07 per diluted share we expect about 48.1 million weighted average diluted shares and about $51 million in taxes for the full year of 2024. We are also raising our annual recurring revenue now to be in the range of $975 million and $990 million at December 31 or about 27% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We are significantly also increasing our free cash flow guidance for the full year 2024 to now being in the range of $115 million to $125 million.
To sum up, we are thrilled to kick off 2024 with another strong quarter of results. Demand for our solution is robust, our platform delivers tremendous value and identity security remains a business imperative. We believe we are well positioned to execute on our targets. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Matt, maybe just to start with you. particularly in the wake of some M&A out there, right, particularly IBM and Hashi, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the backdrop here competitively. And since there were so many multiproduct kind of examples on the call, maybe you could touch on that in terms of PAM and also broader identity. I know you spend a lot of time with customers. So just kind of curious what you're seeing competitively. Yes, it's a great question, Saket. And I think what we see is the continued evolution competitive environment where our platform begins to put us sleep kind of heads and shoulders above everybody else that's out there. We are consistently able to tell the story of the spectrum of identity groups and our ability to bring more than one identity, more than just IT onto our platform. That to differentiate us from the traditional PAM competitors that are out there that aren't really able to deliver on that message.
So that starts to differentiate us in the PAM space and allows us to be able to continue to take share. Then when you start to look at our broader identity story, it brings us into spaces like we talk about access. And you hear me emphasize that a lot, which is in the world of commoditized MFA SSO isn't that much difference between vendors that are out there, but the ability to be able to wrap privilege controls on top of an MFA SSO solution, ours or somebody else's allows us to be able to start talking about how do we bring workforce identities back into our overall identity security platform.
And we see that strongly in some of the examples that I shared. The final piece, which you kind of hit on we were putting together our talk track for this earnings on our secret story well before the Hashi acquisition by the IBM acquisition of Hashi. We had a really strong secrets quarter. And we've been talking about the momentum building, not only in the products that we've had out for a while, but especially in our Conjur Cloud and Secret Hub and SaaS first solutions. And it really is this pivot where security is getting involved and wants to have an enterprise scalable approach to how you secure machine identities.
And what we've seen in the prior quarters and especially in this quarter, is that those deals are starting to pick up and actually also increase in size as customers want to put in place the enterprise backbone. So back to the point of hand, we've been feeling good about our competitive posture against Hashi as it's become more of an enterprise scale sale and a security sale. The disruption of IBM buying them how IBM is viewed in the market. I think it will just lean in to our ability to be able to capture that market around secrets and machine identity security. Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Josh, if I can ask one follow-up for you. I think the part of -- I mean, great to see all the guidance metrics go up, but the one that really stood out to me was the increase in the free cash flow guide. As I think back historically, I think we've talked about sort of a bigger subscription renewal pipeline that maybe would renew at higher incremental margins. Is that sort of the biggest driver for raising at this point of the year? Or is it something else? And maybe on that point, where are sort of in that renewal flywheel for subscription -- sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense? Yes, Saket, and thanks for asking. I mean, first of all, obviously, we had a great first quarter on cash flow. It was based off of coming off of a really strong year and particularly Q4 and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you start to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of -- the last part of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow.
And of course, we were able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So overall, it reports a stellar cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the -- at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raised all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz.  with Mizuho. Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain very low across the industry, and quite honestly, you've been within your own installed base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases, in other cases, just a belief that having an AVR solution might be enough. But is there anything that CyberArk can do that you think can perhaps further accelerate the adoption curve going forward? Yes, Gregg. So you know how we feel about EPM. And I think you've heard us talk about the idea that the core security control that really can protect the endpoint against breach. And our feeling is even stronger in this threat and landscape in this threat environment, that you need an EPM agent installed at the endpoint. You need it on your servers. You needed to protect your EDR investment and ultimately, you needed to secure the endpoint.
Now I think what we have really come to the conclusion on is you're right. It's a little bit of education still required in the market to explain that EPM isn't just about removing local admin rights. It's about implementing the least privileged workflow. It's about application control, and it's really about protecting ransomware. And so I think what we're trying to understand and do as a company is start to embed the EPM value prop into each one of those human identity groups that I've been describing. Build it deeper and tighter into the workflow of SSO and MFA.
Again, ours or anybody else's, make sure that developers workstation start with an EPM control installed. And then obviously, our bread and butter within securing IT, make sure that everyone understands that EDR is really not enough. Where you saw initial real success in EPM was in highly attacked and highly regulated industries. And those big enterprises have been buying EPM for years. And I think we need to take it beyond industries and make sure that everybody can understand the value prop that I just described.
So final point here is we're continuing to invest not only in the integration and the solutions, but frankly, also in the go-to-market talent to be able to complement our sellers out there to tell the story a little bit richer and deeper as I started to describe on the call. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. I just want to follow up on a question from Gregg on EPM. I think obviously, $100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent TAM for you guys. But I guess, any plans to maybe evaluate go-to-market? And do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of legacy or best-of-breed ER solutions and would love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM, what does the profile of customers tend to look like, maybe the size of the customer, go sophistication, are they more identity focused? Or do you see that endpoint demand also driving the demand for EPM? Thanks, Brian. So I think, first and foremost, as I was hitting on with Gregg, I think we believe that it's a necessary component to actually double down in our marketing organization and in our go-to-market organizations to increase our ability to be able to tell the story in the market, especially outside of the larger enterprises, which is an answer to one of your questions, which adopted the fastest.
I think people with organizations with a security first mindset that understood the threat landscape, they got started on EPM a little bit earlier. And they understood from day 1 that an EDR tool doesn't do the same thing. And in fact, they're very complementary. I think as we've started to expand further and penetrate as we built that $100 million business, we started to see industries like health care and manufacturing start to take off because those, again, are areas that are constantly under attack. You can almost map to the threat environment and the ransomware threat particularly in those industries and those verticals are really the ones that have really started to accelerate and help us with building the momentum around the product.
I think when we talk about the opportunity ahead, it's really about, one, making it more seamlessly integrated into our overall portfolio and then enabling and investing in the overlay and marketing capacity to make the story clearer. And then finally, it is about this idea of -- how do we make sure that we take the lessons learned from the big industries and bring it down market to other customers to help them understand why this is -- which be, am I using a, the security control that they should get started with. It's an interesting thing. And some of the less mature markets, let's flip over to places like the state and local governments, see EPM as being the landing spot. It's actually areas where they get started because they understand they can put in place a core security control very fast.
It's a SaaS-based product, easy to adopt, and they can lock down a privilege pathway at the endpoint. So I think, again, we're learning the approach. We're driving significant upside in the business through EPM and I expect that business to continue to build and grow for us in the quarters ahead. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. I wanted to ask on net new subscription ARR, which was flat from a year-over-year perspective. And I wanted to ask a question, I guess, from the perspective of just security spending and environment overall. And within that, if you could parse maybe what you're seeing geographically or enterprise versus SMB, that would be helpful. Thanks, Rob. So overall, we had a strong quarter, our ability to be able to continue to drive momentum in the market. You've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite and elevating the conversation up to the identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards to their auditors and at the top of the list is identity security.
So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple of quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about $2 million or so of renewals basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and as close sense. And that would have made the net new ARR look a little bit better. It then is demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi Group. Matt, in your prepared remarks, you shared a lot of anecdotes about customers who are increasingly landing with a higher incidence of products across the portfolio. So when I internalize this as manifesting and maybe increased wallet share. Can you talk to us a little bit about the expansion rates and the in the dollar-based retention rates that you're realizing in the portfolio? And specifically in contrast to maybe some of the newer logo activity that relative to more recent a little bit slower. So just that compare contrast between the momentum and the size and scope of the momentum within the installed base versus the new logo activity in the quarter. Yes, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. we have more than [ 8,080 ] worldwide, these customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM into workforce into secrets into our Secure Cloud access. It's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have.
And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is our clear differentiation is the spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privileged controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come.
From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, any time we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1. And we've always said that in this macro, in this environment, new logo deals are -- take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos. The ones we just landed and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo with Jefferies.
Mr. Joseph Gallo, your line is open. Can you hear me? I'm sorry, somehow my headset was not working. Thanks for the question. Awesome to see the cash flow machine turn on. It was impressive operating margin performance this quarter and the guidance, although the full year raise was modestly less than the beat. Can you just walk us through the dynamics for this year? Is that primarily rev mix shift I think you mentioned head count growth, but moderating. So just any other investments we should think through given the 34% ARR growth is highly indicative of a large opportunity. Yes. I'll start here. I mean, basically, we're excited that we'll be able to -- that we're raising the metrics across all boards from cash flow through the operating -- through the revenue through the operating. In terms of color on that, we do expect SaaS to be a bigger player on the revenue side as we go into Q2 and into the second half.
With regard to the investments, we're catching up on some hiring on the slower hiring from Q1 and we anticipate to continue hiring into the second half as well. And so that's where we'll see some of the investment side in R&D and also, of course, in the go-to-market engine as we always like to pre-hire when we look at multiple years of growth. I think from -- I don't -- from another perspective, in terms of the mix, we see the mix continuing on other than the fact that we see it kind of inching up towards some more SaaS business. And maybe just one add for me is when we look back on Q1, and we talked, as Josh just said, about a little bit of a slower hiring profile. We've seen that kind of kick in solidly here in April. And so that actually brings up the anticipation of expense, and that's built into our guidance going forward. One of the nice things for me, despite the lower higher in Q1 is when I actually look at the quota carriers, which is what we really are investing in to make sure that we capture the opportunity.
We had a nice quarter around ramping up quota carriers, especially fully ramped quota carriers. And that sets us up to be able to go capture the opportunity here throughout the year. As the year goes on, we'll look for more opportunity to be able to capture on this exciting growth opportunity ahead of us. Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Josh, actually a question for you on the guidance. I actually thought the guidance raise was better than expected in light of what we're seeing, I think, in software more broadly. I'm curious, it's Q1, it tends to be the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, and it's early in the year. So what's giving you confidence to raise that ARR guide by the magnitude that you did, given what's still somewhat uncertain macro environment? Yes. Thanks, Hamza. I think it really starts with the demand environment that Matt talked a lot about already in the earlier questions and in his prepared remarks and that's kind of generating the pipeline coverage and the demand generation that we're seeing for the course of the rest of the year. And I think the other point is we're well positioned from a go-to-market team and engine.
Matt just alluded to the fact that we're about where we are on quota reps and quota carriers. And just pretty much everything that we see coming out of Q1 coming -- first of all, coming out of Q4 and then what we saw in Q1 and what we're seeing in the pipeline going forward and the overall demand environment that we're getting from the customer base, we're confident on being able to raise the guidance across those metrics. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Awesome.Maybe just on the cloud, it's great to see the continued traction with Secure Cloud Access. And as we think about kind of the cloud opportunity more broadly, we often hear about either [ Kim  or ITDR. I was hoping you could talk more about how you think about these adjacent cloud identity security markets as opportunities for CyberArk over time? Yes. Thanks, Adam. So we are -- and you've all heard me talk about this opportunity of how we secure access to the cloud. And just to start with, that goes across of the identity groups that I was describing. The traditional IT users are increasingly having to access not only on-prem targets, but also cloud assets and cloud environments. And we need a -- what would be considered a traditional PAM tool that's able to actually manage those hybrid environments effectively or secure those hybrid environments effectively.
And so our ability to be able to take SCA and blend it in within our identity security platform, is a key component part of actually how we're staying ahead in securing IT users. Then there is this new population of developers out there. And these developers are hired at an exponential rate. And generally speaking, they're higher to go innovate. And once they start innovating, they're scaling up cloud environments, they have [indiscernible] not sustainable and organizations are understanding that they need to put in place controls in the cloud.
So our SCA solution, which allows for zero standing privilege, which is a unique approach. No privileges are assigned until the point of access allows us to be able to go in and talk to customers about securing that developer population, allowing them to use native tools and applying security controls at the point of access. So that's a way of building up then to your question, which is, all right, what is the differentiation here? And how do these other markets play in?
When you start to think about CIM, when you start to think even about IT, it's about really understanding or discovering what's going on. It's even, in some cases, about mapping entitlements versus targets. And we have a place to play in those areas. But the major place we play at CyberArk is an enforcement and in controls. And ultimately, once you discover, once you understand you have to control and our SCA solution is a light touch, easy to deploy security first tool we can apply for controlling privilege access and privilege access specifically as people try to access the cloud. So that's just a little bit more background on it. I think it's an opportunity for us to be able to differentiate this cloud access market from some of the other areas that you were describing. And of course, our ability to be able to bring that into the overall platform is what sets us apart. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS Securities. Great. I do want to go back to Joe's question just on the guide. But regarding the duration tailwind that you've seen term license over the past 2 quarters, any color on what's driving that higher? And Josh, can you just clarify what you're expecting from a duration perspective throughout the rest of the year and how that might be impacting the different updates to the revenue and ARR guidance? Yes. I don't think that there was any one -- there wasn't a trend of it driving higher. I think we saw, though in the first quarter, it go up by a few months, and it contributed about just about $3.5 million in tailwind on the revenue side for the quarter. And I think when we look at it kind of over time and kind of as we look into the pipeline, we kind of see it dropping down again by a couple of months, but it's going to move around between the 20 and the 23-month range. I think the bigger point on the look forward really is this idea that Josh hit on earlier around what do we see in the mix when we look into Q2, Q3 and Q4. And when I analyze the pipeline, which unfortunately I still do, [indiscernible] and I have great sessions around that. We try to understand what is it shaping up. And with all of our new products coming into play, which are SaaS only, and then where the market is moving, we see the mix of SaaS really stepping up in the quarter and in the out quarters for the year. Now we've taken that into account in our guide. And even with that, we've been able to raise our revenue outlook for the year. But it is a pretty substantial shift in our pipe towards SaaS. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. I want to talk about the U.S. federal market. You mentioned you have FedRAMP high status for EPM and PAM now. I guess first, how is demand in the quarter? And then second, has that FedRAMP high status opened up a larger pipeline with new agencies that you can now sell to? And are they also purchasing SaaS or more on-prem? Yes. So I think when we think about our FedRAMP, let me first clarify, what we announced was FedRAMP High for EPM and for our identity products. And why did we start there, by the way, versus starting with PAM. It was because we only have SaaS versions of those products. So in order to even be able to sell into the federal government with Identity and with EPM, we needed to be FedRAMP. We believe in the market opportunity. That's why we went and did the heavy lift process, not just to get through FedRAMP but to get to FedRAMP High. That opens up not just the civilian side, of the federal market, but also the DoD side and frankly also helps us at the state level with the state side of the government organization.
We are very bullish and optimistic of our ability to bring EPM and identity into those markets. Now we have an existing book of business with PAM on-prem that we've had for many years. We have invested in the on-prem certifications. We now are investing as well in PAM FedRAMP certification, and we'll get to that in the time ahead. But in the meantime, we believe that one of the biggest industries or verticals that are being attacked is the government. It's being attacked at the federal level it's being attacked at the state level. And our ability to be able to institute core security controls like I'm describing, lock down the end points have a bigger version of -- or bigger story of identity beyond MFA SSO, allows us to be able to capture a bigger piece of the market in the federal space, which we've done well successfully so far in our history, but we think it's an opportunity for investment and growth in the quarters and years ahead. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. I have two questions, maybe I'll insert them all at once. First for you, Josh, on the booking, can you just give us a little bit more color there on how much of that duration, new customers, expansion activity stronger than you expected, the mix of products there? Any color would be great. And Matt, going back to the point you mentioned to the question of complementary EPM being complementary to EDR. It is complementary today. But clearly, more and more of your portfolio right now is at the edge. I would think the browser. I think about that as an edge product as well. And so as you're moving closer and closer to the edge, can your EPM product evolve into an EDR-like product and be competitive with an EDR solution? Sure. And I may take both just in the interest of time to move us along, but the questions. So on the first front, when we look at the bookings performance in the quarter, remember, bookings has nothing to do with duration. So the duration just wanted to be transparent. It was a bump up in the quarter. It's about $3.5 million of contribution around revenue. But it's not a contributing factor to the strength of our overall business. The strength of our overall business is based upon continued growth across the entire portfolio.
We continue to see ARR just grow really strongly for each piece of the platform. Now I highlighted in the call kind of particular strength in the secrets management business, and I'm very excited by that because that, again, is showing our ability to compete effectively as a security sale in the machine identity space. So I would highlight that. I would also highlight, as we talked about earlier, our ability to be able to go back into the base and expand customers beyond PAM or securing IT into new areas like securing developers or our ability to be able to go compete effectively in the quarter around workforce and our differentiated workforce solution. So across the board, I can point to the entire portfolio, talk about strong bookings and that kind of comes from that overall approach. Remind me again of the second question? EPM into EDR. So on the EPM side, I think we are very comfortable with our definition of identity security. Our definition for these four different identity groups, our ability to be able to be the control point and our ability to be able to apply privileged controls across those. And just like I think that EPM is a complement to EDR. I'm very respectful of the EDR businesses that are out there. I go to customers, and I tell them all the time, yes, they ask me, should I spend money on next-gen EDR and I say, yes. It's a good security control to have in place. And a lot of them have the right security first mindset and how they approach it.
But I think there's plenty of space for us to carve out with the least privilege and privileged control side of the end point. And by the way, when you talk about our browser, you're talking about the same thing, the idea of an identity-centric security control-focused browser that can integrate into our identity security platform. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us without having to go into the larger EDR market. Your next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari with Baird. Matt, the follow-up on the secular browser GA looks very timely. As you said, [indiscernible] the growing demand for [indiscernible] market and designed to go beyond just the [indiscernible] harvesting and browser products. One, this comment you made was you believe the browser will not only enhance security but also drive adoption of all the other solutions I know it's still early days, but the market seems to be moving quite fast. So just curious, are you already kind of seeing signs or the browser is seeing differentiated becoming a landing point and driving demand for other solutions? And then just a quick follow-up on Azure. Sure. So I think just to ground everybody in the release, So when you go into the CyberArk secure browser, you are able to, obviously, from a security control perspective, browse freely with a cookieless browsing with password replacement with other security controls built right in, and it's designed for the privileged users to be able to get to other targets within the enterprise much, much more securely.
And it kind of locks down and stops one of the most important or most difficult attacks to be able to protect against, which is post-session authentication hijacking. So we look at it and we pitch it from that perspective, and it is a really nice security story. But underneath that, it is really a gateway and an easy navigation into our identity security platform. When you go into the browser, you're presented with a copilot that allows you to be able to access your single sign-on tiles.
It allows you to be able to access your infrastructure targets, traditional targets for PAM users. You can go and write from the browser right from the main screen, you can get into your cloud service providers' portals into the back-end micro services. and you can actually do things right in the browser that you would normally have to go into the back-end platform to go do.
So that creates a much easier path for users and administrators to be able to leverage and use the platform effectively. So when we look and we talk with customers and all the customers that have been using the product when it was in limited release, they start to see this improved pathway of usage, removing the friction of user access in the PAM space and allowing for total integration into our workforce tools. Got it. So very helpful, Matt. And just quickly on the Azure marketplace. You mentioned about a sound [indiscernible] deal that you guys kind of won aligned with PAM EPM and kind of flow through this new route to market. Can you talk a bit about go-to-market motion and kind of any sense about the relative size or mix or incremental trends around this marketplace motion? Sure. And I think you've heard us talk in the prior quarters about the idea of -- we believe that one of the upside opportunities for us is to continue to exploit new routes to market. You've heard us talk about that in the context of the MSP program, the launch of our MSP console, our ability to be able to actually leverage new channel partners go down market with distributors, continue to push on our SI partnership and our SI relationship.
So you see, overall, we're investing in enabling and building stronger partnerships. One of those new routes to market is our marketplace. And you've heard us talk about the AWS relationship that we've built and continue to drive on to allow for frictionless buying to leverage the AWS sales force and then to be able to be part of the dollars that sit out there for marketplace purchases. And it's been a great lubrication in the sales cycle. In this quarter, we highlighted the deal that you mentioned, which went through the Azure marketplace. We're earlier days from that perspective for sure. but it speaks to the overall marketplace opportunity as a buying vehicle and as a co-sell motion that can help drive our business forward. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Matt Cohen for closing remarks. Thank you. And I want to go back as we celebrate our 25th anniversary to think about the fact that CyberArk is laser focused on driving innovation and delivering value to our customers. An achievement we owe to the hard work and dedication of over 3,000 CyberArkers today as well as our partners around the world.
We are in an amazing vision as the leading identity security company that is built to last and thrive for at least another 25 years. We look forward to welcoming many of you at our impact customer event in just over 2 weeks. Thanks for joining the call today. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Sri Anantha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review CyberArk's second quarter 2024 financial results. With me on the call today are Matt Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer; and Josh Siegel, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made on the call today may be considered forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on currently available information. I refer specifically to the discussion of our expectations and beliefs regarding our projected results of operations for the third quarter, full-year 2024 and beyond. I also refer to our expectations and beliefs regarding our proposed acquisition of Venafi.
Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. I direct your attention to the risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and those referenced in today's press release that are posted to CyberArk's website.
CyberArk expressly disclaims any application or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements made herein. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also available in today's press release as well as in an updated investor presentation that outlines the financial discussion in today's call. A webcast of today's call is also available on our website in the IR section.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Cohen. Thanks, Sri, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We started the year with a clear vision and strategy to strengthen our position as the identity security company. In the second quarter, we executed against this strategy exceptionally and our results exceeded expectations with momentum continuing to build across all aspects of our business. After a strong first half of the year and with our proposed acquisition of Venafi in the second half on track, we are well positioned to extend our leadership across all identity use cases. with our industry-leading platform and solutions.
More of that later, but first, a few highlights from our strong second quarter. Net new subscription ARR was $56 million. That's a record outside of our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Subscription ARR of $677 million grew 50% and year-over-year. Total ARR of $868 million grew 33% year-over-year, and our Q2 results significantly exceeded guidance across revenue, operating income and EPS. We delivered record total revenue of $224.7 million, growing 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $23.7 million, highlighting the operating leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.54, and we are pleased to report $41.7 million in free cash flow or a 19% free cash flow margin for the quarter, another proof point of the subscription flywheel effect and the power of our business model. 
We are incredibly proud to be among an elite class of software companies that delivered faster than 30% ARR growth, increased net new ARR year-over-year and drove meaningful upside in profitability and free cash flow. That's a testament to our relentless focus on driving profitable growth. Our expanded position as the leader in identity security, and the unique value proposition of our unified identity security platform, solving clear and present needs for the CISOs around the world. 
The strength of our results and business momentum gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the full-year 2024 on all metrics, which Josh will discuss later.
Today, CISOs recognize that traditional methods of secure and identity no longer work. Three forces, new identities, new environments and new attack methods are fundamentally redefining the market. The modern enterprise has to secure four different types of identities or personas with each one  having unique challenges and levels of complexity.
The four groups are workforce, IT, developers, and machines. These identity groups are increasingly accessing heterogeneous targets located on-prem, and in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, meaning security has moved from parameter-based to identity-centric. Given this complexity, it's no surprise that in today's threat landscape, all roads lead back to identity.
Last year, 93% of organizations were victims of an identity-related cyber attack and nearly all of them more than once. As I talk with customers and experts around the world, it's evident that a new paradigm for securing identity is required. This new paradigm centers around our fundamental vision that every identity human and machine needs to be secured with the right level of privileged controls. CyberArk's unified end-to-end platform is the only one to deliver on this vision. Increasingly, this is resonating with customers and it's driving tremendous business momentum and fueling our growth. 
In Q2, the strength of our platform and land and expand execution resulted in strong close rates and robust pipeline build. Customers are allocating significant portions of their budget to identity security, consolidating spend, and most importantly, consolidating trust with CyberArk.
As an example of all these factors coming together, we can look at a strategic customer [ Prudess ]. Less than a year ago, the international government agency landed as a new logo with a 7-figure deal that secured IT users with PAM, workforce identities with identity, and EPM, and machines with sequence management. Since then, they have grown with CyberArk and this quarter, they further expanded their workforce protection with another 7-figure ACV deal. 
The deep relationship we have formed with [ Prudess ] and the speed of expansion after initial land shows the power of our identity security platform and how it is well aligned with what great organizations like [ Prudess ] need to do to be secure. As the scope of PAM programs continues to expand to include shadow IT, database and cloud administrators as well as high-risk workforce users. We are continuing to help our customers modernize their identity security programs with broader, more agile privileged controls across these personas. And a rip and replace new logo win, a leading biotechnology company signed a 6-figure deal to replace a competing PAM vendor. 
CyberArk's comprehensive identity security platform was a key differentiating factor as the customer wanted to modernize not just the protection of the IT user with Privilege Cloud, but also enhance security for their workforce with Workforce password manager and protect machine identities with Secrets Management.
Every organization today has a substantial and rapidly growing developer population in the pursuit of speed and efficiency developers are often afforded always-on privileges with only light, if any, security in place. Tier 2, we have to shift the paradigm to one of security first without interfering with the developers pace of innovation. At the foundation of our developer solution is our secure cloud access, or SCA functionality, SCA applies the principle of least privilege access to developers, data scientists and cloud engineers while allowing them to work natively and efficiently without having to change the preferred workflow. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see strong traction with this offering. In a deal that included SCA and Privilege Cloud, leading enterprise software company, SAP, saw standing access just-in-time access and zero standing privilege from a unified solution as the key differentiator for choosing CyberArk. With SCA, they can now seamlessly enable a zero standing privilege approach while fully securing their modern cloud environments.
On the spectrum of identities, the need to do things differently is especially top of mind for securing workforce users. Each workforce identity is more powerful today than ever before and can become privileged throughout the workday. Traditional SSO and MFA functionality on their own don't provide the security needed as evidenced in many high-profile breaches.
In the second quarter, our workforce solution was once again one of the strongest performers because we are solving this critical customer problem. We reimagined workforce identity by wrapping MFA and SSO with more controls that secure web sessions, the browser and manage passwords. In addition, workforce protection extends to the endpoint with Endpoint Privilege Manager. 
The following two deals showcase the power of bringing privileged controls to the workforce. A U.S. financial services company who is a long time CyberArk PAM customer had a need to keep its workforce more secure by managing passwords. With WPM, they can now do exactly that. The ability to add secure browser and secure web sessions on top of their existing vendors, SSO and MFA means they can also benefit from the additional security layer of CyberArk's broader access suite that's integrated within our platform.
In a different example of the importance of lease privilege at the endpoint when securing the workforce, a major aviation company chose to protect their workforce workstations by implementing our EPM solution. Choosing to deploy EPM with our FedRAMP High certification, they landed with a high 6-figure deal that closed through the AWS marketplace.
In machine identity, we had an outstanding quarter, and our momentum continues to build. Underpinning our current machine identity solution, our Conjur Cloud and Secrets Hub which when combined, empower the developer with agility and security within their native workflow. And one outstanding deal from the quarter, a major airline who is a long-standing CyberArk customer recognized the need to move its secrets management strategy within the security team's we met. We quickly demonstrated the value of CyberArk Secrets Hub, resulting in a mid 6-figure ACV deal.
We believe that the market for protecting machine identities is inflecting, and we have increasingly heard from customers that there's an urgent need to protect all machine identities. Machine identities themselves are growing exponentially due to the increase in cloud computing and the rise of AI, the machine identity landscape is also becoming more complex with increasing regulatory scrutiny and emerging standards like Google's guidance to rotate certificates every 90 days.
All of this is happening as machine identities are increasingly targeted by adversaries as a weak point in organizational security controls. We are very excited to be building out and expanding our leadership position in machine identities with the pending acquisition of Venafi, which is undergoing regulatory review. 
All machine identities need to be discovered, secured, managed, and automated to keep their connections and communication safe. Venafi machine identity management solutions are complementary to CyberArk with no technology overlap. We believe that by combining our secrets management identified modern machine identity management, certificate life cycle management and SSH key management, we will set a new standard for end-to-end machine identity security.
As you can see from these deal examples, our platform provides the ability to land in multiple spots and with multiple products. In the second quarter, we signed 245 new logos, and approximately half of these new logos landed with 2 or more solutions. In other words, customers are protecting multiple types of identities with CyberArk from day 1.
In addition, we had a strong quarter of expansion within our base across all our solutions, but machine identities with secrets management and workforce identities with our access offerings were particularly strong. At Impact, our marquee customer event held in May, attendance was up more than 25% compared to last year. we showcased that we are the front runner in innovation and are expanding the capabilities of our identity security platform, all serving our fundamental vision of securing every identity human or machine with the right level of privileged controls. 
We announced exciting product innovations across the whole portfolio, but I want to highlight two of them here, CORA AI and ITDR. CyberArk's CORA AI provides identity security focused artificial intelligence embedded within our Identity Security platform. Our unique data set on the behavior of all identities, enables CORA AI to do more, and ultimately, effectively analyze sessions, detect threats and recommend action. In addition, user and admin lives are made easier and adoption is faster with an identity security assistant that understands natural language. This will fundamentally transform how users interact with our platform significantly reducing the time it takes to deliver critical information and analysis. 
Identity Threat Detection and Response, or ITDR, is sometimes discussed as a separate market or product. We, at CyberArk believe ITDR capabilities need to be part of a broader platform. They should not just be about monitoring the vendor's infrastructure or limited to active directory, they need to look across all identities to detect identity risk and then be able to take automated response before damage is done. Our ITDR capabilities powered by CORA AI will detect and identify risky behavior, anomalous use of secrets and much more. The powerful combination of CORA AI and ITDR enhances security improves resiliency, drives increased productivity and enhances engagement with our platform. 
In summary, I want to leave you with the following takeaways from today's. First, momentum continues to accelerate in our business. Identity security is a top priority for CISOs and customers are consolidating spend with CyberArk.
Second, our solution selling is increasing our momentum in the market. applying the right level of privilege controls to every identity is a security imperative that is recognized by Boards, by the C-suite, security teams and increasingly by operations and developers.
Third, we are leading the charge when it comes to thought leadership and execution in the identity security space. Our ongoing innovation and pending acquisition of Venafi will further extend our leadership position and competitive moat and help further solidify our position as the identity security company.
And lastly, we are executing deals are progressing at a faster pace and our close rates remain strong, a clear testament to the fact that customers are allocating budgets to identity security.
Momentum continues to build across our entire business, and the strength of our platform is driving our outstanding results. With our 28% revenue growth and our 19% free cash flow margin, we were a solid Rule of 40 company in Q2.
I will now turn the call over to Josh, who will talk about our strong financial results and the increase in our yearly guidance. Thanks, Matt. Q2 was another strong quarter for CyberArk. Once again, we exceeded our guidance across all metrics, highlighting our strong execution and durable demand for our Identity Security platform. we delivered strong net new ARR growth, 245 new logos, solid top line growth, and our subscription flywheel is helping us drive robust operating leverage, and healthy free cash flow.
Now moving into the results. Total revenue grew 28% year-on-year, reaching $224.7 million and exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Annual recurring revenue reached $868 million, that's growing 33% year-on-year with $57 million in total net new ARR. As expected, SaaS made up a larger share of our bookings in the second quarter compared to the year ago period from last year.
Subscription ARR grew 50% and reached $677 million and is now 78% of total ARR. We added $56 million in net new subscription ARR that's an increase from the $49 million in the second quarter last year and a record for any non-Q4 quarter. Maintenance ARR was $191 million. Like-for-like conversion activity still represents a single-digit percent of our year-on-year ARR growth. 
Our business continues to benefit from the momentum we are seeing in upselling and cross-selling new solutions across our platform, which is a significant factor in our strong growth. In the second quarter, the cohort of customers with more than $100,000 in ARR grew to nearly 1,900 -- and the cohort with ARR of more than $500,000 is now over 340 customers that grew 38% year-on-year.
Moving into the details of the revenue lines for the second quarter. Recurring revenue reached $208 million, growing 32% year-on-year and accounting for 93% of total revenue, continuing to go up from the 90% in the second quarter last year. Subscription revenue was $158.4 million, growing 49% year-on-year and representing 70% of total revenue. Maintenance and professional services revenue was $62.7 million. Of that, Recurring maintenance revenue was $49.6 million compared to $51.6 million in the year ago period, and our maintenance renewal rates remained strong and in line with historic levels. Professional services revenue was $2.1 million.
From a geographic perspective, all regions showed healthy growth, Americas was at $129.2 million, growing 21% year-on-year. EMEA revenue was $69.9 million, up 39% year-on-year and APJ revenue was $25.6 million, growing 40% year-on-year. All P&L items now will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Please see the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of our press release.
Second quarter gross margin, gross profit was $186.9 million or 83.2% gross margin. That's up from 81.5% in the second quarter last year. In the second quarter, our operating income was $23.7 million or 10.6% operating margin also up compared to the operating loss of $5.6 million in the second quarter of last year. The significant improvement from the year ago period highlights the inherent operating leverage of our business model. Net income came in at $26.1 million or $0.54 per diluted share, also significantly outperforming our guidance and up from earnings per share of $0.03 in the year ago period. 
We ended June with 3,200 employees worldwide, including about 1,370 in sales and marketing.
We are pleased to deliver another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was $41.7 million in the second quarter, as compared to a negative $12.6 million in the second quarter of last year. That means we have delivered $108 million in free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year. That's well ahead of our expectations. We believe this is a clear demonstration of the inherent cash flow potential in our recurring revenue models.
Before going into guidance, I want to briefly touch on our proposed Venafi acquisition, which is still expected to close in the second half of 2024. As we noted previously, Venafi had approximately $150 million in ARR with more than 550 customers. Like CyberArk, about 95% of Venafi's revenue is recurring adding to our durable subscription revenue model. Importantly, we expect Venafi to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP margins. It's rare to find an acquisition opportunity that meets both strategic and financial objectives. We're confident with Venafi, we did exactly that.
Now let's turn to our guidance. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $230 million to $236 million, which represents 22% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $20.5 million to $25.5 million for the third quarter. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.49 per diluted share. Our guidance also assumes 48.2 million weighted average diluted shares and about $12 million in taxes.
For the full-year 2024, we are increasing our guidance across all our metrics. We now expect total revenue in the range of $932 million to $942 million, representing 25% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. As we look at our pipeline for the remainder of the year, SaaS continues to be expected to lead the way.
Reflecting the power of our subscription model and our continued commitment to driving operating leverage. We are increasing our full-year operating income to a range of $107.5 million to $116.5 million. we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.17 and $2.36 per diluted share. We expect about 48.2 million weighted average diluted shares and about $53 million in taxes for the full-year 2024. 

We are also raising our annual recurring revenue to a range of $985 million to $995 million at December 31, 2024, or about 28% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We are significantly increasing our free cash flow guidance for the full year to a range of $145 million to $155 million that will represent 16% free cash flow margin at the midpoint.
I want to note that our guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2024 does not include contribution from the proposed acquisition of Venafi. We will update our guidance for the Venafi acquisition in the first quarterly earnings call after we closed the transaction.
To sum up, we are thrilled to report another strong quarter to finish out a strong first half of the year and confidently raise our guidance. We are pleased with the progress we have made towards closing the Venafi acquisition and look forward to the industry leader joining CyberArk later this year.
With reporting now, the 33% ARR growth, 11% operating margin free cash flow margin, we are firing on all cylinders. Identity security is a top priority for CISOs, and our platform is a clear industry leader, delivering tremendous value for our customers.
And I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Okay. Great. Questions here, and congrats on the strong execution. Thanks, Saket. I appreciate it. Absolutely. Matt, maybe just to start with you. I think we all understand CyberArk's sort of undeniable leadership, right, in the PAM market. But I was wondering if you could just talk about how you feel like you're differentiating in areas like workforce identity and secrets management. Because during your prepared remarks, it just sounds like there's a lot more functionality that you could offer in at least those two areas versus competitors, but just wanted to hear how you think about that. Thanks, Saket. I actually love that question. I might spend a little bit more time on answering it because I think it's core to kind of our growth strategy here is our ability to be able to differentiate on those two pillars versus the market competitors. So if we start with securing the workforce, and you've heard me say this before, but we really have taken a stance that we need to reimagine how we secure workforce identities. And for a long time now, we've been securing the workforce, the general workforce with single sign-on and multifactor authentication.
And those are really important core security controls, and we offer it and the competitors offer it. But the reality is, in this breach environment, we need to go beyond those basic security controls. We need to do things like extra security when a high-risk user is accessing the increasing number of SaaS applications. That's our secure web sessions. And the idea there is a normal user who's going through their daily work, they can look like a regular user when they're accessing certain applications.
But if you're the admin an HR accessing the Workday system, you're actually a high-risk privileged user every time you go into that SaaS tool. And so we need to be able to wrap extra security controls for those use cases. We add in our secure browser. The idea of really enterprise-grade security browsing for these users so that we can tie in things like cookieless browsing.
We can have the ability to be able to monitor sessions. The idea of workforce password manager, which we heard talk about in the release. So these ideas together into one integrated solution puts our package, our solution versus the competitors, and the customers are increasingly saying, wait, I can get that. Why wouldn't I go with that because we need to think about how we substantiate a better security posture for the workforce. So we are having a higher win rate. We are seeing strong growth on the workforce side, and you hear the excitement as I'm describing it.
It's a similar story over on the machine side. I'd say it's a story that's even going to get better post Venafi acquisition. But here, we're talking about the idea of how do we get control across the broad spectrum of machine identities that sit out there. And we can be talking about legacy applications that are still sitting in the data center.
We can be talking about modern container-based applications coming out of the developer group. We can even be talking about the idea of the micro services or the workloads that sit underneath all these modern applications. They all have identities. And we need to be able to make sure that we can discover them, we can secure them and we can manage them.
But we have to do it in a way that naive to the workflow of the people who are actually building these applications in our combination of Conjur Cloud and Secrets Hub allows us to differentiate both the ability to offer a full-scale solution like Conjur Cloud, but also to be able to add or layer on top of the secret stores that sit within the hyperscalers, AWS, Microsoft, Google, so that the developers can actually choose what tools they want to use, but security can layer the right controls on top.
And you heard that in the example I used in the script of the airline who basically made a decision that machine identity security was going to be under the control of the security team. And the minute that decision was made, CyberArk became the only choice.
So I think this is what we're seeing out there in the market. And as we think about Venafi and the expanding opportunity to actually go after certificates and other forms of machine identity, we just see a long runway of growth ahead of us. That makes a ton of sense. Josh, maybe for my follow-up for you. The inflection in free cash flow is just great to see. I know that billings isn't a metric that we've really focused on much in the past, but I'm just wondering, is that sort of flywheel with subscription renewals grows, how do you sort of think about when that metric becomes more meaningful? Saket, thanks. First of all, you're right. We're really excited with the free cash flow that we generated not only in Q2 but really for the whole first half of the year. I'm also excited that we're able to continue to raise the guidance, significantly for the full year, and it's really based off of the factors around just really strong renewal rates, strong bookings as well.
And I think, I think when we think about billings, one of the things that is the reason why we've always kind of shied away is the noise that comes from the maintenance piece of the component within the deferred revenue for goes into the billings calculation. So I think to the extent that when ARR for the maintenance goes down dramatically, and we've become everything around the ARR growth and the deferred revenue is focused on the subscription SaaS.
I think that's what becomes a lot more of a clear predictor or an indicator of the growth in the business, and that's why we're still really focused today on our ARR growth, which is really the strongest indicator because it kind of helps to wash out any impact from the tail of our transition out of the perpetual business model. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Matt, can you maybe give us a little bit of additional commentary on how your platform vision is resonating with customers? And are you perhaps seeing channel partners start to bring you more into these types of deals as well? Jonathan, so absolutely. I mean I think the platform is the very foundation of our ability to do solution selling. And it's the combination of both that is actually differentiating us in the market. So we come to the customers, and we're talking about these four personas, these four identity groups, workforce, IT, developers, and machines. And then we're talking about this vision, which is the idea to be able to secure every identity with the right level of privilege controls. 
The only way that that's possible is with an integrated platform with the ability to be able to understand the behaviors of each identity group and apply the right level of controls, we call that intelligent privilege controls based upon what behaviors we're seeing, what the user is trying to do, what the target they're trying to access. And so we're not even into the discussion yet around the particular technologies that we offer. I'm talking about a high-level vision with customers about this ability to be able to expand across all their identity groups. That introduces the notion of the how. 
Well, how do we do that? We do that with one integrated platform, one user experience, one ability to be able to run unified audit and unified reporting. And absolutely, that is not only resonating with customers, but I think it's the backbone of the relationship. Because even if a customer decides, you know what, you're the PAM leader. I want to get started with securing IT, they feel future proof. They feel safe in the relationship because they know they can expand off of one platform into those other identity groups when the time comes.
Now of course, as we mentioned, about half of our new logos land with more than one solution, more than one identity group because customers actually from the get-go, want to get started with leveraging more and more of the platform. 
So I do think it's fundamental to our strategy, and it's fundamental actually to the elevation of our relationships with our customers as we map out their long-term identity security strategy. Got it. And then just in terms of a quick follow-up. When we look at the strength in the free cash flow margins this quarter, I mean, is this sort of the new normal level? Or should we expect there to be additional leverage just given the strength in your performance? Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So I think we guided and increased our guide for the full year. So that's the expectation going to the back half of the year. But I do think that what -- what the cash flow from the second quarter and also from the first quarter indicators that, yes, we do have a lot of leverage in our model to be able to continuously increase our cash flow margin, our free cash flow margin against revenue going forward, and we anticipate doing that in the years to come. Your next question comes from the line of Madeline Brooks with Bank of America. Nice performance this quarter. Just two quick ones for me. First of all, in your prepared remarks, you called out some nice wins. And I just wanted to double click on those. I'm trying to understand that or I guess, confirm with you that second quarter was really driven by a host of different deals versus one or two really oversized large ones.
And then second question for me, both for a ourselves for Josh is just getting an update on some of those other business metrics. And you mentioned over 50% are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your portfolio?
And additionally, you if you could just touch on any type of NRR type of a metric. I know last time you spoke, I think it was still trending above 125. So if we could just kind of get an indication of where it is now, that would be helpful. [Audio Gap] percent make up from the top 10 deals as a percent of our overall bookings. And we continue to see a really strong breadth of business across all our markets actually driving our results. So it's a great indication actually of the strength of the business when we look under the covers from that perspective. I think when you think about the metrics that we're seeing out there, I think we're continuing to feel, we feel good about all of them. I think when we think about our new logo lands, we were really happy with that. 
So yes, the multiple solution lines. But just in general, getting to 245 new logos in this economy, it feels like a strong landing spot for us, and we continue to plant seeds across the board, and we plant seeds across the board across all of the product lines. And I think that's the other kind of underlying message.
We've talked about this mix or this pie for a while, and the pie continues to maintain in the consistent kind of slices as we've seen in prior quarters. And the reason for that is that PAM continues to grow. So our newer areas obviously are growing faster, and they're performing well. But the core PAM business itself from an ARR perspective continues to grow. And so the overall shifting of the underlying pie doesn't change all that much. which is where you want to be, right? You want your core business to continue to perform and you want your emerging businesses to perform even better, but not catch up so much because you have any weakness in your core. And so this is what we're seeing.
I think we're still too early to really talk about NRR as a number out there. We want to get through some more cycles. So it's actually not a number that we've disclosed out there. But I think we feel very strong in our ability to be able to harvest deals within our base, and we see really strong expansion within that base. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Yes. And that you're coming in at the tail end of earnings and your call sounds quite different than pretty much what we've heard out there. And so I want to drill down a little bit into that relative to -- is there a sense of urgency you're finding from companies or customers, excuse me. I mean your new logo counts up few companies have had the net new ARR growth in the first half that you guys have. So is it just all coming together at this point? Or is there -- is there some sense of urgency because the economy has been relatively uneven or flat at best for most? Yes, Rob, it's a good question. And I think is indicative of what we're seeing out there. So let's break down again what the landscape looks like. At the moment in time, the threat vectors, the adversaries out there it continues to elevate, right? And so the breach environment, the risk environment increases. And CISOs and security teams are under a tremendous amount of pressure. And within that construct, they're asked by their Boards by their C-suite to focus in on what's most important, what's most likely to reduce risk, and that's the ability to actually secure environments. And then, frankly, also what's most likely to help them be resilient if risk materializes.
And we, within the identity security space as a whole and as the leader in identity security are just at the forefront of those conversations. Because ultimately, the CISOs prioritize identity security at the top of the list. So the answer of what they can do to reduce risk is implement core controls, implement privilege controls, understand how to protect the workforce more securely than just MFA, SSO. Go and attack the machine identity environment has been neglected for years. expand out or modernize how we secure IT to make sure that we're not just doing the basics, but we're moving beyond that to actually, for example, secure access to VMs into cloud.
And so all of that then becomes a conversation with us and the customer about, all right, how do we move and how fast can we move. Our partners get it, so they're pushing it harder. So we've become a top priority for our partner ecosystem. And ultimately, it materializes in the results that we see.
I think independent of macros and independent of other factors out there and uncertainty, ultimately, security teams have a mission, and it's the same mission of ours, which is to secure their environments, to protect their organization and their digital transformations. And I think we're just top of mind for that and then we're able to go deliver, and we see that in the results, and we see it even in the outlooks of what we see in the pipe moving forward. Thanks for your commentary there. Josh, just a quick one on free cash flow margin. If I look on a trailing 12-month basis, you're closer to about 20%. And historically, the shape of free cash flow in any given year is a little more second half weighted, if not even throughout the year. So is there something unique in this year relative to that second half? Because I think you're guiding to roughly 16.5% cash flow margin at the high end of the range, which is actually below your TTM numbers? Yes. Thanks, Rob. So when we look at the guidance for the full year that we raised, I think, by $30 million, but we're still handicapping, so to speak, for the impact of the Venafi transaction of the investment that we're doing today around it and related costs. We're also taking into consider consideration potential rate cuts in the second half that could be significant on the interest income. And third, I would say that there's consideration of tax obligations in the second half.
So when we kind of think about that and we -- obviously, we're much more bullish on our free cash flow this year than we had started out in February. And we were glad that we were able to still increase the guidance for the full year, but we did consider some of these other factors about -- to the extent that we increased our guidance. Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Congrats on the ongoing consistent execution. Guys, any views on how the public -- any views on how the public vertical has performed this quarter? And maybe just to word about linearity trends during the quarter and maybe how it's been performing during the month of July? Sure. I'll take that. So I think we've talked about this before, but as the nature of our solutions have become more mission-critical, we've seen kind of more even distribution in our federal government space, kind of across the board. And so we don't generally see a huge tick up. We actually are seeing just good, solid behavior across government, global government, across SLED and state and local, which is a growth area for us. And so I think we're happy with our performance overall.
We expect it to continue I wouldn't say there was any outsized differences in the quarter. And frankly, I don't think there'll be any outside differences in the quarter to come. I think we're just going to continue to see strong growth. I think our global government vertical represents about 10% of our overall ARR. And I think we continue to see that perform well. Any views about linearity trends? Across the entire business, we continue to see we see our normal hockey stick. So we are always back-end loaded in the quarter. We saw Q2 perform kind of consistent with normal Q2s. I would say we've had a strong start to Q3 here. So we're feeling pretty good. But I haven't quite solved the quarterly hockey stick, it's one thing yet to be solved here at CyberArk. Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. I'd like to follow up to Rob's question because the results here, as everyone is saying here, is they're impressive. It's -- but it's not only math CISOs that identify that have said, hey, identity a priority here. But it's also cyber insurance companies. I know that you and I have talked about this a lot in the past.
But I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year-over-year for the first time in 1.5 years, in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique -- like you spoke about the origin and the strength of the CISOs -- they've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way.
But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there. Is -- are you -- is cyber insurance -- to get cyber threat a decent price, you have to have PAM -- and is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness? Yes. Listen, I think we've talked about it cyber insurance is a nice tailwind for us and all the cyber insurers as they've kind of perfected their models, look at core security controls that need to be in place. And PAM is there. By the way, EPM is increasingly there. You see them starting to move over and look at the machine identity space given the threat vector there. For sure, MFA, SSO has always been there.
So I think cyber insurance is a nice tailwind. And you kind of started to hit on other factors. And what I would tell you is there's a lot of tailwinds. The regulatory environment is a tailwind for us. We're talking about DORA regulations in Europe or SEC regulations here in the U.S. they create an awareness of what is most important to go do.
Cyber insurers, as you just talked about, create an awareness of what's most important to go do. You mentioned the breach environment. And increasingly, we're seeing both customers and even the IR firms making sure that the first thing they go do or recommend is come talk to us, and we see kind of post breach deals picking up coming our way from a CyberArk perspective.
So I think, I think across the board, the tailwinds that support the fundamental thesis that I gave, Rob, which is we're top of mind and we're a priority. They all kind of reinforce that point and ultimately lead to stronger results. Okay. So it sounds like a lot of things are happening out there. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolf Research. Just one for me. Matt, I think you mentioned that win rates were improving on the workforce side. I know you guys talk a lot about how your workforce product portfolio is differentiated because you have some adjacent offerings that just makes SSO and MFA feel more secure. But can you talk to some of the strategic pricing initiatives you're taking that help make customers not only feel like the product portfolio is differentiated, but they're just getting much more value from it as well and how that maybe helped driving those improving win rates? Sure Josh. So thank you. I think we talked about this a little bit at our Investor Day, but we've moved to this solution motion and -- it's a really simple concept, right, which is we're pricing per the persona group, where we're launching solutions for the persona group. So there's workforce, again, IT developers and machines. For each one of those personas, we've got a kind of standard in an enterprise package. And our goal is to make sure that even the standard package is better than anything you can get from any competitor out there. And obviously, the enterprise takes it one step further.
And so when we think about the workforce side for a second, and you think about our standard workforce solution, certainly our enterprise one, you're getting a slice of not just MFA SSO, but you're getting the first two layers of security of secure web sessions and standard and the second two layers in enterprise. You're getting a level of identity management around life cycle management and workflow engine. You're getting the browser. You're getting an element of workforce password manager. And so as you kind of pointed out, in spaces where we're competing from the, let's say, challenger position, especially in workforce.
We're not the biggest shark out there, then we're competing on value in security, and we're going in with our new solutions, and we're saying, wait, you really want what they offer for SSO, MFA versus what we offer as a total solution to secure your workforce. And I think that's resonating. And by the way, it resonates even -- if the customer doesn't want to swap out their IdP, their SSO, MFA provider. And I shared that example in the script because it's an important one which is to say, listen, if you've made a choice on Microsoft or even Okta recently, and you don't want to swap that out, that's fine. We can start to wrap our security controls on top of that. 
We can bring you into our platform -- and then over time, we can see what happens. And I think that's what the sales team is feeling energized by, and they're out there competing not only more effectively, but I think with a lot more confidence. That makes a lot of sense. And then just maybe a quick follow-up. You -- I think also in the prepared remarks, you called out how the lifetime of certificates kind of shrinking to 90 days when it used to be, I think, multiple years. There seems to be a lot of little incremental news headlines on just companies out there losing faith in their incumbent certificate management providers. Are you seeing a rate of change in the demand with which people are realizing that Venafi is a modern solution that can handle these new requirements that the market is impressing upon these companies? Yes. Listen, I think we remain incredibly enthused by the Venafi acquisition. We need to go finish it out, close it and get them on board. But I'm out there talking to customers, our customers really every day. And of course, as you might imagine, I'm discussing machine identities. And we're talking about this kind of broad end-to-end machine identity landscape. And I just want everybody to try to understand this for a second.
For each machine identity, let's take an application. It can be an application, it can be a bot. It can be an AI-driven body, it can be an IoT device. But let's take an application. That application has multiple identities. So that application can have an identity that looks a lot like a username and password. We call that a secret. It can also have an identity with its core identifying features, think like the equivalent of a human with their passport or their driver's license. That's a certificate. And without the ability to be able to identify themselves through a certificate, they can't, for example, the application can't get listed on website. You can't get listed in Google. 
So the idea here is our end-to-end machine identity goes across all machines. And then within each machine can manage whether it's the secrets, the credentials, it can manage the certificates these identifying features. They can manage their key -- keys, modern keys. And our combination of Venafi plus CyberArk allows us to be able to be really the only provider that can do that end to end.
Now diving into your question, actually, that was all a long preamble, is when we think about the certificate space, there has been organizations out there that aren't on the upper tier of the enterprise or aren't highly regulated, they been able -- they thought they could do this themselves. I can create a spreadsheet and track all my certificates, which can be in the thousands or even more. 
And I can figure out when I need to rotate or issue a new certificate when it expires through an automated script, that's impractical today. If you are managing more than 5,000 certificates, the idea of doing it manually or through an automated fashion is just not possible.
And so that then triggers real interest in an enterprise-grade certificate life cycle management tool in a modern SaaS environment, which is really what Venafi offers. And so I really think we're at this inflection point where the do-it-myself or do it with some smart people on IT is no longer applicable.
So you add that with the total end-to-end story. And that's why, as you can tell because I'm going on about it, that's why you can see this idea of, wow, what can we do at CyberArk as the leader in machine identity. And when we close this acquisition and we come back, we'll talk a little bit more about what that offering looks like and the momentum we'll see. Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Just one for me. Josh, you alluded to maybe bringing down the free cash flow directly in response to some of the things that you might be doing around Venafi. So I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail or maybe a taste of what maybe some of these anticipatory investments or plans or efforts or initiatives might be around Venafi, provided that hasn't closed yet. But again, anything anticipatory that you're doing, if you could give us a flavor on. Yes, I'll start, and Matt, if you have anything to add. But first of all, I think it's from my angle, and we're trying to forecast cash flow, free cash flow for the second half of the year. It's really more around what are we doing now around PMI for the transaction, the additional investments around making sure that it's successful the full integration as well as, of course, related transactional costs that are going to be going into it, whether the dry one of legal and various advisory, advisory costs as well. 
And I also would not -- I would want to repeat, there's also -- we took actually consideration of where interest rates are going in the second half of the year, which is also has an impact on the free cash flow. But it's really the things around related to what we know we're doing today around direct and indirect costs related to the integration with Venafi. Your next question comes from the line of Junaid Siddiqui with Truist Securities. Matt, you've talked about the importance of the MSP channel. And have really leaned into it. Could you talk about the traction that you're seeing in the MSP console that you recently launched and maybe any other initiatives that are contributing to growth in new logos? Yes, sure. No. I think MSPs are important component of today and an even more important component of the future. I think more and more organizations, not just down market but actually enterprise organizations are choosing to outsource their security stack to the MSP providers for out there. And so we see that as a big piece of our partner program. We talk about it actually regularly.
We did launch the MSP console earlier in the year, and it's gotten rave reviews. It's made the life of the MSP significantly easier and it allows them to be able to focus on going out and helping find us customers. once they have it, keeping those customers happy and satisfied. And the console itself really helps with kind of tenant management. It helps with the ability to understand usage, and again, it just makes their life easier.
So I think MSPs are a big piece of the future of CyberArk. You see more and more of the kind of nontraditional, kind of SIs get into MSPs, resellers become MSPs. And I think it's a big piece of how we see ourselves going forward. 
It also allows us, by the way, to talk about a broader portfolio stack. If you would talk to us maybe a year or 2 ago with the MSPs we did have, they were really focused in on PAM. And now we see the MSPs really embracing the full portfolio strategy, the platform itself, actually moving into machines, moving into the access side.
One of the areas that all of our partners, not just the MSPs are most excited about is actually this idea of cloud access and how do we secure developers, whether they're cloud architects sitting in IT, or developers sitting in the developer organization.
And what we've seen here, and it was evident in the SAP example, we have released a press release and I mentioned them in the script, they really wanted to think about how they expand the notion of PAM to a modern stack that actually secures the cloud environment, and they adopted our Secure Cloud Access is the fundamental component platform of how developers will access the cloud environment.
It's a really exciting win for us. And those types of new use cases come to play with the MSPs as well, and they realize that they can cover all of the personas of their organizations if they effectively adopt the CyberArk platform. That concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Cohen for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thank you. And as you can tell, we're just thrilled to deliver another strong quarter. We're delivering innovation, and we're continuing to build our vision around this idea of delivering the right level of privilege controls to every identity. We couldn't be more excited about the Venafi acquisition, which remains on track to close in the second half of 2024.
And we're in an amazing position overall to continue expanding our leadership position in identity security. I want to end by thanking the more than 3,000 employees at CyberArk all around the world for their hard work, and their diligent effort in making CyberArk what it is today. Thank you, and we'll talk soon. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
