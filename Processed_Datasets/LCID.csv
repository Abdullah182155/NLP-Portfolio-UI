At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Please be advised. that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Lauren Sloane, Investor Relations for Lucid. You may begin. Welcome to Lucid Group's Third Quarter FY2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call we have Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO, and Sherry House, our CFO. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter, ended September 30, 2021, was filed with the SEC and the related earnings press release was issued after close of market earlier today. Both are posted on our website. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the statements on this call, particularly those regarding the future financial performance of the Company, production and delivery volumes, macroeconomic and industry trends, Company initiatives, and other future events are based on the information that we have as of today and include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations.
And we refer you to the cautionary language included in Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, as well as other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC for a fuller discussion of such risks, uncertainties and other factors.

A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon, as well as in the investor deck available in the Investor Relations section of our website at ir. lucidmotors.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Lauren. We're very excited to welcome stakeholders to Lucid's Inaugural Earnings Call. We've achieved tremendous amounts over the course of 2021 and we are excited to lay out our vision and priorities for the Company. We look forward to continuing to work with investors and analysts to build long-term relationships with our stakeholders. For those of you who are new to Lucid stories, we were originally founded as Ativa back in 2007. At that time, we were focused on advancing our battery technology, logging over 20 million miles in real-world driving data. And armed with everything we learned as Ativa, we then turned our efforts to creating the best car in the world as Lucid. Rethinking from the ground up every single aspect of the vehicle. From design, to engineering, to manufacturing. And the initial results of our efforts is Lucid Air, which carries with it the means to accelerate the adoption of electrification, while redefining luxury in the automotive market. As we continue to bring Lucid Air to market, it's clear that the opportunity we have in front of us is massive because the market opportunity is not just for electric vehicles, it's for vehicles overall. Currently, there's only about 2.5% penetration into the U.S. vehicle market through EVs, and only about 4% penetration into the global vehicle market.
We see the luxury car market expanding at an annual rate of about 5% over the next few years, and ultimately reaching over $700 billion of global sales near the middle of this decade. We believe that the growing customer sentiment for electric vehicles, coupled with the government mandates encouraging their adoption, provides significant support for the EV industry overall and for Lucid's position within it. Lucid is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity driven by our key differentiators, namely our technology innovation, and the people who work here. Now first off, we believe that our technology is worlds apart from even the current market leaders. For example, no one expected Lucid to achieve even 400 miles of range. And now we have an EPA certification of 520 miles of range for the Lucid Air Dream Edition R. And we've created this technology with an eye towards an ability to manufacture it at scale, which is where true innovation lies.
Furthermore, we have a drive to continue innovating, which is why we've been able to surpass even our early range estimates. As another example, our technology powered every car in Formula E, the world's premier electric motorsports series. And indeed, it changed the sport. Our battery packs have enabled Formula E cars to complete full race distances on a single charge. Now, what we learn from every race car, at every race, goes directly into the battery technology, powering Lucid Air. As the media and early customers have learned, our vehicles are truly the fusion of hardware and software, made possible by one of the best teams in the industry. We have auto industry veterans, including members of my former Tesla Model S team, working with former executives from Apple, and learning from their customer, the electronics experience. Along with so many other standouts from automotive and tech industries. We plan to leverage our team's abilities to continue to improve vehicle function and features, even after customers take delivery via over the air updates.
Before we update you on some of our substantial achievements during the most recent quarter, I would be remiss in not highlighting some of our most recent achievements outside of Q3 and that's because these are quite significant. First off, we started delivering vehicles to customers at an event at our Silicon Valley HQ, just two weeks ago on October the 30th. Now these preceded an increasing number of deliveries nationwide slated for this month and next, including more than two dozen deliveries to paying customers that occurred just this past weekend. So you may have already witnessed your first sighting of Lucid Air in the wild. Yes, you'll have a full report on customer deliveries during our Q4 Call, so watch this space for more. Next. Just this morning, Lucid Air was officially announced as Motor Trends 2022, Car of the Year. Now, it is arguably the most prestigious award in the motor industry, seeking out true innovation, and groundbreaking vehicles. For a new brand and a new Company to win, well, to my knowledge, that's only been done once before.
And I should know I was there. Getting back to the matter at hand, in Q3, we secured a number of certifications required to sell a vehicle ahead of those customer deliveries that I've just mentioned. This includes full FMVSS, CARB, FCC, and FDA safety certifications, all of which further establish our credibility, and cleared the way for the ramp up of Lucid Air deliveries. But what I'm most proud of is the official EPA rating of 520 miles range. And because we achieved this landmark through our world leading in-house technology, not by simply installing an oversight battery pack, or off-the-shelf parts. Our Lucid Air Grand Touring has an official EPA -rated range of 516 miles and it achieves that with the 112 kilowatt-hour battery pack, giving it an industry-leading efficiency of 4.6 miles per kilowatt-hour. Taking a step further, we have 6 Lucid Air variants in the top 6 positions of the EPA range ratings for EVs. And unlike many other EV companies, we design, develop, and build our Power-train and COO EV technology components in-house, with an emphasis upon efficiency. Now, we view this as a strategic competitive advantage for Lucid as we look ahead. Next, after securing the EPA rating, we officially commissioned our factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and started production of Lucid Air. At a factory event on September 27th, we hosted our customers, media, and guests.
All of them had the opportunity to drive Lucid Air. The reactions and feedback from his experience could not have been better, including a broad validation from important media. I rather like when reporters call Lucid Air jaw-dropping and the future of cars. Now, the fantastic experience these customers and the media's had with the Lucid Air to-date, have only increased interest in the brand, and the result is an accelerated pace of new reservations, currently at 17,000 and climbing quickly. Which has also spurred us to increase the total production quantity of the Dream Edition to 520 both to accommodate demand and also to recognize the landmark EPA 520 miles achievement. Lastly, I'll highlight that the customer journey has also been an area of focus for us this past quarter. We now have 16 Lucid studios and service centers across North America. But this is only the beginning. And I'll talk more about our plans for expansion shortly. And now, I wanted to look ahead to our near-term strategic priorities, which will see a continued focus on achieving progress against our existing activities.
As I mentioned earlier, last month, we started delivering Lucid Air Dream additions models to our reservation holders. And we're currently ramping up customer deliveries. We will soon start to deliver Lucid Air Grand Touring models, followed by Touring and Air Pure next year. With such demand across the Lucid Air lineup, we felt it critical to accelerate expansion of our advanced manufacturing plant, or our AMP1 factory in Arizona. Essentially investing in our capabilities to mitigate future business risks. This process started in Q3 with progress well underway on the addition of 2.85 million square feet of manufacturing space to our Arizona factory. This expansion will allow for a significant increase in production capacity for Lucid Air and enable production of the Gravity SUV in 2023. And speaking of expansion, our retail footprint grew significantly this year. Including our first location outside of the U.S., in Vancouver, Canada, which we opened last month.
And we plan to have 20 studios and service centers open by the end of this year. So you can see acceleration as a theme in the second half of 2021. We also continue to increase our service footprint across the U.S., not just with physical service centers but also with the roll-out of our mobile service program. We expect service centers to continue opening in North America and we anticipate hiring a significant number of additional service technicians as we expand our capabilities. We're optimistic about these goals even in a challenging environment as COVID-19 continues to present numerous obstacles for the auto industry and supply chain. Lucid is no stranger to this, but we have continued to deliver against our timeline and with the highest standard of quality. And I would like to commend the Company's employees who work relentlessly and tirelessly to help Lucid's progress and grow during these recent periods of uncertainty. Lastly, I would like to spend some time providing an overview of our longer-term strategic focus areas, as well as upcoming major milestones.
Lucid continues to grow its operations in the U.S. but as part of our growth strategy, and more specifically, our international strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance, repair services, and manufacturing activities outside of the U.S. Again, with the goals of mitigating business risk and charging future growth. On the retail and service front, we're looking to expand our footprint in Europe and the Middle East, and we expect to enter these markets in 2022. There has been continued expansion of the team in both regions with key additions to leadership and the employee base, and we're excited by the prospects of these key regions. We believe this will help establish Lucid as a global brand and address untapped market demand in these regions on an entirely new level, while also taking action to address climate change through sustainable mobility. Moving to our Air line up. The longer view will see production expanding to include [Indiscernible] touring and pure models, as well as future variants. With our in-house technology established in Lucid Air as the new bank benchmark for EV efficiency, we will be quick to maximize this potential.
Because if we can achieve 516 miles with just a 112 kilowatt-hour battery pack, it's easy to imagine a smaller pack, and the weight and cost savings afforded by it, which would allow for much more trainable EV that can still achieve 300-plus or 400 and plus miles of range. And finally, we're excited to launch additional vehicles over the coming decade, including Project Gravity. A luxury SUV that leverages the Air's platform and that, we expect, will elevate the SUV to a new level with [Indiscernible] performance and category-defining interior space. And we look forward to sharing more details about the Gravity next year, ahead of expected production in 2023. With that, I would like now to hand the call over to our CFO, Sherry House, who has been a tremendous addition to the Lucid team. Her experience and background have been truly invaluable. I couldn't have asked for a better partner to work with me on the next phase of this very exciting journey. Sherry. Thank you very much, Peter. I'd like to start by expressing how pleased I am to be speaking to all of you today for Lucid's inaugural earnings call covering the third quarter of 2021. Just 6 months ago, I joined this fantastic team which Peter has assembled, and I've witnessed firsthand what is possible when you put a passionate and persevering team on tasks to set a new standard in vehicle electrification. This has been a very active quarter for the Company, highlighted by external validation of Lucid's many technological and design feeds and even marked by a number of industry first, such as first EV to reach and exceed 500 miles of range on a single charge. On the finance front, on July 23rd, we completed our reverse merger deep back transaction with Churchill Capital Corp Four and our pipe investors to form Lucid Group, Inc. This transaction brought approximately $4.4 billion of net cash on the Lucid's balance sheet. On July 26th, we further raised our public profile and access to capital through our public listing on the Nasdaq as LCID.
These events significantly bolstered Lucid's balance sheet and derisk the near-term execution of Lucid's forward plan. This capital will increase the production capacity and vertical integration at our production facilities in Casa Grande, Arizona and support the readiness of our global supply chain. Second, this capital will enable our commercialization and globalization efforts by expanding our studio and service center footprint in planning for the future localization, manufacturing. And finally, this investment will fund R&D efforts to enhance and grow the technological moat that Lucid has established. Specifically, the dollars will advance the development and launch of new variants of the Lucid Air and the Gravity SUV, as well as future vehicle programs and other technologies. I'd now like to turn your attention to our third-quarter results to put the quarter in context, yield serve two primary themes throughout our financials. First, we'll be the strengthening of our financial position, which we just discussed. And second will be the transformation of our Company as we ready ourselves for large-scale vehicle production.
In our Q3 results you'll see costs associated with our startup production in September However, you will not see vehicle revenues until Q4, given that customer deliveries began on October 30th. In Q3, Lucid recognized revenue of $232,000, predominantly related to the use of our battery packs in the Formula E race series. There is seasonality of this revenue stream and similar to 2020, we expect to see the lion's share of battery pack revenue in Q4. The cost of revenue was $3.3 million and includes cost of goods sold related to the startup production at AMP1 that occurred in September. Engineering, Research and Development expenses had grown by about 72% year-to-date compared with the same period in 2020, predominantly driven by the investment in talent, prototype expenses related to the testing and certification processes that Peter referenced earlier, as well as the production quality validation fleet that we produce at AMP-1.
On the SG&A side, expenses increased by approximately $400 million for the 9 months ending September 30 versus the same period in 2020. A key driver of SG&A expenses is headcount growth related to the build-out of the sales and service network as we prepare for additional deliveries in the fourth quarter. We also invested in people, processes, and systems on the G&A side of the house in order to not only support Lucid as a publicly traded Company, but also to support the globalization of our business. Lastly, there was an increase quarter-over-quarter in stock-based compensation across both R&D and SG&A, this increase is attributed to a cumulative catch-up on employee grants. Accounting treatment required the merger to close before 2021 grants could be recorded its stock-based compensation. Transitioning to our balance sheet and cash flow at the end of the third quarter, Lucid had a cash position of approximately $4.8 billion, reflecting the $4.4 billion from the SPAC and pipe, plus the cash on balance sheet at the time of the close.
We also added a $173 million from the exercise of public warrants prior to the notice at cashless redemption, which occurred on September 8th. The cashless redemption, provided investors who had purchased the LCIDW warrants with access to the stock without the burden of making an upfront cash investments. As to the close of our public warrant program, that decision resulted in the exercise of nearly all of our outstanding public warrants. The cashless exercise also reduced dilution by enabling a 0.4458 to 1 ratio on the issuance of shares to public warrants exercised. We observed a significant amount of goodwill with our retail investor base due to this cashless provision and our decision to extend the warrant redemption window through October 29, which allowed some who missed the initial redemption window to still exercise for shares. We want to reiterate how much we appreciate everyone who exercise their warrants and are so pleased to have such a diverse and supportive investor base. And lastly, I would like to comment on CapEx to close at our balance sheet highlights.
We increased our net property, plant, and equipment by over $250 million from the prior year. As I mentioned, this PP&E growth is related to the build out of AMP-1 investments in machinery, tooling, and equipment, and the expansion of our retail studios and service center footprint throughout the U.S. and internationally. Looking onward to the fourth quarter, we are incredibly excited about the road ahead. We expect to ramp up production and continue to increase customer deliveries of the Lucid Air. We're seeing increasing interest in the Lucid Air with over 17,000 current reservations. Heading into 2022, we remain committed to our plan to achieve 20,000 units in the calendar year. However, this plan is not without risk, given the extra ordinary supply chain, and logistics challenges that the automotive industry has been facing. Financially, we're proud to strengthen loose it's balance sheet as we commenced production at customer vehicles heading into the fourth quarter, and we believe that we are well-positioned to fund the exceptional growth opportunities in front of us as we move through 2022. In closing, I'd like to thank all of you for joining our Third Quarter Earnings Call.
A recording of which will be posted on our Investor Relations website. I'd also like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and dedication across our headquarters and facilities, retail stores, and manufacturing plants. It's because of your collective efforts and the effort of our partners that Lucid can create value for our investor base and drive our ultimate mission to bring sustainable energy technologies to the world. I'm personally optimistic about the future of Lucid and the value that we will deliver to all stakeholders, customers, suppliers, partners and investors. Before we transition to analyst questions, I'd like to note that we are exploring additional methods to ensure that our broad and growing investor base can participate in the Q&A, and we hope to have that implemented in early 2022. With that, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator. Thank you. [ Operator Instructions] [ Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Good evening and good afternoon, everybody, and congrats on your first quarter as a public Company and that that's achievement onto its own. You're dishing everything else are getting done here. First question for you, Peter and maybe Terry. You can try me in on the second part of this. As you think about what you're doing here and the success of the air, and what theoretically will come here with the gravity, 90,000 units capacity by 2023 seems a little bit pedestrian, right? Meaning that your demand may far exceed that. I'm just curious, Peter, as you think about what your volume, goals or aspirations are overtime, if you could elucidate those or just tell us where you're headed, and then also just thinking about, what's going on with the stock, and the availability of low-cost capital. Sherry, would you consider -- and you Peter as well, obviously. [Indiscernible] a greater issuance, sooner rather than later, to raise capital, to maybe accelerate this 90,000 units capacity in 2023. And hopefully maybe grow even faster than what you've been talking about. Quite an interesting point, John. Right now, we're laser-focused as a Company and the whole management team under my direction, in scaling what we've got. Laser focused on growing the scale towards 20,000 units next year and 50,000. But we're planning on 500,000 units by the end of the decade. We have a plan in place to expand Casa Grande to that level. And we've also got localization of manufacturing. We've got incredible high value in our manufacturing as well because we manufacture the entire technology suite, the battery, the motor, the inverter, the whole electric powertrain, in-house. So we're not just buying in parts here and just having value that way. There's a whole lot of in-built value-add to the cars that we've got. We've got a Casa Grande capacity planned out to 365,000 units.
But of course, we also plan probes in other parts of the world, the Middle East and in China, and this is going to be part of our global expansion plan. We're very ambitious in terms of the scope and make no mistake this is a technology play, and this is a technology race. And as a tech Company, it's our technology which we are confident will put us in this preeminent position. But as you know, we designed this technology to be truly mass manufacturable. I think scaling our volume is well within our sights. And John -- oh, great to have you with us, first. And I can take the second part of your question where you're talking about just balance sheets and also just deployment of capital. We're sitting in a terrific place today with a $4.8 billion as of September 30th. That can get us well through 2022. You're going to see a large CapEx increase happening next year. Actually multiples of CapEx are going to be deployed next year versus this year. So we're already doing that acceleration. And in June, we announced that we were going to be bringing forward $350 million of planned CapEx investments from future periods into the 2021 to 2023 periods, and also increasing overall between 2021 and 2026 by 6% to 7%. So we are going to be, as a Company, accelerate in our ability to deploy CapEx. And if the opportunity presents itself -- you might recall that our prior versions of our motto suggested that, 2024 and beyond that we might start to step down our CapEx but then opportunity is there for continued expansion and we are ready for it. We will certainly go after it.
We do think that there is increasing availability of capital to us today, from a lot of different sources. You'll note that we still haven't even taken debt on, though we have the opportunity to provide terrific loan-to-value there if we chose to take on debt and then with the fat price increasing, it gives us a lot of other opportunities as well. We're feeling really good about what we could do, and we feel like we are increasing the Company's ability to deploy capital efficiently and quickly. And then just a second question, Peter. I mean, obviously with, Air you have a knockout products with best-in-class range. Arguably, one of the best if not the best on the planet. When you think about gravity, that's tough act to follow. We're [Indiscernible] is following that. How do you view gravities differentiation in the market? I mean, presumably if just given the form factor, it's not quite as good a range as air, but what's the real, pun intended, pull for the gravity to the consumer in the market. So glad you asked me that. We've made a whole bunch of advances with Gravity project. It's very close to my heart. We're getting it ready for production late '23 and I think it's going to be equally as disruptive in the SUV space as Air is in its sedan space. We're going to deploy the space concept, miniaturization of the electric car train, incredible range for its class, and it's going to have 1 or 2 really big dialing, unique features as well. I am super excited about Gravity. Okay, and then [Indiscernible] sorry, just a housekeeping question, Sherry, how much stock comp was an SG&A and R&D specifically in each line item, if you could just give us that if you have it. I can tell you across the two was $235 million and yes roughly double what it might have otherwise spend the chip is cumulative effect that I mentioned. It's really related to -- It has like a double trigger and you have to actually have the merger happen before you can put it up on your accounting statements. Plus the stock is performing very well. So that's always a good a high-class problem to have. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it. Yeah, of course. And it was more, that it's a cumulative stock than it was the stock price to the quote, right? Okay. Yeah. Great. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi. Good evening, everybody and congrats on the MotorTrend Car of the Year Award. That's incredible. Especially considering it's your first car. So, well done. Thank you. Thanks, Peter. I had a question on the delta of reservations from the 13 at the end of the quarter to the over 17 now, can you give us a little -- My understanding is you opened up reservations to international, so I'd be curious what the like-for-like is of North American reservations within that delta. Then maybe within international, how much of a Saudi versus non Saudi or any color that would be helpful. We don't [Indiscernible] international reservations before we announce the 13,000, also, I mean, the bulk of reservations is our home markets, U.S. and we haven't even opened up the big market and teacher, which is China. But absolutely Saudi is great because it's our biggest market number of reservations, and that's really heartening that the country which is gained its wealth based upon its carbon economy is so forward-looking and sees the efforts in corrective product. Okay Peter, I'll leave it to you whether you want to disclose that or not, but just for my second question, on your distribution strategy, can you remind us why the advantages of going direct to consumer and why you are not using a franchise model. And I don't believe you're considering using a franchise model, but just wanted to confirm that. Thanks. That's correct, Devin. Well, I think the important thing here is that we are creating a new brand. It's not just about the product. The product defines the brand, but there's more here than just Lucid Air and a luxury brand. And the consumer experience in the consumer journey is too precious to delegate to third-party. We need to choreograph the consumer's journey through discovery, through intrigue, through purchase and ownership, and how better than to do it directly. You can also just driving consistency in messaging as well, you're not working with independent franchises and dealerships that it just really allows a lot more control, controlling pricing, there's a lot of benefits that we see in this direct relationship Thank you, Sherry. Thanks, Peter. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. Hi, everybody. Just a first question. First, going back to the reservation growth up to 17,000. With the momentum you're seeing in reservations, how are you thinking about when to, I guess, more formally unveil gravity and even open up the reservation book there? Oh gosh. Well, I guess that with all things, in good time. I'd like to have Gravity to a level of greater substance that we can actually show a car, possibly later next year, I would say. But right now, I've got such laser focus on Air. The reservations are growing, increasing. And I'll tell you something else. I'm really particularly happy about the split in those reservations. We've got a really nice blend. I mean, we're sold out of our Dream Edition, as you know. We've expanded that to 520 units to reflect our 520 EPA rating and the growing demand. But we've got a really nice blend of reservations for Grand Touring and Touring until very much reflecting the sort of split that we will manufacture over the next 15 months or so. In fact, when you look at September 30th numbers, we had talked about the 13,000 reservations and we also had talked about that that reflects an order book and revenues of about 1.3 billion. So you can do the MSRP math from there and it gives you a good sense of where that mix wise and see consumer not over-index some pure, it's just a really nice balance. So we're happy with where it is and we'll keep watching it as we go forward. And we're also going to be enjoying decreasing costs over time and improving margins. And so we feel like we'll be in a really good position as some of these other products not pick up. That's all. That's very helpful and just maybe secondly, hoping you can update us on your latest thoughts on the Dream drive software strategy and in terms of partners versus what you might look to do in-house? Our strategy here today has been, of course, key focus on creating the very best electric vehicle in the world with the most advanced electric power train. And endowing that car with core foundations of hardware suite. 32 sensor suite, 14 cameras, with solid-state 120 degree line up, and a whole host of long range radar and closely mixed radar. So that's been the step 1 of the plan. Create the most advanced foundations for the house in terms of the hardware, and have software which is broadly competitive in the marketplace. Now we've achieved that, the next step will be to advance that software. Now, we're planning as a default to do that in-house and we're building the team. But and as you know, I'm very open here in Silicon Valley to potential partnerships in terms of the software but I see that as a potential bonus, I think the default position is going to be, development software now and take that to will cost standard based upon the hardware suite we've got and to develop that in-house. That's all, it's all very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Stan Shpetner with Pickering Energy. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a new vehicle launch. Can you speak to, a little bit, of what degree of gross margin variability you have across the different versions of the Air. And how, over time, if you take a point of view, that to drive volumes over time, you'll have a greater proportion of pure sales and how -- what are the implications for that in terms of trend of gross margin as that mix shifts over time? Yeah, thanks so much for your questions. So we're expecting to have competitive growth margins by the time we reach mid decade. And you're going to see that our gross margins are not going to be there initially because we're activating depreciation expenses, we're training new employees, we're going to be driving efficiency within the manufacturing, arena over the next year, especially year and a half and then you're going to see as the volume increases just gross margins improving overall, is that absorption improves. With respect to your question about how are we thinking about the higher-priced model versus the pure were just in such a unique advantaged position because of our technology. But it's going to need lot to go from -- The tremendous machine of our Dream Edition and still be able to produce with the pure over 400 range -- 400 mile range, as well as of our 500-horsepower. And we can do that while reducing costs by reducing one of our motors, we also can reduce the battery pack and we have a lot of trim features that can be activated or deactivated to basically make up those products exactly to what the customer is seeking. So those are the enablers that we have. That's absolutely right. Right now, we're using our extraordinary efficiency to achieve range to create a technological tool to force, to define the brand as the range king. But, in the future where we use that technological advance as a commercial enabler, it means that we will be able to provide a car which is competitive with range. We'd be at 300 miles, 400 miles, whatever, but with a commensurately smaller, proportionately smaller battery back than the competition, because our technology is inherently more efficient. And because of that, because the battery pack is the single most expensive item in electric car, this will affect the margin and therefore, it -- have a direct bearing upon our viability -- our commercial viability as a Company. And the other thing I would just say there too is just -- We have an amazing team. We've got a terrific supply chain team. We've had terrific manufacturing team. They've done it before. They've done it at Audi. And if not just gotten the plants up and running and efficient, they brought the costs down. And all of the experiences coming to bear on our products and our factory and that's another important point that I wanted to make sure I left you with. I am with you in the factory with cost down going for the future, the car is designed that way. Thanks. Just to follow up. Earlier you mentioned that you have a fairly balanced order book between the different for versions of the Lucid Air. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of when next year that we could expect to see shipments of the pure to begin? I think it's in the latter part of next year when fuel comes out. But my impression is pure. I want to get the cost down. I want to fulfill our mission, which is the mass adoption of electric vehicles. Great. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks. Thank you so much. As you can see by what we've achieved in Q3 and by future plans, there is a tremendous amount of exciting activity here at Lucid. Supported by our industry-leading technology, our owning going investments in cutting edge manufacturing and the outstanding team we have assembled, we believe there are a sizable opportunities to shareholder value creation ahead of us. I would again like to thank our employees for getting us here. We have a truly unrivaled team. I'm proud of what we have accomplished, and I'm optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. We look forward to speaking with you regularly and keeping you updated on the progress we're making. We aim to be transparent in our approach and look forward to engaging with you. Thank you so much for joining us here today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Lauren. We're excited to update you on Lucid's tremendous progress in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone for Lucid. We commenced customer deliveries of the world's most advanced EV sedan. As of year-end 2021, this included 125 cars in customers' hands, while we produced over 400 vehicles in total as of today. And on these, over 300 have now been delivered to customers. We accomplished deep deliveries against the backdrop of an extraordinary supply chain and supply quality challenges. Indeed, we could have chosen to build faster, but we elected not to sacrifice quality, given our unwavering commitment to the highest standards. These first deliveries of Lucid Air validate our mission to inspire the adoption of sustainable energy by designing and building captivating electric vehicles centered around the human experience. While the delivery of our first cohort of cars to consumers is important in its own right, it also represents the first real-world stress testing of the critical part of the customer journey. From reservation to order, to production, delivery and after-sales support, including the over-the-air update to the Lucid Air onboard software. When you step back and think about it, we put both a full EV powertrain and vehicles into production across 2 separate and distinct factories which I believe to be the very first time that that's ever been done. So we were able to run 2 parallel tracks simultaneously in our manufacturing, producing our proprietary powertrain and battery packs at one site and then fully assembling the car a little way down the road at our AMP factory, an extraordinary achievement. And having worked through all of this, we are more confident than ever that we're building a quality foundation on which we can scale our business and build long-term growth. Starting and beginning to ramp production was a significant step in moving from concept to reality and delivering on our mission to create a future where there is no longer an artificial choice between doing great things and doing the right thing. The initial feedback from customers and third parties has been resoundingly positive. So many customers are saying that their Lucid Air is the best car that they have ever driven and praise the quality of a build, enjoying the engaging dynamic driving experience, whilst also relishing the luxurious interior ambience. At the time of our last call, Lucid Air had just been named MotorTrend 2022 Car of the Year. Since then, we've continued to rack up industry accolades. We were named Best New Car to Buy in 2022 by Green Car Reports, the 2022 Luxury Green Car of the Year by Green Car Journal, and MotorWeek 2022 Driver's Choice Award for the Best EV. The EPA has efficiently certified the Lucid Air Dream addition with the longest range of any EV at 520 miles. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, Inside EVs conducted a real-world driving test to validate our 500-mile range at a steady 70 miles per hour. I encourage you to take a look at their coverage, which is posted online. In addition, we have the fastest charging EV available today, independently verified to be capable of charging 300 miles in just 22 minutes. And as I recently told the New York Times, we've replaced range anxiety with range confidence. Now on that note, I do want to emphasize a point which has been all too long overlooked here. Our transformative range and efficiency are as much due to our in-house software as our in-house hardware. We truly are becoming as much a software company as a hardware company. And I believe our efficiency in miles per kilowatt hour is an appropriate and valid metric for this. Now these metrics reinforce that our powertrain is the most efficient in the market, in the real world and in customers' hands. And this is a critical point. Our enhanced technology, enabling more miles from a smaller battery size, will allow us to shrink pack sizes for future products whilst maintaining a highly competitive range. And this is particularly advantageous for the Lucid Air Pure variant. All of this is translating to significant demand for our products. As of today, we had over 25,000 reservations for Lucid Air, representing a 47% increase from our 17,000 reservations in mid-November. Our reservation book represents a healthy mix across our products from our higher-end trends through to our pure model. The Lucid Air Dream addition was heavily oversubscribed and is completely sold out. We continue to see strong demand across our highest performance product tiers. And actually, we're considering how best to address this demand. We are gratified that customers recognize the exceptional quality of our cars with an industry leading, independently certified range, exceptional performance and handling and unmatched efficiency. To address the rising demand for our products, we are actively working to expand our manufacturing facility in Arizona, AMP 1. This is an imperative for us. Increased production capacity is essential to drive mass electrification and meet customer appetite for our vehicles. We continue to make good progress on the addition of 2.85 million square feet of manufacturing capacity as part of Phase 2. And Sherry will provide further details. And as we discussed ramping up our manufacturing footprint, today, we are also excited to announce plans for a new factory in Saudi Arabia, our first international production facility. The Lucid estimates that the selection of KSA as the location of its first international manufacturing plants may result in financial benefits to Lucid of up to $3.4 billion over 15 years. This facility will be a world-class manufacturing center with the ability to produce up to 150,000 vehicles annually at full capacity. We appreciate the efforts of the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and the King Abdullah Economic City to finalize this game-changing collaboration. We are thrilled that this collaboration will allow us to introduce the world's most advanced electric vehicles to more people and additional markets in the coming years, and also enables us to further our shared ambition to transform the economy of the KSA to sustainable transportation energy. We look forward to breaking ground shortly and expect the facility to begin production in 2025. In the more immediate term, like many manufacturers, our production has been and indeed continues to be impacted by supply chain challenges. As you saw from our press release today, we have updated our 2022 production outlook for Lucid Air to a range of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. As a vertically integrated company, our technology and engineering foundation gives us significant advantages. We have control over both software and hardware, and the proprietary powertrain and battery pack technology have been holistically designed for scalability of automated manufacturing. And because we have a clean sheet approach without the constraints of managing a legacy internal combustion-based business, we've been able to pivot and adapt quickly if availability of certain components is disruptive. As an example, we have been able to manage the chip shortage in partnership with our suppliers. The supply chain issues that we are experiencing from factors including components shortages, our insistence on the highest quality parts and logistics issues. In some cases, the pandemic meant that our teams could not visit our suppliers in person to ensure alignment on engineering specifications and tooling. As travel has opened back up, our supplier quality teams have been able to address many of these issues. I will note that these issues are impacting only a handful of our approximately 250 suppliers and are not affecting critical single source or dual source components like semiconductors or batteries. Instead, it's been commodity items like glass and carpets, and we've adapted by changing our specifications or indeed switching vendors if needed. In some limited cases, we are evaluating additional opportunities to move production in-house to drive further efficiencies. We believe we will move past the key bottlenecks we're experiencing in the next few months with further improvement in the second half. We're continuing to augment our skills and capabilities, and refine our processes in supply chain and logistics. As a start-up, our priority is to gain efficiency and improve as we scale. None of this is possible without an experienced team that brings decades of experience in the automotive industry, including in manufacturing and the supply chain. Indeed, we recently added Ralph Jacobs, a veteran of Audi and Volkswagen, as Vice President of Program Management to help spearhead our launch efforts alongside our existing leadership team. Overall, while we are optimistic that our current shortages will ease over the coming quarters, we also know that unexpected issues will arise in the future. And we are confident that we have and continue to augment the right team in place to manage them. We are at an inflection point in terms of consumer interest in and adoption of electric vehicles, which means our timing as we scale simply couldn't be better. The entire car market is going electric. One need not look further than the 6 Super Bowl ads for electric vehicles to know that the tide has turned, whether it's Bentley planning to be all EV by 2030, GM and Renault-Nissan investing significant sums to build EV capacities over the next few years, of all those efforts to become the first all-electric legacy automaker. We started where they're all heading, and I like our odds. As we put the first Lucid Air dream addition cars into customers' ends, we are at the forefront of one of the most significant transitions in mobility and generations. Now not all EVs are equal. Our technology supports the greatest efficiency as well as the roomiest interior for an exterior footprint of our size. And with the growing interest in EVs, the opportunity is enormous, and we are well positioned to target an expanding global market in the years ahead. We are attracting all types of consumers, not just luxury traditional car buyers, but also early EV adopters, consumers seeking performance and consumers focused on sustainability. I hope you'll stop by one of our studios to see our products up close and learn more if indeed you haven't already. As we look ahead, we are continuing to expand our retail footprint with our first studios in Europe and Middle East planned to open later this year. In addition, we are making progress in the development of new models such as our Gravity SUV. We continue to experience earnest interest in gravity, and our ambition is to make Gravity as outstanding as our first product in the sedan category. We now expect Gravity production to begin in the first half of 2024, which will help ensure meet our commitment to high-quality standards. This will also provide us additional time to implement learnings and best practices from our Air launch. I continue to personally oversee the engineering development of gravity and I'm becoming increasingly excited by its sheer disruptive potential. In closing, I'm confident we have the right combination of technology, people, products and funding to continue to break new ground in the large and growing market for electric vehicles. We have a significant cash position and a strong balance sheet to support the scaling of our business and to capture the tremendous growth ahead. We have great confidence that our technology will lead the industry in development of new products that will redefine consumers' expectations of EVs. 2021 was a great year for Lucid. And at the same time, we're only getting started. While I certainly have been frustrated by the supply chain and logistics setbacks that we've experienced, our conviction and proof points in what we can accomplish has never been greater. I'm incredibly proud of our team and everything that we've achieved to date. And with that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financials. Sherry? Thank you, Peter. Today, I'll share our Q4 and full year results, which demonstrate the progress in our business model and conviction in our future opportunities. As Peter mentioned, 2021 was a critical year in establishing the foundation of our business operationally, which is reflected in our financial results. We are very excited to have started deliveries in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 revenue was $26.4 million, including $21.3 million from the initial 125 deliveries at the Lucid Air Dream Edition, which began in October. We also recorded $4.9 million in revenues from battery pack sales from the Formula E racing series. Our results in the fourth quarter reflect the inflection point we are at, beginning to scale production and delivering vehicles while investing substantially in the future promise of the company. Cost of revenues were $151.5 million, which includes direct parts, materials, shipping and handling, overhead and estimated warranty costs. Launch costs were a meaningful part of this number in Q4. We brought in additional manufacturing and quality personnel to ramp up production. These steps represent our commitment to the highest possible quality standards. We also experienced increased logistic costs and expedited freight due to supply chain disruptions. As a result of these increased costs, we recorded an impairment charge of $48.9 million in the fourth quarter to reduce inventories to their net realizable value, less the cost to sell. In 2022, as we continue to ramp production, we expect increased freight and overhead will result in impairment charges that could negatively impact cost of sales, though this impact should lessen over time. As an item further down in the P&L, we also incurred on December 31, the $583 million noncash expense related to the mark-to-market gain on private warrants. Our R&D costs in 2021 totaled $750 million, which was in line with our expectations. These efforts are focused primarily on the development of the battery and powertrain technology, the Lucid Air, Project Gravity and future generations of our electric vehicles. We will continue to invest in our technology leadership. As more OEMs bring EVs to market, it's critical that we maintain our competitive advantages by delivering a unique combination of hardware and software that sets Lucid apart. Our Q4 SG&A costs of $197 million were comprised in part of expenses related to growing our retail studio and service network along with investment to build out our global e-commerce platforms, IT and other G&A systems. We opened 6 additional studios and service centers and have hired personnel in North America, Europe and the Middle East as we prepare the business for international sales and service in 2022. Over the next several quarters, we will continue to build out our core business systems and direct-to-consumer digital and physical infrastructure to transact with customers in new countries. Additionally, operating expenses were impacted by stock-based compensation in the amount of $151 million in Q4, including vesting under the CEO equity award agreement. We expect that additional shares will vest under the CEO equity award agreement in early March. We've also strengthened our leadership team with key hires in accounting and finance. We appointed Gagan Dhingra as Vice President of Accounting and Internal Controls and Principal Accounting Officer; and Mustally Hussain is Managing Director, Global Treasurer and Head of Financial Services. Together, they bring decades of strategic leadership experience in building accounting and financial functions at multinational public companies, attracting and retaining talented experienced people that want to be part of this new wave of transportation will be key to our success. So far, despite constraints in the labor market generally, we've been able to add talented colleagues to the Lucid team across geographies and levels in the organization. Overall, and as reflected in our financial results, we continue to invest in best-in-class technology, processes, personnel and systems. This is a theme you will continue to hear throughout 2022 as we create the infrastructure necessary to scale globally and operate effectively as a large public company. As we prioritize scaling our business, we've executed strongly against our strategic objectives, setting the stage for another growth surge in 2022 commensurate with the increasing demand for the Lucid Air. As you heard from Peter, we successfully produced 400 vehicles and delivered approximately 300 cars to our customers, and our total reservations have increased to over 25,000 as of today. We've received multiple prestigious third-party accolades as well as great feedback from customers to perceive their cars. We continue to see strong demand for our premium products. In fact, the demand for Grand Touring at $139,000 is even higher than our lower-priced Touring model. We also have seen increasing reservations for the Lucid Air Pure Trim level, which we are targeting at a price point of less than $70,000 for consumers in the U.S. after the impact of tax incentives. With our reservations reflecting estimated revenues of more than $2.4 billion, we're accelerating our plans for growth as quickly as possible. Our retail footprint grew significantly in 2021, and we reached our goal of opening 20 studios and service centers by the end of the year with additional new locations planned for 2022. In addition, we're seeing strong progress to increase our total capacity from 34,000 units to 90,000 units with the Phase II expansion of AMP 1 in Arizona coming online in late 2023. Phase 2, which is an additional 2.85 million square feet, will include an in-factory logistics center, on-site stamping facility and the relocation of our powertrain center to AMP 1 from another location in Arizona, thereby helping to speed the assembly of finished goods and improve our overall efficiency. In addition to the ground-breaking announcement, we made today about our plans to build a new manufacturing facility, we continue to explore additional sites in China and possibilities in Europe. All of these efforts underscore our global ambitions and reflect the interest we are seeing for our products around the world. As mentioned by Peter, we are managing through supply chain challenges that you've heard about in numerous companies across industries [indiscernible] season. At Lucid, we have the right experience and resources to help mitigate these issues. In some cases, we're buying ahead to reduce the risk of parts shortages. This will be a use of cash in the coming year as some items now require more than a year's lead time. In situations when suppliers have not been able to deliver, there are multiple options to resolve these issues, and we've executed on all of them as needed to effectively deal with the current situation, including collaborating with existing suppliers to improve throughput and quality, switching suppliers if we deem that the best approach and necessary enhancements cannot be executed to our satisfaction and bringing the manufacturing in-house. Our holistic approach is a key competitive advantage. And when AMP 1 Phase 2 comes online, it will allow us to become even more nimble in the quarters ahead. As we consider Lucid's global market opportunity, the strength of our balance sheet is a leading asset. Building upon our successful listing on NASDAQ, we issued $2 billion in green convertible bonds in December. We were also selected to the NASDAQ 100 in December. As a result of our successful fundraising initiatives in 2021, we ended the year with over $6.2 billion of cash on hand, which ensures we are funded well into 2023. We have multiple options for additional funding to further solidify our position, which will enable us to continue to be opportunistic in the market. Balance sheet strength and financial discipline are central to our approach as we build our infrastructure and execute on the massive opportunity ahead. In all, we invested $421 million in CapEx in 2021 and these foundational investments will help deliver on the promise of electrification. All in, with everything we've accomplished recently, we have the elements in place to execute successfully on our plans the core pillars for future scalability and growth Now turning to guidance. We're updating our outlook for 2022 production to a range of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. This projection represents our best estimate as we analyze our relationship with our suppliers and where the bottlenecks still exist in the supply chain, as well as our own internal plans to improve logistics. We expect to remain supply chain constrained in select parts of the business in the coming months, and project improvement in the second half of the year. As we look at our operating expenses for the year, we expect to continue to see investment in our vehicle programs as well as investment in our retail operations, planning and business support functions. We will also be supporting our entry into the European and Middle East markets during 2022. We anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $2 billion in 2022, which includes investment to support our manufacturing facilities and associated machinery tooling and equipment and retail network and service development, both domestically and internationally as well as software and technology investments. This represents a nearly 5x increase compared to our spending in 2021 as we work to dramatically scale our business. We are considering other accelerations and opportunistic projects and will act on them as they make sense during the year. We remain committed to our business model of starting with the production of higher trim products before moving to other tiers. With this in mind, we will be starting production of Pure later this year, which will lead to higher volumes and scaling. In closing, we are still in the early innings of the electric vehicle revolution and believe that we are well positioned to emerge as one of the winners. We're confident that we have the right technology, people, products and funding trajectory to succeed. In just a moment, Peter will make some final comments and begin the Q&A portion of today's call. Today's Q&A will feature questions fielded from some of our retail investors with the aid of the State Technologies platform, consistent with our commitment in November to introduce a mechanism to include questions from this important part of our shareholder base. We're excited to address those questions here. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Peter. Thank you. Thank you, Sherry. I hope it's clear why we're so energized by what we've accomplished in the past few months. And by how much opportunity is still ahead of us. We are looking forward to continuing our dialogue with all of you in the months ahead as we build momentum in the business. And with that, let me turn it back to Lauren to get your questions. Thank you, Peter. It is now time for our Q&A session. We will start by taking a few questions we received from investors who submitted questions on the Say technology platform. We have implemented this platform to enable shareholders to post questions directly to our management team, and we have chosen questions which address topics that we felt were not discussed in our prepared remarks. We will also take questions from our research analysts. And the first question we received from our retail investors is related to Lucid's current and forward-looking competitive strategy. Do you have any strategies in mind to compete with Tesla? Well, that's a fascinating point actually. Well, in fact, we really don't see ourselves competing directly with any particular car companies. Our goal and my goal is straight out to make the very best cars. We want to make the very best electric cars in the world. Our mission is to inspire the adoption of sustainable energy. I actually believe that Lucid Air is the best product in the world already. I believe we're at the forefront of that technology and the proof points are that we have the most efficient TV with the highest range certified by the EPA. We have a high voltage, the fastest charging. And these are also proven and validated outside by real-world third parties and customers. But what excites me the most is we're advancing state-of-the-art. I'm really confident that we can do that because I know the product road map. For me, it's product, product, product. Thank you, Peter. And our next question is supply chain related. How is Lucid approaching the chip shortage? Yes. As Peter mentioned in his prepared remarks, to date, we've not experienced a gating issue with semiconductors. And this is really for several reasons. First, Lucid has significant electrical and hardware engineering talent, and we designed many not all of our printed circuit boards in-house. Hence, when certain of these shortages have surfaced, we've been able to adjust our designs and revalidate and resource promptly, largely using our existing direct relationships. I mean second, we stay in close contact with our supply base to understand any critical shortages, and we do periodically leverage the spot market to secure chips that are at risk. And we purchased a head where it makes good business sense. In fact, just recently, I approved a purchase record ship that required a 72-week lead time. This is not a trial process to actively manage the chip shortage situation, and it does continue to evolve. But listed is really well positioned to deal with these sort of challenges because of our deep subject matter expertise and the direct relationships that we enjoy with many of the semiconductor leaders. Thank you, Sherry. And our next question. Any update on the Apple Car discussion? Well, I've been asked this question a number of times in the past. Unfortunately, we have nothing to provide related to discussions with Apple or any other potential partner at this point. But I would say, that said, we do recognize the attractiveness of our product and technology for such companies and we're always open to discussions. I mean, I think our efficiency, our connectivity, the sensor suite are significant points of attraction for such partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space or as it relates to other in-cabin monetization opportunities. I think we really recognize that we are in the process of creating a Lucid Air computer on wheels. And that software development is a huge part of that. We've been focused upon developing software as much as hardware in the past year, we brought in significant leadership from Apple and other disruptive technology companies to take our digital engineering leadership. We remain very open-minded on this front, and we're excited about potential for partnerships. We remain open-minded on this front and are excited about potential for partnership. I will now take a question from John Murphy with Bank of America. I just have 2 quick ones. First, Peter, as you think about the causal factors for the reduction in your planned production this year, I mean, you're citing supply chain. It appears that maybe some of the capacity expansion and reorganization has put forth or been prioritized over ramping volume in the near term for the benefit in the long term, and there might be some other micro issues that we can't see. I'm just wondering if you could kind of bucket those or maybe rank those in order of sort of impact. And then also as we think about this, does this change your outlook for 2023 volumes? Or is this sort of short-term pain for long-term gain? Those are interesting points. I mean, first of all, I would say that we have been primarily constrained. We've got about 250 suppliers worldwide, notionally about 3,000 parts. And this has been really a phenomenon of just a small handful of our 250 suppliers. Paradoxically, we've been mainly impacted in a commodity supply parts. For example, finished parts, trim parts for the exterior, even glass and carpet. So it's not the core technologies of the vehicle that have been largely impacting us here. And we have -- you're right, we've chosen quality over volume. We don't want to get sucked in some myopic view of short-term numbers. We're building a brand with a 10-year plan. And our customers have been really grateful and appreciative of the quality that we've built into our car, the build quality. So we prioritize quality over numbers. For 2023, just to provide a little bit of context there, the supply chain situation is quite dynamic, and we will share guidance as we experience more of the following quarters, and we'll be doing that in Q4 for sure. What we can say though is that the tooling is coming on nicely within the factory for phase 2, and that is enabling us to be able to produce up to 53,000 and Lucid Airs as we are -- by the end of 2023. So we do have the ability to -- we are bringing on this tooling that's going to enable continued availability of production. Exactly. And by way of risk mitigation, John, we're supplying particular support to some suppliers to up their processes and bring them in line with our quality expectations. Some we're actually allocating the supply to new suppliers. And in some instances, we're actually bringing processes and manufacturing in-house so that we can have a vertically integrated control of quality and volume. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a second question around the Saudi facility. Do you expect the financing to come from internal funds that you have? Or do you think the public investment fund will be a key component funding that capacity addition, I should say, even expansion, but the incremental addition of that facility in Saudi Arabia? It just sounds like there would be a lot of interest in the diversification from their standpoint, so they might be able to or willing to put more capital in. I'm just curious what your expectations are there. Well, first of all, we ended the year with $6.26 billion of cash in the balance sheet. So that in and of itself funds us really well into 2023. So as we look to launch these efforts here in 2022, we already have the cash available to us to be able to use. I mean as we move forward with our forward business plan, we plan to leverage many sources of capital. It could come from governments that could come from the capital markets, whether it be debt or equity. And right now, we see just a tremendous number of opportunities for funds. So we're going to look at what's going to be in the best interest of the shareholders. and be really opportunistic looking for cash that is efficient. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. A couple of questions. Just first, going back to the supply chain pressures. I was hoping you can maybe articulate it sounds like you expect most of the recovery to happen in the second half of the year. Maybe talk about how much visibility you have over the next few months with some of the suppliers you mentioned and just the degree of confidence of how to think about the cadence of improvement in production throughout the year. Yes. Well, we have an earning focus on addressing some of the supply chain challenges. We see them to continue for the next few months. But we see an uptake in the second half of the year. So we're really optimistic that we're going to be able to resolve these. And again, this is a small handful of suppliers. We're not talking about fundamental technologies here. We're talking largely paradoxically commodity suppliers, finishes, carpet glass and things like that. And unfortunately, you can't sell a single quality car unless those -- particularly those visible parts are absolutely perfect. So we're very optimistic that we will resolve, but it's going to take a few months, and the second half of the year, we'll see a significant uptake. And our guidance is based upon that premise. That's very helpful. Peter. And just a quick follow-up on the 25,000-plus reservations. Hoping you can give a bit more context around the regional breakdown, kind of where you're seeing the most incremental demand coming from. I don't know if you can give detail on which other vehicles or segments, some of these reservation holders are kind of coming from. Any additional comment will be helpful. So we announced we've got over 25,000 reservations. Last time we announced, we had over 17,000 mid-November. So that's well over 40% uptake. I think what's really important to recognize here is that, that is just for Lucid Air this is we haven't opened reservations for Gravity. And this is our reservations that only opened in North America, Europe and the Middle East. The lion's share of those reservations are our home market here in the U.S. And also, we have a fantastic mix here. Of course, the Dream edition is sold out. We've actually started making Grand Tourings, and Touring is coming later this year and reaching to something that really excites me the Pure before the end of this year And we've got a really healthy mix of orders between those models. Moreover, I should say, because the Dream edition was so resoundingly sold out, we are looking at how we can address that actual latent demand out there for our higher end products. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. So my first question for Sherry. So CapEx, thanks for the guidance of $2 billion this year. I have in mind that at one stage last year, you were intending to spend $900 million in '22. And then I think in July, you announced a plan to accelerate some spending. But nevertheless, the $2 billion, it feels like a further raise on that acceleration. So can you talk to us a little bit about where that additional spending is going and the benefits that should come from it? Yes. Maybe I'll start with that. Yes, of course. Actually, we were planning to spend closer to $900 million in 2021, and that was before we did that June update. In 2021, we ended up spending $421 million in CapEx. And it wasn't that anything is delayed. It's just payment of some of the CapEx ended up being shifted out by about a quarter. So a lot of that $500 million essentially is now moving into 2022. So that is increasing the base amount that you're seeing originally in 2022. And actually, our amount in 2022, the prior guidance was higher than that. It was, I believe, closer to $1.3 billion originally. And so now we're bringing in that 500 million. And then as you might recall in that June press release, we had talked about taking some of the spend, $350 million of the spend, from 2025 and '26 and moving it into the earlier years with an overall increase in CapEx with 6% to 7%. So really, you're not seeing anything different from that guidance that we provided before, you're seeing this kind of shift that's happening. Okay. Wonderful. And my second question, you mentioned some input cost inflation, maybe around logistics. Obviously, we've seen it more broadly from raw materials. I'm wondering what sort of impact we should expect from that this year? And are you intending to offset any or maybe all of it with price rises? Yes. Like many of the OEMs right now, we are definitely studying price and making sure that the value that we're providing to the customers makes sense in the context of the price that we're charging. And there may be opportunity there, and that's something we're going to continue to study over the future quarters, potentially to offset some of these increases but also it just may make good business then. So more to come on that. We're analyzing it. On the cost side, we do see this continuing logistics cost increases both in Air as well as Land and C. And so part of what we're trying to do as we're starting to stabilize and moving out of some of the early launches to move more of our parts from Air to C, which will bring down some of our costs. But despite our actions there, the costs are high regardless. So we are planning to still see these high cost throughout 2022, and we do expect that, that is going to result negative gross margin for us through 2022 due to these impacts supply chain and logistic issues, and it's just going to end up attaching itself to the inventory costs, which is going to cause -- we anticipate further impairment charges within the cost of goods sold. But we do see that lessening as the year goes by, and we're taking lots of mitigating actions. As I mentioned, things like that oversee components, moving them from air to sea. And we're looking at getting early analysis on some of the shipping channels that we have, looking at how we can aggregate shipments. So lots of actions are in the works there. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Faghri with Guggenheim Partners. Great. First, just a quick clarification on the Air production ramp. When do you expect to finish the Dream Edition deliveries and start delivering the grand touring trend? Well, we've actually started delivering the Grand Touring already. And as soon as we're able to secure sufficient parts of sufficient quality, we will complete delivery to our customers of green addition. And that can't happen soon enough for me. Great. And then on the Gravity SUV production launch now being expected in 2024 versus 2023 prior, could you provide us a bit more color on why you're pushing out the launch at this point? I think is there anything specific you'd highlight that makes you feel like it's going to take longer to get the SUV out of the door since it does seem like most of the supply chain issues impacting production now should be transporting. Yes, exactly. So I just want to make it a better product. I'm really excited with the way it's developing. It's just going to be awesome. It's taken a few twists and turns in its development to make it even better than we had anticipated. So I'm super pumped and I think it needs -- deserves just a little bit longer. We also want to integrate a lot of the learnings of productionalization from Lucid Air into that program, have that healthy feedback loop of integrating those learnings. We're going to have a transformative SUV, which is going to embody the core Lucid DNA, product DNA, the space concept. And what compact on the outside, more space, more practicality, more luxury on the inside. And we're going to have an ultra-high efficiency SUV, which nobody has ever done before. And we will next take our investor question through the Say Technologies platform. What's the future plan in terms of expanding sales and charging stations? Thanks, Lauren. Yes, we are actively and thoughtfully investing in our retail studio and service center footprint. -- support our customers throughout their customer journey. And that's everything from discovery and initial interactions with our product and technology all the way through over-the-air updates and post sales and service. As we disclosed, we have increased our studio and service center footprint to 20 locations by the end of 2021. All of those were in North America, and we brought our first Canadian operation online in Q4. And we're excited to be entering the European and Middle East markets in 2022 and we have started working our Munich location, and we expect to open it this spring. And then we also have several other domestic and international announcements planned throughout this year. I should also mention that we have mobile vans deployed in over a dozen major metropolitan areas already, and we're going to be expanding that throughout the year as well. On the charging front, first off, we're fortunate to have the longest range and the fastest charging vehicles. So our charging frequency and duration is shortened. That said, we are continuing to enjoy the partnership that we've established with Electrify America, and we're actively studying whether it makes sense to deploy specific high-speed charging infrastructure on a case-by-case basis. We're also watching the deployment plans for charging infrastructure that's funded by the U.S. government, and we're excited to hear that with the joint office that's being developed between transportation and energy, that they're looking to get some of these first charging infrastructure in place and online as soon as the end of this year. And so that's also going to benefit all of us in the EV sector. So we're excited about that as well. Great. Thank you, Sherry. And the last question we will take from the Say technology platform. What are the next plans for the company? And where do you see Lucid in 10 years? Well, as we discussed in our previous remarks, right now, we’re focused on ramping up production and achieving delivery targets. And we’ve got a laser focus on the team, the company is just laser-focused on that. As we seek to fulfil what is now 25,000 reservations, over 25,000 that have been placed by customers for just the listed air. So now we’ve got grand touring in production and then the next product is already taking place. Then we’ve got Touring coming later this year. But the one that I’m really excited about is Pure. Pure is on schedule for late this year, the Pure version of Lucid Air in its purest most affordable form. And we’re expanding our manufacturing footprint as well, and both now through expansion at our AMP 1 on factory in Arizona, and that’s through phase 2. That will add 2.85 million square feet to our production footprint and will increase our annual production capacity in Arizona up to 90,000 vehicles per annum. And in addition, we’ll be building out our AMT 2, our second factory, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, our first assembly site overseas. And that, alone will add another 150,000-vehicle production per annum As discussed, we continue to look on Lucid Gravity. That’s on track for the first half of ‘24. I’m super excited about how disruptive an SUV this is going to be. And overall, we have the industry’s leading EV sedan, and we started customer deliveries. It’s a significant achievement for our company. Next step is really about scaling. Scaling, scaling, scaling. And capturing the tremendous opportunities ahead just as our consumer interest in EVs is reaching this inflection point. And of course, I’m a product guy, it’s going to be scale, scale, scale. Product, product. This is a technology race. But to wrap up, I’d like to just say a few words, how grateful we are to all our stakeholders, to the employees, to investors, to our suppliers, our partners for helping us in the progress and for helping realizing this all-important mission. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Maynard Um, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you and welcome to Lucid Group’s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO and Sherry House, our CFO.

A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in the investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Lucid’s CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard. In Q1, we delivered 360 vehicles to customers, nearly tripling the 125 cars delivered in Q4 of 2021. Furthermore, in April alone, we delivered well over 300 vehicles demonstrating our accelerated production ramp. And this growth progression keeps us nicely on track for our 12,000 to 14,000 production targets as Sherry will tell us more about shortly.
We are pleased with the demand we are seeing and now we have more than 30,000 reservations as of today. Note that this 30,000 figure does not include the recent up to 100,000 car deal with the Government of Saudi Arabia, which is entirely incremental. I’d like to thank the entire Lucid team for their dedication and hard work. We are off to a great start. And we are only just beginning. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. But we are up for the challenge. And we are on track for some great milestones this year.
In just two short quarters since we started deliveries, we have garnered many industry accolades reaching out some very well established luxury car brands. Lucid Air is now used in the same breadth as some of the best known luxury car luminaries in the market. And that’s truly amazing if you think about it. In the first quarter, Lucid was named the Best Luxury Electric Car by U.S. News & World Report. It was named Luxury Electric Vehicle of the Year by Cars.com and Best Car to Buy 2022 by Green Car Reports. Edmunds very recently reported an unprecedented 505 miles in their real world EV range test of the Lucid Air Dream R, a new record. But most importantly, it’s our customers who are truly delighted with Lucid Air. I believe as we get more of our vehicles into our customers’ hands and as we expand our test drive program, our momentum will just continue to build.
We are nearing completion of deliveries of Lucid Air Dream edition and commenced deliveries of Air Grand Touring in the first quarter, also having announced the new Air Grand Touring performance model in April. The dual motor Grand Touring performance delivers 1050 horsepower, making it the most powerful electric vehicle currently available in North America, combined with an exceptional EPA estimated 446 miles range. The Air Grand Touring with up to 516 miles of EPA estimated range has an unprecedented efficiency of 4.6 miles per kilowatt hour.
And I’d like to spend a minute or two on this, because I don’t believe the importance of EV efficiency is well-understood today. In order to drive widespread EV adoption, we must address the cost of making EVs. And here, the really fundamental question is not how much does a battery cost per se, in terms of dollars per kilowatt hour, but moreover, how much does it cost to endow an EV with given amount of range? For example, how much does it cost to create an EV with say 200 miles range or 300 miles range or a 400 mile EV? In this context, it’s crucial to compare, which is the better route to achieve this goal, a reduction in battery cost or an increase in efficiency. Well, with say, a 10% increase in efficiency, it is possible to achieve the same range with a 10% smaller and therefore 10% less expensive battery. For example, we believe we can endow Lucid Air Pure, with over 400 miles range with a battery pack size of less than 90 kilowatt hours, a significant battery downsize and therefore cost saving and commercial advantage over the competition. But efficiency also drives other very important benefits. Unlike a gasoline car, where the benefit of efficiency is only felt at the cost of a fill-up at the gas station, an efficient EV is a fundamentally superior product in many ways, influencing weight, agility, range, and interior space and comfort.
Reducing battery cost, although not to be dismissed, fundamentally only really benefits the cost of manufacture, whereas we expect increasing efficiency to benefit not only the cost of manufacture, but also the lifetime running costs plus the lifetime environmental footprint both through energy consumption and through raw material usage. This final advantage is not to be dismissed likely, because in a world with a potentially limited raw material supply chain, efficiency becomes the enabler for the manufacture of more electric cars. So, our first step has been to deliver a vehicle with a longer range than anyone else in the market. And our next step, later this year, will be to deliver a vehicle with a range of over 400 miles. But to achieve this with a smaller battery pack than the competition and this is Lucid’s commercial advantage.
Now, we are only able to do this, because we design, develop and manufacture our own technology in-house. It’s the combination of a proprietary ultra compact powertrain, state-of-the-art high voltage inverter, our bidirectional 900 volt wonder box, exceptional aerodynamic design, and our scalable and modular battery pack, which is based on our extensive Formula E race experience. I am aware of only one other who has the technology vertical integration we do. You simply cannot achieve this by buying off-the-shelf components. And I am proud to say that our efficiency is industry leading among commercially available passenger vehicles, while others will try to catch up to where we are today. We are not standing still.
We are improving on our technological advancements and will drive more innovations and efficiency to remain ahead of the competition. We also continue to make great strides in our software and developed 11 over-the-air software updates in Q1. We hear our customers and we are delivering on their constructive feedback, many through over-the-air updates. We designed our vehicles from a clean sheet to be one of the most advanced in the market. And with world class vehicle technology that will enable us to deliver more features and enhancements without customers having to bring their vehicles in for service. We have the capability to control even the smallest of details in the car via software. With our software-defined vehicles, we can change everything from how the door handles function to increasing key fob battery life. And we will continue to strive to meet the high standards of our customers by making their Lucid better and better over time.
So, we think we are extremely well positioned in the technology race, but we need to get Lucid Air’s into the hands of more customers and ramping production of quality vehicles is my top priority. We have over 30,000 customer reservation holders as of today, demonstrating growing interest in Lucid and rising demand even as new competitors arrive. So, we are intently focused on production as well as our expansion. And as you can see from the photo in the shareholder presentation, the AMP factory expansion in Arizona is seeing tremendous progress. And once complete, we will have an additional 2.85 million square feet of production footprint and increased that annual production capacity in Arizona to 90,000 vehicles per year. We are also very excited to be breaking ground on our new factory in Saudi Arabia soon. And very shortly, we will have a grand opening of our Munich studio, signaling the arrival of Lucid to the EU market. Now, more on this next week when we will debut our EU plans. So, our global expansion plans are on track.
Now having said, I do want to highlight them supply chain dynamics are very fluid. And the COVID lockdowns in China that’s impacting others in the industry are also resulting in some bottlenecks for us. But our team is doing an incredible job mitigating this to keep us on track. We also announced today that we are increasing prices of our vehicles that will go into effect at the beginning of June. The world has changed dramatically from the time we first announced Lucid Air back in September 2020. And I want to assure our existing reservation holders that we will be honoring current pricing for all existing customers as well as new reservations made before the end of the month. In order to ensure fairness and prioritization, we will be reaching out to reservation holders to facilitate order configurations in order to lock in pricing as their specified model becomes available.
Now lastly, I want to highlight a landmark agreement we made with the Government of Saudi Arabia on April 20. The government has undertaken to purchase up to 100,000 Lucid vehicles. This is one of the single largest electric vehicle purchases that I am aware of and we are delighted to be supporting Saudi Arabia in achieving its sustainability goals and net zero ambitions by bringing our advanced luxury EVs to Saudi Arabia. Sherry will go into more details on this momentarily.
So, in closing, I believe the electric vehicle market is still in the very early days of secular growth. And I have never been more excited than I am today about our technology, our products, our team and our future. I firmly believe this is a technology race that is set to play out over the coming years. And I am highly confident that we are well placed to be a leader with our state-of-the-art in-house developed technology.
With that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financials. Sherry? Thank you, Peter. Despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, we continue to see terrific progress in the business. This is largely due to the perseverance and astute problem-solving capabilities of the Lucid team across manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and engineering. We are also grateful to our global supply base who worked tirelessly with us to find real-time solutions to a very complicated and fluid supply chain situation. We are very pleased with the reservation momentum we are experiencing. We are seeing excellent increasing traffic to our Lucid Studios as well as visits to our website in our award winning vehicle configurator, all indicating accelerating interest in the Lucid brand.
I’d now like to turn our attention to our first quarter financial results. Our Q1 revenue was $57.7 million, which represents a quarter-by-quarter increase of 113%. We remain committed to scaling your business and expect to see significant growth in revenue as our delivery volumes ramp across GT, touring and pure models. Cost of revenue in the first quarter was approximately $246 million. This expected increase was primarily related to personnel and overhead costs as we ramp up production as well as higher logistic costs and expedited freight due to ongoing supply chain disruption.
As a result of these increased costs, we recorded an impairment charge of $96.4 million in the first quarter to reduce inventories to their net realizable value. If noted last quarter, we expect increased freight in overhead will result in impairment charges, which will negatively impact cost of revenue in 2022. So we expect this impact to lessen over time. R&D expense was $186.1 million in line with our expectations.
Peter talks about how our efficiency is driven by the in-house design, development and manufacturing of our own proprietary technology and we continue to focus on pushing the technology envelope. Specifically, we are investing in state-of-the-art battery and powertrain equipment and facilities, software advancements in world class talent. SG&A expense of $223.2 million was comprised in part of expenses related to growing our retail studio and service network, along with investments to build-out our systems and personnel globally. We opened 4 additional studios and service centers and continue to prepare for growth in North America, Europe and the Middle East this year.
GAAP-based compensation in the quarter was approximately $175 million, $116 million of this amount was in SG&A, $50 million was in research and development, and the balance of $8.5 million within was in cost of revenues. In other income, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $523 million related to the mark-to-market value of private warrants. Value of the warrants can be influenced quarter to quarter by a number of factors, including Lucid Group’s end-of-quarter share price.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with close to $5.4 billion of cash on hand, which we expect will fund us well into 2023. We have multiple options for additional funding to further solidify our position, which will enable us to continue to be opportunistic in the market. Capital expenditures were $185 million in Q1 and we expect CapEx for the year to be around $2 billion as we continue to invest in the incredible opportunity ahead. Our 2022 CapEx will be used for facility in machinery and equipment expansion in Arizona, retail and service center development, early investment in Saudi Arabia, and other CapEx associated with vehicle and component development.
We remain committed to scaling our business and are executing against our strategic objectives. Ramping production is the high priority to fulfill growing demand is reselling every vehicle we can make. As Peter indicated earlier, we successfully delivered 360 cars to our customers in Q1. And in April alone, we delivered over 300 vehicles demonstrating our accelerated production ramp. Total reservations grew to 30,000 as of today, which doesn’t include the additional 100,000 units from the agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia and we believe interest will continue to increase as the number of Lucid Airs on the road grows and as more consumers are able to experience this luxury and performance in-person.
We continue to build out our physical presence through our expanding retail studio and service footprint. We added 4 new locations in Toronto, New Jersey, Arizona and Southern California in the first quarter for a total of 24 and more recently opened a location in Boston. We have additional new locations planned for 2022, including the grand opening of our first European studio in Munich, Germany next week. In the first quarter, we started deliveries with the Grand Touring Air, and in April, we announced the Grand Touring Performance.
We announced pricing for the Grand Touring Performance at $179,000, reflecting our appreciation for our early Lucid Air Dream purchasers, but also reflecting cost increases in the commodity, supply chain and logistics and market. To combine these fluid market dynamics, we are announcing price increases to our Lucid Air volume. As of June 1, the new pricing will be $154,000 for Grand Touring, $107,400 for Touring, and $87,400 for Pure. And as Peter said, we will honor current pricing for all existing customer reservations as well as new reservations made before the end of the month, as long as potential customers convert their reservations to orders within 30 days of the opening of the order system.
While we are and always will be intently focused on finding ways to lower the cost of making our vehicles and providing value to our loyal customer base, we also need to be mindful of the changing industry dynamics and we will continue to be vigilant and take action as necessary. As Peter also mentioned, we entered into a landmark agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia, where they will undertake to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period. The initial commitment is to purchase 50,000 vehicles with an option to purchase up to an additional 50,000 vehicles. Deliveries will start no later than 2023. And we expect orders will range from 1,000 to 2,000 vehicles annually and increase to 4,000 to 7,000 vehicles starting in 2025. The purchase price of the vehicles will be determined based on the lower the standard retail price for the applicable vehicle in Saudi Arabia and the standard retail price for the applicable vehicle in the United States plus the logistics and importation costs and other costs of delivering and homologating vehicles to meet the regulations of Saudi Arabia.
We are also excited to announce that we will be breaking ground very shortly on our previously announced manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, which should enable us to meet the growing demand for Lucid’s products over time. On our last earnings call, we announced agreements with the Ministry of Investment in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Investment Development Fund in the King Abdullah Economic City. We are honored to be a part of the country’s vision of transformation in their commitment to advancing the automotive ecosystem in the manufacturing of sustainable transportation in the country.
Moving to our production outlook, similar to many companies in our industry, we continue to face global supply chain and logistics challenges, including COVID-related factory shutdowns in China. We are working closely with our suppliers to mitigate the impact of disruption. While any extended disruptions could result in an impact to our production forecast, today, we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 vehicle production guidance for 2022 based on the information we have at this point combined with our mitigation plan.
We are also reiterating our CapEx of roughly $2 billion in 2022 and continue to believe our current cash on hand is sufficient to fund our scaling well into 2023. From a product perspective, we are excited to start delivering the Air Grand Touring Performance in June in the Air Touring and Air Pure later this year, with Project Gravity SUV remaining on target to begin production in the first half of 2024 and much more to come.
In closing, I want to thank our dedicated and talented employees and our partners and suppliers who are working to bring our award winning products to the global marketplace. We are confident that our in-house technology, coupled with our investments in our manufacturing sales and service footprint will enable us to meet our growing customer demand and provide substantial benefit for all of our stakeholders. Following Peter’s closing remarks we will begin the Q&A portion of today’s call. Today’s Q&A will feature questions from some of our retail investors, an important constituency of our shareholder base through the state technologies platform.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Peter for closing remarks. Thank you, Sherry. We are intently focused on ramping production this year to get more of our award winning vehicles into customers’ hands. And this is a top priority and we are pushing hard. Our geographic expansion plans are progressing as planned. And I believe our product roadmap is second to none with the Grand Touring Performance, Grand Touring Pure and Project Gravity on schedule for their respective timelines and we will have more to share with you in the future.
And with that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get to your questions. Maynard? Thank you, Peter. We will now start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is how do you intend to compete with both Tesla and Rivian given current supply chain and market constraints? Well, we are highly confident that we can compete against the very best based upon our EV technology leadership. I mean, we compete on our technology differentiation, on our unprecedented efficiency and in our in-house vertical integration. And I talked about our unprecedented efficiency in my prepared remarks and how this is only possible because we design, develop and manufacture our own technology in-house, we truly vertically integrated and you cannot achieve this just by buying off-the-shelf components. We also differentiate ourselves by having a luxury brand mindset. We are focused on quality and having a customer-centric approach to our direct-to-consumer experience. We want our brand to reflect not only the best EV in the market, but also the experience of that to our customers. But the EV market is not a zero sum game today. I mean, we compete in a global car market and unless not forget our primary competition is gasoline cars, not other EVs. I have said before I don’t believe there is such a thing as just the market for EVs. There is a market for cars. And the EV market penetration is very low today. We believe the EV share will come at the expense of gasoline cars. So I am incredibly optimistic as we have tremendous amount of runway ahead of us. Sherry? Yes, I’d also add that in my prepared remarks, I spoke about the supply chain challenges that are impacting the entire automotive industry. Now, we have been able to mitigate some of these issues because of our vertical integration and our in-house design capabilities. When you design your own tech, it just allows you an increased level of flexibility and control. For example, because we design many of our own printed circuit boards, we have been able to redesign, qualify, and even source a different ship directly from our existing semiconductor supply base that we have direct relationships with. In other situations, as I mentioned last quarter, we have been buying ahead in the spot market and we continue to work really closely with our supply base to mitigate impact and look at risks ahead of time. But in some cases, we have had to switch suppliers and we have even in-sourced where it made engineering and financial sense. Our next question is the investor presentation in July 2021 mentioned the prototype energy storage system progressing well. How is the Lucid energy storage system progressing now and when do you expect production for the Lucid ESS to begin? Yes. Well, we are primarily focused on vehicles today, but we do fully recognize that our tank is extensible to other growth markets that we can help drive our sustainability mission. We analyzed different markets to understand where our tech could give us the unique advantage to compete with and one of the most promising ones we pulled out was with energy storage or EFS. Now, our first prototype has validated the capability of our technology. It’s running and it’s here at our headquarters here in Silicon Valley. It’s attached to our solar field array and it’s working well. And we have installed a significant solar array at our AMP1 factory in Arizona and that is in readiness to connect and integrate our second prototype there at the factory and this is currently in the development phase. Yes. And to put this in context, it’s a small amount of our people and financial resources today. But we see a lot of future potential here. We have been examining and we are examining multiple end markets, including residential, commercial, industrial and utility to see where it might be best for us to play today. But right now, we are focused firstly and laser focused on the vehicle market, but we will be sure to keep you apprised since we have anymore to say on this topic as developments come forth. Our next question is with the report of Saudi Arabia buying upwards of 100,000 cars from the company, do you think that will drive more buyers from other areas of the world or are there other big orders such as that that aren’t just – that just aren’t public? Thanks, Maynard. Yes, we are seeing many [Technical Difficulty] legislation from a number of other countries towards achieving a goal of zero emission and it aligns with the mission of our company to bring sustainable technologies to the world. We are thrilled that Saudi Arabia shown such vision and commitment to our company. The government undertook to purchase up to 100,000 Lucid vehicles. And we believe they are buying very best EV tech there is. The purchase price of the vehicles will be based on our standard retail prices as we shared in our earlier announcement. Just to put this in context, this is one of the single largest electric vehicle purchases that we are aware of and we are delighted to be – to support Saudi Arabia and achieving its sustainability goals and net-zero ambition. I also want to highlight that in connection with the King Abdullah Economic City, the SIDF and the Mesa agreements that we signed in February, we expect to receive up to $3.4 billion in financing and incentives with respect to CapEx and operations for manufacturing factory in KSA. This includes financing provided by the SIDF loan and that’s disclosed in our 10-Q. In addition, we recently secured a revolver facility from Gulf International Bank, which is also disclosed in our subsequent events section if you want more detail. We also expected the unprecedented efficiency that we have, aligns very strongly with what fleet operators care about. And there is many benefits also to our bidirectional technology. So we have anything to announce [Technical Difficulty] to-date, we think our efficiency and our bidirectional technology are going to be a really important part of the value proposition to the set of potential customers. Our next question is what is Lucid’s plan for a charging network? Tesla obviously has the advantage over the EV market right now with their network of chargers. Will Lucid be mirroring a similar solution or will there be an adapter to utilize other charging networks? Yes. Well, I mean, first of all, the remarkable efficiency and range of Lucid Air, I mean, you can replace range anxiety or the range confidence, you can go further in the first place. And we also have an advantage, because we have the fastest charging car in the world. We have demonstrated up to 300 miles range in about 22 minutes. It’s a profound commercial and technology advantage. You simply charge less when you have greater efficiency and the longest usable range. And also, I believe that we have a significant second mover advantage. We have got a 900 volt vehicle, others are at 400 volts and we have a much faster charging vehicle. And when you need to charge, you can charge your Lucid Air virtually anywhere in North America using an open source combined charging system, the CCS plug, the current standard, that’s super important that we have open source. And then we combined the Air’s wonder box boost charger cannot automatically recognize your Air, adjust the incoming voltage and boost voltage for the quickest possible charge. So, it’s got boost voltage capability. And this means makes charging easy at home or at any public station. And you can also charge up by plugging the included Lucid mobile charging cable into a typical household outlets or a NEMA 14-50 for a faster rate of charge. Now, that said along with Air’s astonishing range, you can also benefit from our partnership with Electrify America and the most extensive network of ultra-fast public charging stations nationwide and they have over 750 stations and over 3,300 chargers I believe across the U.S. and plan to have more by the end of the year. And don’t forget, when you reserve an Air by June 30, 2022, you get complimentary access to up to 350 kilowatt charging for 3 full years in the USA. Next question, are you planning on releasing a new vehicle this year? If so, when do you think it would come out? Thanks, Maynard. Yes, so the answer to that is yes, in our outlook section of the shareholder presentation, also in my prepared remarks, we said we would have the Air Grand Touring Performance in June and then that’s going to be sequentially followed by the Air Touring and the Air Pure later this year and of course, we still have the production of the Project Gravity SUV starting in the first half of 2024. Thank you. We will now take some questions from the phone lines. David, can we take the first question, please? [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just I was hoping you could share the production numbers in Q1, I apologies if I missed it earlier to and also where you were in April. I know you talked about deliveries for the quarter and production for the full year, but hoping to get a sense of where you are on the production ramp? Yes, Sherry. Hey, great to have you with us, by the way. We had 360 deliveries in Q1, and then asked for production vehicles in Q1, we have nearly 700. Perfect, any kind of early update on Q2, maybe an April number? Itay, we actually delivered over 300 vehicles to customers in April. And this is a very interesting progression, on this a geometric progression we are seeing, yes. Because in Q1 of this year, we delivered 360 to the customers, very nearly tripled what we delivered to customers 125 in Q4 of last year. And then we say over 300 customer deliveries in April. And it’s so easy to do sort of invalid math here, people take a quarter they multiply with four and come to the wrong answer for the year. This is a progression. It’s almost a geometric progression that we are seeing unfolding. So, Itay, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 guidance for the balance of the year. So, as long as the supply chain logistics disruptions aren’t material and our mitigation plans are effective, we have been watching the China lockdown situation really closely. We have had a little bit of impact there. We had a couple of days that we did shutdown. And we did have a little bit of slowing for about a week and a half in April. But we have mitigation plans in place. We are able to get access to some warehouses. We are able to move production to another area of China in one case. And so as long as things continue to progress and really resolve through the course of May, we are feeling comfortable with what we have stated. We will reiterate saying, we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 vehicle production forecast for ‘22. And that’s based on the information we have at this point combined with our current mitigation plans. Great. That’s very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. On the price increase, I think you alluded to a bit before, is that all reflective of higher input costs. And if you can maybe talk a little more detail about specific cost increases, you are seeing kind of what’s sort of in there that you are trying to kind of cover for? Yes. Sure. Let me provide some context there. Well, first of all, the pricing actions that will be effective June 1sr won’t start to impact our financials in a meaningful way, likely until 2023. There might be some slight positive impacts in 2022. Our raw material exposures have been ranching, call at 5% to 10% of our bond costs depending on the vehicle variant. And these actions will help to offset those inflationary pressures throughout this year, which are typically delay to the way the contracts are written. Usually the indices move and then we pay either the quarter or semi-annually following that. We do have other exposures though including expedites, which had been very high due to the supply chain disruptions and record freight prices. We also have a little bit of exposure on steel and construction costs, a lot of that’s locked in for our Phase 2. But we do have a little bit of exposure on the back end with respect to steel. So, looking ahead, I would say our current belief is that costs will stay elevated or slightly higher than they are today for the next couple of quarters. And then we are expecting some stabilization might occur. Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you. Sure. David, we will take our next question, please. Of course. We will take our next question from Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, again, just on the price rises that you have announced today. So, I think it’s, the price rises are between 8% to 13%. And if I look at some of your competition, I note that Rivian raised its prices, on average by 18% back in March, Tesla has raised the price for Model S by 25%, over the last 12 months. So, do you think that there is further room for raising the prices that you have on the Lucid Air, especially given the quality of the product, as you mentioned? Let’s say- I would say about that, good to have you with us here today. I think we don’t know for certain the situation is very fluid. We are actively monitoring it. And we will act as required. We are pushing ahead also, though, with many engineering changes and cost reduction initiatives that are aimed at lowering our cost basis for the vehicles. So, that is helping to offset some of this as well. But if we do have to raise further, one of the things that we are comforted by is we know that we offer a very unique value proposition to customers. And we believe there is no other vehicle on the market that offers the same combination of efficiency, performance, range, space and design that we have. So, like other companies, we are experiencing these real increases in commodities. And you were just going to have to balance the benefits that we provide to all our stakeholders, whether it would be our customers, or suppliers or investors. But we believe that the action we are taking right now best optimizes. And then as for future, we are just going to have to watch and see. And then Charles, I think Sherry raises a really salient point here. It’s not recognized sufficiently. Efficiency advantage becomes a commercial advantage. We can provide a car with competitive range for a smaller battery pack, and that helps in our cost structure. Great. Thank you. And my second question is on the batteries. And can you just remind us what your current battery cell supplier relationships are, how they are structured, and the extent to which higher raw material input costs will hit you in 2022, or whether or not it’s sort of delayed to 2023 and beyond. And finally, how much battery capacity is already locked in with your suppliers and until when? Sure. So, we have long-term contracts with two of the major global suppliers at LG and Samsung. Those are multi-year in nature. We also have some state side production that’s going to be coming on board as well. On the raw materials side, we are exposed, like most companies are to the raw materials in the batteries. But we are fortunate and that we can leverage the buying power of LG and Samsung, their access to these raw materials going forward. Now, as per our availability, we are covered fully through this year. And we also have most of our coverage for the next couple of years. But we are working with both LG and Samsung as well as another company that we are in the process of validating this fall that we expect will come on board with them either later this year or early next year. And we are working with these three groups in order to supply the balance of what we need. But right now things are looking promising at this point. Right. Thank you. David, we will take our next question, please. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Good afternoon, everybody. First question on Lucid Air facilities, I think if I heard it right that the price was $179,000 and this is indeed as far as I can tell amidst the level it’s been announced, so not just in addition to the pricing [Technical Difficulty]. So is that number correct? And two, how much opportunity in the Air [Technical Difficulty] to product performance versions of your product [Technical Difficulty] very strong mix and how this took place? Okay. There was a lot of static in the line John. I think we got some of that. I think you were asking about the GTP, the GT Performance pricing. You are right, that is $179,000. That does sit above the new pricing that we have just launched for the GT, which will be $154,000 effective June 1st. The base was $139,000. It will stay on the GT and will stay that through May 31st. Now, I think you were asking a little bit about like our revenue generation capability and maybe the ability of this product, Peter if you would talk maybe a bit about how you see, customers desire for this product? Indeed, Sherry, I mean what happened was that we were oversubscribed, very significantly oversubscribed, for Dream Edition. And customers were asking, well hey, we want – we have 1,000 horsepower car, people are going crazy here. Where is the 1,000 horsepower car, we want 1,000 horsepower car. So, we quickly turned around, and we are very responsive. We are a tech company, we put this and we created the GT-Performance, 1,050 horsepower. Now, that price reflects our commitment to Dream Addition customers. They put commitment and faith in us. And I think they got it. So maybe to follow-up if you can hear me better now picked up my handset. I would say it helps. How much opportunity could be potentially be in your performance versus [indiscernible] and took advantage of mix not just raising price? Very difficult, it’s same here John. He is asking about on the ability to do more of these in the future. I think there is always an opportunity. I think some, well, I mean this is this is showing the power of the brand. And it’s showing that the product defines the brand. We are being considered as a brand that can command this sort of position in the market against the traditional Grand already, because of the premise of our product. And the other thing, I think you may have touched on this just mix generally. Let me give you a little bit of context there. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see the demand for the GT product exceeding the Touring and we are building the GT products now. We will then be building the Touring, then the Pure as we are exiting the year. You are going to continue to see very strong mix throughout this year, slightly decreasing as you sequentially bring on these other products that are priced slightly lower. And that’s really healthy position for us. Because as we are ramping up, carefully maintaining the quality, it’s great for us that we can sell higher end products through that ramp up and don’t have to transition to more affordable products quite yet. It’s absolutely right, Peter, because the absorption costs will start to improve over time as the volume increases as we get through the next couple of quarters and into next year. So, you are going to start to see some relief on what you are seeing happening right now in the negative gross margin, as that greater level of production comes on board. Yes. And we are seeing it reflected in the 30,000 orders that we have now got the reservation, that it’s 30,000 reservations, a very healthy mix between the GT touring NPO. [Technical Difficulty] Sure. So, the revolver is from Gulf International Bank, that is in addition to the $3.4 billion of financing and incentives that we had mentioned. Now, in the 10-Q and the notes, you can go to Note 6, you go to Note 19 and 20, you are going to see some detail in there, about the GIB of loan, how its structured. You also also see mentioned to the GIB in there, the Gulf International Bank revolver, the $267 million that you just referenced. You will also see in there information about our lease that we are getting through the King Abdullah Economic City. And you will be able to see some of the dollars associated with that as well. So, they asked giving you some of the tools, you need to be able to understand the financing that is available to us. And then additionally, there is incentives. Now, we did decide to proactively adopt a new government assistance standard, a disclosure standard as of January 1st of this year. So, as any of these incentives, or any of these loan items come on board on our balance sheet in impact, we will be showing them in the financial statements through notes and disclosures. So, you will be able to get information fairly real-time with respect to that. You were breaking up a little bit, I think you were asking about the $5.4 billion of cash on hand, we continue to feel really good about our ability to be well into 2023. And the addition of some of these financing packages has continued to strengthen our liquidity situation and their access to financing. We did have some of that baked into our forward model. But this continues to de-risk that for us. Right. David, we will take the next question. And there are no further questions on the phone at this time. I will turn the call back to you Maynard. Thank you. So, we will now take our last retail investor question before concluding the call. And the last question is what is Lucid’s 5-year plan? Oh Maynard, I think this is my favorite question. I think we didn’t pose this ourselves. It’s about product, product, product. I am an engineer, product is king. And a great brand is built by having the best products, and it’s actually defined by those products. And I am so excited, we are going to do Pure project Gravity SUV, and further drive technology innovation. We have a roadmap and a tech roadmap to keep on advancing. Now, really what we have done so far. Step one, was to establish Lucid as a global luxury brand and create a vehicle with incredible range through efficiency. We have done that. Now, step two is even more interesting, because that is to scale globally into the premium segment, and to commercialize vehicles that use smaller battery packs with competitive range versus other vehicles in the market. And I have already noted that ramping production is my top priority. We are making really good strides here. Again, efficiency is our key USP. Now beyond that, I am aiming for a mid-size platform in a decade. I am really enthusiastic about that. We could only do this by starting off by creating a technology flagships and Gravity first, by advancing the technical efficiency and setting a new EV benchmarks and then my making more affordable products. Remember, we design all our EV powertrain in a sense, we develop it or we manufacture it all in our special factory in Arizona. And we think we can become even more efficient over time. And that will translate well into our product roadmap. Sherry? Sure. And if you look at our current manufacturing plans, we expect a capacity for 500,000 vehicles annually as we crossed the mid-decade mark. So, to break it down, we are going from 34,000 capacity in Arizona to 90,000 with our Phase 2 expansion. If we complete the ample on Phase 2 expansion, we will move directly into Phase 3. And we believe that can get us to about 350,000 annual vehicle capacity in Arizona. Then you add the 150,000 vehicle capacity from Saudi Arabia. And that gets you to about 500,000 by just after mid-decade. And then to remind investors we do we have the $5.4 billion on the balance sheet as we just spoke with John Murphy. We do also have access to this finance staying in the kingdom. And we believe that this funds to flow into 2023. Exactly, Sherry. So and we are very focused on product, product, product in our long-term plan. Near-term, we are focused on ramping production and getting more vehicles into customers’ hands. And I have to say in closing, I have never been more excited I am today about our tech, our products, our team and our future. The electric vehicle market is still in its very early days of secular growth. And I believe our focus on product, technology, quality and service will put us in an enviable market position. Thank you, Peter. This concludes Lucid’s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining us today. And you may now disconnect.","i would like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Maynard Um . a discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings press release . in Q1, we delivered 360 vehicles to customers, nearly trip trip to new york .",0.0

Welcome to the Lucid Group Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today. Maynard Um, you may begin. Thank you, and welcome to Lucid Group's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Sherry House, our CFO.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call, particularly those regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events, are based on the information that we have as of today and include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, and we refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, as well as other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC for a full discussion of such risks, uncertainties and other factors.
Forward-looking statements made during today's call speak only as of the time they are made, and we are under no obligation and expressly disclaim any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon, as well as in the investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard. In Q2, we continued to see strong customer demand for our vehicles, with over 37,000 customer reservations as of today. That's an increase of more than 7,000 in the quarter, up from 30,000 reservations as we reported last quarter.
Now this 37,000 figure does not include our agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles, which is entirely incremental, nor indeed does it include potential reservations for our forthcoming SUV, the Project Gravity, nor even potential reservation for Lucid Air in markets outside of North America, Middle East and Europe.
As such, we are very pleased with the reaction from customers and excitement surrounding Lucid Air. And we believe that as we get more of our vehicles into our customers' hands and expand our test drive program that our momentum will just continue to build.
We're also pleased to report that Lucid Air continues to garner many industry accolades vesting some very well-established luxury car brands. Now for example, we debuted the 1,050 horsepower Lucid Air grand touring performance in June at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK, which features some of the world's fastest vehicles.
Although Lucid Air grand touring performance recorded a Goodwood Hill time climb of 50.79 seconds in the shoot-out, and that's the fastest time of any production road car at the event and the 12th fastest time overall, which included many racing cars.
Now to be clear, only racing cars were faster at the event and many of the racing cars were not as fast. Now this demonstrable performance advantage lies in Lucid's in-house EV powertrain technology. Lucid designs, develops and manufactures all our core EV body in-house.
This vertical integration differentiates Lucid from virtually every other car manufacturer today. However, with all that positive momentum, I do have to say that this quarter has proven to be a very challenging period. And whilst we have experienced supply chain and logistics challenges along with the entire industry, the limitations of our logistics system have compounded the challenge.
And although we continue to face supply chain constraints, the resolution of some earlier gating component supply issues allowed us to push towards increasing the production rate. And as we attempted to push forward the rate, we found that our logistics constraints prevent us from scaling meaningfully this past quarter.
For example, our ability to speed the correct part through align at the correct time and cadence. Our each car is built with thousands of parts and do this whilst maintaining a high Lucid quality build standards.
So with that, let me walk you through our first half and Q2 production and delivery figures to provide a little context. In the first half of 2022, we produced 1,405 vehicles. These were factory-dated vehicles, and this means that they are completed and ready for delivery to customers.
But in Q2, we also made a significant number of vehicles that we did not factory gate instead electing to hold them back in order to ensure that these cars met the highest standard of quality. Remember, quality must take a priority over volume as a luxury brand, and I'll touch on quality a little bit later.
Now from a production standpoint, we have both planned and unplanned pauses in the quarter that resulted in approximately 2.5 weeks where we have no daily production at the factory. In addition to causes of a more transient nature related to supply chain and logistics issues.
A production pause due to installation of body shell assembly equipment and robotics with the Lucid Air Pure was preplanned. The equipment has been successfully installed, and we're on track for the start of Pure before the end of the year, which we expect to be hugely significant for us as a company.
At the same time, we did also experience some unplanned production pauses, primarily in order to improve our logistics processes, which, as I stated earlier, became more apparent as we started to scale.
So as a result, we are reducing our 2022 production guidance to a range of 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles. Our revised outlook guidance for the year reflects the logistic challenges I described as we begin scaling, which exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes. But I do believe that we've identified the primary bottlenecks and have already taken steps to begin to remedy the situation.
We have made a significant decision to bring our logistics operations in-house. We've made key hires to the executive team, and we've restructured our logistics and manufacturing organizations accordingly.
We accelerated access to our logistics center as part of our Phase 2 expansion in Arizona. And within a couple of months, we expect to have our logistics center on site at AMP-1, which should help mitigate and begin to eliminate the logistics bottlenecks as well as reduce costs of the shipping and handling of parts. Furthermore, we're overhauling our logistics processes and introducing a series of improvements to simplify the system and yet make it more efficient and robust.
I am pleased to announce that Steven David has joined Lucid as Senior Vice President of Operations. Steven will report to me and will be based in Arizona at the center of our critical manufacturing and logistics operations.
In this newly created role, Steven will lead global operations, including oversight for the expansion of AMP-1, as well as future operational centers. The business leaders of supply chain, logistics, manufacturing quality will now report directly to Steven, ensuring we're executing tight alignment across these business units.
Steven's wealth of experience in manufacturing and operations will be a tremendous asset to Lucid. Most recently, he was Head of Components Operations at Stellantis, responsible for business operations, including P&L for two companies within the organization.
And before that, Steven has served in a variety of leadership positions at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, including Vice President of Manufacturing and Engineering Manufacturing for Asia Pacific. Steven has extensive and in-depth experience in the automotive arena.
I'm also delighted to welcome Walter Ludwig, Vice President of Global Logistics to our executive team, who will be reporting to Steven. Walter brings over 28 years of automotive experience and joins us from Mercedes-Benz where he held various roles, including Head of Operations, Head of Quality and most recently, Head of Central Logistics. For the last 20 years, his main management focus has been ramping up and stabilizing the manufacturing plants in Germany, China, Russia, Argentina and the United States. Walter provides operational leadership in developing and implementing best practices in automotive logistics and parts management, material planning as well as other areas.
Now moving on to the deliveries. Last quarter, I highlighted that we delivered well over 300 vehicles in the month of April. In Q2, we delivered 679 vehicles to customers. Our decision to prioritize quality had an effect on our deliveries and quality is an organizational priority. I've been working with the team to make sure that nothing leaves our house without meeting our high standards.
Now in fact, I'm joining today's Q2 earnings conference call directly from our AMP-1 factory right here in Arizona. I'm right here on the front line, and I've been spending a vast majority of my time here, right here on the shop floor. As I believe it's my responsibility as the CEO to be here resolving issues and helping to onboard the new executives.
Indeed, I feel particular home on and around the production line, where I am personally and directly engaged in helping solve problems. It is right here that I witnessed the passion and the camaraderie of the Lucid employees in the factory first hand and particularly a much valued associates who are so engaged in this process.
And this is very real. They are so engaged because just like me, they really want to build the world's best cars, and just like me, we want to do that in volume. And believe me, we're working tirelessly to make that happen. And so I'd like to personally thank all of our employees for their sheer dedication for working alongside me shoulder to shoulder right here in the factory.
Now we've also made enhancements to our quality processes that are yielding improvements. The quality of the cars that we're factory gating now are excellent, and we are working to make sure that this excellence in quality is consistent at scale off the line. Again, quality simply must take priority over volume as we establish our brand reputation.
In the quarter, we aligned manufacturing quality and field quality under Nick Minbiole our Vice President of Global Quality and that is already yielding improvements. We also brought in Sun Hei Moon [ph] as Global Head of supplier quality. Sun Heijoins us from LG Electronics vehicle component solutions company, where she was the Vice President of Field Quality and of customer support, responsible for leading all aspects of field quality performance, customer support and aftermarket for products. Prior to LG, Sun Hei served as Powertrain Quality Director for General Motors, International Operations in Asia.
They, along with the team, have already identified areas for further improvement and implementation has been underway. And these, combined with existing planned process improvements, give me confidence in our ability to ramp significant production volumes.
On a positive note, our ability to produce cars has not been limited by our ability to manufacture our electric powertrain. And this advanced technology, which truly differentiates us is manufactured in-house by attendantly advanced processes. And these are largely all going pretty well.
And when you consider just how advanced these systems are, this part of the story is really quite an achievement. And from a product perspective, as I noted earlier, we already started deliveries of the 1,050 horsepower grand touring performance. And we're on track for additional version of Lucid Air for later this year, followed by the start of Project Gravity SUV production in the first half of 2024. We also expect to ship the very first Lucid Air into Europe and Saudi Arabia by year-end. So we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.
Now I also want to provide an update on our Formula E relationship. As we approach the completion of four successful seasons, supplying the standard battery pack to the series, I'm proud to say that we have had a 100% safety record to date with just two races remaining in this the final series season for the Generation 2 race cars.
With the advent of the all new Generation 3 Formula E race cars for next season, Lucid is proud to announce that we will be the sole provider of front drive units for the series. This brand new Lucid front drive unit has been custom developed to provide ultra-high performance with gravimetric and volumetric power density. These drive units are capable of 469 horsepower, yet remarkably are approximately half the weight of the Lucid Air drive units. Their position in the nose of the electric race kind front of the driver’s feet would drive shelf connecting outlet to the front wheels.
Make no mistake, this is impressive next-level technology. And just as our learnings from our racing battery program provided technological transfer into our road to Lucid Air, I think that this brand new Lucid high-tech racing drive unit is probably a good pointer to a potentially smaller, yet powerful road car drive unit in our future.
As far as I'm aware, we are one of only two OEMs or car companies that are vertically integrated through the design, development and manufacturing of our own technology. And I'm confident that as this technology race plays out, Lucid will continue to stand out. And we continue to garner strong industry accolades driven our technology and our design. In Q2, we won the 2022 Wards 10 Best Interiors and UX. This award validates one of the founding principles of Lucid Air, which is the Lucid Space Concept. In fact, I recently filmed our Lucid Tech Talk on the Space Concept, whilst Chief Engineer, Eric Bach presented our latest Tech Talk on the Wunderbox bi-directional charger, which you can find on our Investor Relations website.
The software team continues to work hard with 19 over-the-air update delivered since the beginning of the year. We added a number of features, including an enhancement to Lucid Air’s ability to identify traffic signs and inform the driver of speed limit changes and other important drive information, a major upgrade to navigation as well as other customer-requested features, and we have a major software upgrade coming later this year.
Now although I'm delighted by the strength of demand we see for our cars and the [indiscernible] are received, I am conspicuously aware that the true value of having what is now widely recognized as a truly exceptional car can only be achieved by producing it in a meaningful volume and that is why my laser focus and indeed that our Lucid team is right here in Arizona, unlocking the path to our volume ramp-up.
Make no mistake, although frustrating, this is a phase of our growth as a company that we will power through. And that one, we will power through with a steely determination. We have a product. We've augmented our workforce, and we're improving our processes to enable this to happen.
Now furthermore, as we increase the number of vehicles on the road, I believe we will see further demand growth as the awareness of Lucid Air and of the Lucid brand proliferates. I'm also excited about the potential reservation demand for project gravity SUV, which we are now considering just how to debut and when precisely to open reservations.
Longer term, in order to have a more meaningful impact on the climate, we recognize that we need to be in the more affordable, higher volume segments of the market, and we will be doing just that with our midsized vehicle platform around mid-decade, which I believe will further demonstrate the value of our efficiency through our in-house EV technology.
In short, I remain very excited about our future and the broad road map ahead. Whilst right now, we're taking steps to resolve our current constraints at the same time, we're driving forward with a sense of urgency to get our incredible vehicles to market. And indeed on that note, I'm very hopeful you will see the fruits of these labors in the coming months and quarters.
And with that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financials and an additional perspective on our business. Sherry? Thank you, Peter, and thank you, all those for taking the time to join us today. I want to echo Peter's excitement about our future product and technology road map and customer demand. We remain incredibly excited to bring new versions of the Lucid Air to customers this year. And it put the reservation number of over 37,000 in context, this represents potential future revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, and that's before including the up to 100,000 vehicle deal with Saudi Arabia and the future reservations for the Gravity since we've not yet opened the order book for our upcoming SUV. Our future reservations taken together with our growing customer base, brand awareness and number of industry accolades gives us the conviction to continue to invest in the rapid expansion of our business.
Turning to our second quarter financial results. Our second quarter revenue was $97.3 million, which represented a quarter-over-quarter increase of 69%. This included $96.1 million in automotive revenue from the delivery of 679 vehicles. We also recorded other revenue of approximately $1.2 million, which includes sales to Formula E. As Peter mentioned, the Formula E drivetrain agreement is the natural next step in our relationship, and it's a true testament to our advanced technology differentiation. Cost of revenue was $292.3 million.
Similar to last quarter, this expected increase was primarily related to personnel and overhead costs as we ramp up production offset by lower freight costs quarter-over-quarter due to our ability to ship the vast majority of our international shipments from air to ocean freight.
We recorded an impairment charge of $81.7 million in the second quarter, primarily as a result of these increased costs being capitalized into inventory. This is fairly typical in initial production ramps. And just as we saw a decline from Q1 to Q2 in this impairment charge, we expect that the impact should lessen over time as we ramp up production volumes toward our planned manufacturing capacity.
Moving to operating expenses. We're still in the growth stages of our company and investing behind our strategic priorities, but I want to be clear that we're doing this in a prudent and methodical manner. We're instilling a culture of cost consciousness, and we're working with our talented team members across the company to identify and execute on cost efficiency opportunities.
To illustrate this point, I'd like to add on to Peter's earlier comments around the importance of quality. Getting quality right and getting it right early on in the factory helps to reduce downstream costs and improve throughput. So in addition to building the brand and customer loyalty, there is also tangible financial benefits to our quality-first approach.
Now turning to research and development. R&D expense totaled $200.4 million. The 7.7% increase sequentially was primarily related to prototype material, engineering, design and testing services, offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expense. SG&A expense was $163.8 million, down 26.6% from the first quarter, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense.
In Q2, we added five new studios for a total of 29 studios and service centers across the US, Canada and Europe. We're proud to have added new studio locations in Boston, Massachusetts; Manhasset, New York; Denver, Colorado; Seattle, Washington and our first European studio in Munich, Germany. And we'll continue to strategically open new locations globally as we scale the business and grow our presence. We're also increasing our fleet of mobile vans and have a total of 29 in North America as of quarter end. Our mobile service vans can perform over 80% of the service procedures that can be done in a service center, and it's an important element in ensuring high customer satisfaction and a lower-cost approach to providing service as the fleet of loose vehicles grows.
Stock-based compensation in the quarter was $94.4 million, $10.4 million was in cost of revenue, $39.2 million was in research and development and $44.8 million was in SG&A. In other income, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $335 million related to the mark-to-market value of private warrants. The value of the warrants can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors, including Lucid Group's end of quarter share price.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which we expect will fund us well into 2023. During the quarter, we also announced a new ABL asset-based loan credit facility with initial committed capital of up to $1 billion and the availability is based on the value of certain eligible assets. The terms also provide for incremental revolving commitments of up to an additional $500 million subject to obtaining vendor commitments. We had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL credit facility in Q2.
The importance of the facilities that it provides Lucid with incremental liquidity and demonstrates the vote of confidence from a world-class syndicated global banks, many of which have been through -- with us through multiple transactions as we scale our business. I'd also highlight that this is a typical part of the capital structure of mature businesses and reflects the further development of Lucid as a growing global company.
In Q2, we activated a working capital loan under the Gulf International Bank facility agreement in the amount of approximately US$6.7 million related to early work to build our factory in Saudi Arabia. We have approximately US$86.6 million currently available under the working capital facility and an additional US$173.2 million under a bridge facility.
It demonstrated through the series of actions, we are committed to working proactively and opportunistically to ensure that our balance sheet remains an area of company's strength. In Q2, we continue to invest in our technology platform, the scaling of our global business and the manufacturing infrastructure build-out. Capital expenditures related to these activities were $309.8 million in the second quarter.
As you can see from the photos we shared in our Q2 earnings presentation, our Phase 2 expansion at our Casagrande, Arizona factory is progressing. When complete, we expect our installed capacity to increase to 90, 000 units per year by early 2023. As we exit mid-decade, we expect to reach an annual installed capacity of 350,000 units in Arizona and 150, 000 annual units of installed capacity in Saudi Arabia and that gets you to an annual installed capacity of 500,000 shortly after mid-decade.
In Q2, we announced our initial launch plans into the European market with the Lucid Air Dream Edition R, which is optimized for an estimated 900 kilometers of range and the Dream Edition T, which features 1,111 horsepower.
We have not yet begun to accept orders in Europe, but we did reach out to our existing reservation holders to gauge interest in Dream Edition, and we immediately saw strong demand.
Moving to some of the other major milestones in the quarter, we launched Lucid Financial Services in June, in all new digital platforms offering a flexible, fast and transparent financing process. Many Lucid Air customers have been asking for flexible financing options with a preference for a 100% digital experience. And we've delivered on that ask.
Loan products are available to U.S. customers in all 50 states and leased products in 38 states and growing through a seamless process designed specifically for, Lucid customers. We believe this helps open up the market as it's estimated that over 65% of OEM customers seek out loan or lease financing.
This also enables us to continue to build direct relationships with our customers throughout their ownership journey. Now it's highly unusual for an auto company to rollout this type of service is early in the growth cycle as -- truly amazing and great work by the team.
Another proud milestone in the quarter was our -- addition to the Russell 1000 Index. Russell Indices are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies.
Our inclusion in the Russell 1000 Index is another significant milestone for Lucid and should help broaden our awareness in the institutional investment community. Now, turning to the outlook, Peter outlined some of the supply chain and logistics challenges as well as the actions we're taking to address the near-term production bottlenecks we're experiencing.
Bringing our logistics operations entirely in-house in accelerating access to our logistics center on-site at our Arizona factory will help to reduce complexity, cut down lead times and reduce various costs. We believe these decisive actions as well as the addition of leadership across logistics, process transformation and supplier quality will help us unlock these bottlenecks.
However, it's unlikely we'll be able to makeup the anticipated loss volume in 2022. Consequently, we are adjusting our 2022 production guidance to 6,000 to 7,000 units from 12,000 to 14,000 units.
Now turning to our cash guidance, we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which we continue to believe is sufficient liquidity to fund us well into 2023. This assumes we are investing fully in accordance with our forward plans.
As a reminder, we also had the KAEC debt facilities and the ABL with significant untapped capacity. I'm also confident we will have options for additional funding as needed, and our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to be opportunistic in the market.
Moving to CapEx, CapEx in the first half of 2022 was $494.9 million. While the timing of CapEx outflows can shift quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect capital expenditures for the year of approximately $2 billion.
This funds facilities as well as machinery and equipment in Arizona, retail and service center development, early investment in our presence in Saudi Arabia and other CapEx associated with vehicle and component development.
In terms of our product road map guidance, we're on track for deliveries of additional versions of Lucid Air later this year, including the grand -- Air Grand tour performance, the Air Pure, the touring and for production of Project Gravity SUV in the first half of 2024.
In closing, despite our immediate challenges, I'm proud of what our team has been able to accomplish collectively with our business partners. We've enabled financings. We've continued important infrastructure build-out and launched award-winning products. We welcome the new leadership team members and look forward to the capabilities that they bring, as we work together to resolve issues and capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Following Peter's closing remarks, we'll begin a Q&A portion of today's call. Today's Q&A will feature questions from some of our retail investors, an important constituency of our shareholder base through the Say Technologies platform.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Peter for closing remarks. Thank you. Thank you, Sherry. I want to close by thanking all our employees for their dedication and hard work, our customers and investors who put their trust in us and our suppliers and partners who are tirelessly helping us on our journey. I'm more convinced than ever that this is a technology race and that we are well positioned with our enhanced developed advanced technology.
But I want to be clear that right now, my relentless focus is with this great team right here in Arizona, in helping resolving our logistics challenges and in ramping up production. I remain confident that we shall overcome these near-term challenges with a relentless tenacity and a steely determination. And in so doing, put in place appropriate processes and methodologies that will serve us well for the future. And make no mistake, that future is hugely exciting because right now, more than ever, the world needs the new Lucid products and technology advancements that we have yet to bring to market.
And with that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get to your questions. Thank you, Peter. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Before we take questions from those on the phone, we want to post some questions from our retail investors sent them through the Say Technologies platform. The first question, straight to it. We all want to know is there a possibility for a partnership with Apple in the future. And we also have another related question regarding partners that will include, which is Hertz went with Tesla would Lucid think about something like a partnership with car rental companies to get the brand out there? Thanks, Maynard. So we don't have anything to announce today regarding any new partnerships. That said, we recognize the attractiveness of our product and tech platform for other companies, and we're keenly open to discussing partnership options. With regard to fleet or rental cars specifically, our vehicle line very strongly with the operational and financial metrics that these operators care about. For instance, we are industry-leading in efficiency, which is measured in miles per unit of energy and hence miles per dollar. Our charge time and range are also leading the market, which translates to higher vehicle uptime, which both customers and fleet operators desire, and we can also enable fleet operators to manage and run predictive analytics on the fleet and communicate with the fleet given we've installed an OTA-enabled software platform in every car that we've sold. Yes, indeed, Sherry. Even from a -- I guess, from a vehicle architecture perspective, our Lucid Air space concept provides additional room for luggage or cargo or in the case of an autonomous vehicle like sharing fleets, which are configured with the extra computer hardware and equipment. We have more room for that equipment and -- equipment.
So, I think for many of these characteristics and attributes would potentially make us a fantastic partner for one of these groups today. And frankly, even more, I guess, over time as we introduce more affordable models in the future, such as the Air Pure, another variants. I mean, what can I say? Well, look, we've got the perfect current platform for such opportunities, I guess. Great. We'll move to the next question. Any plans for an EV in the $40,000 to $50,000 range to compete with other EVs in that price range? And there's another question related, which is will Lucid offer cheaper models for a broader market? Yes, this is good. And I think there's a sort of kind of a popular sort of widespread misconception that Lucid only wants to be playing in the high-end luxury segment of the market, and that's simply not true. In order to have a more meaningful impact to the climate, we just need to be in the higher volume segments in the market. That's how we're going to really make that impact. And one of the first steps, I see Pure as a stepping stone to a more affordable car. That's one so passionate about the Lucida Air Pure. And I mean, looking a little further ahead, we'll see our midsized vehicle platform just mid-decade, which is going to be a further advance in our technology efficiency story.
And I just want to explain, we deliberately chose to start off at the high end because we were defining a brand, a super called brand with -- from its California DNA, and this is just the starting position. I mean we start off by creating our tech flagships such as Lucid Air and Gravity first. And we focused the technical efficiency, we set new benchmarks. And then we're going to make more affordable products, and that's what really excites me.
Remember that we design, we develop, we manufacture all our power training in our factory in Arizona. And we think we can become even more efficient, and that's going to drive down cost of easy ownership and accelerate and capitalize widespread adoption, which is my passion. And we'll move to the next question. Does Lucid plan to pay out dividends in the future? We don't currently have plans to do so, but let me give you a little bit of perspective. We believe that our EV technology platform is amongst the best in-house developed technology available in the market today. And so our primary focus is to continue investing behind the strength and the growth of that platform so that we can fulfill our mission, which is to bring sustainable technologies to the world. Therefore, we don't anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future. Thanks, Sherry. And our next question from the same platform. Is Lucid currently working with Apple to implement the new car play with iOS 16 that will be released in 2023 to utilize all Lucid Caustic displays? Well, that's a very specific question, I guess. Maybe allow me to explain this more broadly perhaps. And of course, I can't speak for Apple's future product line here. But we're always evaluating new technologies as they come to market. And of course, we will continue to do so. Look, we've got an awesome car from a hardware and mechanical perspective. And what I can talk about is some very exciting software updates coming throughout the year that will really sort of match the prowess from the hardware side, and we will continue to provide new features via over-the-air software updates. And specifically, with regards to car play, we're actually in a beta testing phase of validating right now. And actually, we plan to release the final version in the near future. So, stay tune and wait for that. Great. Our next question, how is Lucid planning to combat inflation and a potential recession in the short term? How will this affect the Gravity SUV that's coming out in 2023 and potentially a $50,000 EV in 2025? And Sherry, maybe you can take the first part, and Peter, you can take the second. Thanks, Maynard. Well, the entire industry has been experiencing inflationary cost environment, and we're certainly not immune from that. With respect to the actions that we've specifically taken in June, we increased the prices of the Lucid Air. And it was the first time that we announced – since that we announced prices back in September 2020. And we're not going to see a material impact from that action until 2023, given that we honor the prior prices on the reservations made through May 31 and orders of the grand touring, which were confirmed in June.
As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're still in the growth stages of our company investing behind our strategic priorities. So, large scale blanket cost-cutting initiatives aren't necessarily appropriate in our case. That said, I want to be clear that, we're allocating capital in a very prudent and methodical manner. We're instilling a culture of cost consciousness. We're working side-by-side with our talented team members to identify and then execute on cost efficiency opportunities. It often takes time to get processes to be best-in-class in efficiency. So there is definitely more work that we can do to rein in costs. Like others in the industry, we're running at various downside scenarios, and we'll act accordingly based on market conditions. Yeah. And I think the second part of the question was, is everything on track for Gravity release? Yeah, as we stated, our Project Gravity SUV is on track for start of production in the first half of 2024. And actually, we're currently in the process of leasing engineering data for our prototype builds. And I'm hugely excited about that, and have been closely interacting with that whole process. And we also happen to mention that our midsized platform, of course, is on track for just past mid-decade as well.
Now of course, it's important to recognize, but to sync with the start of production of gravity of pools, but at the same time, we're readying our factory through the Phase 2 here of AMP-1 right here in Arizona. And particularly, we're expanding the north end of the body shop ready for Project Gravity, and the south side of the building the new assembly halls where we'll run both air and gravity down that line.
Now, we have customers asking us all the time for SUV and Gravity can do for the SUV market, just what Air did for the luxury sedan market, and we're going to take the same concept, the range, the efficiency, the technology and design and performance and apply all the great stuff to an SUV. And I think it probably doesn't surprise a lot of people. I'm not a great SUV fan, but this finally is the SUV for me. It's actually going to happen. And we finally met the SUV love, and that's a Project Gravity. Great. Thank you. So now we'd like to take a few questions from the phone lines. Towanda, can we take the first question? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Good afternoon and good evening, guys. I actually have three quick ones. First, Peter, you mentioned that there were finished vehicles that were held at the factory and that factor gated and ordered as finished. I'm just curious how many those were and how many of those are close to being finished?
Second, as we think about the logistics center being brought on-site in Casa Grande, what the incremental cost for that would be and does that have any impact on capacity? And then the third question, Sherry, what is the ABL borrowing base that's backstopping the new $1 billion loan or ABL facility? And you mentioned that might be upsize. So what other assets could be pledged for that ABL? Thank you, John. Peter here. Yes, I mean, the first question was the cars that we held back through Q2 at the factory. But we did that to really ensure that the quality was just perfect. And it was just fit and finish adjustments on what we call flush and gap, the hood to the fenders, the -- just the finer points of finessing that you would expect features and the quality commensurate with our luxury automobile.
And although -- and many of those cars were meeting some of standards of my quality team, I took the decision that I really want to up the game here and get things right. Now we're actually releasing a lot of those cars, we’re directing them to our service centers right now and then they're finding themselves their way to customers having had that attendance, love and attention and care. And I think they'll be delighted with our best efforts to make them as perfect as they can be.
You also asked about the logistics center at Casa Grande. Now, this was -- this was preplanned. Part of the massive 2.85 million square foot expansion does include several hundred square feet, 100,000 square feet of logistics space.
What we're doing is just accelerating that at a very modest outlay. Just getting that a little bit quicker, because the closer we can bring the buffer soft in the materials to the line that is key to create a more efficient flow of material within our own plant. So this is nothing new. It's just an acceleration of what we've already planned. Yes, right. So no real incremental cost to speak of with respect to that LOC. You asked about the ABL. I mean, we are just delighted to put that in place with this world-class group of banks in our syndicate. The borrowing base, the initial committed part of it is $1 billion, okay? And then we can borrow up to about a-quarter of that billion right now based on eligible assets. That, we will grow into more over time as inventory goes up as other of our assets go up, and that is something that is going to be available to us on a growing basis just as we move forward and mature as a company.
The neat feature about this ABL was it also has an accordion feature. So, although the second part of it, the accordion part is not committed yet, it is up to an additional $500 million that's going to be available for that. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Also a quick ones for me. First, it sounds like on logistics issues, you've identified the problems and the team is in place. Hoping just you can elaborate more level of confidence in the second half of the year. Maybe talk about what you expect production split between Q3 and Q4, and degree of confidence you have in to growing that for next year?
And then secondly, I was hoping you could also comment on the rate of reservations that you saw after the June price hike. Just curious on what you saw for demand there. And lastly, Sherry, maybe you could comment on the minimum cash balance you'd like to have as you kind of plan out liquidity into 2023? Hi, Itay. Peter here. I think it's a really excellent question. We based our guidance. Based upon a mindset, which is neither super, dually optimistic or dually pessimistic, a very balanced approach, and we've taken a very comprehensive and very thorough analytical approach to the risks and opportunities that we see and which confronts us. This is a perfect size and in precise area. But the entire executive, analyze this very thoroughly, and we have a very high degree of concurrence in our collective thinking, which has led to this revised guidance. So let me talk to the reservations question. So as you can expect, when we announced in May at our May earnings release that we’re going to keep the prices, the oil prices in effect through the end of May and not have them go into effect until June 1. That did bring forward some reservations. So we had a very large spike that happened in May.
You see that as we went from 30,000 to 37,000 that's the largest growth that we've ever had in a three-month. So that did happen as expected. I'd say that pull ahead had a little bit more pure in it than others, which you also would find as being intuitive that the lower price points might be a little bit more price sensitive, so looking to lock in that rate.
Now, what was really interesting, as we move ahead the next couple of quarters and we looked at the reservations that have come in, in June and July, if we take that June and July base that we've had and then we add to it the increase, that the over normalized increase that we got in May, we are still way ahead of where we would typically be if we were just normalize through June and July. So that pull ahead, we're seeing really might have been a bit of a bump up, just kind of like a marketing event almost, if you will.
The other thing that was interesting is we booked at the June and July reservations that are coming in is that they continue to be allocated across the same mix allocations that we saw pre-price hike. So you're still seeing Pure highest followed by Grand Touring and then Touring. So Grand Touring continues to be above Touring as well. So we're seeing -- what I would say is very encouraging response and reservations following similar patterns. And when you take the bump in May with the reduction we've seen in June and July, we're sitting in a really great place. Thank you. And then third, I think you had a question about minimum cash balance. So that one's interesting. There's a lot of different ways to model this because the way we are looking at the $4.6 billion. And when I talk about going -- when I talk about being well into 2023, I'm talking about going in accordance to our full plan, which is investing in Saudi Arabia, investing in all of our vehicle variants, investing after the swift pace that we have chosen to do. We have some options there, right?
So when you think about the minimum balance, you could stretch that out if you want. So I mean, I'm not really going to provide any guidance with respect to how much cash we want to the bank, but I just want you to know that you're going to continue to see from us the same type of proactive kind of opportunistic behavior that you've seen every quarter, we're coming to you, and we're telling you about something interesting that we've done in the capital markets, we did the convertible bond offering. Now we've done the ABL. We put in place $3.4 billion in Saudi Arabia. So I think you're going to continue to see that kind of action taking place from us monitoring the markets and making sure that we're doing what is prudent on behalf of all investors. We'll take the next question, please. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've also got three, please. So firstly, again, sorry, on the production. I'm wondering, can you help reassure us a little bit on the ramp-up by giving us an idea of what your weekly production rates exited Q2 at and what it is today?
My second question on order intake, Sherry, you just mentioned there that if you smooth out the last three months, it was actually ahead of what you expected. But if I look at it, I think I'm right in saying that you've averaged about 78 orders a day in the last period since you updated us? And in the three-month period before that, which is March to May, it was basically the same as that. So I'm wondering is the sort of explanation that there were cancellations and so the gross order intake was significantly above or maybe the expectation is that the order intake would slow?
And thirdly, Sherry, I think there was $1.4 billion of purchase of securities in Q2. Can you just tell us what that is and whether or not we should treat it as being as liquid as cash when it comes to your funding requirements? Thank you. Hi, Charles, it's Peter here. I really love to provide guidance on weekly production rates, and this is because it can be so misleading. There's a whole host of factors. If we can delay production a little bit to improvements to our line side supply, which, for example, can improve rate in the future. And once we start cherry-picking specifically weekly production rates, I think we get into this territory. And I think that the numbers we provide you give the most broad and honest description of our ability to have produced cars through this relevant quarter. And our guidance of 6,000 7,000 cars for the year, I believe, is a very balanced and a realistic guide for the future. So I'm sorry, I don't think it's wise to me to give you or weekly production rate right now. Let me cover off a couple of your questions as well. So you were asking about the short-term and long-term investments. So you're right, we took some of our cash, and we parked it in short-term and long-term investments in separately managed funds. And we did this because we didn't need access to all the cash right now, and we wanted to be able to get a little bit higher return on our money. Those dollars are accessible to us at any time that we don't intend to use them right away and we plan to let them mature and garner the interest rates, which is the purpose why we put them there. But they are absolutely acceptable to us. I don't want people to get confused when they see the cash balance, the cash line on the balance sheet going down quarter-over-quarter. Some of that was moved into short-term and long-term investments. Our assets are still there. It wasn't that we spent all that. And I definitely don't want there to be confusion on that point.
Secondarily, you asked a bit about just the reservation. So when we booked at that normalized curve, I was talking about, we did exactly what you said, I look back three months and I look back six months and nine months. And I kind of looked at what does that normalization look like, and we are definitely well above that when you look at May, June and July kind of taken together.
Cancellations came down slightly. So we've actually seen some improvement there as well. But what you are going to see as we go forward is that the deliveries are going to be increasing substantially. So I don't know you're going to continue to see that kind of growth because you're going to have a lot of deliveries coming out of that number. Now we will be opening up the gravity order book at some point, then we expect we're going to get another large spike to get, right? So there's going to be some dynamic nature to these reservation numbers going forward, and we'll be sure to be as transparent as we can about that in future earnings calls. Great. Thanks. And we'll close out with the last question from the, say platform, which is what is the plan for growth? How do you plan to take more market share in the EV market? Well, I mean, first of all, I have to say this. I think there is no such thing as a market for EVs. There's a market of cars. So we're not competing for this sort of artificial construct of EV market share. I think that's a fantasy. We're competing for the rest of the marketplace, which is huge, the white space, which is currently occupied by outdated gasoline cars. And that's what we're competing with the penetration into that market. But I would also say that this is a technology race, and we're in it. And this is yet to play out because not all EVs are created equal.
And I'd also like to add, I mean, with Lucid Air, we're addressing specific issues that have been sort of resistance points, I guess, to customer adoption with EVs in the past. I mean we've got the longest range. We're the fastest time to charge. We've got incredible space in interior design. It's really leveraging so much more than just an EV. It's a leverage all those advantages that electrification can provide. And I think we can sell more cars, the cost we address these key resistance points. But furthermore, I guess there's a bigger issue at stake here. And I'm glad you asked the question because I mean it allows me to address this.
The world's precious battery materials are really scarce, and our technology allows us to make more cars with less batteries and this is a point that's really missed because we can make more cars less -- with less resources because we can go further for a given amount of energy because we've got more efficiency. I mean, for example, we believe we could endow Lucid Air appeal with over 400 miles range with a battery pack size of less than 90 kilowatt hours. That's what's going to make Lucid Air Pure really awesome similar range, but fewer batteries than compared with EVs for others. And that is the future. That is the consequence of being in the tech race. Great. Thank you. And I think that's a great way to end. This concludes Lucid's first quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for joining us today, and you may now disconnect.",a question-and-answer session will be held at the Lucid Group second quarter 2022 earnings call . the call is based on the information we have as of today and includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .,0.0

Welcome to the Lucid's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Maynard Um. You may begin. Thanks, Towanda, and welcome to Lucid Group’s third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Sherry House, our CFO.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call, include forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events.
These statements are based on predictions and expectations as of today and actual events or results may differ due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, and the forward-looking statements on Page two of our investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon, as well as in the investor deck.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Now, I'm delighted to say, that we've made significant progress towards achieving our 2022 production targets of 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles. In Q3, we achieved a record quarterly production of 2,282 vehicles, more than triple that of and deliveries of 1,398, which is more than double that of Q2.
I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone at Lucid, your collective efforts, which has been central to driving these meaningful increases, as we scale and ramp production and deliveries. You continue to play a key role in the progress of our production ramp and in so doing, help getting more customers behind the wheel of their new Lucid Air.
Now, in Q2, we weren't in a position to give you a figure for a weekly production number. But today, I'm pleased to announce that we've now proven our ability to produce 300 cars a week. And even more importantly, we have a visible pathway to our next incremental production rate. And this has been a huge team effort drawing upon talent from right across the company. We've made some difficult decisions and some systematic changes to the organizational structure. And I think now that the results are beginning to speak for themselves. We're working very hard to control what we can control, but the supply chain situation remains fluid.
In fact, even now, we're experiencing a challenge with one particular item that will lead to some very temporary time-out for the line. However, we believe we can still achieve our 6,000 to 7,000 production guidance for 2022 despite this particular issue. And during this time, we'll implement a whole batch of improvements that will further enable us to produce even more cars.
Now, turning to logistics, we believe we've made significant progress in our plan to bring our logistics operations in-house and to restructure our logistics and manufacturing organization. We addressed some of the primary gating factors that impacted production in the second quarter.
Steve and David and the new leaders we put in place, have been doing a very good job, providing valuable leadership in executing this transition. But, whilst I'm pleased with our progress, we do have more work to do, but it is my privilege to continue to personally lead this important team effort alongside incredible team here in Arizona.
So in fact, I'm joining today's earnings call once again from AMP-1 in Arizona, right off the factory floor where we've been very busy. Just last week, we commenced production of a Lucid Air Touring that I'm looking forward to personally deliver to the very first who want to be customer next week.
Touring is around 620-horsepower dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version of the Air with a zero to 60 of around 3.2 seconds. And whilst I'm very excited to be able to offer a more affordable version of Air with Touring, I'm equally as excited by Lucid Air Pure, which will be our most affordable Air variants with up to 480 horsepower.
We're on track to start production of Pure soon and expect to start delivering the first of these vehicles before year-end. So stay tuned next week for our Lucid Launch Event for a lot more details. But I'll give you a little sneak peek with some numbers.
We talked about Grand Touring getting the industry net leading 4.6 miles per kilowatt hour. And now I'm happy to say that Touring will be able to match the landmark 4.6 miles, per kilowatt hour efficiency of Grand Touring, albeit at a more affordable price point.
And that's an important incremental step to bringing ultra-efficient EVs more attainable. And we will continue to push relentlessly to get closer to what is our aspirational target of close to five miles per kilowatt hour for Lucid Air.
Now, this incredible efficiency is driven in large part by our in-house developed Powertrain Tech. Many of you heard me say this before, this truly is a technology rise and not all EVs are created equal, yet Lucid enabled more miles per kilowatt out of battery. And this allows us to provide world-leading range with a smaller battery and so offer exceptional rear seat ergonomics with a deeper footwell in both the Touring and Pure models.
And we continue to garner external validation of our technology progress, through such recent awards as Top 10 Best Engine and Propulsion Systems from WardsAuto.
But we're not stopping there. In Q3, we introduced the Sapphire Brand, Lucid's new high-performance, driver-focused brand. Sapphire represents the pinnacle of electric performance, finally achieving the satisfactory performance that I so long searched for. Air Sapphire will be the very first Lucid product to bear the Sapphire name, and we'll build upon our technical prowess to take electric high performance to next level.
At the heart of Lucid Air Sapphire is the three-motor powertrain, the first from Lucid, featuring a brand-new twin motor rear drive unit and a single motor front-drive unit. All developed and manufactured enhanced by Lucid. And make no mistake in terms of performance, efficiency and compactness, I believe these are truly state of the art.
The twin rear drive unit introduces new heat exchanger technology and heightened coolant flow rates. In addition, the battery system is upgraded for higher power and more precise thermal logic. And with over 1,200 horsepower, Lucid Air Sapphire is not only the most powerful electric sedan in the world; it is the most powerful sedan in the world. We're regularly testing Sapphire now. In fact, I'm currently personally test driving Sapphire, and I'm satisfied with the progress it's making. We expect to start production in the first half of 2023.
We're also delighted to say that Project Gravity SUV will be ready to be unveiled soon. We're planning events in early 2023, and we'll begin taking reservations from that moment ahead of the start of production in calendar year 2024. So I'd go so far to say that I believe the performance metrics of Gravity are going to be unsurpassed within its class, further demonstrating our technology prowess.
We're going to take some -- the same space concept, the range, the efficiency, technology, design elements and performance and apply all that to create, what I believe, will be truly a landmark SUV. We're readying our factory through Phase 2 here at AMP-1 in Arizona. Specifically, we're expanding the north end of the body shop to get ready for Project Gravity and the south side of the building. The new assembly halls where we'll run both Air and Gravity down that line.
Now, I believe Gravity can have as much, if not, even greater impact upon the SUV market than that Air has for the luxury sedan markets. And I cannot wait to share more details in the not too distant future. Stay tuned for our launch event next week, where we will go through the Lucid Air line and provide a sneak peek on the Gravity SUV.
Now while I'm very excited by our vehicle roadmap, I'm also thrilled with our software progress and in particular, the latest UX 2.0 release. We made a very conscious decision to design Lucid Air from the beginning as truly software defined vehicle. The synergistic integration of software and hardware engineering results in a vehicle that can get better over time, long after customer takes delivery through simply receiving an over-the-air update.
Now during the third quarter, we released 14 over-the-air software updates, more than one per week. Our latest over-the-air software update is the most extensive to date with significant advancements and improvements across the vehicle. New features include Instant-on Glass Cockpit and Pilot Panel displays, launch of highway assist for the DreamDrive advanced driver assistance system, improved on-screen layouts and indeed many other features.
Well, I think it's very important to highlight that Lucid Air has always had world-class software you've likely just never seen it. It's a software that drives the powertrain, the software that manages the batteries, all the software that controls the critical components of the vehicle.
In addition to our in-house manufactured technology, software is a key element for Lucid Air's unheralded performance and efficiency. Put simply, we've never achieved an EPA estimated 520 miles in the case of the Dream edition range had it not been for this software. Of course, these components are all over-the-air updatable as well.
Our world-class software team led by Mike Bell will be releasing many more features in the very near future. In fact, just last week, we announced SiriusXM's radio -- audio entertainment experience will be a standard in-dash feature across the full lineup of Lucid vehicles. The beta will be available at no cost to Lucid owners and in 2023, we expect to deliver the full implementation.
Lucid owners will receive a full three-month trial subscription. As everyone may be aware, my bigger picture vision has always been to establish a Lucid group of companies that encompass not just cars but an energy ecosystem as well as a technology licensing. And these are the three pillars, if you will.
So we recently launched our Lucid vehicle accessories, which includes the Lucid Connected Home Charging Station, the first step into the company's future energy ecosystem. Lucid's Home Charging Solution can support up to 19.2 kilowatts of electrical power which enables charging of up to 80 miles per hour to match Lucid Air's industry-leading fast AC charging rate.
The Home Station will effectively double the rates at which the Lucid Air can be charged when installed at full power compared to the included charging cable. Now the Charging Station is also equipped with hardware ready for bidirectional electric power and is Wi-Fi enabled for the future over-the-air updates.
Turning to our battery strategy. I'm delighted to announce that we recently validated battery cells with another global battery supplier. We expect this agreement along with our existing agreements with LG and Samsung to give us sufficient cell supply both in 2022 as well as 2023. And we're working on long-term supply arrangements with numerous suppliers.
Indeed, I'd like to take this moment to thank all our suppliers who work very hard with us during these challenging times. So to sum up, I'm incredibly proud of the Lucid team and what we've accomplished despite the many challenges that we and the industry faced. In just a short amount of time, we brought our logistics operations in-house. We restructured our logistics and manufacturing operation. We brought in exceptional leadership. We've addressed some of the gating factors impacting Q2 production, and we delivered on the software experience, one would truly expected Lucid Air and launched our technology division.
I believe we're only just getting started. We'll deliver variance across the performance and affordability spectrum with Sapphire, Touring and Pure. We'll begin on our global expansion with the first deliveries into Europe and into Saudi Arabia by the end of the year. We'll unveil Project Gravity SUV early next year, and we'll continue to focus on extending our unsurpassed technology leadership.
Lastly and most importantly, I'd like to thank our customers for your faith in us. I've met a number of you and your families and your feedback and delight are really a part of what drives me and the whole team here to deliver the quality and experience you truly deserve. We're ramping production as quickly as we can to get more vehicles into the helm of our customers. And I want to reiterate that, I firmly believe we're track to achieve our 6,000 to 7,000 vehicle production guidance for 2022.
And with that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financials. Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. Before sharing our Q3 results, I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude to our customers as well as our entire Lucid team members, our partners and our suppliers.
In Q3, we scaled across every corner of our business, from manufacturing and engineering to G&A, sales and service. We've made tremendous strides in our production ramp. We launched our new Sapphire brand, introduced additional product features and worked to enhance our customer experience through our expanding sales and service network. All of this strong progress was only possible through the perseverance and collaboration of each and every one of you, and I'm incredibly proud to work alongside you.
Now, turning to our third quarter financial results. As Peter mentioned, we produced 2,282 vehicles, more than triple our Q2 production numbers and delivered 1,398 vehicles, which was more than double Q2. The variance between production and deliveries was primarily a function of vehicles distributed across three areas of the delivery process, vehicles in transit, vehicles awaiting pre-delivery inspection and vehicles awaiting delivery to a customer.
As we mature as a business, we'll continue to learn and refine our in-transit inspection and delivery processes. So in the near to medium term, we expect vehicles produced to placed at a higher volume than vehicle deliveries as we accelerate our production and we initiate international deliveries in the fourth quarter, the latter which requires longer in-transit times.
We continue to have strong demand with more than 34,000 reservations as of November 7. To put the reservation number in context, this value equates to the amount of our current annual tool capacity in AMP-1. This also compares to the over 37,000 reservations we had in Q2. The reservation calculation includes new reservation, nets out all deliveries that we accomplished in Q3 and Q4 to-date and also net out cancellations.
It's important to note that this number does not include the up to 100,000 vehicles under the agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia. We expect deliveries to start next year. Meetings have been ongoing with the government, and we're actively working on scheduling of the first deliveries.
We also have not opened up reservations for Project Gravity SUV. We expect to start taking reservations in early 2023 opening up what we believe will be a very large and incremental addressable market for us. Our ultimate goal is to sustain a healthy reservation bank, balancing wait times and deliveries until our supply increases with our expanding factory footprint.
Turning to our P&L. Q3 revenue was just over $195 million, which represented a quarter-over-quarter increase of 101%. We remain intently focused on scaling the business and continue to expect to see significant growth in revenue as delivery volumes ramp.
We're also excited about our recent launch of Lucid vehicle accessories, an expanding line of accessories that serve as the stylish complement to the entire Lucid Air vehicle lineup. In addition to the Lucid connected home charging station that Peter mentioned, we also announced a number of other accessories, including a cargo capsule that many customers have been asking for.
Turning to our cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was $492.5 million, which includes direct part, material, shipping and handling, IT costs, overhead, personnel costs, including wages and stock-based comp, estimated warranty cost and inventory write-down, primarily related to reducing inventories to their net realizable value.
Similar to last quarter, this expected increase was primarily related to personnel and overhead costs as we ramp up production, offset by lower freight costs quarter-over-quarter, due to our ability to shift the vast majority of our international shipments from air to ocean freight.
As we produce vehicles at low volumes on production line designed for higher volumes, we have and will continue to experience negative gross profit related to labor and overhead costs. Additionally, we recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment of $186.5 million in Q3.
This amount contemplates the value we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering cost necessary to convert the inventory on hand into a finished product. During this quarter, our LC NRB [ph] impairment increased primarily due to product mix and an increase in inventory levels, including firm commitments.
Moving to operating expenses. We're still in the growth stages of our company and investing behind our strategic priorities, but we're doing this in a prudent and methodical manner. As I said last quarter, we're instilling a culture of cost consciousness and we're working across the company to identify and execute on cost efficiency opportunities.
R&D expense totaled approximately $213.8 million, up 7% sequentially. The sequential increase was related to the continued ramp-up of the Gravity and Sapphire program as well as headcount growth to support further investment into our cutting-edge tech and products, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.
SG&A expense was approximately $176.7 million, up 8% sequentially. SG&A consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, allocated facility costs and other general corporate expenses. As we continue to grow as the company, build out our sales force and commercialize the Lucid Air and planned future generations of our electric vehicles. We expect that our SG&A costs will increase.
We ended the quarter with 29 studio and service centers, flat from Q2. We opened our first studio in Saudi Arabia, at the end of October as well as our first Texas studio in Plano. And we expect to strategically expand the number of studio and service centers with a number of new openings across North America and Europe through the remainder of this year.
We increased our mobile fleet by nearly 10% in Q3, which is an important element in ensuring high customer satisfaction as the fleet of Lucid vehicles continues to grow. Our mobile vans can perform over 80% of the services that can be done in a service center.
Stock-based compensation in the quarter was $83.3 million, approximately $10.8 million within cost of revenue, $34.1 million in research and development and $38.4 million within SG&A. Other income was favorably impacted by a non-cash impact, mark-to-market value of private warrants in the amount of $140.1 million.
The value of the warrant can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors, including Lucid's Group's end of quarter share price. Our overall performance in the quarter was a net loss of negative $530.1 million.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with just over $3.85 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments with total liquidity of $4.2 billion when considering our global credit facilities.
To continue to drive our growth plan and capture significant market opportunity we see, we do want to maintain the flexibility to raise additional capital. Our major shareholder, the public investment fund, has expressed a willingness to support us in a future capital raise on a pro rata basis.
We are incredibly grateful to have such a strong strategic investor as our partner. We are putting in place, a $600 million at-the-market program which will create flexibility for us to raise new third-party equity capital.
Combined with a pro rata participation, by the Public Investment Fund, this would allow us to raise up to approximately $1.5 billion net of fees and other operating expenses. The ATM program provides us with an attractive option to raise capital, but we have no obligation to execute on the program, and we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to financing.
This is consistent with our historical funding actions, including raising funds last year with a green convertible bond and earlier this year securing a $1 billion ABL facility. Our strategy is to take a holistic approach towards funding the business.
We believe we have access to a variety of available options in debt and equity markets as well as access to low-cost government programs. We'll continue to be opportunistic in raising capital, and this ATM program is one incremental tool in our broader funding strategy.
Turning to inventory, Inventory in the quarter increased due to a combination of our production volume ramp and vehicles in-transit to customers. However, we reduced work-in-progress inventory by more than half relative to last quarter, as we made progress on completing production of in-process vehicles from Q2.
In Q3, we secured approximately 495 acres of land, situated underneath our AMP-1 factory, and we also entered into an option to purchase additional land around our existing facility, further securing our future needs.
Capital expenditures were $290.1 million in Q3. Year-to-date CapEx was close to $785 million. Our Phase 2 expansion at AMP-1 is progressing, and we expect to begin moving Air production to the south building in the first half of next year. Construction is ongoing, but we've started installing some equipment and as we discussed last quarter, we're using a portion of our expanded footprint for logistics.
Now, moving to our international expansion efforts. Just recently, Peter and I, and some of the Lucid team went to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, meeting with government and banking partners in conjunction with the opening of our studio in Riyadh. We're already starting to realize the benefits of the KSA relationship in the $3.4 billion economic support.
We were happy to announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Human Resources Development Fund for HRDF in Saudi Arabia as well as the receipt of the first grant from the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia, also known as MISA. HRDF, which is part of the National Development Fund, will contribute 75% of the training costs and salary support for more than 1,000 employees, resulting in an estimated contribution of more than US$ 50 million over a five-year period.
This collaboration and investment from HRDF will allow Lucid to provide essential and meaningful training opportunities for Saudi National, many of whom have not worked in the EV space previously and will be instrumental in making sure we have well-trained professionals as we launch Lucid's first internal manufacturing -- international manufacturing locations. We're thankful for the strong support and collaboration in the region and glad to see it all coming to fruition.
Turning to the outlook. We're reiterating our 2022 production guidance of $6,000 to $7,000. We had strong production in Q3, and we believe we're on track to achieving this outlook. We ended the quarter with a little over $3.85 billion in cash and investments, which we continue to believe is sufficient liquidity at least into the fourth quarter of 2023.
This assumes we are investing fully in accordance with our forward plan, which includes the Phase 2 expansion of AMP-1 in Arizona, the engineering and prototyping of Gravity, the continued build-out of studios and service centers in North America, Europe and Middle East and some early spend associated with entering the Asia-Pac and China market.
Moving to CapEx. We expect capital expenditures for 2022 to be around $1.2 billion. The reduction in CapEx guidance for 2022 is largely a function of timing and does not represent an overall reduction in the budget. Any dollars not spent in 2022 are anticipated to be spent in 2023 and a corresponding shift from the end of 2023 into 2024 is likely to occur.
In closing, we're excited about our progress in the many exciting coming milestones in our road map. By the end of this year, we will have introduced four of our Lucid Air vehicle variant: Grand Touring Performance, Grand Touring, Touring, Pure and Air Sapphire and Gravity are on the horizon.
Our international expansion is also well underway, and you can see that we're starting to realize the benefits of our strong partnership with the government of Saudi Arabia. We can't wait to share more about some of these great projects that the Lucid's team is working on, including our Lucid Launch Event on November 15.
With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get your questions. Maynard? Thanks, Sherry. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Today's Q&A will feature some questions from some of our retail investors who are an important constituency of our shareholder base through the Say Technologies platform. We'll follow that by live analyst questions and close it out with a couple of statements if we have time. So let's start with the first question.
What is the production target for 2023? So we will be providing a detailed outlook for 2023 today, we will likely provide this information in our next earnings call, which will cover our Q4 and full year performance and expectations for 2023. As we said in our prepared remarks, we're intently focused on ramping production. We have line of sight into our next incremental ramp-up, and we're delivering as many vehicles to our customers as possible. So by next year, we expect to be producing our full line of Air from our highest performing Air Sapphire to our most affordable Air Pure. And we plan to begin delivering some of these vehicle variants internationally. We're also planning on unveiling our Gravity SUV. So we're very excited about 2023. Thanks, Sherry. We’ll move to the next question. When are you planning to start building and utilizing the railway transportation in the Casa Grande factory to reduce transportation costs for suppliers and cars delivery. Yes. So as I mentioned, we're working across the company to identify and execute on cost efficiency opportunities generally. There's a number of opportunities we could pursue in which they make more sense to pursue as we ramp volume. If it makes financial sense, we, of course, will consider them, including the use of the railway transportation, which is right in our backyard. Yes. I think I'd want to add that Arizona and the City of Casa Grande have been incredible partners, and we're always looking for additional opportunities to drive our business, whilst at the same time helping to spur jobs and economic growth in this region. Thank you. And let's move to the next question. It looks like there's about 1,000 cars that have been produced and not delivered. Why is that? And where are these cars stored? Yes. Well, I mean this is a function of the cadence by which we've ramped up. We've made a remarkable strides in ramping up. And naturally, there's going to be a phase lag between producing the cars and getting them out to our dear customers. So it’s very much a cadence issue and a phase lag phenomenon. Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, in the near to medium term, we expect vehicles produced to pace at a higher volume in vehicle deliveries is we're accelerating production, and we're also going to be initiating our international deliveries in the fourth quarter, and that requires longer in-transit time. Great. Next question is, what is your current development progress of the current CarPlay version? Is it still planned to be released by end of year? And are you planning on partnering with Apple to add their upcoming fully integrated CarPlay in the next year? Yes. Well, we're most cognizant of the demand for this and the team is working on it. All I can say right now is we are pushing hard to get it to market as soon as we possibly can. Great. We'll move to the next question. The report of Q3 deliveries and confirmation of 2022 delivery targets was helpful. Going forward, does Lucid plan to provide more transparency to investors between earnings calls? Yes. So it is our intention to release our production and delivery numbers each quarter ahead of earnings and the hope of providing greater transparency. We know this has been important to the retail and the institutional shareholders. And we really appreciate your feedback, and I'm glad to have the confirmation of this information was helpful. Great. I think we'll move to questions on the phone in the interest of timing getting everyone's questions in. Operator, I just wonder if we could take the first question, please. Thank you. Our first question, please stand by. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy. Mr. Murphy with Bank of America, you line is open. Good evening, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones. Sherry, can you remind us of what you think the minimum cash level is you need to keep on the balance sheet along with liquidity. And how do you think about the key drivers of the improvement of cash flow through the end of next year? I mean, there's a lot going on here on product investments, capacity expansion. So I mean it would be understandable that cash burn would stay fairly high in this growth mode, but it seems like you're indicating that improve materially as we go through the end of next year. So just curious on minimum cash and how we should think about cash burn improvement? Yes. So as I said in the prepared remarks, John, we got cash of $3.85 billion already on the book. And then when you look at the availability under the ABL on available borrowing, that is shift to $4.2 billion. And as even before you look at the fact that we've access to the SIDF program and that's the Saudi Investment Development Fund, which has $1.4 billion loan capacity. We've drawn down on none of that.
And so, as we expand next year, a lot of our CapEx is going to be kind of split between both Saudi and then also here in the United States, and so all those Saudi dollars were able to draw down against the loan as well. So as we said, we're good well into Q4 of next year, so you can kind of complete the math there kind of for yourself on minimum cash needs.
As for key drivers of it, we're going to continue to keep a watchful eye on manufacturing overhead and labor, we’re looking at our bond cost reductions, keeping an eye on things like raw market -- raw material inflation.
And then, of course, a big part of this is our intentional growth, right? We're deciding as a company to expand rapidly, quadrupling the size of our Casa Grande facility and then also the big build-out of our first international facility. So that CapEx spend is what's driving a lot of this spend for next year. And again, that is our decision. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question around the product, Peter. You sound equally excited about the Sapphire and the Pure, which are kind of two ends of the spectrum for Air. I'm just curious, as you think about mix and pricing next year, if you balance the launch of those two products, ones at the high-end, ones at the lower end of the Air, still a high-mix product. How should we think about that, Peter? And if you look at Sapphire, are there volume limits on that, or if the order book is thousands and thousands, will you feel that? Is there a limit on where Sapphire volume could be capped? Well, any quick side John, for different reasons. I mean the key message here is we're going to use our in-house technology to drive down the cost per mile of making an electric car through efficiency. And Pure is a big step forward in advance in that march. It's going to be an example of us making a more affordable car, a more attainable price point and a fundamentally better car, we're going to get match the 4.6 miles per kilowatt hour that you see with a more expensive model with Grand Touring.
But we're also going to have a better rear seat ergonomics, because we have a smaller battery pack, we're going to have class-leading range from this thing. I think it's going to be an amazing product in a character of its own. And it's part of our relentless drive to make more affordable products. And I'll touch on that in my closing remarks.
I think for Sapphire, it's really important, because it's a halo product. It's our performance driver focused brand. It shows how far the Lucid brand can go. But it's really important as a market to demonstrate to the world the sheer prowess, the Performance prowess, the drive-ability, that a state-of-the-art, high – ultra-high voltage, homegrown electric powertrain can deliver.
I mean Sapphire is the most satisfying driving machine. I mean, I've driven -- I had the luxury of driving phenomenal cars, throughout my entire career. I think this is truly the pinnacle of driving machinery. So there you have a really nice bandwidth from right up to $250,000, and it's a great, great price range to operate in. Yeah. So we're going to continue to see strong mix with the nice mix of products. And just a helpful indicator to you for informing ASP is the reservations book. And so we've got the 34,000 reservation that equates to greater than $3.2 billion in corresponding revenue. And so that's a helpful indicator as you're looking to build out your models. It's helpful. Thank you very much guys. Thank you. Thank you. …Next question please. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Hi Peter. Hi, Sherry. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on another strong quarter, I just wanted to better understand the CapEx. So it looks like the 2022 guidance was lower to $1.2 billion from $2 billion.
You mentioned on the call that this reduction is primarily due to timing. So I'm just wondering I know you haven't disclosed the CapEx for 2023, but should we assume an additional $800 million in CapEx for 2023, or how should we think about that as we go into next year? Thank you. Yeah. No, thank you for the question, I'd be thinking more of it in terms of a shifting in the way that we estimate for CapEx for both kind of 2022 and if we look at it in 2023, we took a really conservative estimate of all of the exposure that we would have.
But as the payment schedules come in, the work is completed, it's been a little bit slower on the payment side. So that -- those dollars that are going to go into 2023, we see that a similar amount of dollars are going to exit 2023 and actually go into 2024.
So we don't really see it as incremental per se. We see a little bit more as a shifting of dollars based on the way we did our computations for CapEx. So we'll be giving some more guidance on that in February, when we do our Q4 performance and then also providing some guidance for 2023 then. Got it. Thank you, Sherry. That's very helpful. And maybe for my quick follow-up is just in regards to the agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia for the up to 100,000 vehicles. I'm wondering if you can maybe give a bit more color there regarding the timing.
I think in the past, you've said that, the vehicle deliveries for the agreement are expected to begin no later than second quarter of 2023 with initial orders in the range of between 1,000 and 2,000 vehicles annually. Is there any additional color there that you could provide, or just trying to get a sense of how to think about it going forward. Thank you. Yes, I would say that that's exactly right. I don't have any updates to that guidance. We were just over in Saudi a couple of weeks ago meeting with the Ministry of Finance on the very initiatives. So we're firming up the details. They're starting to pick trends. We're working on schedules. So all of the others coming together really nicely and that same number that we said, it's going to start a little bit slower.
And remember, this is a 10 year agreement that they're next making with us. So just a tremendous commitment from KSA, and that's going to extend across multiple of our vehicle variants. It's going to start with the Air and then move to the Gravity and also to the Lucid platform thereafter. Yes, indeed, I think that that 10-year commitment just underscores what a great long-term partnership that we've got, particularly with the Public Investment Fund, this is a long-term relationship we're planning for a very successful long-term future together. Wonderful. Thank you so much and again, congrats on the quarter. I will pass it on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one was on the order book. So maybe it was a bit surprising to see it decrease in length since [Technical Difficulty] I appreciate deliveries were higher in the past three months than in prior periods. But I guess that still implies that order intake has slowed materially. Why do you think that is? And do you think that the order backlog will continue to decrease as you deliver more vehicles in Q4. Perhaps you could comment on what you think is ideal order backlog is for Lucid either in units or days of sales? Yes. So let me just add a little bit. Yes, you absolutely understood it correctly. The reservation does net out all of the deliveries that we had in Q3 as well as up to now in Q4. We did have some cancellations as well. So they've continued to be quite modest, low single-digit level of -- low single-digit percentage amount of cancellations.
What we did see, just to give you a little bit more context and a lot of people are asking about this is in August after we announced the bring down to the 6,000 to 7,000, we think some of the folks felt that they might be pushed out a little bit too far, and we did see a bit of a spike in August, the still low single-digit in terms of cancellations.
But now that's normalized to a much more normal rate. We also think folks are getting excited for Gravity, and that's going to be coming here in early 2023. We're going to be opening up the order book. So, frankly, Peter can speak to this as well, but I'm quite satisfied with where we are when you think about. Charles, yes. I mean there's a good number to hear. We don't want people working too long. There's a perception here, the more is better. I think, there's a good number. We've got great, great order book here. I think that, some folks we might have lost a few because our Q2 production was lacking, and there was perhaps an anticipation that the wait would be too long. But we're addressing that now with a dramatic increase in production rates. And also, as Sherry has said, I think the big one for us is going to be Gravity. Gravity is absolutely going to be awesome. And that many people are saying, look, I'm just holding back now. I want to see what this Gravity is going to be like because it's really SUV that I'm hankering after. And if that can deliver the same sort of space concept, the range, the efficiency, the performance, I'm waiting for the order book to open on that one. Okay. Understood. Thank you. The cancellations to, we're finding as we do research on that, a lot of it's from the people that order early. So what Peter is talking about that wait time and the proper size that really is important for us to manage. Got it. Thanks. And then my second question on the gross profit margin. So despite the increase in volumes, there wasn't much improvement in the gross margin versus Q2. Could you maybe comment on that? And sort of more big picture. During the SPAC process, I think your financial guidance at the time indicated that the gross margin would be positive once you were delivering 20,000 units a year. Obviously, a lot has changed since then, including the material costs. But is 20,000 units anywhere near the scale that you think you require to get to gross margin breakeven? And if not, how much higher? Yes. So first, let me comment on the quarter. So you're right, the gross margin to go a little bit more negative. But a lot of that is related to us ramping up the business, increasing the inventory, the way that lower cost or net realizable value calculation works is you got to take your inventory, you got to then assume that you put into that all the additional dollars needed to make it scalable. You look at what your mix is and then you do that analysis for the impairment.
So the impairment had gone up, which is a big kind of driver of that number. We are seeing a lot of positive progress on the gross margin as we go into next year, I'm not ready to comment on that fully yet. We're working through the budget, we might provide some guidance on that in February. But a lot of the things that we're looking at is we're looking at for continued ability to bring our bond cost down, which we're continuing to see.
We're also seeing that really coming into effect with our gravity program as well as we're sourcing some of the components. So as we're moving into the future, we're seeing that as well. And you're right, there are some things that are different than when we went out with the SPAC. The raw material prices have been high. We think -- they may have peaked in Q3, and we're starting to see what we believe is going to be some settling in Q4 and beyond, but that definitely hit us hard.
And then also freight cost, although we've been able to do within our control to take anything that was an air and transported to sea, freight costs are still high. So we're looking for that to continue to normalize, which is going to really start to enable the types of numbers that we were thinking about previously. So more to come on that probably in our next call. Thank you very much for the question. Can I just sneak one last one in. The CapEx reduction for this year, what are the projects specifically that have been delayed into next year? So it's more the payments and most of the spend this year is based on our AMP-1 facility. So this whole quadrupling of the facility that's happening here in Casa Grande, Arizona that's where most of it's happening. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thanks, everybody. Just a question on cost cutting. You added about 1,000 new employees in the quarter. I'm just wondering, in addition to some of the delayed CapEx into 2023 and 2024, whether there is an opportunity to maybe slow that pace of hiring? Could we see some of the OpEx or the curvature of it also maybe be flattened a bit sequentially, or how should we think about that as you kind of plow forward with the quadrupling of the size of the facility? Yeah. I think that's a keen observation, Adam. I'd say that we're keeping a really watchful eye on this. So we want to make sure that we are scaling in the OpEx really commensurate with the progress in the business. And if the business is progressing at a certain level, we want to make sure that rate is making up. So we'll continue to look at SG&A in particular. But you remember, part of the SG&A is the sales component and so building out that footprint for our studios and our service centers, which is a really important part of our customer service experience. So we don't want to cut ourselves short there, but certainly in other areas of the business we're keeping a very watchful eye on spend. Yeah. I think that's absolutely right, Adam. I think we're balancing our growth trajectory with prudence here. You're going to continue to see as the revenue is going up and with a doubling of revenue that we have this quarter. Obviously, as a percentage, the OpEx came down quite a bit, as you would expect, and we continue to expect that type of improvement to happen over time. Okay. Thanks, Sherry, thanks, Peter. Just a last quick one for me is thinking into 4Q, the LCNRV impact, you guided that you're still going to be having production over deliveries. And I think implying that as you ramp, you're still going to have the carrying inventory in the channel, even if it's not work in process inventory. But I'm wondering if the number you mentioned of, what was it, $180-some-odd million in the third quarter was something that could flatten increase or be a bogey we could think about as an impact into the fourth quarter as well? Thanks, everybody. Yeah. It's a complicated calculation, but I would say it's going to likely improve over time as we continue to grow into the full capacity of our facility and before we start to activate kind of new depreciation expense associated with future expansion. So given that wouldn't be activated probably in the end of the year, you're going to probably see quite a bit of improvement there. Also, as you start to maybe normalize some of the inventory levels as well because remember, a lot of this is kind of looking at inventory and taking kind of a reduction based on that as well. Thanks, Sherry. Yeah. Thank you, Adam. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri with Needham. Your line is open. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to quickly touch on order book and potential revenue as well. The potential revenues dropped $300 million from approximately $3.5 billion in 2Q to $3.2 billion in 3Q. Third Quarter revenues of $200 million do not explain the drop fully.
I was wondering if -- what the gap of $100 million here is? Am I reading too much in these approximate figures or early high-priced orders were replaced by lower-priced orders during the quarter, or was there something else like impact of ForEx? What explains that $100 million additional drop in potential revenues? I'm not necessarily following it. Our deliveries increased by about double and our revenue increased a little bit more than double. So we saw a really nice linear relationship between deliveries and revenue. Our reservation mix continues to be quite high right now because, remember, we've been largely producing the GTs, which is one of our higher-priced products, higher performance products.
And as we move forward, we're going to start seeing more of the Touring and Pure entering into the equation. So you will see the mix changing over time, but then we're also bringing the Sapphire and some of the GTP as well there’s some counterbalancing. So, I didn't see any kind of disconnect from my vantage point between the revenue number and the delivery number. Okay, great. And the second question was I wanted to ask about the resiliency of the 10,000 vehicle order from the Kingdom. There is a lot of talk about Kingdom looking to have their own EV brand. How does it affect your relationship with the government? Is there increased urgency to deliver those vehicles quickly? Are there -- is there a sense of urgency to have some safeguards in place to protect that order in any other way? How should we think about that large order from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? I think that it's a testament to the long-term relationship that we have and the support that we've enjoyed from Saudi Arabia. I think we typically, [indiscernible] here, the electric car company. And I think there are potentially some synergies with supply chain in the Kingdom as well. But I think that our relationship, it spans across many ministries within the Kingdom. They committed to 50,000 preorders and with an option up to 100,000 over long-term period of 10 years. So, I am very confident and I think we can very comfortably coexist and benefit, actually mutually benefit from each other's existence and growth. And I see that they really view us as very vital to the growth of the auto ecosystem overall. And that's why we have such a strong relationship building across SIDF, the HRDF, the Ministry of Finance, the MISA organization and especially the Public Investment Fund. Great. I think the other thing to recognize is we're in different parts of the market where with the luxury on higher end. So I think we've got some sort of complementary strength here. But I just think that we can work together to reduce costs with the supply chain. I'm looking at a synergistic opportunity here. Great. And if I can sneak one more in. Sherry, you mentioned that you will start international deliveries in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you can talk about what does, it do to the margins, especially your cost of deliveries will go up and U.S. dollar is pretty strong. So how should we think about margins in fourth quarter with higher rte, higher headcount, international deliveries and so forth? Yeah. So we're just going to be starting the international deliveries in Q4, and that's going to be going to Europe and Saudi Arabia first. So we haven't announced all of our pricing in those regions yet. So stay tuned for that, and you'll be able to see what we're going to be doing there. It's a lot of opportunity. That's the way I'm looking at. Great. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks. Great. Actually, before we go to the closing remarks and maybe we'll mix them together. Let's go to one more say question. And the last question in orders that you guys tend to make cheaper cars like Tesla in the future. But this wraps in, I think, very nicely to -- another question, which is what can shareholders expect within the next year to two years from Lucid Motors? Essentially. I mean this is what it's all about. Our vision is to capitalize and inspire and accelerate the adoption of sustainable mobility, sustainable energy.
And to do that, we're developing our own ultra-high technology in-house to create more efficient electric vehicles because not only these are created equal and that enables us to travel further with less, batteries, because batteries are the highest single cost item. That's where we can drive the cost of EVs down.
That may seem a great paradox, because right now, we're making starting the luxury product, but mid-decade, we're going to bring our midsized platform in. That's going to be an awesome product and much more affordable.
So watch this space. That's what this is all about, making EVs more affordable through high technology in this tech race? And maybe to that point, what do we expect to see? Well, I mean, this year, we're going to see Touring and Pure.
Pure is a particular favorite of mine, it's elemental Air truly, and we're going to show more of that on our Lucid launch event in November 15th of this year. So please tune into that. And we're going to have Touring and Pure.
Then we're going to have this monumental driving machine Sapphire, which I'm personally testing, finding the performance truly satisfactory at the moment. That's going to come out in the first half of next year.
And then, the real big one on the near horizon, which is looming, is Gravity. And I think Gravity is going to be really transformative as a high-tech, high-efficiency, truly sporting SUV. It's a sporting SUV. And I just can't wait to show that to everybody.
So that's planned for calendar year 2024. And we'll have a sneak peak of that on November 15. And then, we will move towards sort of late mid-decade, on midsized platform, which is what it's going to be about the real gelling of all this technology to make a car, which is truly much more affordable mid-price range. Great. Well, thank you, everyone. This concludes Lucid's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for joining us today.

Welcome to Lucid's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Maynard Um. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, and welcome to Lucid Group's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Sherry House, our CFO.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call, include forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance of the Company, production and delivery volumes, financial and operating outlook and guidance, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events.
These statements are based on predictions and expectations as of today and actual events or results may differ due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our most recent fillings with SEC and the forward-looking statements on Page 2 of investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in the investor deck.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by extending a heartfelt thank you to the entire Lucid team. I'm proud of their perseverance, resourcefulness and teamwork. This allowed us to drive meaningful improvements in the back half of 2022 and close out the year with production above our previously stated annual guidance. We went from making 279 vehicles in 2021 to 7,180 in our first full year of production. And we went from delivering 125 vehicles to customers in 2021 to 4,369 deliveries in 2022.
Now I'd also like to thank our suppliers and partners who work diligently with us to navigate through an exigent year. And of course, I would particularly like to call out the PIF, who have not only been a committed investor but really an incredible strategic partner. We are most grateful for their partnership. And of course, I'd like to thank our customers one of the things I'm joined most is getting to meet you and see your delight when you take delivery of your rooted air. You are a big part of what drives us to deliver the quality and experience to so deserve.
But let's not forget that 2022 was also a seminal year for the Company, a year when we finally realized our issue of producing an EV embodying our view of the most advanced technology possible and getting that into customers' hands in significant numbers. That was not without its challenges, but as ever, the team work tirelessly to resolve as I will cover later.
Now during that period, I've also observed a growing realization and acknowledgment of our view that our core EV technology is not just the best, but the best by a tangible margin. We see this acceptance widely by many in the know by those who follow the EV and technology space. In fact, even some of our detractors are coming to this inevitable conclusion that the Lucid Air is a truly incredible product.
Now this awareness has happened though in the large part, not just through an overwhelming endorsement from journalists and outlets in the automotive sector. But moreover, through customers experiencing the range, comfort and sheer driving pleasure of our cars. Now some of you may have heard of [Synopsys], but there are really three steps that will lead to our success as a company and those steps of manufacturing sales and profitability.
In short, in respect of our cars, can we make them, can we sell them? And can we make money on? So in 2022, our primary focus was the first of these steps. So, it wasn't it possible for us to manufacture cars. We've got the right leaders in place, brought logistics in-house, and I personally worked tirelessly on the factory floor, leading the team to identify and remove the manufacturing bottlenecks that we faced.
And the fact that I take in today's earnings call from our headquarters here in Europe, California, is symbolic as the transition of the day-to-day factory operations [indiscernible] and our Arizona team. Let me be clear, production is no longer a bottleneck. We were also able to deliver Lucid Air touring and a small number of Lucid Pure in the fourth quarter and delivered our first Air into Europe and Saudi Arabia as promised. So, we now have the rates of Air covering a spectrum of performance and range on the road today. And Sapphire, our highest performance Air is scheduled to start production this summer.
You may indeed have seen a video on social media of Lucid Air Sapphire in a quarter mile road race with the Tesla Model S Plaid, the Bugatti Chiron and the Ducati motorcycle. Lucid Air Sapphire extraordinary performance is clearly a testament to the superiority of the technology we have developed in-house. So whilst other EVs may offer a choice between performance, range, efficiency, charging speed, luxury and space, variance of Lucid Air lead in all of these key metrics. And this is fundamentally enabled through the vertical integration of our technology, we design, we develop and manufacture our motor inverter by directional charger and race-derived battery pack in our powertrain factory in Arizona.
Now [Interglobe Tourist] is our world-class EV powertrain software. And I want to clarify that a large part of our incredible range of performance is indeed software derived. And I think that there's insufficient understanding and appreciation of this core Lucid capability. And this is where the importance of our in-house technology leadership is paramount. Not only does it provide advantages in performance, efficiency, charging times, interior space among many other features, we also expect it will provide a cost advantage at scale.
And there are tangible metrics that will lead us to believe our technology is probably several years ahead of even our next closest competitor, who, in turn, we believe, is several years ahead of others. And we continue to invest in cutting-edge innovation. This is a central capability, which only find really exciting and personally really inspiring. A great example is our new motor sports going unit with integral electric motor, inverter and transmission, which is already in use as the standard frontline units for a leading electric racing series.
Our [indiscernible] Lucid's, Lucid's very latest technology, resulting in unprecedented compactness and lightweight for its Air [indiscernible]. Now I am also proud to say that Lucida achieved the highest possible rating of five stars in the rigorous Euro NCAP safety assessment with a full five stars for each category. We brought a clean sheet design and engineering to Lucid Air with the goal of securing the highest possible safety ratings.
Also in the fourth quarter, we released 22 over-the-air software update and in particular, released UX 2.0, which is our most expensive software update to date, comprising literally tens of millions of new lines of source code across nearly every upgradable computer in the vehicle. Lucid Air was engineered from the start with this over-the-air capability and is in every car we make today.
And many of the upgrades and refinements were based on owner feedback and ideas, and our incredible software team is looking on further developments and improvements and features, and you'll see these continuously rolled out over time. Our software capabilities are further demonstrated through our recent decision to initiate a voluntary recall of a small number of lucid airs related to a supplier issue.
Now I want to be super clear. We were not mandated to do this, but we have an unwavering commitment to our customers. We were able to identify potentially impacted vehicles by sending a software update to all of our vehicles that allowed us to scan for a particular electrical signature within each car and thereby, to identify the less than 300 cars potentially affected by this supplier issue. Now this truly innovative over-the-ear solution is an example of our world-class software capabilities and advanced technologies, believe me very few car companies would have been able to implement such a solution.
Now I'd also like to address some questions that we've been getting about battery cell supply. In the fourth quarter, we signed an agreement with [indiscernible] for battery cells. We expect this agreement along with our existing agreements with LG and Samsung to give us sufficient cell supply for our Air and Gravity programs comfortably through 2025. So having manufactured 7,180 vehicles and delivered 4,369 vehicles in 2022, we currently have more than 28,000 reservations, in fact, more than we plan to make in 2023. And this doesn't include the up to 100,000 vehicles under the agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia with deliveries expected to start this year.
Now as we indicated last quarter, one part of the variance between production and deliveries is the distribution of vehicles across three areas of the delivery process, and that is vehicles in transit, vehicles awaiting quick delivery inspection and vehicles awaiting delivery to a customer. Now some of the vehicles were also internal fleet cost for test drives and engineering. A further constraint is because latching the precise specification of cars we build to that of the customer selection. But like many other companies, we are not immune from a challenging macroeconomic environment.
Now Sherry will go through our guidance in more detail, but I want to reiterate that we are not limited by production. We could scale up, but we're making a conscious decision to match production, whilst focusing upon cost-effective build quality. We are focused on building versions of Air to meet customer interest, converting reservations into orders, meeting and increasing customer demand and getting Lucid Air into the hands of more drivers who can become brand advocates.
And I want to stress that this is nothing new to Lucid team. Having designed and engineered Lucid Air through a time of considerable turbulence in the supply chain, we built our greenfield factory in arguably one of the most challenging times the industry has ever seen with the COVID pandemic, later overcoming newer supply chain and logistics bottlenecks to ramp production. Indeed, we've posted through circumstances outside of our control while growing and becoming a stronger and more nimble companies from our experiences.
And we'll continue focusing upon innovation and bringing the best products we believe anyone has ever seen to market to do to our customers, but also to make the planet a better place for generations to come in so doing. And we're not only building zero emission cars. We're building zero emission cars that make the best use of the world's resources and that's through our advanced technology and design. It's this mission and our incredible customers that drive us every day. And indeed, that's why I am so optimistic about our future.
In 2023, we have two prior strategic areas of focus. Number one, customer awareness and growth; and number two, a laser focus on cost. Sherry will talk more about costs in her prepared remarks. So let me speak now to growth. I spoke about the early momentum we had that was impacted by our ability to manufacture as for delivery. We identified the issues and move quickly to address them. We've gotten past the major bottlenecks limiting manufacturing, but this had some impact on the demand we generated early on, and this has been exacerbated by the challenging macroeconomic environment.
But we know there's real interest in our car. We know this because despite not having an aggressive brand awareness campaign, we generated a considerable amount of consumer interest and reservations. And these are customers that discovered leases at lags that a coveted early dream-addition and granting customers who love this luxury EV. We've learned so much from our early adopter customers, and they're on the cutting edge of automotive, they are the taste makers. And now we're ready to expand to a broader audience
Just so I work side-by-side with the team in Arizona to alleviate the manufacturing of mix, I've been personally touring the country visiting our studios, listening to our sales associates, delivering cars in person and speaking to customers to garner all their insightful feedback. And I've taken this feedback to energize the team with a renewed focus upon building broader and more targeted brand awareness. This effort reaches across our organization, from leadership to the retail customer experience and further is the progress we've already seen with national ride and drive programs.
Indeed, we're inviting people to experience the best and those who best understand this are our customers who ultimately become our very best advocates. And there's also a critical mass we're nearing. In my experience, there's a tipping point in brand visibility once enough vehicles are on the road. And I believe we're getting really closer to that point now. I'm proud to say that today indeed we believe there's a Lucid Air in every single space of the U.S.A.
And turning to our product road map, we have stealth look coming, metal restoring, more cure all-wheel drive and pure rear-wheel drive, the purest of the pures. We have a lot of like demand for these products. However, I should note, we are experiencing a supply chain issue with stealth look that will impact our ability to ship these in Q1 of this year. And we have quite a bit of demand here, and we're working very hard to resolve this. We'll also be ramping up international shipments this year, of course, to Europe and to the Middle East.
And I'm really excited about the gravity SUV, which remains on track for start of production in 2024. Gravity builds upon everything we've achieved thus far. Driving further advancements of our in-house technology to create a luxury SUV like none other. Gravity is a further evolution of Lucid's core DNA of luxury, spaciousness and efficiency through its in-house technology, setting itself apart from the competition with a previously unattainable combination of supercar performance and seating for up to seven adults. I look forward to Gravity's publican veiling later this year.
So I want to leave you with a message of restless optimism for the year ahead. We have what we view as the very best car imaginable in production today. A view substantiated with countless reviews and accolades. Plus, we have more attainable versions arising very soon. We now need to amplify this message across a broader customer audience in order to broaden awareness, which will in turn drive sales. We'll be ramping up in key new international markets. We'll be producing with quality and volume. Clearly landmark products are on their way in Sapphire and Gravity, supported by technology road map to keep us clearly ahead of the competition. I consider myself privileged to lead our talented team through this, the next step of our journey.
And with that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financial. Sherry? Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. In 2022, we scaled virtually every part of our business while keeping a sharp focus on execution. We made tremendous strides in our production ramp began delivering grand touring, air touring and in the U.S. and initiated deliveries into Canada, Europe and the Middle East. We also launched Lucid Financial Services to provide loan and lease products to our customer base and had our most significant over-the-air software upgrade in US 2.0, just to name a few of our many achievements.
We were able to accomplish this despite supplier, supply chain, logistics and quality issues throughout parts of the year, and we finished the year on a strong production note coming in above our previous annual production guidance. All of this was achieved through the perseverance and collaboration of the entire Lucid team. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to them and to our customers, our partners and our suppliers without whom this would not have been possible.
Now turning to our fourth quarter and 2022 financial results. For 2022, we recorded revenue of just over $608 million, up from just over $27 million in 2021 and achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.97 billion versus a loss of $952 million in 2021 in 2021. In 2022, we made important investments in our future and did so while ensuring a healthy balance sheet throughout the year with an average liquidity balance of over $4.8 billion.
Now moving to the fourth quarter results. We produced 3,493 vehicles, delivered 1,932 and generated revenue of $257.7 million. Cost of revenue was $615.3 million for the fourth quarter. As we produce vehicles at low volumes on production lines designed for higher volumes, we have and we will continue to experience negative gross profit related to labor and overhead costs. However, as we scale production, we would expect to see economy of scale benefits.
Additionally, we recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value, which we also refer to as LC NRV adjustment of $204.9 million in Q4. This amount contemplates the value we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering costs necessary to convert the inventory on hand into a finished product. Our LC NRV impairment increased 10% on an absolute basis, primarily due to the production of multiple variants of air and an increase in inventory levels associated with the ramp in production.
We typically receive several questions from the investment community on LC NRV and how to normalize this impact. The impairment calculation has various levels of complexity. And so understandably, it's very difficult to back out when assessing gross margin. What I would say is we have seen improvements in gross margin throughout the year. When adjusting for the LC NRV, we went from an average gross margin of negative 138% in Q1 and Q2 to an average negative 58% in Q3, Q4 and for a total gross margin improvement of 2.3x over that period. And we're far from done. We have many additional opportunities identified that I'll illustrate in a moment.
Moving to operating expenses. We've been able to hold operating expenses essentially flat while increasing the revenue line 32% quarter-over-quarter. R&D expense totaled approximately $221.3 million, up 4% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily related to gravity and payroll expenses, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. SG&A expense was approximately $170.9 million, down 3% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense and reduction of specific external professional services.
Staff based compensation in the quarter was $71.3 million, approximately $11.9 million was in cost of revenue, $28.5 million in research and development and $30.9 million was in SG&A. In other income, we recognized a noncash gain of $256 million related to a change in fair value of a common stock warrant liability.
I'd like to highlight, though, that this noncash warrant related impact can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors, but one of the larger factors is Lucid Group's share price at the end of the quarter. The decrease in our share price was one of the key reasons for the noncash gain. The inverse should also hold true so that's something to consider as some of you build forecasts at the end of each quarter. In Q4, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $623.6 million.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with just over $4.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments with total liquidity of approximately $4.9 billion when considering our global credit facilities. This included the successful completion of a $1.5 billion capital raise in Q4, which was comprised of an aftermarket offering for net proceeds of $594.3 million and also the consummation of a private placement of shares to the PIF for aggregate proceeds of $915 million.
The public investment fund of Saudi Arabia has been a committed investor and a strategic partner for Lucid for many years, and we're so grateful for their partnership and support. Since 2018, the PIF has invested $3.6 billion, including $915 million through its private placement in Q4 2022 through IAR, an affiliate of the PIS. They've also been instrumental in introducing us to many of the ministries throughout Saudi Arabia and those relationships and partnerships have resulted in significant economic and administrative support as we launch our international operations in the Middle East.
Back to the balance sheet, we're very proud of the balance sheet strength that we've been able to consistently sustain over time. As you've seen over the last 15 months, we have access to a variety of funding options from the $2 billion green convertible bond offering the end of 2021 to the $1.5 billion GAAP to market and private placement at the end of 2022, coupled with government support in Saudi Arabia and the large $1 billion ABL facility we put in place with a world-class banking syndicate. We'll continue to take a holistic and opportunistic approach towards funding business. We believe we have access to a variety of available options in debt and equity markets as well as access to low-cost government programs.
Turning to inventory. Inventory increased 22% in the quarter due to our production volume ramp and the number of vehicle variants that we are now producing. Capital expenditures were $289.9 million in Q4. Year-to-date CapEx was approximately $1.1 billion, slightly lower than our guidance of $1.2 billion, which is due to timing of payments and the deferment of certain costs by reconfiguring usage of Phase 1 at AMP 1 in Arizona in order to use it for a longer period of time before we fully cut over to Phase 2 in Arizona.
Before providing our 2023 outlook, I want to speak to our top two priorities of the Company. Heading into 2023, we recognize the difficult market environment and particularly the impact higher interest rates and market uncertainty has on consumers' inclination to purchase, and we're taking action. We talked about our two strategic priorities in 2023 being: number one, growth; and number two, cost. Peter spoke to our growth priority. So I'll largely address cost. But before doing so, I'd like to make one comment on our growth.
Beyond our focus on vehicle growth, I believe we have a number of additional opportunities, many of which are already beginning to become additive to 2023. Our strong technology advantage is no longer in question. our range, our performance, our efficiency, our charge times, we're increasingly being recognized for our in-house technology. And these are creating opportunities. We generated revenue from our motorsports electric drive unit in Q4.
We expect to recognize a small amount of revenue from a U.S. government award for battery module prototypes and a number of others have reached out to us for discussion on licensing or purchasing our technology. In addition, we signed our first vehicle emission credit deal in the U.S. It's a multiyear deal, and we expect to recognize a small amount of revenue starting in 2023, and we see considerably more opportunity here as the regulatory environment around many parts of the world's Titan.
Turning to costs, there are two areas of cost that we are zeroing in on. The first is driving down the cost per vehicle. The second is cost optimization of operating expenses. And let me go through each. On the manufacturing and cost of goods sold side, we've been intensely focused on reducing costs. We have daily cost improvement meetings across various areas of manufacturing, engineering and supply chain. Last year, we were able to reduce costs to more than cover the headwinds in the form of battery raw material input costs.
As we are sitting here in February, we already have identified cost opportunities at a similar level to last year that we expect to implement by the end of this year. And we are surfacing more innovative ideas in cross-functional internal meetings and value engineering workshops with our supply base. This is before considering the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act which we expect to contribute as much as a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle. As we look ahead to Gravity, we've already sourced approximately 70% of Gravity components with a very strong carryover of suppliers from air.
And I'm happy to report that on an aggregate basis to date, we've been able to stay in alignment with our cost target for Gravity. Another area of COGS focused for this year is inbound freight. We've achieved significant reductions last year by moving our international freight from air transit to sea, but we've identified another 2x to 3x savings that we believe is possible.
We have a task team assigned, and we think this is one of the fastest realizable cost reduction opportunities available to us this year. On the operating expense side, we're instilling the same approach. We're looking at all facets of spending with a multitude of ideas on the table. In SG&A, we do expect growth in a couple of key areas.
Number one, we'll continue to strategically build out our service and delivery footprint throughout the U.S., Europe and the Middle East as we meet the needs of our growing customer base and our commitment to customer care. However, we're simultaneously studying ways to drive increased efficiencies out of our existing studio and service center assets and were feeding this information into our future planning.
And second, we're increasing our investment in IT enterprise systems to support the increasing production and delivery volume, global expansion, continuous improvement in cybersecurity and growth in cloud data resources for both our active customer fleet and our internal R&D initiatives. We are instilling a culture of cost consciousness and we're working across the Company to identify and execute on numerous cost efficiency opportunities.
Now to our outlook. For 2023, while we believe we have capacity for greater production, we're forecasting a production range of 10,000 to 14,000 vehicles. Given the uncertain macro environment, we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that's larger than what we would provide under normal circumstances. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to highlight some things to consider as you think about the linearity throughout the year.
In Q1, factory production in the early part of January was reduced by seven days of production due to a planned year-end physical inventory count. We'll also start building vehicles for Europe and the Middle East in earnest shortly. And so there will be some transit time associated with that. In addition, due to supply chain challenges, we were unable to deliver on the popular stealth look option resulting in a reduction of buildable configurations heading into Q1, and so we made a strategic decision to moderate some production as we transition to buildable configuration.
Thus, we expect Q1 to be down significantly on a sequential basis with a corresponding impact on margins in Q1. In Q2, we will ramp shipments to the Middle East and Europe, so we would expect total deliveries to increase in Q2. We will also begin to build popular configurations across several vehicle variants, including pure and higher volumes for which demand remains very strong.
Starting in Q3, we may begin activating parts of Phase 2 at AMP 1, and we expect some transitional downtime could occur. In Q4, with Phase 2, we would expect higher efficiencies as specific shops come online and hence, greater potential manufacturing output versus the rest of the year. While I would caution that there are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin, I wanted to provide some color on the direction of our gross margin.
We expect lower volumes in Q1 to impact gross margin but expect a sequential improvement throughout the year, which should be supported by some of the expected bill of material cost down and inbound freight opportunities that I just mentioned a moment ago. Regarding our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with approximately $4.9 billion in total liquidity, which we believe provides sufficient capital at least into the first quarter of 2024.
Moving to CapEx. We expect capital expenditures for 2023 to be between $1.5 billion and $1.75 billion, reflecting some efficiencies and deferrals in our capital outlay, which is lower than the $2 billion annual CapEx that we provided at the beginning of 2022. We are moving forward with parts of Phase 1 in Arizona as we believe will benefit from a number of cost efficiencies, including bringing logistics more fully on site, bringing staffing in-house as well as plant efficiency.
We also are looking at activating Phase 2 online in stages on a shop-by-shop basis, which we expect will allow us to defer some capital expenditures until 2024 without a delay in the estimated Gravity timing. Lastly, as Peter mentioned, we had more than 28,000 reservations as of February '21, and this is before counting the potential impact to be up to 100,000 vehicles from KSA.
At the time we first started providing reservation, we have not started production or delivery, and we provided this figure as a proxy to estimate potential future revenue. With the progression of our business, we believe production and deliveries are a better representation of the progress of our business. And so going forward, we will no longer plan to provide an updated quarterly reservation number. However, we plan to continue to provide quarterly production and delivery figures shortly following the end of each quarter.
As we look into 2023, we'll continue to focus on strong capital discipline, leaving no stone unturned for every cost optimization or elimination opportunity. We are proud of our technology and product achievements. We're gearing for growth while simultaneously taking a vigorous and comprehensive look at reducing costs, and I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us.
With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get your questions. Maynard? Thanks, Sherry. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Before we take questions from those on the phone, I do want to take questions from our retail investors sent them through Say Technologies platform. And the first question is, is the Saudi PIF taking Lucid private? It's a policy. Lucid does not comment on market rumors, and so we don't have anything to say specific to this question. What we said in our prepared remarks is that PIF has shown a commitment to Lucid having provided $3.6 billion since 2018 and including $915 million through its participation from the subscription agreement just in Q4 2022. PIF has not only been a committed investor but also a strong strategic partner and we're very grateful for the partnership. Peter here. The partnership and support has been phenomenal. I think we'll move to the questions from the phone lines, please. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. I just wanted to dig into sort of the decline in the reservations and sort of this new line, the demand may be a little bit weaker than expected. I mean -- and Peter, when you look at this, the implied price on the old backlog was $94,000. And then on the current backlog, it's $96,000. So it kind of indicates that the mix improved. So it seems like these folks might be a bit stickier, but you're indicating that the demand relative to your production is weakening, but it's still far in excess of what you're talking about producing this year of 10,000 to 14,000 units. So I'm just trying to understand why production is not an issue, why you wouldn't produce more to drive revenue and profits this year if that backlog is real? Yes. Peter here, John. That's a very cogent point. First of all, we do have over 28,000 reservations. But remember that a reservation doesn't guarantee itself is transmitting -- translating into delivery. These are nonbinding reservations. So you can't bank on a reservation automatically into delivery. I'd also like to point out that the 28,000 does not include the 100,000 that are potentially being ordered by the government of Saudi Arabia. So we're sitting in a very good position in that respect.
I think what we've got to focus on is providing cars building configurations from a factory that precisely match the configuration of the customer order. For example, we've got stealth trend coming. We've got a little delay in stealth trend because of a supplier issue. And there's a lot of orders for stealth. And then there's pure in volume, although we've delivered some pure and many of those reservations are waiting for the availability of the pure solution of pure the real-world drive.
So, I think a lot of this is our focus on providing new variants, our focus on building cars with the utmost attention to quality and cost in terms of optimizing our processes and matching the cars that we do build to the precise reservation -- the precise specification of the customer whilst in meaningful that a reservation in itself is non-binding and not guaranteed to transition to the consummation of an order. Additionally, we're in the process of expanding internationally, and it takes time. We'll also be putting some vehicles on boats and starting to really curing more volume to the Middle East and Europe especially as we're exiting Q1 and into Q2. So you're going to start to see that pick up throughout the year in volume. And also, John, our advice, our guidance for the year is a reflection of the range due to the uncertainty of the current macroeconomic conditions. And the effect on consumer behavior is challenging in such circumstances. Okay. Then if I could just ask one quick follow-up. You're emphasizing your technology and the advantages you have which is pretty impressive. What kind of opportunities in the near term as far as licensing and potential product sales on the powertrain side do you think could effectively be executed? Or is this the kind of opportunity that might be two to five years out as opposed to something that will be one to two years out? Well, John, I'd love to do this. I think we've got a technology which is which has observed a sea change in the last year. There's a widespread recognition that the technology that I believe is the best is being recognized as so very widely. And yes, we'd like to make our technology available to other automakers and customers and not just automakers. There are a range of applications. Our focus has been, as an executive team, focused on ramping up production.
My focus right now is just amplifying the message to a broader audience so that we can ramp up our sales. It's not been -- my focus has not been going out to lobby for licensing agreements with our technology to other automakers. We've been very passive in that respect. And I think that's the right focus for us. Let's focus on our own product, first and foremost and then good things will come. And then in addition, I think that any test that we continue to apply in those cases it is accretive to our business. Can it leverage where we are today as a business? And is it going to not distract from our core focus as a company. So when it meets those, then it becomes a higher likelihood of success. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Just to ask John's question, first question, just another way or more bluntly. The 10,000 to 14,000 production guide, that's a deeper reflection of underlying demand as opposed to any limitations on your ability to ramp production, right, because production is no longer the bottleneck. If you were to annualize your fourth quarter production, right, that would get you to 14,000 units for the full year. So yes, can you just kind of unpack that one more time in terms of what informs this range? Is it demand, or is it -- yes? Certainly, and your math is irrefusable. Look, we've sold production that is not the gating issue here now. My focus is on sales. And here's the thing. We've got what I only believe to be the very best product in the world. And we've just too few people are aware of not just the car but even the Company, and so we need to amply focus now away from production to amplifying customer awareness that we've got this amazing car with unprecedented range technology efficiency, incredible driving machine, a great driver's car, just unbridled joy of ownership that we are getting feedback from owners who have experienced this. We need to amplify that message and broaden the awareness, which in turn will drive sales. And that is the focus right now. It's not that we're production-constrained. Yes. And then in addition, reservation holders some of them are waiting for us to offer their very specific configurations in volume. We talked about that already, whether it be pure, whether it be Stealth, whether it be some of the Middle East and European configurations as well. Yes, there's quite a lot of interest in Stealth. And unfortunately, we've got a little bit of a delay due to supply chain challenges, which we're working seriously to resolve. Okay. Understood. And on gross profit for this year, and it does sound as though the LC NRV formula is quite complicated. But that totaled almost $570 million negative noncash impact for 2022. Is there any way to think about what that impact will look like for this year? And any clarity on if this year goes to plan, your plan as stated here, when gross profit breakeven, the time horizon as to when that could be achieved, I think would be -- obviously would be really helpful? Sure. So as I said on the prepared remarks, we're really proud of the actions that we were to take last year in terms of cost reduction, cost down inbound freight reductions that led to a 2.3x improvement when you went from the first half of last year to the second half of last year when removing the effects of the LC NRV. As we look forward to next year, the way that we're thinking about it is we have identified areas for bill of material cost reductions. We have identified areas for inbound freight reductions we do see emission credits starting to come more into play.
We do expect to start getting the benefits of IRA impacts. We do also see some lessening of our need to be buying ahead significantly in the spot market. Last year, this time, we were buying ahead a lot of semiconductors. We're not doing that nearly as much as we were last year this time. All of those are potential tailwinds and benefits to gross margin. On the other side, some of the things that you'll see is as the trim mix changes and it moves to more pure, those are lower margins.
So that's kind of working against you from a gross margin profitability perspective, also just looking ahead as we start to activate some of the additional equipment in the factory that's going to see a little bit more of a burden in terms of depreciation, which is also going to act in the opposite direction. So what I wanted to do now is to just at least help contextualize a little bit of where the puts and the takes are, we're not here going to share exactly when we think we're going to be gross margin positive but I think that those are important factors to take into consideration as you're thinking about your model. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. I just wanted to touch on the guidance once more. So that 10,000 to 14,000 number, which is roughly in line with the preliminary guidance for last year, can you talk about some of the kind of the assumptions that are embedded in that guidance and just maybe a little more granularity? I presume that, that's -- you said before that you will begin shipments to Europe and Middle East later this year. So I presume that part of that production is being included in there. I'm just wondering, if you could maybe add a little more context there? It is, absolutely. We're including the -- in the guidance, a number of cars to Europe and the Middle East. We've already supplied small numbers to those markets, but we're really ramping up now in earnest in the very near quarter. We've also -- it includes the ramp-up in customer demand for Pure for metal roof, touring for real-world drive Pure and a number of factors. As an executive team, we've taken a very careful look at the landscape. And we've been very cognizant in our thinking, our guidance, a prudent guidance with a bandwidth, which reflects the uncertainty of the market in these challenging macroeconomic times. Got it. And maybe one quick follow-up, I wanted to touch on licensing. Again, I think some perception out there is that over the long term, this licensing component could potentially be the largest contributor to revenue in the future. And maybe I'm not thinking about this correctly, but I presume that, that would certainly improve gross margins. I understand the emphasis being almost entirely on ramping up production in car sales. But why not introduce this licensing revenue segment, perhaps prior than initially anticipated? Indeed, I actually share your optimism. I think that it's a really big dining opportunity here. But I have to have laser focus. I've described the three steps, the three steps forward. Can we link these cars? Can we sell them? And can we make a module on them? Last year, my focus was on manufacturing, and we make them, my focus now is on amplifying the message, attracting a broader audience and ramping up our sales. But you're absolutely right. I mean this is a technology race, and this is very little understood.
There's a reason we've got outstanding range with the reason we've got so much more range than the competition. It's not born due to an oversized battery pack. It's more upon exclude efficiency, which we've created through in-house technology. That means we can go further with a smaller battery pack. That means our car can be lighter and more agile and more cost-effective to make. And this is where we have a leadership. And this is so relevant to many other companies that haven't really invested in this new era of electric technology, but it's also good applications outside of automotive in heavy industry, aerospace and agriculture. And as you have heard me say in prior earnings calls as well, this just doesn't have an application just for like the passenger cars like Peter is saying, but also opportunities for fleet operators. They more than anybody, appreciate the efficiency, the performance, the range that we have uptime is important to them. Range is important to them. So, those are factors that we think also makes us a very attractive option for fleets as well. I do also think, though, that there is a natural time scale to this. I think that many traditional automakers have only just come to terms with the fact that battery electric is indeed the future. And I think that amongst those, many are yet to recognize the value of high-technology solutions not commoditizing EV technology and the true value of efficiency. Not my words, efficiency is not some esoteric thing that appeals just to engineers and scientists. It has a tangible value to the commercial viability of the Company because the battery pack is the biggest single big-ticket item in the bill of materials of the car. And if you can meaningfully reduce the size of the battery for a given range through efficiency that means that you can make a more profitable product. And I think that many people are actually really weakening up to this and this realization. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Jewsikow with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. First on reservations. Are you seeing higher cancellation rates on maybe your higher trim vehicles? Or what drove the recent decision to add an incentive on select trim levels? Well, remember that when we have a reservation, it is a nonbinding reservation. So there's no guarantee that someone who's made a reservation will actually follow through with that. What we are seeing is a very strong demand particularly or a product sort of forthcoming pure, redrive Pure touring. I think that we've had a very strong uptake of green addition and grand touring, but I think there is a latent demand for other products in the range and particularly stealth. I think there's a strong demand for stealth, and that's why I frustrated that we have some supply chain issues now, which are delaying that a little bit, but it's coming very soon. Okay. So that's helpful. And then presentation calls out strong demand for Air Pure. And I think that makes perfect sense, especially when we look at the implied potential sales in the reservation backlog. But is that the single biggest gating factor in for 2023 production, or maybe are we under appreciating some of the stealth and international batching being pretty large issues. I guess the way we think about it ramping pretty meaningfully. Yes, it's an overlay of another -- it's more none than that. I mean it's just the different specification of cars, interior color, exterior between the range of touring, Grand Touring and Pure and then you've got the real combinations and then you overlay that with the stealth. There's quite a number of combinations here, and it's matching the discrete requirements, the very discerning requirements, a very discerning high-end customer base.
With our ability to build specifically those specs of cars and get those to the customers. That is one factor. And then we have the overlay of the international deliveries and the fact then that you've got relatively long journeys to faraway places between the factory and actually the customer. So all these factors conspire to, and we give a very analytical approach. Sherry has led a very thorough analysis from the executive team looking at a whole range of factors to lead to these conclusions. Capable of cross-functional look at that across every single area from supply chain to manufacturing to all of those, and as we said that the manufacturing is very well prepared to be able to take on additional volumes as they come for. Production is no longer a bottleneck here. But I would say that one of the biggest factors we face, and I'll be very transparent here is, I believe, for what from my perspective, we've got the very best car in the world and not enough people know about it. And actually, that is an entirely solvable problem, I believe. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Two quick ones, one on Pure and then one just qualitatively on gross margin. So Peter, on Pure, you mentioned that more units and more volume will be available in early 2024. And just to combine the sort of demand, wait time and reservations comments you already answered to some of the other questions. Why couldn't you produce more Pure this year that would pull in higher conversion from the reservations and just do it this year as opposed to '24? That was the part that wasn't clear. We don't have to wait till 2024. What we've said is that Gravity will start production in '24. We're absolutely indeed doing that, Chris. We're ramping up Pure, and we will drive Pure throughout this year. It's what we need to do is ramp up the suppliers' ability to supply the parts for those particular models. Okay. So while production is not a bottleneck, there is maybe component supply issues that have a natural ramp curve for Pure. So you are somewhat limited on the amount that you can produce Pure this year, even though it's not a ""bottleneck."" That's right. And we're further ahead with four-wheel-drive Pure than two-wheel-drive Pure. And actually, two-wheel drive is a great car as well because it's a classic. We will drive car, they are driver's machine. Okay. Peter, would you -- I mean just because there's always a question that all a result of this chicken in egg of demand versus production. Would you be willing to venture on a go-forward basis do you think Pure will be sort of greater than 50% of sort of the demand for Air if we put Gravity? I would think that's a reasonable function, yes. I think that we're looking for just its price point will determine that that figure with that presumption would be a reasonable I can't dive precisely on the product mix. But I would think you not far off. I would think that over time that that's what you would see. You're going to have some different impacts here in the near term because some of the regions like the Middle East and Europe haven't had the opportunity to enjoy some of the higher products yet. So, there's going to be maybe a little bit more focus on those earlier and then they would get Pure a little bit later. And that's what we're going to be building Green and Grand Touring is now very soon for Europe and the Middle East will be a skew towards higher end products, but I think that will be transient in those markets. Okay. Great. And then, Sherry, just one more for you, I know you don't want to give gross margin targets or guidance. But is it fair to assume you talked about the cost improvements from sort of the 58% sort of ""normalize"" in second half, you'll make some improvements over the course of 2023. But you really won't get the unit scale under absorption, just given the numbers versus where sort of second half and Q4 are? Is it fair to assume that, that is probably, by far, the absolute largest bucket to get you to gross margin positive? And that when I think about a high utilization number, you probably have to get production into the 30-plus units to sort of have high utilization on just Phase 1, again, no numbers, but conceptually. Yes. I think conceptually, you're thinking about the right way. I think that we're seeing really good reductions in bill and material costs. And as I said, in some of the other areas where I think we have some control, including inbound freight, but that, remember, it's going to take through the year to start to see. So it's going to be gradual over time.
And then when you look at volumes probably increase over that period, we guided that Q1 will be low and the fact that you've got some depreciation that's going to start activating as we bring on some of those additional shops towards the end of the year, that's going to increase the depreciation and the volume is not going to catch up entirely to that, right? So you've got some competing forces there, but I think you've got a pretty good understanding of it as you just described it. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Maynard for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. This concludes Lucid's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to Maynard Um. You may begin. Thank you, and welcome to Lucid Group's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Sherry House, our CFO.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call include forward-looking statements under federal securities law. These include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, financial and operating outlook and guidance, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events.
These statements are based on predictions and expectations as of today and actual events or results may differ due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our most recent filings with the SEC and the forward-looking statements on Page 2 of our investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in the investor deck.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In quarter one, we produced 2,314 vehicles and delivered 1,406. Sherry will go into more detail on our financials, but I would like to first thank all our employees. We have the best EV on the market. And really, I believe, the best car on the market and it would not have been possible without the collective efforts of our entire team, which is a direct result of tremendous perseverance, resourcefulness and teamwork.
I want to express my deep personal gratitude to everyone who has contributed to and the teams that will help advance our mission going forward. I'm very excited about our future and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We have the best EV on the market and really, I believe, the best car on the market. And it would not have been possible without the collective efforts of the entire team.
I would like to welcome three new members of the Board, Sherif Marakby, Chabi Nouri, and Ori Winitzer. Together, they bring significant global experience in the areas of marketing, finance and operations, across automotive technology and luxury consumer goods. Now these additions are a reflection of the company's evolution as we mature to the growth and brand awareness stage of our life cycle.
I'd also like to congratulate Turqi Alnowaiser on his appointment as Lucid's Chairman of the Board and also thank Andrew Liveris for his guidance during his service as Chairman. And also, a heartfelt thank you to our outgoing Board members, Nancy Gioia, Tony Posawatz and Frank Lindenberg for their significant contributions and their dedication to Lucid's mission.
Now last quarter, I laid out two key significant strategic priorities for the company: Number one, growth and brand awareness; and number two, a laser focus upon cost. We have taken immediate action on both. We made the decision to adjust our workforce in Q1 given evolving business needs, productivity improvements and broader economic uncertainty, which we, like many others, are not immune from. Whilst we believe this positions us to be more agile and puts us in the best position for success moving forward, it was nonetheless a difficult decision. Sherry will speak to our cost focus in greater depth.
So let me provide an update on our growth and brand awareness progress. Now we continue to make strides in growing our brand awareness. And I'm proud to say that Lucid Air was recently awarded a number of prestigious industry accolades adding to our existing portfolio of awards such as the 2022 Motor Trend Car of the Year. At the 2023 New York International Auto Show, Lucid Air was crowned the 2023 World Luxury Car. Lucid Air was also named the U.S. News and World Report 2023 Best Hybrid & Electric Cars list for best luxury electric car.
Now these awards reinforce our belief that the Lucid Air is not just the best EV in the world, but the best car available in the world today. The Lucid Air sets a new industry benchmark for range and two versions that were the first EVs to achieve an EPA estimated range over 500 miles. And we set these new standard, thanks in part to our groundbreaking in house developed technology, which continues to garner significant industry attention. In fact, Lucid recently received the 2023 Newsweek Powertrain Disruptor of the Year award.
I cannot underscore enough how advanced our technology is, making it the best in the world on many metrics. I believe that we are years ahead of our next closest competitor, who in turn we believe is several years ahead of their next closest competitor. I believe that as more companies come to the realization that developing world class powertrains is not as easy as we make it look, then we will continue to grow more interest in our patented hardware and software technology from other OEMs.
And in fact, we continue to see interest from multiple parties. As I've said in the past, whilst this is not an area where we put a tremendous amount of proactive attention, I'm pleased with the growing levels of interest and progress that we're receiving with these OEMs. So our technology and knowhow is what enables us to have game changing range, super car levels of performance, super-fast charging, luxurious and spacious interior, and exceptional aerodynamics.
But I also want to stress that the best technology does not mean most complex nor most expensive. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I believe that our vehicles are fundamentally easier to manufacture in many ways than our competitors. And this is done through brilliant in house engineering, a design for manufacture and very high degrees of innovation. And we're not resting on our laurels.
We're using advanced technology to drive down the costs for EVs. We're moving towards more efficient TVs in order to decrease the battery pack sizes, which will enable lower cost vehicles. And we have much more to come with an exceptional technology roadmap and further enhancements and innovations, pushing the envelope on what's possible, including for our mid-sized platform.
Now looking more near term, Sapphire is on track for start of production later this summer in mid-September. The Lucid Air Sapphire will feature three motors, carbon ceramic brakes, an aerodynamic package, new sports seats and crack tuned suspension for a sublime driver focused sporting experience. It's expected to boast two seconds – subsea seconds, north to 60 miles an hour and a sub-four seconds north to 100 miles an hour with a sub 9 seconds quarter mile at a top speed exceeding 200 miles an hour. I've been test driving Sapphire very recently and I'm finding it extremely satisfactory in terms of its performance.
I'm also excited to announce that the Gravity SUV entered a new phase of development with road testing having started a couple of weeks ago. Just as the Lucid Air redefined the sedan category, I believe that the Gravity SUV is positioned to do exactly the same for its corresponding SUV category.
Indeed, we're taking all the best elements there and putting them into an SUV, game changing range and efficient to see amazing interior space fast charging performance and luxury. And just last week, I was out in a Gravity on a test drive, and I'm delighted with the progress that has been made. I make no mistake, the Gravity SUV will be a true landmark. And we can't wait for you to experience the Gravity SUV at an unveil later this year, at which time you'll be able to place a reservation. We think you're going to absolutely love it.
Now in software, we continue to make big strides. We had five over-the-air updates in Q1 with a number of features that customers have been requesting, including CarPlay and scheduled charging. And indeed, we're working on many more exciting updates. We're listening intently to what our customers want, while simultaneously providing more in-house design features to provide our customers with whatever best-in-class experience they prefer.
And what's more important is to emphasize that we've designed our cost to be over-the-air updatable from the very start. And I believe that there are very few that have the over-the-air capability to the same degree. It's a platform on which we can do so much more. On our last earnings call in February, I spoke about customer awareness of the Lucid brand. We see brand growth happening in stages, starting with the innovators, then early adopters and moving to early majority and beyond.
We believe we are still early on in our customer growth stage of innovators and early adopters. And as we achieve a tipping point in brand visibility wants enough cars are on the road, we believe we will see a higher velocity of growth. And we've continued to take serious action and a holistic data-driven approach to our marketing programs focused on qualified awareness, digital conversion, test drive experiences and conversion to orders and deliveries. And we're seeing some early wins.
The number of test drives has nearly doubled in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year. I believe that seeing is believing and once you experience the handling, the quality, the performance and the interior space of Lucid Air for yourself, you'll understand the award-winning nature of our vehicles. We see test drives as the key stepping stone for customers considering the purchase of a Lucid Air.
We launched our Dream Ahead Tour last month, which is designed to showcase the Lucid Air’s game-changing electric vehicle performance and technology. Consumers will have the opportunity to experience and drive our three Lucid Air models, the Lucid Air Pure, the Lucid Air Touring and Grand Touring and they will do that in 42 key cities right across the USA. Now in fact, the White House promoted our Dream Ahead Tour as part of President Biden's EV acceleration challenges, highlighting actions to encourage EV deployment.
I'm also delighted to announce that Andrea Soriani recently joined Lucid as our new Head of Marketing. Andrea brings over 25 years of experience in luxury brands and automotive, having worked at companies such as Maserati, Ferrari and TAG Heuer. And we certainly expect Lucid and Sapphire and the Gravity SUV to further elevate awareness of the Lucid brand. There are many more grassroots efforts underway capitalizing upon our incredibly passionate customers, who are also our biggest advocates.
Now there's a misconception out there that Lucid Air starting price is far higher than it actually is. Many people out there really believe that the Lucid Air is a $200,000 car. Well, the fact is that the starting price for Lucid Air Pure is $87,400 which we believe is a truly compelling offering in the marketplace today. And we're working on ways to achieve broader access. We started deliveries of the Lucid Airs with self-prepared (ph) last month and we deliver more Lucid Air Dream and Grand Touring this quarter to customers in the EU and in Saudi Arabia.
We've resolved some of the gating items, and we'll continue to focus on ramping up production of stealth appearance and components for international shipments in the second quarter. We expect diluted air fuel volumes in the back half to also ramp with the start of the Lucid Air Pure real-world drive in North America. We're on track to produce over 10,000 vehicles in 2023 with company-wide initiatives ongoing that will enable higher volumes as market conditions allow. And Sherry will go through guidance in greater detail.
So in closing, we recognize that we have more work to do, but we're making progress with our strategic priorities, and the team is totally energized. Our mission and our optimism are unchanged. We're committed to a more innovative and environmentally sustainable future, designing, building and delivering the best EVs on the market as we expand globally and develop more exceptional vehicles, such as the Gravity SUV, which we plan to launch in 2024. I am confident that we have the most advanced technology. We have the right operational infrastructure and the know-how to deliver. And we have a track record of tenacity that will make us stronger.
And so with that, let me turn over to Sherry for an update on our financials. Sherry? Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. I'd like to begin by calling out a few recent highlights. Last month, we announced that Lucid joined the United Nations Global Compact, the worlds largest corporate initiative advancing sustainable and socially responsible business practices. Sustainability is an integral part of what we do every day. It's our mission, and we view this as a natural progression in our sustainability journey as a company.
Last month, we also signed the first annual agreement with the Human Resources Development Fund, or HRDF in Saudi Arabia. This agreement operationalizes the memorandum of understanding signed with the HRDF in October 2022 and will facilitate Lucid training programs and will fund skills development and salaries for Saudi National, who work within our organizations within Saudi Arabia.
The public investment fund has connected us to many of the ministries throughout Saudi Arabia and this HRDF agreement is another example of how those relationships and partnerships have resulted in significant economic and administrative support as we launch our international operations in the Middle East. The PIF has been a committed investor and a strategic partner for many years and we're very grateful for their partnership and support.
I'd also [Technical Difficulty] on the SEC investigation that was previously disclosed on December 6, 2021. On April 27, 2023, SEC staff inform Lucid that the SEC concluded their investigation related to the business combination between Churchill Capital Corporation IV, which was Lucid legal predecessor and Atieva, Inc. in certain projections and statements. I'm pleased to inform you that they do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against the company, which we view as a very positive outcome. We consider this matter closed.
I also want to talk about the Form S-3 and Form S-8 that you may have seen filed today after market close. We amended the existing S-3 with the filing of a new S-3. As you’ll recall, we consummated a private placement of common stock to Ayar for aggregate proceeds of $915 million in December 2022. In connection with this private placement, we agreed to register the shares with the SEC.
The Form S-3 is intended to register these shares by amending the existing Form S-3 that we filed in August 2022. This action was to fulfill our contractual obligations regarding registration rights and is not a new issuance. We also filed a Form S-8. As a reminder, the Form S-8 is primarily to register the additional shares made available under the company's second amended and restated 2021 stock incentive plan, which was approved by the stockholders at the 2023 Annual Meeting on April 24.
Moving to the business. As Peter mentioned, in Q1, we made the very difficult decision to streamline our workforce to better position the company for the future. We took a $22.5 million restructuring charge, which was at the lower end of the $22 million to $28 million we indicated in late March. Given that we were able to reallocate certain employees to other critical positions within the company. We anticipate the final part of this restructuring actions approximately $2 million to occur in the second quarter.
Now turning to our 2023 first quarter financial results. We produced 2,314 vehicles, up 225% year-over-year and delivered 1,406 vehicles, up approximately 291% year-over-year. Making Q1 2023, our second highest performing quarter in terms of production and delivery volumes. Though its performance was less than Q4 2022. As we guided last quarter, we expected Q1 to be down significantly versus Q4 2022. While we work to drive up qualified awareness of our world-class products and also work to unlock production of sell the European and the Middle East variance.
As Peter mentioned, we've now resolved some of those gating items and are focused on ramping these three areas further in Q2. For Q1, we recorded revenue of $149.4 million, which represented a year-over-year increase of 159%. Cost of revenue was $500.5 million for the first quarter. Our gross margin was down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This reduction was driven by lower volumes, which we signaled would be down in our Q4 earnings call in February. As part of that $500.5 million in cost of revenue, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $227 million in Q1 related to lower of cost or net realizable value, which we also refer to as LC NRV, obsolescence and losses from firm purchase commitments.
Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense totaled approximately $229.8 million, up 3.8% sequentially due in part to Gravity testing and tooling. Peter spoke about Gravity, and we're very excited that road testing has already begun. This increase was partially offset by the execution of cost initiatives to reduce outside services as well as freight.
SG&A expense was approximately $168.8 million, down 1.2% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower base staff compensation and IT expenses. While we are intently focused on optimizing costs, which I will talk about in a moment, it's equally important to note that we are continuing to invest behind our strategic and growth priorities including sales and service, customer care and the build-out of international offices and infrastructure.
To that end, in the first quarter, we're excited to have opened five new studios and service centers, three are international sites with one each in Montreal, Toronto and also Norway and two are in the U.S. with one in the Washington, D.C. area and the second in the San Francisco Bay Area. This brought our total at the end of the quarter to 40. We'll continue to be strategic and judicious with our site expansion and are utilizing cost-effective pop-up studios with great effect to complement our studios for brand awareness.
On the service side, we ended Q1 with 38 mobile vans (ph) on the fleet in 73 nationwide approved body shops to ensure high customer satisfaction is the fleet of Lucid vehicles continues to grow. Our stock-based compensation in the quarter was $55.3 million. We also recorded a non-cash expense of $40.8 million related to the change in fair value of our common stock warrant liability. As a reminder, this non-cash impact can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors with one of the larger factors being Lucid share price at the end of the quarter. In Q1, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $643.9 million.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with just over $3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments with total liquidity of approximately $4.1 billion. We're very proud of our ability to consistently sustain a strong balance sheet over time. We've been able to access a variety of funding options from the $2 billion green convertible bond offering at the end of 2021 to the $1.5 billion ATM in private placement at the end of 2022, alongside government support in Saudi Arabia and the large $1 billion ABL facility we put in place with a world-class banking syndicate. We'll continue to take a holistic and opportunistic approach towards funding the business, and we continue to believe that we have access to various options in debt and equity markets as well as access to low cost government programs.
Turning to inventory. Inventory increased sequentially due to the pace of our production volume ramp versus delivery in the quarter, raw materials associated with new vehicle variants that we are now producing and a higher volume of in-transit inventory as we move the remainder of the components, which are eligible for ocean transport to see. Over the balance of the year, we expect a significant reduction in raw material days of inventory on hand, yet supply chain pressures eased somewhat. We obtained more predictability in the transportation channel and we refine our inventory management processes and systems. Capital expenditures were $242 million in Q1.
Now moving to the outlook. We are on track to produce over 10,000 vehicles in 2023 with company-wide initiatives ongoing that will enable Lucid to pivot to higher volumes as market conditions allow. While we typically don't provide delivery guidance, we wanted to provide some directional color to help you with your modeling. For Q2, we are targeting deliveries to be up sequentially. We now have cures in all U.S. showrooms for test drives, and we have a broader set of billable configurations available, though it is important to note that we are still scaling those programs, and we're continuing to work on our sales and qualified awareness initiatives. We expect that Q3 production and delivery numbers will ultimately be determined by how fast we are able to ramp the pure buildable configuration. And as for Q4, we are expecting that to be our largest quarter of the year.
While I would again caution that there are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin, I want to provide some context on our expectation for the direction of gross margin this year. In the second quarter, we expect improvement on higher sequential volume. We also expect to realize improvements throughout the year as a result of our cost efficiency and cost optimization efforts. Specifically, our workforce restructuring in the first quarter is expected to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $91 million, geared towards cost of revenue with the balance of the annual savings attributed to OpEx. You will start to see the full impact of the savings in Q2 less the approximately $2 million restructuring charge that we mentioned above and which will hit in Q2.
Second, we've been working a number of bill of material cost reduction efforts. We're expecting to see a cost savings by the end of the year, not necessarily throughout the year with more reductions already identified for 2024. Third, we have restructured a number of our freight contracts, and we believe that we'll continue to see improvements in this area over time. Lastly, we're working diligently to reduce the days outstanding of our raw material inventory.
Over the past 18 months, we have held additional inventory due to concerns on part availability and logistics slowdown and, in some cases, banking apart due to tooling capacity planning. However, this excess inventory has significant storage costs, reduces our ability to benefit from commodity price reductions that are now occurring and also increases risk for obsolescence in some parts expire or are updated due to engineering changes. We believe that there is significant savings as we unwind some of this excess inventory to simultaneously refine our tracking and inventory systems. These actions will both reduce our working capital and our cost of revenue.
Other gross margin tailwinds include the opportunity from the Inflation Reduction Act, which we think could contribute as much as a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle in the regulatory environment is also getting more stringent and we see opportunity on the emission credit side around the world. Recall, we signed our first emission credit deal in Q4 of 2022. Regarding our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in total liquidity, which we believe provides sufficient capital at least into the second quarter of 2024.
Moving to CapEx. We expect capital expenditures for 2023 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, reflecting some efficiencies, which were identified over the last quarter and deferrals in our capital outlay. CapEx to support our continued growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities across the globe and development of different products and technologies and other areas supporting growth of Lucid's business.
Phase 2 of the factory build-out in Arizona is progressing and we believe will benefit from a number of cost efficiencies, including moving logistics more fully on site and later bringing stamping in-house. We're also looking at bringing Phase 2 online in stages on a shop-by-shop basis, which we expect to allow us to defer some capital expenditures and associated depreciation expense until 2024 without a delay in the estimated Gravity timing.
With regard to our manufacturing progress in the Middle East, the first [indiscernible] also referred to as SSKD (ph) facility in Saudi Arabia with capacity of up to 5,000 units is nearly complete and equipment installation will begin next month. We had a ribbon-cutting for our SKD building in Casa Grande, Arizona, trained up staff that came over from the Middle East, and we expect to be operational in Saudi Arabia in Q3. This is very exciting and exactly where we want to be.
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Lucid team as well as our investors, partners, suppliers and customers. With your support and commitment, we are several steps closer to realizing an environmentally sustainable future.
With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get your questions. Maynard? Thanks, Sherry. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. We'll start by taking Q&A from our retail investors through the safe platform, very important constituency of our shareholder base followed by live analyst questions.
So our first retail question is, Peter, you have said, I'd just like to under promise and like to overdeliver. You promised 20,000 deliveries in 2022 and 49,000 in 2023. We got 4,022 and guidance is just 10% to 14% for '23. When will we see under promising and over delivering. It has been the complete opposite so far. Thank you, Maynard. I'd just like to say -- start by saying to everyone I acknowledge and emphasize with the frustration, and I take this very seriously. Under-promising, over-delivering isn't about setting low standards or being complacent. It's about being realistic and proactive. And then going above and beyond to try to exceed expectations. And we as a management team, we've taken it very, very seriously. Back in '21, happy anyone could have foreseen. The disruption to the logistics and supply chain that we saw in 2022 that affected the whole industry, it wasn't just Lucid. It was a bunch of other car companies, very established names were affected the same way.
I was part of the team that worked night and day in that factory to resolve issues throughout '22. And as a huge team effort, we did that. And now, we're facing challenges in the market, macroeconomic effects and high interest rates, which do impact. We've seen with all of the federal tax incentive at the end of 2022. And these are factors, which are very difficult to predict. When we guide, we do so with absolute honesty and integrity to the very best that we are able to estimate.
And I truly emphasize with our shareholders who are here with us through the long run. But I nevertheless, believe that this is a technology race that the technology that we've developed is unique. It's hugely differentiating. It will enable us to push the point of cars down because we've got more efficiency, which means we can go further with less battery energy, which means we can go the same distance as anyone else with smaller batteries and batteries at a high cost item, which gives us an advantage in terms of potential gross margin.
And I believe this will come to bear in the future. And we've also got compelling products coming. We've got Sapphire which is going to be a halo product, halo product for the brand and help grow brand awareness. As we know, that is a limiting factor right now. And then we've got the big one for production coming next year and on track, the Gravity, which I think is going to be a seminal product. So I temper this with unerring optimism for the future for Lucid. Thanks, Peter. The second question is, would you consider launching the Gravity with a more price accessible trims first to attract more buyers considering the current economy conditions? Yeah. First thing, I would say that from a principal perspective and given where we are in the life cycle maturity of our company, we do think it's important to balance between volume and price not to optimize one to the detriment of the other. Your question is timely because we have been studying this topic, looking at launch cadence. The time between launches and the price elasticity curves and where the intersection of those end up optimizing for the company. it's still a little bit early for us to comment on our intended approach. But what I can say is that we've already sourced about 80% of the components on the Gravity, it's going really well and we've been able to stay within our cost targets, which will ultimately give us maximum flexibility to react to dynamic market conditions over time.
We're also taking lessons learned from the air in looking how we shrink the amount of time between trim launches, hence, getting all buildable configurations into all regions out to the public faster. And finally, we know it's important that customers are aware of the full price spectrum for the vehicle. We found that a lot of people simply don't know that we offer in the case of an air, a vehicle with earning price of $87,000, as Peter mentioned a few moments ago, and hence, awareness is something that we continue to focus on. So we'll keep you posted as we can share more perhaps if the Gravity unveil later this year and in 2024 as we approach starter production. Thanks, Joana. Can we turn it over to phone questions, please? Sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Pierce, Needham & Company. Your line is open. Hey. Good afternoon. Just a clarification. Did I hear you right that test drives are up to us in 1Q '23 versus the fourth quarter of last year. And if that is the case, I was just curious what was driving that given the Dream Ahead Tour launched in the second quarter, I believe? That is correct. It's been a whole holistic series other activities that we've initiated, which collectively will form the basis for our forthcoming marketing strategy. It's not just been the Dream Ahead Tour, that's bringing garnering a lot of test drives. But we've been much more proactive both studio level through initiatives that we've undertaken from headquarters here.
To get more people in the car, people are blown away by the sporting us, the driver engagement, the refinement, the comfort of driving Lucid Air, people who have never driven EVs before are attracted to this. It's all about getting people behind the wheel to experience. Very few people will actually buy a car without experiencing a test drive. So I see this as a conduit -- sort of gateway to a future purchase and ownership experience. Okay. And then just lastly for me. With the cars available on the website right now, cars you have in inventory, is there something you're doing to kind of -- that coincides with the test drives or the Dream Ahead Tour kind of work through that inventory or is it just about whatever specifications or configurations a customer wants you'll build that based on whatever they order. I just kind of want to get a sense of -- I know you're not profiting time or price, but how you're kind of thinking about those two dynamics? Well, we've got -- we are reconfiguring the website to make the customer experience more seamless, more straightforward. We're showing the cars we have currently available that can be spent on that website. And of course, we're building to order. We've recently introduced the [indiscernible], the dark side look of the listed Air. And that's really attracting a very different audience. It's a very different vibe, a more youthful appearance to that car. And it's a very handsome manifestation of the range.
So we're doing all those things, we've got increasing volumes of touring out there. We've got touring’s in the studio to experience and test drives are undergoing. And of course, we're bringing more and more affordable versions of Air Pure, the Air Pure coming out. And later this year, we'll be bringing the real-world drive variant of the Air Pure out. Remember that a lot that many people believe that Lucid Air assumed $200,000 car, it actually starts at $87,400 and we need to really dispel this myth. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Peter, in your comments, it sounded like you were -- or you were alluding to potentially licensing or selling the powertrain technology. And it sounded like that was actually pretty far along potentially with some customers. I'm just curious, if you can comment on that or give us any other color as to what those comments meant. No, John. I'm not in a position to disclose anything tangible juncture. As I said on the earlier, but we continue to receive incoming interest. And I think there's a growing awareness that we have something very, very special here in terms of performance and efficiency. And if you can have something more efficient, you carry less batteries. So you burden with less matter weight and this makes the car really more agile and more sporty, more of a driver-focused experience. So the technology we have today is eminently suitable for higher performance vehicles with our drive units of $600 to 670 horsepower capability.
When we develop lower power units, more affordable units from mid-sized platform in a few years' time, that technology would be more appropriate for a more mainstream manufacturers. We've not proactively going out to seek any engagement in this arena, but we've had multiple OEMs come speak to us, and we are in dialogue with several right now. And that's all I really can disclose at this juncture. Okay. And then, Sherry, maybe just two quick financial questions for you. The $411 million of finished goods inventory would indicate there's almost 4,000 units in stock. Is that about right or is there something else in that finished goods inventory that would be considered that wouldn't be a complete vehicle? Yes, that is a little bit misleading. So I'm glad you asked the question, John. The finished goods inventory has the inventory that is available for sale, but it also includes our test fleet vehicles. loaner vehicles that we have in order to give optimal customer care experiences for the end customer, showroom cars as well. These are vehicles that ultimately, after a few thousand miles on them or perhaps, no miles on them in the case of showroom cars or media cars that we will ultimately sell, but they're not available for sale today. So it's important to differentiate between available for sale today and finished good inventory that is being used for other customer-facing purposes. Okay. And then just the other financial question. I mean there's a lot going on right now, so I haven't had a chance to completely go through that S-3. But it sure looks like a mixed shelf. I mean, is there the availability for you to raise material amounts of capital under that shelf that's been filed or I mean -- I'm sorry, once again, I haven't gone through the details there, but it looks at first blush like there's a lot of room for you to raise capital. Well, again, this is not a new issuance. This was really just a contractual obligation that was associated with the subscription agreement that we did with the PIF back in December of 2022. Okay. Great. Thank you very guys. Okay. Thank you, John. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shepherd with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking our questions. Peter, I wanted to perhaps follow up from the -- one of the last questions in terms of the licensing. I realize you're not providing additional color on that? I'm seeing if I can maybe you can ask the question slightly differently.
Given the slight reduction in the production guidance for this year and gross margins where they are, I guess what is the reluctancy to introduce this as a new revenue stream? You have the proof of concept with the Formula E series. You continue to talk about the technology and how superior it is relative to competitors. So I'm just trying to understand why not introduce this sooner rather than later. Thank you. There's no reluctance on our part. We're very open and engaged. We have to prioritize here. Last year, my laser focus was working crazy hours in the factory. That's what I was doing, crazy hours to resolve logistics and supply chain issues. My laser focus right now is amplifying for brand awareness and creating a cohesive strategy with Andrea to market this brand and make many more people aware that we've got the best car on the planet.
Our tech road map, I believe, is extraordinary. We will be launching progressively more affordable versions of our tech, which would be appropriate for different -- for OEs in different parts stronger of the market. So there's nothing tangible to announce right now in dialogue with third parties. And I will make an appropriate announcement should that bear fruit. But there's no reluctance on our part. We're open and receptive, but it's -- I really have to focus on our products right now rather than proactively chasing licensing. Got it. Okay. Understood. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you can perhaps just give us any color on the deliveries starting to Saudi Arabia as part of the major agreements? There was a brief comment there from Sherry at the end. Sorry, if I missed it. Just wondering maybe you can elaborate a bit further just in terms of how you see those progressing, yes? Thanks. Yeah. So I think you’re referring to the Ministry of Finance agreement that we have in which they have committed up to 50,000 maybe up to a total with the option for another 50,000 to a total of 100,000 units over the next 10 years. We are progressing those conversations. We are in active dialogues. We’re in the process of building out the specs for the first vehicles that they want to receive later this year. So that is actively ongoing. Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats again. I’ll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First of all, the change in guidance in terms of going from 10,000 to 14,000 to 10,000. How much of that would you say is related to just some concerns on the macro or your ability to build brand versus just factory production issues? Any details you can provide on that? And then I have a follow-up. Yeah. I think it's important as we take a very responsible perspective of this, that we match the cars that we build, the production volumes with the cars that we deliver, and that's the balancing act. Certainly, we believe that the macroeconomics are playing a part in the deliveries right now. We also believe that the interest rates play a part, even for a high-end product, even in this part of the market, interest rates to provide a headwind. But we've got initiatives within the company to turn the source is on to up the bolus, shouldn't those market conditions improve. And we are ready to scale up pending that.
And also as we amplify brand awareness. And also I come back to this misconception which seems to be out there. But yes, people believe it's a $200,000 car Actually, the entry level price is $87,400. It's probably conceivable that people think of it as a $300,000 car dollar count because it's so amazing, but actually, it's much more attainable, and we need to spread that word as well. Great. That's helpful. And then just in terms of -- you mentioned maybe bringing Phase 2 online in stages. Can you just talk to sort of the triggering points for that? And whether -- I don't know whether if you focus on certain stages besides the CapEx efficiencies it helps in any other ways in terms of how you -- how the vehicle production goes from a cost standpoint and your ability to react to changes in demand. Thank you. Yes. No, I think it's an important question. So we're in the process of adding significant I think 2.85 million additional square feet in Arizona, Casa Grande facilities. And it's a number of our shops are being either expanded or new buildings. And what we're finding is that as we look at our production plans that we have the ability to continue to eke out a bit more volume out of some of our existing machinery tooling equipment in the existing shops for a bit longer which would allow us to take certain of the shops, like stamping perhaps paint and potentially delay the onboarding of those, hence, you will delay the depreciation expense that accompanies that particular machinery tooling equipment and facility to a little bit longer.
The other thing we're doing is, we're really carefully looking at all of the equipment that's going in each of these shops. And to the extent that there is volume equipment that could potentially be delayed like the addition of additional robots, for instance, we're looking to put those in place and activate those as they're needed versus doing it all at one time.
The other thing that's really unique about what we're doing in the general assembly hall is that we're going to have the ability to dial up the jobs per hour between a few different job power points. So it's not a unit step increase in the direct labor and bringing on the equipment, but instead, we'll have the ability to dial that up gradually and we're going to work to be really thoughtful about that so we can minimize depreciation expense and also the just efficiency of the workforce as well. Great. That’s all. Very helpful. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Evercore. Your line is open. Thank you. Hi, Peter, Sherry and team. So looking at ASPs, there were about $106,000 per vehicle this quarter. so that either implies some heavy discounting below MSRP or a lot of our trend. Can you maybe speak a little more to that and how we can think about that going forward? So I think that when you think about the mix, as it starts to differ from 2022, you're starting to have more dominance and trims other than Grand Touring and Dream, right? So now you start having more prevalence of touring. We're starting to get peers in there. as you go forward through the balance of this year, there is going to continue to be a healthy mix because some of the higher trim levels are going to start going and are going to the Middle East and Europe.
And so you're going to start to see the exposure of those products with higher end products in those regions while you simultaneously start to ramp pure in the U.S. and then later send that overseas as you're exiting the year and into 2024. So you're going to continue to see this mix of trims. We did have a 7,500 kind of continuation program that lasted the first couple of months of the year -- a couple of few months of the year, and that also is reflected in the revenue numbers that you do see. Okay. And it's safe to say that $7,500 continuation program will come off going forward throughout '23? It did come off, yes. Yes. Okay. And then just one quick modeling question for you, Sherry, on the LC NRV (ph) cadence. Is there any sort of guide on how we might see those charges hit in the remainder of this year and the next, just so that we can lay it out cleanly in the model and understand how those might affect the bottom line. It's a great question. The LC NRV charges have been really kind of between $180 million, $200 million-ish to $20 million the last threequarters. So we've kind of seen it basically leveling off. We do expect to see an improvement of that over time because part of the charge is associated with the inventory we have on hand, given my comments that we're looking to reduce the days outstanding of inventories on hand and did not bringing fresh inventory in, in terms of raw material, which -- and also work in process, finished goods, we would expect that to start to taper down. So as you're looking forward this year, we are expecting some reduction in that over time.
The other thing that we have had in some impairments there is we had mentioned some obsolescence. We had mentioned some scrap. I had mentioned the fact that we have some different activities ongoing to really address that in a more proactive way and that's partly us improving our systems. It's partly us not having to hold as much inventory on a precautionary basis because we're not experiencing the same supply chain issues and the same COVID issues that we had in the past. So bringing down that inventory, making sure it's more current inventory will also improve the situation throughout the year. Understood. Thank you for the detailed answer. Of course. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Redburn. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If we exclude the non-cash inventory write-down charge, your COGS per unit only improved by about 8% versus the fourth quarter 2022, which likely reflects the rotation towards the lower content Pure and Touring variance, but also some of the discounts that you just mentioned. Are you able to provide some data points for analysts and investors on the work that's being done internally to remove the costs from the vehicle? Yeah, absolutely. I mentioned a few of them in my prepared remarks, but let me provide some additional context. So some of the work that's being done is on build a material cost down. Now they have two different flavors. One part is commercial agreements that we have with our suppliers and improving piece price cost. Some of that happens as you're negotiating additional volume with them on new programs, they become more open to negotiating down piece price on current programs. So that's part of the effect.
The other effect is when we are doing engineering changes that have a corresponding cost increase as well. So [indiscernible] is certainly something that we are expecting to see throughout the year though you have to remember when you've got inventory on hand and you're bringing new lower cost parts in, you got to go through that inventory first that's why I guided earlier that you're going to start to see the impact of that more towards the end of the year and also as you get into 2024 because some of these items we know will actually take effect in 2024.
Some of the other areas where we've been seeing some really good progress has been in freight and that will start to show up more in Q2 and Q3 as we've renegotiated some of our contracts there and also we're seeing improvements in manufacturing overhead as well. And then as a result of the workforce reduction, there's improvements that you're going to start seeing more of it is going to be in cost of revenues than in OpEx, you're going to start seeing that in Q2.
So these are different cost-down initiatives that will start flowing through the gross margin. And of course, we talked about the greenhouse gas credits, the Inflation Reduction Act, some of those things, some of the trims that we have, those will start hitting a little bit later in the year with our rotation. Okay. Cool. Thank you. And I guess my second question is that the Lucid Air began production roughly one year after beta prototyping testing began. And clearly, COVID impacted some of the start of production time line. But shouldn't analysts and investors use the same time line to conclude that the gravity SUV begins production in roughly nine months to 12 months from now, given your announcement that this nameplate has just begun road testing? All I can say is that we've got to get the product absolutely right. There is a gestation period between data and start production. There's also a nomenclature issue here. We are on target for started production late '24 for the Gravity. Okay. Well -- perhaps maybe if you outline exactly what needs to happen for the -- between now and the start of production, maybe so that we can track in real time. I don't know when you expect the vehicle will get homologated, et cetera, et cetera? Yeah. Well, I mean, home obligation comes relatively late because that has to be conducted to process and tooling that represented levels or authenticity for the represent production. So right now, we're road testing the beta vehicles for the core attributes, structural integrity, drivability, suspension tuning we're starting on some of the great developments, the traction controlled antilock braking systems, the core attributes of the vehicle, then we will move to a phase of interior development. They want to have representative interiors at this stage.
Later this year, we'll move bases with representative interiors, we can do all that development. Then the long lead tooling items are being kicked off because some of the parts take over a year to tool and then we'll go through a preproduction run through next spring, culminating in production late 2024 on track. And I believe it will be a seminal product. It's -- Gravity is on track. It's the landmark. It's going to be a landmark seater third row, three-row, super practical, super high performance, extraordinary range, extraordinary performance attributes. Great. This has been super helpful. Thank you. I’ll pass the line now. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Jewsikow with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. Peter, just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of competitive dynamics in the market right now. From our vantage point, it feels like a pretty challenging market for luxury electric vehicles, but wanted to get your view on if price cuts from your -- one of your large domestic competitors on their luxury line of vehicles is having any impact on demand for used vehicles? Well, I think what you're referring to is perhaps a different part of the market. I believe that there is a challenge to the entire market right now because of macroeconomics and because of interest rates, which actually do affect this place of the market. We're seeing key competitors from Germany discounting their products very heavily that's not just the U.S. manufacturer that you may be referencing the Germans are heavily discounting their vehicles, and I think there are challenges right across the marketplace. I think what we need to do is just amplify awareness just how compelling our product is.
We've got better range. We've got better interior comfort. We've got more [indiscernible]. We're faster charging. We're more efficient to hire technology. We've got a fundamentally superior driver engagement experience. I was taking some potential customers for test drive just yesterday, and they were just lower by the overall driving and riding experience. And we just need to get more people behind the wheel. That's what this is about. We don't have a 100-year heritage or history. We don't have an existing customer base. We need to win in new advocates, new customers. That's super helpful. And it's good to hear you out in the field kind of promoting the product. Personally, most weekends amount meeting customers at events and the grassroots evangelism is growing. And this doesn't happen overnight. This will take some time. We are planting a cons for a forest to come in the future. Make no mistake. Makes perfect sense. I guess you gave the data points around test drives and the number of cities you're going to for the Dream Ahead tour. Is there anything you can commentary you can provide on kind of the cadence for order trends since that started or is it too early? It's too early to do that. And there are so many factors that overlay it's very dangerous. But what I would say is this that we've more than doubled the number of test drives in the last quarter. And I believe that very few people would buy a car without test driving. I see that as a key stepping stone a key conduit a very relevant metric, and that is a step towards purchasing ownership. And then what we see is the best sales people we've got are our customers that become advocates and some of them even evangelize for us. And there's something very genuine about that. Yeah. These test drives also give us personal touch points in order to enter into dialogue with the customers, better understanding their needs and then it all would say that if we've stood up the loose financial services business in the U.S. and then growing that overseas, that's another touch point where we can gain intelligence on what the customer needs the pricing that they're looking for, the interest rates that they're looking for. And all of these are going to be data points that we can use to refine offerings that are going to best meet the customer needs. And then we're streamlining the whole customer experience, making the website much more intelligible, more intuitive, more user-friendly streamlining the ordering process online. That's super helpful. And just last quick question for me, kind of Gravity, any learnings from the Air launch process over the last 12 months to 18 months that will help inform the Gravity launch, call it, 12 months from now? Yes, of course. I mean we want to continuously improve and there's a continuous improvement and learning process, which we take very seriously the teams here. The engineering team Gravity works very closely with the production team is in full process design for manufacture. And this is a really collaborative team sport, which we take very seriously. I really believe Gravity is going to be a seminal product. I don't think there's going to be anything else there that's even close.
It's taken all technology that we've developed to date and more that we're going to throw at this or because the problem with SUVs is getting range without unduly large battery, which becomes super heavy and then you lose payload capacity on the car. So this is a multi-dimensional hugely technical challenge, and it's only now, I believe, that we're ready to really give it up a shot. Gravity is going to be huge for us. I'm very excited about it. Very helpful color. Thanks, Peter, Sherry and team. I’ll hop back in queue. Thanks you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back to Maynard for closing remarks. This concludes Lucid's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thanks. Thank you all for joining us today, and you may now disconnect.",a question-and-answer session will be held at Lucid Group's first quarter 2023 earnings call . the call is based on forward-looking statements under federal securities law . a discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings press release .,0.0

Welcome to Lucid Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Maynard Um. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, and welcome to Lucid Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Sherry House, our CFO.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call include forward-looking statements under federal securities law. These include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, financial and operating outlook and guidance, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events. These statements are based on the predictions and expectations as of today, and actual events or results may differ due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our most recent filings with the SEC and the forward-looking statements on Page 2 of our investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in the investor deck. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We hit several major milestones in Q2, none of which could have been accomplished without the incredible commitment of our employees. Thank you to the Lucid team for your passion and dedication in driving our mission forward.
We also have many exciting events and announcements planned in the second half of this year that I'm very eager to share with you. But before I do, let me start with our major Q2 milestones and provide an update on our progress of our initiatives. In June, we announced a landmark agreement with Aston Martin, providing them access to our Sapphire electric vehicle powertrain technology, indeed, Sapphire-enabled Aston Martin EVs.
Aston Martin chose Lucid following a competitive process to ensure that they access what they felt was not only the best but also the most advanced and suitable technology available on the planet. This agreement represents the advent of a core pillar of Lucid Group, namely our technology supply and licensing, and in so doing, reaffirms the commercial value of our patented technologies. We believe this could represent a harbinger of future opportunities not only in applications for the automotive market but also in markets such as commercial transportation and even aviation.
Also in the second quarter, we raised $3 billion in capital to fund the forward business, removing financial concern and demonstrating the strength of our partnership with our core partner, the Public Investment Fund. Sherry will go into greater financial detail of both the Aston Martin agreement and the capital raise later in her prepared remarks. In Q2, we produced 2,173 vehicles and delivered 1,404. In addition, we had a significant number of vehicles that were in transit to Saudi Arabia. These are cars which were produced but not yet delivered, which we have started delivering to customers in Q3, and Sherry will further elaborate upon this as well.
Over the last 2 quarters, I spoke about the company's 2 strategic priorities: growing brand awareness and cost efficiencies. Now whilst we still have work to do, I'm pleased to say that some of the initiatives we've actioned are seeing solid progress. We saw another strong increase in the number of test drives sequentially through Q2, and the third-party data shows that our brand awareness in the luxury and premium segment is growing to a much stronger place. And as our fleet size grows, so does the number of Lucid Air sightings. We believe that there is a marketing and demand benefit when we achieve a critical mass of vehicles on the road, and we're making headway here.
We continue to garner strong accolades and received an authoritative independent summary of how Lucid Air stacks up against the competition with MotorTrend most recently naming Lucid Air the best electric luxury vehicle you can buy in 2023. It's also important to highlight that Lucid is being asked with increasing frequency by government and nongovernment organization partners to showcase our cars and technology at a growing number of events in the U.S. and Europe. Our name recognition and positive brand associations are growing significantly in the government, trade associations and nongovernment organization space.
We'll also be launching a customer referral program, which we think will get our loyal customers excited about the opportunities for both physical and experiential redemptions. Our customers are some of our most ardent advocates, and we want to reward them for their fervor. And with our brand awareness moving in the right direction, we're now putting more energy behind it to capitalize upon the interest, including the recent reinstatement of Lucid's original pricing. And Sherry will talk more about this in her prepared remarks.
So looking into the second half of the year, we have many exciting events and announcements coming. We're on track to execute our deliveries under the purchase agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia and thus far, I'm pleased with consumer and government demand in the region. In September, we expect to start producing Lucid Air Pure rear-wheel drive. Now the Pure rear-wheel drive will be able to achieve 419 miles on an EPA cycle with just an 88 kilowatt-hour battery pack. And let me do the quick math for you. This equates to an efficiency of approximately 4.74 miles per kilowatt-hour. Indeed, at 4.74 miles per kilowatt-hour, the single-motor Lucid Air Pure tops every other EV on the U.S. market.
What this efficiency means for customers is the ability to go further with less battery. And because the battery is smaller, this means in turn that the car weighs less, is more agile and more importantly, can cost less than a vehicle of similar range which needs a larger battery pack, to get greater distance, smaller battery, lower materials costs, lower running costs, lower total cost of ownership, immense interior space and much better for the environment. And what really excites me is this technology that enables this 4.74 miles per kilowatt-hour for Air will in turn enable more affordable products in the future. In fact, as the price of the vehicle goes down, the cost of the battery becomes even more significant because it is the largest single cost of the vehicle. This is where efficiency becomes most critical.
Now I've been asked many times, Lucid has an advantage for now, but how long before others go and catch up? And my reply to this is always the same. Far from this gap shrinking, we're working assiduously to grow that gap because it's critical to the planet that we achieve higher-efficiency EVs. Achieving a 4.74 miles per kilowatt-hour is testament to that. And we won't stop pushing the envelope on our technology. Work has been well underway on our next-generation power technology for our midsized platform.
Now also in September, we plan to commence production of Sapphire. Preproduction has, in fact, already begun, and we've held a number of viewings for media and early customers already. Sapphire will boast a 0 to 60 time of 1.89 seconds, a 0 to 100 miles an hour time of 3.84 seconds, and a standing-quarter mile time of 8.95 seconds. But whilst I think the power and the performance is impressive, I can only begin to tell you how immensely delightful and responsive Sapphire is just to drive normally, even when you choose to exploit a mere fraction of the performance. This, to me, is one of its most surprising, engaging, even endearing attributes. Sapphire is hypercar performance, delightful handling, the tractability and turning response of torque vectoring with everyday usable in an unprecedented combination.
Then in October, we'll be hosting a special launch event as well as making the first Sapphire customer deliveries. Now outside of the North America, we are continuing to expand our footprint. We plan to open our Dusseldorf studio in late September, and I'm particularly excited about the prospects for this market. We took the Lucid Air Dream performance to the Autobahn, what is best-in-class drag coefficient range and high-speed stability to many heads on some of the most iconic roads in Europe.
Now also in September, we plan to have the opening ceremony for our manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. We're incredibly excited about this official opening of our second Lucid factory and our first manufacturing facility outside of the United States. And finally, the announcement everyone has hotly been anticipating. We plan to formally unveil the Lucid Gravity to the world in November at a special launch event that will be live streamed for everyone to watch.
Turning to software. In the second quarter, we pushed 7 over-the-air software updates with some major enhancements. I can't emphasize enough the significance of our ability to enhance almost every part of the vehicle with software updates. And we have a more significant vision for our software strategy, one that we think very, very few in the industry can match. And I'm really excited about the long-term potential here. Please stay tuned.
So to sum up, despite an uncertain macro environment, I'm very excited about the back half of this year. We plan to start executing on purchase agreements with the government of Saudi Arabia, produce and deliver Pure rear-wheel drive, produce and deliver Sapphire, officially opening our manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia and, of course, unveil Gravity at our marquee launch event in November and more to come that we're not quite ready to announce yet. I really cannot wait for you to experience these amazing cars. And with that, let me turn it over to Sherry for an update on our financials. Sherry? Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. Before sharing our Q2 results, I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude [indiscernible] this year. We successfully closed the transaction in June. As Peter mentioned, we also announced a landmark technology deal with Aston Martin. Aston Martin will pay Lucid a technology access fee of $232 million, comprising $100 million in ordinary shares of Aston Martin and aggregate cash payments of $132 million phased over a period of 3 years, with the ordinary shares and $33 million of the cash payable to Lucid following deal closing, which is expected later this year. Aston Martin will also commit to an effective minimum spend with Lucid on powertrain components of $225 million in addition to engineering integration fees.
Monetizing Lucid's award-winning technology is a key part of our forward strategy, and we're delighted to commence this new arm of our business with a partner as well respected as Aston Martin. Concurrent with our earnings release, we announced the finalization of our milestone agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia with an initial commitment to purchase 50,000 vehicles and an option to purchase up to an additional 50,000 over a 10-year period. It's a powerful affirmation of our product and a testament to our strategic relationship with the country.
On the manufacturing front, our Saudi Arabia semi-knocked-down, also referred to as SKD facility, is nearly complete and is on track for production in September. We expect to scale deliveries from this facility in Q3 [indiscernible] for both consumers as well as various government entities within KSA. This SKD facility will be capable of up to 5,000 units per year and is part of our larger AMP-2 campus, which at full scale is expected to produce up to 155,000 units per year.
Before I turn to our second quarter financial results, let me briefly touch on the reinstated pricing. At the beginning of this year, we spoke about our 2 strategic priorities, brand awareness and cost initiatives. The targeted actions we took to invigorate our marketing programs in the luxury and premium segments is resulting in greater brand awareness. A few moments ago, Peter spoke to the third-party validation of our stronger brand position. We started seeing evidence of this with our order volumes increasing towards the end of July, and we aim to capitalize on this brand awareness momentum by taking actions to improve vehicle affordability for customers.
Hence, we have reinstated pricing levels to those which we contemplated in our original business plan. The early reception has been very strong with a 3x increase in orders in the first full day of the program as compared to the end of July. The return on investment that we're now seeing gives us more confidence in the next steps of our plan to further improve brand awareness and importantly, conversion.
Turning to costs. We have realized cost improvements in a number of areas but we've also had some offsets. In 2022, we realized cost reductions in our bill of materials. And in 2023, we've experienced significant improvements in our logistics costs through more efficient routing combined with declining rates globally. Our manufacturing labor costs have also come down, and our manufacturing efficiency has gone up as a result of our workforce reduction and productivity initiatives implemented earlier this year. However, we still see tremendous opportunity across the organization for cost downs that have been identified as part of a 5-part cost control program that we implemented in the first half of this year.
We believe that some of the largest opportunities exist in bill of material costs, manufacturing overhead, scrap reduction and professional services spend. While some of these cost reductions can be realized this year, we expect much more will be realized in 2024. To provide some context, many of the bill of material cost reductions take time to implement and validate. Additionally, realization of these savings requires us to work through our existing inventory balance first. We're still carrying high inventory levels partly due to COVID and partly due to the optimization required in material planning as we bring on new vehicle variants. As a result, both cost downs as well as other savings in areas such as commodity price reductions won't be realized until we work through this existing inventory, which we expect will meaningfully occur in 2024.
It's important to note that we also see other forms of income in the next few quarters. We estimate IRA benefits of around a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle, which we do not currently recognize in our results. Additionally, we've now signed several emission credit deals and expect to recognize revenue starting in Q3. Although the total amount is not material yet, we are seeing further interest and opportunity here.
Now turning to our 2023 second quarter financial results. We produced 2,173 vehicles, up 213% year-over-year and delivered 1,404 vehicles, up approximately 107% year-over-year, so flattish sequential relative to our expectations for units to be up quarter-on-quarter. In addition, we had a significant number of vehicles that were in transit to Saudi Arabia. We had planned to get these vehicles to Saudi Arabia out for delivery before the Eid and summer holidays, though they were delayed due to supplier issues. Those issues are now largely resolved, and we expect deliveries to customers and the government of Saudi Arabia to ramp this quarter and in Q4.
Turning to the P&L. In Q2, we recorded revenue of $150.9 million, which represented a year-over-year increase of 55%. Cost of revenue was $555.8 million for the second quarter. Our gross margin was down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The reduction in gross margin was driven by impairment charges of approximately $295 million in Q2 related to lower of cost or net realizable value that we also refer to as LC NRV, which was largely due to reinstatement of the original pricing program, obsolescence and losses from firm purchase commitments. Other sources of the cost of revenue increase this quarter included component scrap and onetime costs related to special campaigns to repair or replace under warranties.
Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense totaled approximately $233.5 million, up 2% sequentially, with the largest factor attributable to higher stock-based compensation expense due to our annual equity refresh taking place within the quarter. SG&A expense was approximately $197.7 million, up 17% sequentially. The sequential increase was attributable to higher payroll-related expenses and higher stock-based compensation expense as well as IT and G&A investments as we build out the global business. We opened 1 new studio in Q2, bringing our total studios and service centers at the end of the quarter to 41. This excludes our temporary and satellite service centers. The number of studio openings can vary quarter-to-quarter, but we'll continue to be strategic and judicious with our site expansion and will also leverage cost-effective pop-up studios, which have been highly effective in complementing our studios for brand awareness.
On the service side, we ended Q2 with 43 mobile bands in the fleet and 74 nationwide-approved body shops. We expect to increase the number of satellite service centers, which will cost-effectively provide additional locations for Lucid customers. Our staff-based compensation in the quarter was $71.4 million. We also recorded a noncash benefit of $42.1 million related to the change in fair value of our common stock warrant liability. As a reminder, this noncash impact can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors, with one of the larger factors being Lucid's share price at the end of the quarter. In Q2, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $710.3 million.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments with total liquidity of approximately $6.25 billion. We've been able to consistently sustain a strong balance sheet over time. And as we've done for the last 2 years, we'll continue to be opportunistic in exploring and diversifying access to financing sources.
Turning to inventory. Inventory decreased 16.5% sequentially due to the reduction in raw materials and inventory write-down. Presuming that supply chain pressures continue to stabilize, we see a pathway to a significant reduction in raw material days of inventory on hand as we work toward greater predictability in the transportation channel and refine our inventory management processes and systems. Capital expenditures were $203.7 million, down 15.7% versus Q1.
Moving to the outlook. We're reiterating our production outlook for more than 10,000 vehicles in 2023. We've noted in the past that production is not our bottleneck but we're being prudent in managing vehicle inventory. For those of you updating your models, I want to point out that the SKD vehicles that are partially assembled in Arizona and completed in KSA will not be counted as a production unit until they are finished in KSA, so an increasing amount of our production volume will be coming from KSA as we finish out the year.
Although we typically don't provide delivery or gross margin guidance, we want to provide some direction to help you with your modeling. We expect deliveries to be up the back half of the year, and we expect Q4 to be our largest quarter of the year as we ramp sales to customers in the government of Saudi Arabia, ramp Pure all-wheel drive and introduce our most affordable variant, Pure rear-wheel drive in September.
There are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin but let me provide a little color on our expectations based on what we know today. We expect gross margin to improve through the back half of the year. We expect the improvement to be driven by higher volume as well as lower LC NRV and an expectation for fewer one-off expenses that occurred in Q2 of this year. With regard to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $6.25 billion. We expect this will give us runway through the start of production of Gravity and into 2025.
Moving to CapEx. We expect capital expenditures for 2023 to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, reflecting some efficiencies which were identified over the last quarter and deferrals in our capital outlay. CapEx will support our continued growth objective as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, some moderate investment in retail studios and service center capabilities across the globe and other areas supporting growth of Lucid's business.
I'd like to close by saying that we recognize the uncertainties in the macro environment and we're being thoughtful about how we navigate through this. But we're pleased so far with the progress we're seeing across some of our targeted initiatives and the momentum in our brand awareness and orders. We're also excited by what's coming in the remainder of the year. We're getting the Air into more customers' hands this quarter in Saudi Arabia. We will deliver Pure rear-wheel drive, our most affordable Air trim in September. We'll start deliveries of the Air Sapphire in October, and in November, we'll have our big Gravity unveil, a lot to be excited about in the 2 quarters ahead.
With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get your questions. Maynard? Thanks, Sherry. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Today's Q&A will feature questions from some of our retail investors, which is an important constituency of our shareholder base through the Say Technologies platform, followed by live analyst questions. Before we take questions from those on the phone, let's move to the Say questions here. The first question. What is the current status of your midsized EV development? Are you still planning on building it or alternatively providing licensing your platform to another OEM, similar to Aston Martin recent deal? Are you still aiming for a mid-decade release? Well, I'm delighted that the midsized EV development is on schedule for mid- to late decade. It's going to represent a further development in our technology and really take the efficiency story to the next level. That's really important. Expect all the attributes of efficiency, the space concept that you see in our current vehicles, the charging speed that you experienced in the Air to be there.
For that, we're developing our next-generation powertrain and we're already started working on that. That needs to be ready and to sync with the start of production of the platform. We're looking at all opportunities. The car's going to be a global vehicle. We're going to make it much more accessible in terms of its price point. And this was all with the strategy, the vision of Lucid to start with high-end product we're seeing with Air and Gravity to develop the world's most advanced technology and then to use that to deploy it to make electric cars more attainable.
And a center point of that whole thesis is how far can we go with how little battery, how efficient can we make to come. That's what is [indiscernible] is all about. That's what our technology is all about. And we're going to really -- that's going to manifest itself fully in the midsized platform. Great. We'll move to the next question. Could you provide an update regarding the development of your energy storage system? What is the current status of your ESS pilot program testing? And when should we expect it to go into production phase? Thanks, Maynard. Yes, in addition to the vehicle development and tech licensing businesses, we have envisioned that energy storage systems could be another monetization option for us. This could be ESS as the vehicle itself or residential storage systems as an example. While we have completed some early pilot work, it's not a strategic focus for us right now. In light of macroeconomic uncertainty and higher interest rates, we think it's important at this time to stay focused on our two highest priorities, which our vehicle sales business and our tech licensing business. Thanks, Sherry. The next 1 we addressed in terms of the delivery numbers in the back half, so I'll move to the question after. Is the partnership with Apple still in the works? Well, it's a company policy. I can't speak of potential partnerships with any company, clearly. I would say that we were delighted to have rolled out Apple CarPlay, and I think that really addressed a lot of -- we listen to the voice of the customer, and I think that was a big win for so many people. I think we have developed now a really fantastic user experience with our software. But it's important to give the customers choices they want and to let them choose. So we're open to all partnerships that make sense, including that. Thanks, Peter. The next question we already addressed in terms of our increasing brand awareness, so let me move to the next question. How often will we see ventures where Lucid is licensing or allowing companies like Aston Martin to use Lucid technology in the next 5 to 10 years? Well, first of all, I'm really thrilled to be partnering with Aston Martin. Such a storied company with such great history and just an ideal partner for us. Lucid started with relatively high-end, high-performance technology that we're seeing in Lucid Air and we'll see very soon in Sapphire. So it's appropriate and timely that we have a partner whose core DNA is high technology and high-performance attributes. So there's a perfect synergy here.
As we progress as a company and come progressively down-market into a more accessible place and more affordable, our technology, our powertrain technology will become more affordable. And then that would, in turn, more mainstream partners in the future. But I believe there's a time scale to this. I believe the market will come to us. I mean, it's little known, the vast majority of car companies today are just buying their powertrain from other companies. We are maybe 1 of maybe 2 or 3 that are vertically integrated. We believe that we're about at least 3 years ahead of the nearest competitor. And that nearest competitor is probably many, many years ahead of their closest competitor in terms of core EV technology.
Now I think a lot of the traditional car companies are starting to look at this, but frankly, they're way behind. And I think that as we increase the gap, the very fact we're getting to these extraordinary levels of efficiency, the 4.74 miles per kilowatt-hour, this is an indicator that the gap is growing, not narrowing. I think that a number of these traditional car companies are going to be left behind. And then I think that will be a real opportune moment for us as they seek to get on to the electric vehicle bandwagon, which we'll be a juggernaut by then. Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to take questions from the phone lines. Towanda, can we queue up the first question, please? [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Just a first question, Peter. I mean, the Aston Martin contract sounds great, and it seems like it might be the tip of the spear of things to come on selling the powertrain technology or licensing it. I'm just curious if you can confirm that there are other talks going on or that is part of the game plan. I know you can't talk about specific companies.
And then maybe sort of secondarily with that, explain the economics beyond the initial sort of payments here on shares and cash. That $225 million of powertrain development payment or revenue, I'm not sure exactly how you want to characterize that, Sherry. What kind of economics does that bring within? And is there something beyond this initial $450 million payment? Peter here. So yes, I mean, we're thrilled to have Aston Martin as a partner. It's a supply and technology partnership. Well, the elements, the core elements that we're going to supply are Wunderbox battery modules and battery technology, part of our battery monitoring system and the twin rear-drive unit that is destined for Sapphire. So this is top line technology which we're enabling Aston Martin really to get completely ahead of the pack with in terms of their move to electrification, and it's a wonderful result for both parties.
We're also going to help with the technological implementation and integration such as traction control, stability control and braking systems. The way that our power unit is integrated into their chassis, into their tires, the weight of the vehicle, the weight distribution of their vehicle. And so that sort of leads to the 2 elements of revenue here as a piece which is accessing the technology, and I'd let Sherry elaborate on that. It's an accessing fee, and then there's a supply fee, which is based upon clearly the number of vehicles that will be sold.
We've stated for some time, we've been in dialogue with a number of parties. We're not proactively reaching out to anybody. And my priority is to have -- really satisfying our first customer, Aston Martin. That is my #1 priority now is to ensure that they get excellent service and get the full might of our technological prowess behind them. But I'm open to dialogue with any other interested party that may come along. But clearly, right now, the technology we've got today suits higher-end products. In a few years' time will be in a situation where we could countenance a partnership for a more mainstream product when we get midsized platform technology ready. Great. I'll take the economics part of that question, John. So as we said, Lucid is going to get a technology access fee of $232 million. That's comprised of $100 million in ordinary shares and aggregate cash payments of $132 million. That's going to be phased over 3 years. Now a portion of the cash, $33 million, some engineering fees and the $100 million ordinary shares, that is available after deal closing, which we expect later this year. That will initially be recorded as deferred revenue, which will begin to release into the income statement as prototypes and/or production parts are shipped to AML.
The second part, the minimum spend on powertrain components of $225 million, that will be for prototype parts as well as production parts and then there will also be engineering integration fees. That will occur over time. So as the parts are shipped, the revenue will be due to us. And just a follow-up on that. I mean, a very simple question. I mean, do you think those margins will be sort of very strong supplier margins that would be in the mid-teens with return on invested capital in the high 20s or is that still TBD? This is going to be very strong margins for the company. John, this is a technology company play. Yes, no, I understand. Okay, that's great. This isn't an automotive supplier type of contract. This is a technology play. Okay, that's very interesting. And then just second... It's also very thoughtfully constructed such that the dollars coming in are anticipated to cover our costs as we go through the development cycle with them. Yes. No, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity here and need for this. Just a second question in the SG&A step-up, Sherry. I mean, you didn't mention marketing dollars increasing as far as that step-up. But I would imagine those probably had some impact on the step-up in SG&A, or am I misinterpreting something? Because it just seems like we're seeing a lot more commercials and there's talk about this. So just curious what that marketing spend was and how much it stepped up or didn't. Yes. So marketing is certainly part of the SG&A. We stayed largely within the bounds that we had budgeted and planned for Q2. And as we have said last quarter, we really took a targeted approach. And so we're really thoughtful about where those dollars are spent that we're going to get the largest ROI. Now that we're seeing those targeted dollars providing ROI, we plan to put more dollars into the targeted marketing spend, and then additionally, as we said, capitalize it through the incorporation and reinstatement of our original pricing program.
As you go forward the next couple of quarters, I would guide that SG&A will continue to be up somewhat, particularly as we are investing in infrastructure. So this company is growing. It's growing globally and there's important IT, G&A and launch costs associated with opening into some of these new markets, particularly marketing, that is going to happen. I don't expect this to be significant but it could be up 15%, 20% as you look forward on a year-over-year basis. If you look at a year-over-year basis, say, maybe up 15% to 20% on SG&A. That's very helpful. I got a bunch more but I'll follow up later. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Two questions from me also, if I could. First of all, when we think about the rightsizing or slowing down of the manufacturing, given these lower deliveries than maybe you would have expected a year ago, how much further could you go if, say, you're growing sales but maybe not by as much as you think? Like what are the backstops you have to sort of continue to narrow the gross profit losses? And then I had a follow-up. Okay. So you had a question on manufacturing specifically, and then additionally, you had a question on gross margin more generally. So in manufacturing specifically, we were able to see some significant efficiencies due to productivity initiatives and the workforce reduction that we did earlier in the year. So we're sitting in a good position relative to that. We don't see a lot of creep-up in manufacturing labor as we exit the year. Might be a little bit as we transition into our new general assembly hall and we move to the logistics center that's going to be on site. So we are being very thoughtful about the stage turning on of the new equipment with phase 2.
So as we are in 2023, at this point, we're really only accepting that we'd be turning on depreciation expense associated with the new general assembly hall and the warehouse, which would be essentially the internal logistics center. So as you look through the course of the year, that will come on board but that's only going to be an increase in depreciation expense of, say, 10% to 20%. The rest of that, we're going to move to 2024 more so when the Gravity comes on board late in 2024.
Gross margin, lots of activities that are going on there. We're sitting in a good position with respect to our contribution margin, also known as variable margin, as we're exiting the year. But there's even more that we can do there on bill of materials. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think you're going to see more of that action being effective in 2024. But I do see additional freight reductions and logistics cost down through the balance of the year. So those are 2 things on the variable margin, I think we'll be working on through the balance of the year.
I referenced our 5-point cost control program. And part of that is focused in the manufacturing cost area. There's still a lot to do in manufacturing overhead. And I already spoke to depreciation. So we're really going to be working to get scrap down and to be looking at professional services in the manufacturing overhead area, really focused on getting that down. So those are the areas of primary focus for this year. Great. That's helpful detail, and obviously, it's a complex math to figure out. And then just as a follow-up, you guys were successful in raising capital this past quarter but you also diluted your shareholders, the existing shareholders by 20% to 25%. Can you sort of talk about your -- how you plan to move forward on any potential capital raise relative to protecting your shareholder base? Well, first of all, as we said, there's not an immediate need to raise cash. We will continue to be opportunistic. What I'm excited about is there's a lot of catalysts potentially coming forward here with the bring-on of the rear-wheel drive, with the scale-up of the all-wheel drive of the Pure, with the Sapphire coming out, with the Gravity unveil later this year. All of these things are going to be interim and major milestone points that I would think could be very positive to the valuation of the company.
Hence, as you go further in time, if you add more shares then, it might not be as dilutive because you have these major milestone events and progress points in your business. We'll continue to look at all types of liquidity for the business. We have available to us the ABL. We have available to us loan in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as we advance our production there. We continue to have debt options as well as, of course, equity options. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Just two questions for me. Peter, you mentioned seeing an increase in orders since the recent -- very recent price adjustment. Hoping you can elaborate a bit more on that, and particularly in which trims did you see some of the strongest order response? And then secondly, Sherry, thanks for the color on SG&A going forward. I was hoping you could also provide some color on how we should think about R&D over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. We can't give guidance on the specific breakdown between trims. But what I would say is that we're already seeing a very positive feedback from our recent adjustments. We've also seen the value of just growing the awareness of the brand. And I think also, there's another factor here that so many people have in their minds that the is more expensive than it really was in the first place.
So then you combine that with the advents of the Pure rear-wheel drive, which is scheduled for production start in September. So I think this puts us in a very positive position now. It's all about growing wins, customer awareness of just how great the product is. We received a very significant endorsement just in the last few days indeed from MotorTrend that voted us the best luxury EV offering available in the U.S. and putting us above Tesla, Porsche and Mercedes. So I think we're looking forward to a pretty bright future now. And I can cover off on the R&D question that you had over the next couple of quarters. So we've been able to hold R&D pretty flat the last couple of quarters, but I do expect it to tick up over the next 2. And the reason for that is we're now reaching the important phase in the Gravity development where we'll be doing prototype vehicles. We'll also be doing engineering, design and testing on the Gravity and also early work on the midsized, with continued work on advancements in powertrain.
We also talked about the fact that we would have Aston Martin coming on, but that really has cash inflows designed to offset it. But I would expect maybe up 20% year-over-year would be the guidance that I'd look to give on a year-over-year basis in R&D. Our next question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald. Congratulations on the quarter. A lot of our questions have been asked by now. But maybe I was hoping, is it possible to perhaps better quantify the agreement with Saudi Arabia in terms of deliveries for Q3 and Q4? Just trying to figure out how best to model it. I know you said maybe not material in Q3, but just seeing if perhaps we can get a little more color there. Well, thank you. Yes, we're able to announce today that we have signed the finalized agreement. And this is an agreement and a commitment for at least 50,000 vehicles and an option up to an additional 50,000, making it 100,000 vehicles in all. Of all models of Lucid, this includes cars like Lucid Air being made in Arizona and also in Arizona. And we've successfully shipped homologated cars at scale to Saudi Arabia already and that's a real milestone. And these were in transit at the end of the quarter and [indiscernible] shortly after the quarter end.
We hope to get them landed and delivered before the Eid and summer holidays in KSA, but that we encountered a couple of issues there, which have now been resolved. So we're looking forward to beginning ramping deliveries to customers both in Q3 and Q4. Right now, I have to say we're not providing exact numbers. We don't plan to provide a geographic mix today. Got it. Okay, Peter. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Just wondering if you can maybe give us a sense of pricing for the Gravity, the SUV. I know you haven't disclosed that. But are you able to perhaps point us in the right direction as to where your thinking or what is something that you're targeting there? Sure, sure. Well, we've indicated for some time now to anticipate prices are very similar to the sort of price structure that you get with Lucid Air. But we're not in a position today to disclose those prices. We are planning a major launch event for Gravity in November, and I hope to be in a position that we can disclose those, the pricing structure at that juncture. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Jewsikow with Guggenheim. With the production guidance being maintained implying a pretty big step-up in back half deliveries or at least back half production, how should we think about your pricing strategy going forward? Is your goal to price your product lineup to limit inventory increases from the current level? And would you rather flex pricing or limit production from the current levels? Well, I think we want to make the car competitively priced to make it a super compelling proposition which I think it is now. I think it's an absolute bargain right now, quite frankly. We need to add more vehicles to the visible fleet on the road. The best advertisement we can get is a Lucid Air driving in wild. The more people see the cars, the more they get used to them, the more confidence that they have in our potential customer base. And so we're seeking to, of course, draw down upon existing inventory here and get the cars in customers' hands because our best salespeople are our customers. They're our best, firmest advocates.
And this creates a sort of natural catalytic effect. That's what we're achieving. Now of course, we've got 2 bookings coming. We've got the halo product, our Sapphire performance car coming imminently going into production in September, first deliveries in early October. And at the same time, going very, very similar time, we've got the rear-wheel drive version of our Pure going into production in Arizona in September. And this will be our most affordable and most obtainable variant of the car. So I think we need to watch this space.
We're always willing to adjust to market conditions. I think that's very important to retain that flexibility. The key is to get product out into the wild in customers' hands. That's the best marketing tool we've got. Yes, that makes perfect sense to me. And maybe just a quick 1 for Sherry. But on the impairment charges this quarter, does that reflect the latest pricing moves? Or should we think of -- what should we think about for LC NRV charges into the third quarter? It does already contemplate the reinstatement of the original pricing program for the balance of the year. Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP. Just on gross profit, the -- following up on the LC NRV impact, it took another step higher in the second quarter but was not all of the impact this quarter reflecting noncash. So curious what might be unpacked there. And just how do you foresee LC NRV trending through the remainder of the year? And should gross profit per loss, excluding this impact, improve through the remainder of the year? Yes. So the LC NRV was impacted by the original pricing program. It was also impacted by obsolescence and firm -- losses on firm commitments. In terms of the cost of revenue overall, there were some write-offs with respect to inventory. You get things like expired inventory, et cetera. Those are deemed to be more of a one-off nature. You always have some but we thought it was exceptionally high in Q2 was our opinion. So as we go forward, we would expect LC NRV to go down the next 2 quarters. That would be our expectation, and that's based on really the points that I made that there's fewer one-offs, that we already have quite a bit of inventory on the books and those would be the major drivers. I mean, I know it's tough to say but given the pricing announcements that you've recently made, should the gross profit per loss -- the gross profit loss per unit improve through the back half? So we've already contemplated the adoption of the original pricing program in the LC NRV. Okay, all right. And then just 1 last 1 on the commentary regarding the company's current $6.25 billion in liquidity to sustain the company into early '25. The implied cash burn rate over the next 7 quarters would be roughly $900 million per quarter. Is there any other way to read into that provided time line? I mean, I know we won't get into 2024 guidance right now, but just high level, how should we be thinking about CapEx relative to operating losses, just informing that time line? Yes. I think that you're right, it would go into 2025. We are expecting to go through the launch of the Gravity program. The cash, I think that your estimate is a reasonable one. We have been sharing CapEx all along. I did guide down a bit on CapEx to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the balance of the year, so that gives you a little bit of runway into thinking about the next 2 quarters. As we get closer to the end of the year, I'll probably guide for 2024 on CapEx. Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Beith with Redburn. I had two, if that's okay, and I guess where I'd like to start is on engineering changes. And I think you mentioned a couple of -- or you'd mentioned that you made a start on engineering changes to the Air during this quarter and also in the last quarter. But I was wondering if you could actually give some examples of changes that have been made or incoming to reduce diluted Air's bill of materials. And perhaps outside of that, what opportunities are there to de-content the vehicle to reduce its BOM. And then I have 1 follow-up. I think the most significant point here that affects the bill of material cost, it's not so much a change but it's a new model, which was planned. So there's a difference in the engineering but it's not a sort of unplanned change. It is a structured part of our product rollout. And that is the rear-wheel drive, 2-wheel drive Lucid Air appeal. This has got just 1 drive unit at the rear and so the other cars have got 2 drive units, 1 at the front and 1 at the rear.
So you save the cost of a drive unit. That in itself is very helpful. But we're down to just an 88 kilowatt-hour battery pack, which for most other companies would remain an unacceptably small range. But we're achieving 419 miles on the new EPA cycle with just this 88 kilowatt-hour pack, which is unprecedented. And because the battery pack is the biggest single cost item in the bill of materials, this has significant downward pressure on the cost of building the car.
I think that's the most significant change that we're making. I wouldn't portray that we're making implementing a series of changes to the vehicle other than on the software side because we're able to download over-the-air significant software changes to existing customers, which see their cars become better through the course of ownership.
And I also would like to indicate this, that because we have this modular battery pack, it means that we can just reduce the number of modules in the pack to downsize the pack for the rear-wheel drive 88 kilowatt-hour pack. So it's not a fundamentally different battery pack. It's just a natural derivative designed in from the outset of the pack we've got. And actually, we use a very similar philosophy on the pack of Gravity. It's very similar to the pack of Air using a very high percentage of carryover components to reduce cost and maximize economy of scale as well for us. Got it. That is super helpful. And I guess my second question is really for Sherry. I calculate Lucid's written down approximately $1.1 billion worth of inventory and firm purchase commitments since starting production in the third quarter of 2021. And I was wondering, when exactly do you expect to benefit from consuming the stock or perhaps cease writing down new purchases? Well, over the next few quarters, we're going to continue to use inventory that has already had LC NRV charges taken against it. So that would be over the next few quarters, you can see what the inventory balances on a raw material basis, work in process as well as finished goods through the footnotes in the 10-Q. And then you can do some rough math essentially to think about either the cost that would be attributed to the vehicles that are sold and think about the volumes in your model in order to do that math. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Maynard Um for closing remarks. Thank you. This concludes Lucid's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call.
During the first 3 years of production of Lucid Air, we've garnered significant industry accolades, including Car and Driver 10 Best List for 2024, The 2023 World Luxury Car of the Year and the 2022 Motor Trend Car of the Year. I can't think of any other company that has gotten this far this fast. Our superior technology, design and performance has repeatedly been recognized.
We've proved our technology prowess with Lucid Air. And not only did we pioneer the concept of efficient range through our technology, we also grew our lead with 4.74 miles of range per kilowatt hour for the Air Pure real wheel drive. The technology gap between Lucid and others is growing, not shrinking. 
We also launched the Lucid Air Sapphire, the first supersport EV Sudan as a halo product to showcase the potency of our technology. Not just the most powerful production Sudan ever, it has also been recognized as a great all-around driving car with exceptional handling and driving dynamics. Its exceptional 427 miles of EPA estimated range and fast charging truly completes the package.
And now we're embarking upon our next and most transformational phase of our development with the expansion of our vehicle lineup. The expansion of Lucid's total addressable market starts right now with the Air Pure rear wheel drive grows with Gravity and broadens with the forthcoming midsized platform. We unveiled the Lucid Gravity at the LA Auto Show in November to tremendous early reviews.
I am confident that the Lucid Gravity will redefine the electric SUV segment with incredible range, superior efficiency, fast charging speed and interior space that you have to see to believe. It will be unlike anything in its class, and it will be massive for Lucid. And for those who might be in Geneva, Switzerland next week, we welcome you to come and see us at the Geneva International Motor Show, where we will introduce the Gravity to the European market.
Now turning to sales and marketing. In 2023, we increased our brand awareness. And of greater significance our awareness among EV purchasing tenders increased substantially from the beginning of the year. And this gives us confidence that our sales and marketing initiatives are making solid progress. And we'll continue to take a science-based, data-driven analytical approach to our marketing but are also adding new initiatives. For example, our recent Saks Fifth Avenue partnership will allow us to leverage Saks luxury brand and ecosystem to generate awareness, leads and sales. Select locations will have test drive vehicles, further expanding our reach in locations which are not currently present with the studio.
Of particular significance has been our recent Air Pure Stealth initiative launched just last week. We have now realized a starting price point for the Lucid Air range of $69,900. Yes, that's right. The finest production EV in the world now starts at under $70,000.
This effectively extends the scope of the Lucid Air range into a new total addressable market segment. In fact, we're already seeing extremely promising results from this. Moreover, this is commensurate with our long-term strategy to make progressively more affordable vehicles.
This remarkable value proposition has in large part been made possible by our world-leading technology. Because [indiscernible] enables our cars to go further with less batteries, the Air Pure rear wheel drive is able to achieve an EPA estimated range of 419 miles [indiscernible] further than the competition. But more significantly, it achieves this with a battery pack size of just 88-kilowatt hours. And since the cost of an EV is dominated by the cost of the battery pack, this technical advantage translates directly to profound commercial advantage.
Now I believe it's important that the full impact of this is fully comprehended. The EPA testing procedure has recently been revised, and it's become more stringent. So Air Pure rear wheel drive is able to achieve a landmark [ 4.74 ] miles of range per kilowatt hour of battery capacity, and that's with new EPA ratings.
So whilst we are currently witnessing other EV brands registering reductions in their respective range ratings, Lucid is forging ahead, growing and building upon our technology advantage, and with it, I believe our future commercial advantage.
But I want to be clear, I'm also critically focused upon cost. It's not well understood that we designed and developed our technology for true mass manufacturability at scale. And we have more coming. 
We have significant advancements that I believe can drive costs down further.
Technology is not only about creating incredible products. It's also about innovation to improve costs. And I've never been more pumped about what's coming, what's yet to come from our technology roadmap. We are resolutely focused upon cost whilst continuing to prudently invest for the future.
Through 2023, we dramatically expanded our advanced manufacturing plant in Arizona, which we call AMP 1, and that was in preparation for Gravity. We built a state-of-the-art a general assembly line that is capable of assembling both Gravity and Air on the same line. And we'll continue to vertically integrate where it makes the most sense in areas of stamping, [ body Gravity ], our paint shop expansion and the new powertrain facility at AMP 1.
We built the first ever car manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia for semi knockdown kits. This year we also broke ground for the manufacturing of the completely built-up cars there. These are critical long-term investments that are reflected in our cost of goods sold.
Now the imagery in our earnings presentation, I hope gives you some sense of the scope and scale of what we're doing. When you see it in person and not the different shots in the factory, you truly start to understand how we're building a state-of-the-art factory for the future.
In fact, in January of this year, we have more than 100 guests representing over 60 strategic suppliers for Gravity, Air and for potentially midsize come to our factory. The feedback and support from our suppliers was extraordinary. They highlighted our best-in-class and advanced technology and continued investment in our production facilities, which provide a material signal of our long-term commitment.  My key message to them was one of growth, the critical need for obsessed partners, focused upon excellence and the importance of driving this journey together. So I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of them.
Now on the R&D side, we continue to invest for future supremacy, and I'm incredibly excited about our road map, both from an innovation and from a cost perspective. In 2023, we also raised $3 billion, including unparalleled support of $1.8 billion in equity funding from our largest shareholder, the PIF. Now Gagan will talk about liquidity in further detail.
We formed our technology licensing and access business through our first such deal with Aston Martin, and we're actively exploring additional and even broader technology and supply agreements.
We also have sales to a rental car company, and we're very pleased with early results. Lucid's range and efficiency are perfectly suited for fleets. And in fact, we saw new incremental orders from that rental car company due to demand. 
Of course, we haven't yet scaled this business. We're taking a methodical approach, which is prudent, and we're pleased with what we're seeing thus far. This is yet another tool to help grow our brand awareness and allow potential customers experience the car.
2023 was also a year where we made significant progress with our in-house software capabilities. Software is more than just the user interface. We have some of the best software engineers in the world, working on everything from user interface to new features, to powertrain to infrastructure. In fact, we developed and have been transitioning to our own in-house over-the-air software infrastructure. This not only helps our OTA functionality but it's also a source of cost savings.
Now building an OTA software as a service platform is no small feat. One that I believe most other car companies would simply not be able to do. And it's another example of technology aiding costs. And of course, this is a platform that we could potentially monetize in the future.
Now I want to be transparent as well. We also had some challenges. Firstly, the macroeconomic and higher interest rate environment impacted mainly in this market. And in the new markets to us, there's been some learning. For example, in Saudi Arabia, we learned that there are different market dynamics and intricacy is unique to that market. And so we have to scale that business differently for growth. But we've addressed the pain points. We're scaling up and expect good growth in the region this year. 
Now we've also faced some technical challenges with commencing production of the rear wheel drive Pure in the fourth quarter. This is normal when doing something so advanced and so efficient. As I said, a landmark achievement with a 4.74 miles of range per kilowatt hour. This is our most accessible car, and we had challenges ramping it up. But I'm delighted to say that we've now overcome these challenges and are now fully ramped in pure production.
So as we start 2024, I'm very excited about the year ahead and beyond. We made focused improvements to further enhance our customer journey. For example, the Lucid financial services team has been working to enhance and to simplify the customer financing experience, significantly reducing the customer cycle time to finance vehicles. And we are also in the midst of implementing a new technology platform.
Combined with the rollout of our accelerated delivery pilots, we were able to significantly improve the cycle times from order to delivery, improve customer satisfaction and, in some cases, increase orders. In one instance, we were able to get a customer through their purchase journey from the time they place the order to the time they completed delivery walk out in only just about 3 hours. Now this new process has been live for select markets since Q4 and for new loans and is expected to go live for all lease and other loan markets by the end of Q1 of this year. You'll see us roll these out to more locations throughout 2024.
So our total addressable market triples by doing what we always intended to do, making the Air progressively more affordable and now starting at under $70,000. A technical achievement in getting an 88-kilowatt hour battery pack in the Pure allows us to cut out battery costs but still provide an EPA estimated range of 419 miles even based upon the new and more stringent EPA testing. 
And Gravity will further expand our total addressable market from 2023 by more than 6x. The Gravity is scheduled for start of production late this year and numerous prototypes are already driving around. In fact, we just built more than 40 prototypes to date. You just have to see to believe it, the interior space and the sheer practicality is what every family has been craving, made only possible by our technology and design.
And I'm exceptionally encouraged by the early feedback and interest. We saw more than fourfold increase in daily gravity interest sign-ups following the L.A. Auto Show unveil. And the start of production for more affordable, high-volume midsized car is scheduled for late 2026. We'll continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with the midsized platform and the next-gen powertrain technology. And this will expand our market opportunity from 2023 to nearly 20x. 
As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to invest in our future with further vertical integration with stamping, with [ body in light ] for Gravity with paint shop expansion and powertrain at AMP 1, an important part of our longer-term cost and quality strategy.
I want also to touch on the broader market landscape and what seems to be a shift in emphasis from EVs. We have the utmost confidence in the future growth of the EV market. Environmental sustainability, energy storage improvements, regulatory forces and sheer performance superiority over internal combustion engine vehicles will drive the eventual march to an EV dominated automotive market. Emission standards are getting more stringent, and you've heard me say this many times. This truly is a technology race.
But doing world-leading EV technology isn't easy and not everyone can do it. And I believe that is becoming better understood now. As others are pulling back on EVs, we are here ready to help. We've talked about our willingness to work with other OEMs, and we've signed our first technology access deal with Aston Martin. And we continue to receive incremental interest from larger OEMs and others in the automotive space as well as in adjacent markets for our advanced technology.
In the automotive vertical, this is not only for electric vehicles, but we are also seeing interest in our technology for use in hybrid electric vehicles. There's nothing to announce yet today in terms of the deal, but we're really encouraged by the level of interest. And we're open to it because we think it's critically important for the planet.
Sustainability is at the core of who we are. It's ingrained in our purpose and our products, and we are a technology innovation company. EVs are just the start, but we also believe in the importance of accountability and transparency, which is why I'm so proud to say that we published our very first sustainability report just last week. 
We have more to come in 2024 with the expansion of our total addressable market opportunity with Air Pure and Gravity, further software enhancements and significant announcements, the opening of Gravity orders, the start of Gravity test drives and, of course, start of production of Gravity later this year.
Now we've come a long way, and we're here to do much more. We are here to stay. We have a clear and determined strategy for growth while having a laser focus upon costs. So I'd like to close by saying thank you to our suppliers, to our partners, and to our most important asset, our employees. We've overcome significant challenges and I can't think of any other people I would rather be with on this journey than the people here at Lucid. You are the core of our successes. And we are embarking upon our next transformational phase of the Lucid story, and so I've never been more excited about the future.
And with that, I'd like to introduce Gagan Dhingra, who has stepped into the role of our interim CFO, Gagan, please provide an update on our financials. Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today.
Before I get to my prepared remarks, I would also like to start by thanking the entire Lucid team. Over the past few months, I have spent even more time working closely with all the different parts of the organization. I am incredibly impressed by your perseverance, resourcefulness and teamwork. The successes we have been able to achieve is in no small part due to all of you. 
Turning to the business. In 2023, we made headway with our cost optimization programs, the key strategic priority for the company. We found success in areas, including freight, logistics, overhead and bill of materials. For example, we activated logistics as a part of the Phase II build-out of our Arizona factory, AMP 1, allowing us to bring the vast majority of vehicle components under the same roof as general assembly. This enabled us to realize savings from the reduction in overhead, transportation and complexity as well as better efficiency.
From an inventory perspective, we drew down raw material inventory levels by high teens percent from the start of Q4 through material planning and inventory management improvements. Improvements in focus accuracy, in particular, allowed us to reduce inventory resulted in savings related to logistics and material handling labor, equipment rentals and storage cost. 
We also experienced a significant reduction in freight from more efficient transportation and storage planning. For vehicle direct costs, we implemented a number of initiatives that resulted in certain bill of materials cost savings, some of which is directly related to our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint. We have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses that we will look to operationalize over the course of 2024.
Turning to our 2023 and fourth quarter financial results. We produced 8,428 vehicles in 2023, up 17% year-over-year and at the higher end of the 8,000 to 8,500 guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call.
During the fourth quarter, we produced 2,390 vehicles, up 54% sequentially.  In 2023, we delivered 6,001 vehicles up 37% year-over-year and in the fourth quarter, delivered 1,734 vehicles, up 19% sequentially. We expected to deliver more vehicles in Saudi Arabia in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the ramp-up was taking longer than we expected. However, we believe we now have the right infrastructure and processes built out.
Turning to the P&L. For Q4, revenue was $157.2 million, up 14% sequentially, driven primarily by higher deliveries. Cost of revenue in Q4 was $410 million. I want to make sure this is well understood. You cannot take this line item and divide it by the number of cars delivered to get the initial cost of making each vehicle. This is because our lower of cost or net eligible value, or LCNRV, also takes into account losses on raw materials and from purchase commitments. 
We have LCNRV adjustments, which write down certain inventory value to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future cost necessary to get the inventory ready for the ultimate sale. And we also record losses on firm purchase commitments. In addition, as we ramp up production, we expect the overhead per vehicle to improve.
Our gross margin improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily due to lower impairment charges in Q4 related to LCNRV. This amount was approximately $174.1 million, a 24.6% reduction from Q3. Although there are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin, so we don't typically provide specific gross margin guidance, I wanted to provide some directional color to aid in your modeling.
Looking forward to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate improvements to gross margin despite the price adjustments in the quarter for Pure and Tooling. The improvements are expected to be driven primarily by projected reductions in impairments.
As we move into the back half of the year, we expect to build inventory of Gravity components ahead of start of production, and so expect an increase in LCNRV impairments from an accounting standpoint that will affect gross margin. As I noted earlier, we have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold and we'll continue to focus on implementation and further areas for cost out.
Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense in Q4 totaled approximately $243 million up 5.3% sequentially due largely to higher personnel-related expenses. We believe our R&D investment into technology garners a strong return as the technology is not only used in our own vehicles but can also be leveraged as an additional revenue stream through strategic technology deals such as the one with Aston Martin. 
SG&A expense in Q4 was approximately $241 million, up from $189.7 million in Q3. The sequential increase was primarily related to an increase in sales and marketing spend, which is consistent with what we talked about in prior quarters related to putting more energy behind our science-based data-driven sales and marketing initiatives, professional services and personnel-related expenses related to largely geographic expansion.
We ended the fourth quarter with 45 studio and service centers, excluding our temporary and satellite service centers flat from Q3. On the service side, we ended Q4 with 47 mobile vans in the fleet and 79 nationwide [ improvised ] shops.
We plan to continue to strategically expand our studio and service center footprint as well as satellite service centers, which will cost effectively provide additional locations for Lucid customers. Although we don't provide specific guidance on operating expenses, I did want to provide some broader directional color. 
Looking into 2024 we expect operating expenses to be up year-over-year on an absolute basis, but expect it to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Our stock-based compensation in the quarter was $63.9 million. Total other income was $83.1 million, down from $122.3 million in Q3. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower noncash benefit of $25.3 million related to the change in fair value of our common stock warrant liability down from $60.3 million in Q3.
As a reminder, this noncash impact can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors with one of the larger factors being Lucid shared price at the end of the quarter. We also recognized $6 million in unrealized gains related to the Aston Martin stock we received in Q4 as a part of our strategic technology management. In Q4, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $604.6 million, a slight improvement from $624.1 million in Q3.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, with total liquidity of approximately $4.78 billion. Note, this excludes the $81.5 million in value of the Aston Martin shares as of December 31.
We have been able to consistently sustain a strong balance sheet over time. And as we have done for the last couple of years, we will continue to be opportunistic in exploring and diversifying access to financing sources. Accounts receivable increased to $51.8 million in the fourth quarter, up sequentially from $23.4 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to vehicle sales related to EV purchase agreements with the government of Saudi Arabia, and you can expect that this mix could result in fluctuations on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
Turning to inventory. Total inventory decreased 12.9% sequentially primarily due to raw material drawdown. We continue to see a box to a significant reduction in raw material days of inventory on hand as we work towards greater predictability in the transportation channel and refine our inventory management processes and systems. Capital expenditures for 2023 was $910.6 million, slightly below the $1 billion to $1.1 billion range we guided to on our third quarter earnings conference call. The lower CapEx was primarily related to developed projects into 2024. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $272.6 million, up from $192.5 million in Q3.
Moving to the outlook for 2024. We forecast production of approximately 9,000 vehicles in 2024, and we'll continue to prudently manage and adjust our production to meet our sales and delivery needs. Although we don't typically provide quarterly forecasts, I would remind you that the North American market is typically down sequentially in the first quarter. However, we expect to deliver vehicles in Saudi Arabia that we were not able to deliver in fourth quarter of 2023.
With regard to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $4.78 billion. We expect this will give us runway through the start of production of Gravity and at least into 2025.
Moving to CapEx. Our focus is increasing investments in our future growth initiatives, and we expect capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting certain defers in our capital outlay, M2 expansion for completely built up unit which we broke out last month. The completion of the AMP 1 Phase II expansion for stamping, paint shop, powertrain on-premise and Gravity body in [ white ].
From a product perspective, we have scheduled for Gravity starter production in late 2024, and start of production of our high-volume midsized platform is scheduled for late 2026. 
In closing, I would like to echo Peter's excitement as we enter the next transformation phase of the Lucid. We gained market share in 2023 and outpaced our overall addressable market despite the challenging macro environment, and I'm excited about the significant expansion of our total addressable market opportunity with the Pure, Gravity and the upcoming midsized platform. We are confident in the growth of the EV market and that we have the right technology, people and product lineup to succeed.
With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get to your questions, Maynard. Thanks, Gagan. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. As we typically do, we'll start with the saved retail questions. The first question is from Ed. Where are you at on production and delivery of Saudi orders? Well, last year, we made history in Saudi Arabia with the opening of the country's first ever manufacturing facility. In its first phase, the factory has a capacity to assemble just 5,000 Lucid vehicles a year, and operations have been well underway. Last month, actually, we broke ground on the factory for completely built up or CBU cars and these are critical investments into our future. And we're grateful for all the support from the government and from our partners. With regard to deliveries, we started deliveries to the Ministry of Finance last year. Under the terms of the agreement, the government has committed to purchase 50,000 vehicles with an option to purchase additional 50,000 over a 10-year time frame. This includes the Lucid Air as well as future models such as the Gravity and midsized platform. As I said in the opening remarks, the ramp was taking longer. We now have the infrastructure built out and have the right processes, we are scaling and expect good growth in 2024. Our next question is from Paul. Do you plan to reduce time to market for new products? Gravity has delayed 1 year. Third model is now mooted as mid- to late decade to the 2025. And as shareholders were losing value due to failures and delays, what happened to the all-star team and proven track record? Yes. That's a good point actually. I mean what we saw unprecedented external forces that impacted us with COVID and the global supply chain disruption. And that impacted many in the industry, not just Lucid. But I would say this. Tesla is the benchmark for engineering speed. If you look at the time taken between the start of production of Tesla Model S and X, it was just a bit over 3 years. If you look at where -- I mean we're scheduled for production for Gravity late this year, that's going to be a very similar time period between production of Air and Gravity. And that's despite it not being a derivative product there, a whole new platform. So I think that is a world-leading pace of engineering.
And for a small team to get Gravity, a landmark product, a completely differentiated product in just over 3 years. Now midsize what we've done is define a schedule for it, we're scheduling for late '26. Very similar in time scale. It's right there. I think this is world-class execution, frankly. Thanks, Peter. We'll go to question 3. Are there any updates regarding future partnerships with Apple? Well, as a general corporate policy, we don't talk about any particular companies, particularly as it relates to the future. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we have what I believe is the best tech history. We've seen increased interest from others, and we're very open to it because we think it's critically important for the planet. As I said before, it's super hard to do a good EV. It's relatively easy to make a bad EV and this growing realization just how hard it is to do a world-class EV. Next question is from Landon. When will Gravity reservations open? Is there a target date for first deliveries? We know what -- the target date for first deliveries. Oh, yes, I'm hoping we'll deliver some Gravity vehicles later this year. But naturally, you should expect the bigger volume to be around 2025. But we know the excitement around gravity is palpable. Okay. And we'll take our last saved question from Daniel. Do you plan to take a salary cut to reduce losses or plan to buy back shares to improve stock health? Well, many may not be aware of my founding role in this company as we know it today. I joined the company around 11 years ago, with a clear goal of making the very best electric vehicle and to drive a revolution towards sustainable transportation, which is going to benefit everyone in the planet.
Around that, we would call [indiscernible]. And I guess we had around 19 employees. So in 2021, I received a onetime CEO stock grant, and this was solely determined and approved by the Board of Directors. And a significant portion of that vested due to the company achieving certain market capitalization milestones as we publicly disclosed in 2023. So I think there's a huge misperception that this onetime grant was received as a salary and somehow we replicate it as my salary in the future. 
In fact, in 2023, at my request, I did not receive a bonus for 2022, nor did I receive any further equity grants in '22 or '23. And I just want to assure you, my mission and my dedication is still unwavering. I have not sold a single share of stock in all this time, over 10 years, except what was absolutely necessary for tax purposes. And the company stock I received from the grant remains in the form of company stock. And so I am also directly tied, personally tied, directly and hugely to the company's performance as a key shareholder.
And so I'm incentivized that way. My promise is to continue to work tirelessly, day and night, to drive brand awareness, to deliver more cars, to sign up more technology licensing and access agreements, to drive down costs and to bring the Gravity and midsized platform to market. We have an incredible team. We're driving forward, and I'm incredibly excited about our products and moreover, our future. Regarding the second part of the question, we are investing in our future, but we are a growth company. We are also a technology company. and I believe our investments into areas such as our research and development is an advantage and give us the opportunity for higher returns than any other automotive company because we are monetizing the intellectual property through agreements such as the one with Aston Martin. When we feel we can't increase value from reinvesting back into the business, we would consider returning the cash to shareholders via a repurchase program. But we don't believe this would happen for quite some time. Okay, thanks. Towanda, can we turn it over to go to questions on the call, please? [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Good morning, everybody -- good afternoon. Sorry, long day here. Peter, as you think about the gravity, it's really kind of showcasing your technology, not just on the powertrain but also in the body and structures of the vehicle, meaning just you have maximum material space for the footprint, is pretty impressive. As we think about the Gravity, it seems like it's going to be a game changer for you in the market. However, it does seem like the midsize platform may be even more important.
As we think about the launch of these two programs late this year and then the midsize in 2026, in relative importance, which is more important for Lucid for mid- to long-term success? And how do you kind of gauge that relative size of importance to the company? Thank you, John. I mean if you asked the question a year or 2 ago, people would question our technology. Today, it's given. The world's most -- we've got the very best technology. What we haven't got is scale and an economy of scale. And that is going to take place in 3 critical steps and the first step happened last week. We launched our Pure Stealth initiative. Lucid Air is now available at 69 -- from $69,900, the best EV on the planet at that price. That puts us into 3x the TAM, the total addressable market because now we go into E class Mercedes territory rather than S class So step one, Pure from $69,900, 3x the total addressable market. And then scheduled for production late this year, we have Gravity, the SUV. We're talking about 6x the TAM with Gravity. And then scheduled production late '26, the third step on this journey, midsize, 20x for TAM. It's all about scale. We've got the tech. The tech is designed for scale. It's about achieving scale and with that, we'll get the economies of scale and the margins and the profitability. So ultimately, just to interpret that, I mean we're fighting to the position of getting to that even greater scale with the midsize, and that probably is sort of the fulcrum point and where you'll get to escape philosophy on profitability and cash flow. Is that a fair statement? Today, we're competing with Mercedes and Porsche. With midsized, we compete directly with Tesla Model Y and Model 3. That's the best selling car in the world. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the potential for hybrid technology or joining obviously a nice engine to be part of a hybrid powertrain. I mean, one, what kind of discussions are going on there? And two, I mean in layman's terms, there's always these positions in electric motor to be put or placed in the ICE powertrain from P0 all the way back to P4 and various positions in the middle. As you kind of envision what you could bring to the table and the potential positioning or integration with an ICE engine to make a presumably pretty efficient powertrain for hybrid, where would you land in that positioning? And have you even thought of that at this point? So if you just talk about discussions that are going on and then sort of your thought process about how you would integrate into an ICE engine. Yes. So we always envisaged a key pillar of our business being the technology licensing and supply where in we got the best technology, and that's recognized. Our arrangement with Aston Martin last year has triggered an increase in interest in our technology. we're also growing our own internal team so that we'll be able to not just be receiving passively inquiries but actually become a little bit more proactive in the future.
Actually, the application for hybrid has come as an external inquiry. Because if you look at the core capabilities of our powertrain, the unique selling price of it -- proposition of it is its efficiency. Well, that applies equally to say, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle or a gasoline electric hybrid and also it's compactness its power.
And that is very relevant to the hybrid because in a hybrid, you've got to stuff in a gasoline engine and exhaust and all that stuff and that paraphernalia, and electric motors and battery. And it really becomes a packaging puzzle plus. And because we've got the most complex technology, that ideally lends itself to that. Now Lucid, it's not going to do hybrids. We're ready to bat for electric. We believe Pure is the solution. But certainly, the hybrid opportunity opens up a whole new market arena for our technology. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Dutton with Evercore ISI. Peter, so you mentioned a few manufacturing advancements coming to further drive down costs in 2024. I was just curious if you can quantify those or give us a couple of examples of initiatives that you have in progress right now to help on that cost side of the business. Right. So we're really looking at further vertical integration, particularly in our factory in Arizona. We're bringing stamping in-house and that is going to be right alongside the new body shop for our Gravity. So we will reduce the operational cost, we will reduce OpEx. We'll reduce inbound logistics costs, we will actually reduce scrap as well. And there's an internal efficiency as well by having an integrated state-of-the-art hydraulic transfer stamping line with laser blanking facility fully integrated. Then we're actually moving our powertrain, which is already vertically integrated our world-class motors, inverters, drive units, all in-house at the moment. But that's in a separate factor up the road so we will save those logistics costs by actually putting them under the same roof as our main factory in Arizona, so we will save operational and will be efficiencies.
The other thing we're integrating into that factory is logistics. And we've been able to draw down some of the cross stocks. I think all our cross stocks now virtually have been drawn down upon. So we've got inbound logistics cost savings. And then the other thing we're doing is we've really revised the organization so that quality reports directly into me. We're really driving down man hours per vehicle. But perhaps, Gagan, you could provide a little bit more color on some of the initiatives you're driving leading to drive down cost. Yes. Thank you, Peter. So we have identified 3 initiatives, 1 scale. Scale will help us improve our margin. This is technology and volume rate. One, we took some initiatives in 2023, and we are seeing the results. But more importantly, we have identified additional opportunities that will look to operationalize in 2024. On operational efficiency, which is number three. And as Peter mentioned, we are looking multiple areas. One, freight, we made significant improvements in '23 and looking more in 2024. Logistics specifically as we move from our LOC warehouse to implement Phase 2 general assembly. This has really helped us in reducing the cost. This is a consistent exercise. And we are looking at this very carefully. This is my #1 goal, having the cost optimization. But again, it is not easy. We are looking at consistently. And also, we have initiated a team under me specifically looking each area very carefully looking at each dollar and bring the efficiencies. But as we grow, as we scale, it will bring us efficiencies. This is a technology and volume risk. Yes. Scale is critical because to drive down the COGS, you've got that fixed cost component. And it's the amortization of the fixed cost and overhead depreciation per vehicle. So this is a -- this is the initiative to start at $69,000 is 3-step hitting our total addressable market, the scale will drive down the costs. Excellent. I appreciate all the detail there. That's really helpful. Just one quick one from me then. On Gravity, starting price of $80,000, obviously, not a ton of deliveries in 2024, but will that be similar to the strategy with the air where you're starting with the higher trims and then moving downstream. Is that the right way to think about pricing and the model pending '24 and going into '25? Yes. we haven't disclosed that yet. I do think it's reasonable to assume Gravity is going to be in a similar competitive set as Air, it's going to be completing more in the Mercedes arena, we'll have to wait for midsize to come, which is scheduled for production late '26 to have a true Tesla Model Y Model 3 competitor. I mean, the key thing with Gravity is we're going to hit about 6x the TAM that's going to help us hugely with this economy of scale. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for the KSA market this year. You mentioned, first of all, that there was some unexpected nuances in ramping and I guess, production to during '23. So how do we think about how you benefit from that market and the growth during the year. Yes. Thank you, Steven. We are limited to what we can say in general, and we do not specifically talk about any specific customer. But what we can say, and most of you are already aware that the government of Saudi Arabia has an initial commitment to purchase 50,000 vehicles with an option to purchase additional 50,000 vehicles. And as I said in the opening remarks, the ramp was taking longer than we expected. And we now have the right infrastructure and processes built out. There were significant administrative challenges. We have addressed most of the pain points we are scaling and expect good growth this year. And also note this government with Saudi Arabia also includes Air, Gravity and Midsize. That's helpful. And then just one clarification. You mentioned a lot of cost initiatives that are underway for '24. In '23, is there a way to quantify how the bill of materials came down or just directionally what it did versus '22? Yes. We don't specifically guide but what I can say that our gross margin in Q4 improved compared to Q3. And also we don't provide a guidance, but I expect our gross margin will improve sequentially in Q1 next year. Having said that, our purchase of Gravity components ahead of start of production may have some impact on LCNRV as we progress. But as I said, the cost is a critical component. We are looking at it very carefully. We are very proud of what team has accomplished. Specifically related to the engineering team and supply chain team. They have done a tremendous job finding savings even through technology. So we are -- we have identified couple of areas, and we are looking very aggressively. And this is our #1 goal, looking at the cost optimization and [indiscernible]. I think the other thing is that I know I keep bringing on this point that is critical. It's a critical differentiator of us. Because we can go batteries, we can hit the biggest single cost item of ore on an EV, which is the cost of the battery. Some people are looking at these are so-called advance in technology and manufacturing, you might save $100 in a vehicle. You can say $,1000 potentially with having the ability to go further with less batteries. And we're seeing that playing out now with the Air Pure rear wheel drive. We've got more range than anyone else in that sector. And with just a 88-kilowatt hour battery pack, smaller pack, say, 12-kilowatt hours of pack has potentially thousands of bucks on bill of material. Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Beith with Redburn Electric. I'd like to -- and maybe we'll start with my questions for Gagan. If I exclude the inventory write-down of the $172 million from COGS in the fourth quarter, it looks like unit COGS improved by about 20 percentage points sequentially. I was wondering what was it that drove the improvement? Was it the receipt of the $98 million government grant? Or is this accounted for elsewhere? Yes, that's a good question. So first of all, grant doesn't play a role in the course as of today. What -- as I highlighted, we took a couple of initiatives in 2023. Freight like very important, we made significant savings but also, more importantly, our forecast accuracy of raw materials because today, the cost of goods sold is not only related to how many cars we sell. But is also related to what raw material inventory will have and how we utilize that. So the focus, accuracy, the freight opportunities in BAM really helped us out improve our gross margin in Q4. Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And my second question relates to the Air and the Gravity. If I put aside the differences in the interior and exterior of the vehicles, are you able to share roughly what proportion of parts and components are shared I guess the fact that these vehicles are using different platforms may impact the variable cost down assumptions. It was previously communicated that both vehicles would leverage LEAP. Okay. Let me cover that. If you look at the battery pack, which is the core, core part of the bill of materials of both vehicles, it is about 95% the same. It's -- they've both got the same number of modules, the same number of cells. They made exactly on the same line. It's just that the two of the top modules are a different location. We move them from underneath the rear seat in Air to underneath the front seat in Gravity. This has a transformative effect upon the nature of the vehicle, which in turn leads to a much bigger TAM.
We can only capture that TAM, by having a degree of differentiation. Now if you look at the core powertrain, the drive units and the inverters they're very, very high proportion carryover, slightly different gear ratios because the wheels are bigger, and you need more tractability you have slightly lower gear ratios.
Now the rest of the platform is very similar, which has meant that it saved on our R&D costs because we've got a learning and the process knowledge of how we rivet and glue the sheet stampings, the castings and the extrusions together. But there is a degree of difference in that platform, which I think makes a whole bunch of sense because it makes gravity a true SUV, not some sort of -- soft CUV derivative. And that means we go into a whole new TAM 6 times. We would not be able to capture that TAM. And also, you need to double the tools anyway because of the extra volume. So then we look at the upper body shell of the car, they're always going to be different anyway. So we're talking about a very slight increase in tooling costs. But in return for that, we truly enter a massively bigger term, 6x, and this is all about economy of scale. We've got the technology. It's designed for scale. We just haven't achieved that scale yet. And so therefore, it's not showing in our P&L. Makes sense. All right. And if I could squeeze one last one in. 2 quarters ago, I asked about the steps required to move from beta prototyping of the gravity, which is then just started to series production. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the progress today. So we're writing the thick of beta prototypes. In fact, both between betas and alphas, we've got more than 40 prototypes built, many of which are running around right now. We'll be finishing our run of beta prototypes over as we move now into the spring. And the next step will be to do our release candidates. That's our preproduction run through the summer in the factory and Arizona, which will lead to our scheduled start of production late this year. Thank you. Due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Maynard for closing remarks. Thank you. This concludes Lucid's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

And welcome to the Lucid Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Maynard Um, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, and welcome to Lucid Group's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Peter Rawlinson, our CEO and CTO; and Gagan Dhingra, our Interim CFO and Principal Accounting Officer.
Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call include forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, financial and operating outlook and guidance, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives and other future events. These statements are based on predictions and expectations as of today and actual events or results may differ due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
We refer you to the cautionary language and the risk factors in our most recent filings with the SEC and the forward-looking statements on Page 2 of our investor deck available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.lucidmotors.com.
In addition, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in our investor deck.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. In my prepared remarks today, I'll discuss our partners at the PIF, our better-than-expected production and delivery figures, our cost advantage and our overall momentum. All of which makes me more optimistic than I've ever been about our future.
Now I believe there are 2 key factors that really set Lucid apart. Our superior in-house technology and our partnership with the PIF who have been steadfast investors and partners.
In Q1, we raised $1 billion in capital through a private placement of convertible preferred stock to an affiliate of the PIF. We are a strategic partner in the country's plan to achieve its Saudi Vision 2030 goals. I'm very grateful for the PIF continued confidence and their steadfast support.
Now turning to production and deliveries. In Q1, we produced 1,728 Lucid Airs, and we delivered 1,967. Both slightly above our expectations. In fact, it was our best quarter-to-date for deliveries, up 39.9% year-over-year. Our lower production than deliveries is an active decision to be cost conscious and is not a reflection of production bottlenecks. For 2024, we expect to produce approximately 9,000 vehicles, which is consistent with our guidance last quarter.
Let me now provide you with an update on where I believe Lucid stands today. We've made solid progress on both brand awareness and pricing. With our general brand awareness raising in the first quarter despite reducing media spend from the fourth quarter. Our Lucid Air is increasingly recognized as a superior vehicle in nearly every aspect that customers value. For the third consecutive year, Lucid Air was named the best luxury electric car by U.S. and World Report on its 2024 best hybrid and electric car awards.
Lucid Air is the only EV to win this category award 3 years in a row, another achievement that sets us apart. Lucid Air solves biased key concerns. It has price parity with gas car equivalents. It's the longest range and fastest charging production car in the U.S. market. It's engaging to drive with remarkable performance and it enjoys a lower total running costs due to its efficiency.
Now consumers are savvy, and they recognize the deficiency of other EVs in the market. particularly the limited range of most EVs. To [ eSpheres ] of range anxiety, other automakers must produce and install bigger batteries. Which results in higher cost to charge the vehicle and longer relative charge times versus lucid air. Remember, Lucid air is the most efficient vehicle in its class as measured in miles per kilowatt hour. While leading the industry for range and charging speed and having a lower total cost to charge.
I've seen commentary about our losses per vehicle, but such speculations reflect a lack of knowledge about our costs and our scale of intentions. Inside, the extensively high cost of goods line item is the cost of the factories and equipment needed to make the vehicles and scale our business.
If we envisage the company would only make a small number of vehicles, we would have purchased less equipment and built a [ smaller ] factory. But we have a more ambitious goal to provide affordable, long-range EVs for mainstream mass market consumers. And as we scale, the leverage in our model should become obvious. And we're embarking on a transformational phase, the expansion of our vehicle lineup.
Lucid Air Pure is already here with a starting price from $69,900. And the gravity SUV program is scheduled for start of production late this year. Our SUV's total addressable market is 6x larger than the market we could access in 2023. And the excitement is palpable. In a third-party survey, already 2/3 of EV SUV purchasing tenders would consider Lucid. And this is worth emphasizing 2 in every 3 people intending to purchase an electric SUV knows and would consider Lucid. Amongst all SUV purchase intenders, EVs and gas SUVs, more than 50% would consider Lucid. Now this is a staggering figure for any brand, let alone a new one, and this reflects the significant opportunity ahead.
We are continuing to invest in our future with further virtual vertical integration, stamping, body in white for the gravity SUV program, paint shop expansion and Powertrain at AMP-1, an important part of our longer-term cost and quality strategy. We've applied all of our learnings from Air and incorporated them into our SUV program. So I'm confident that Gravity will redefine the segment with world-class range, efficiency, charging speed and interior volume.
Later this year, we plan to host analysts and institutional investors at our AMP-1 facility in Arizona. To show you our state-of-the-art factory manned by our incredible employees and the machines that build the machines. We'll also have vehicles on the road later this year for you to test drive. And following the Gravity SUV program, we see another step change in total addressable market expansion with our midsized vehicle, which is scheduled for start of production in late 2026.
I am confident that we can achieve unrivaled levels of efficiency for this crucial midsized class vehicle. And again, I can't stress enough efficiency is the key to a smaller battery for any given range. And a smaller battery is a key element to lower cost when it comes to making an EV. I can't wait to show you our midsized game changer.
Next, I'd like to talk about our technology business. Our Aston Martin deal continues to generate more interest in our technology from other prospective partners. And additionally, we are the sole supplier of the front drive unit to a leading electric racing series. Please watch this space as we continue to discuss monetization opportunities across all aspects of our technology, including our world plus software.
I'll close with additional details about our momentum. We surpassed 12,000 vehicles on the road in Q1. Which takes us nicely past the critical threshold into boosting word-of-mouth awareness. And I am pleased with the 39.9% year-over-year uptick in sales in Q1 and with the momentum we're seeing here in April. I always offer caveats. We expect typical seasonal slowing in Saudi Arabia in Q2 and we expect typical seasonal slowing globally in Q3 as consumers go on vacation. Despite this, for the first time, I feel we're on the cusp of escape velocity. We have sales momentum, a compounding efficiency advantage, unprecedented interest from consumers and corporate partners, more than $5 billion in total liquidity, and Gravity, which I believe is on track to become the world's best SUV. Therefore, I've never been more confident in our future.
So before turning the call over to Gagan, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge our recently announced management change. Derek Carty will now lead digital's organization as interim head, taking over from Mike Bell, who will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. I'd like to thank Mike for all of his contributions. Mike joined Lucid in early 2021 and was instrumental in building a truly unparalleled [ software ] organization.
Mike will be staying on for a period of time in an advisory capacity, and I have full confidence in Derek and the digital organization. And as we enter into our next transformational phase of the company.
So I'll end with a big thank you to all of our suppliers, our partners and our shareholders. And most of all, thank you to all [ listed ] employees for your commitment, your dedication and share hard work.
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Gagan Dhingra to provide an update on our financials. Gagan? Thank you, Peter. And thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. Before I get to my prepared remarks, I would also like to start by thanking the entire Lucid team. I am continually amazed by and thankful for everyone's dedication and perseverance.
Turning to our 2024 first quarter financial results. During the first quarter, we produced 1,728 vehicles, and we reiterate our guidance to produce approximately 9,000 vehicles this year. We delivered 1,967 vehicles in Q1, up nearly 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially.
In Saudi Arabia, we resolved some of the logistical go-to-market challenges we had in Q4, and we were able to ramp up deliveries in Q1. We are also pleased with [indiscernible]  American volumes, which we think is benefiting from growing brand awareness and increasing number of vehicles on the road and improving affordability. We are encouraged by what we are seeing.
Turning to the P&L. For Q1, Revenue was $172.7 million, up 9.9% sequentially, driven primarily by higher deliveries. Average selling prices were down sequentially due to mix as well as the pricing adjustments, which affected a part of the quarter.
Cost of revenue in Q1 was $404.8 million, despite lower average selling price, our gross margin improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to both cost optimization initiatives, including production in bill of material and logistics costs and lower impairment charges in Q1 related to [ LCNRV ]. The [ LCNRV ] amount was approximately $137.8 million or 20.8% reduction from Q4.
Fixed costs related to the depreciation of our factories and equipment remains a large part of the cost of revenue. And as we ramp up production and deliveries we expect the overhead per vehicle to significantly improve. There are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin. And as a result, we don't typically provide specific gross margin guidance. However, I wanted to provide some directional color to aid in your modeling.
Looking forward to the second quarter of 2024, we anticipate gross margin to remain flat despite our full quarter price adjustment in Q2 instead of half quarter impact in Q1. This improvement is mainly due to further cost optimization initiatives.
As we move into the back half of the year, we expect to build inventory of components for the gravity SUV program resulting in an increase in [ LCNRV ] impairments from an accounting standpoint. This, in addition to higher depreciation due to further Phase II activation, is expected to adversely affect gross margin. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks last quarter as well. We have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold and we'll continue to focus on implementation and further areas for cost out.
Longer term, our technology will be a key driver of our gross margin. With scale, I believe you will see strong gross margins with efficiency, the key enabler.
Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense in Q1 totaled approximately $284.6 million, up 17.1% sequentially. We expect R&D to increase further as we ramp up the new vehicle programs. I think it's widely accepted that Lucid has the best EV technology in the world.
SG&A expense in Q1 was approximately $213.2 million, down 11.5% from Q4. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing spend due to seasonality and lower professional services and other general expenses due to continued cost optimization initiatives. Although we have identified additional cost reduction opportunities to execute this year, we expect SG&A to increase primarily due to continued investments in strategic growth initiatives.
We ended the first quarter with 50 studio and service centers, excluding our temporary and satellite service centers, up from 45 in Q4. On the service side, we ended Q1 with 54 mobile brands in the fleet and 93 nationwide approved body shops. We plan to continue to strategically expand our studio and service center footprint as well as satellite service centers, which will cost effectively provide additional locations for Lucid customers.
In 2024, we see a pathway to operating leverage. The key will be driving volumes and scale. Our stock-based compensation in the quarter was $63.7 million. Total other income was $49.2 million down from $83.1 million in Q4. The decrease was primarily attributable to a noncash loss of $19.9 million related to the change in fair value of our equity securities of Aston Martin shares, which we received in Q4 as a part of our strategic technology management. In Q1, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $598.4 million, a slight improvement from $604.6 million in Q4.
Moving to the balance sheet. In Q1, we raised $1 billion through a private placement of convertible preference stock to an affiliate of the PIF. I would like to echo Peter and thank the PIF for their partnership and their commitment to Lucid and our mission.
PIF's partnership and support separates us from others in the industry. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, with total liquidity of approximately $5.03 billion. Note, this excludes the [ $50.8  ] million in value of the Aston Martin market shares as of March 31.
We have been able to consistently sustain a strong balance sheet over time. And as we have done for the last several years, we will continue to be opportunistic in exploring financing.
Turning to inventory. Total inventory decreased 18. 8% sequentially, primarily due to further raw material drawdown and lower purchases as we optimize our existing inventory. This is consistent with what I outlined last quarter, where we continue to see a pathway to a significant reduction in raw material on hand. Capital expenditures in Q1 was $198.2 million, down from $272.6 million in Q4.
Moving to the outlook for 2024. We forecast production of approximately 9,000 vehicles in 2024, and we will continue to prudently manage and adjust our production to meet our sales and delivery needs. As Peter mentioned, we are pleased with the demand we are seeing, but I would also remind you that we typically see some seasonality in Saudi Arabia towards the end of the second quarter.
With regard to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $5.03 billion. We expect this will give us a runway through the start of production of the Gravity SUV program and into the second quarter of 2025.
Moving to CapEx. We will continue to focus on our future growth initiatives and we expect capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $1.5 billion. This reflects certain deferrals in our capital outlay from last year. The AMP-2 expansion for completely built-up unit, the completion of the AMP-1 Phase II expansion for stamping pin-sharp powertrain on-premise and body in white for the Gravity SUV program. From a product perspective, we are scheduled for start-up production of the gravity SUV program in late 2024 and scheduled for start-up production of our high-volume midsized platform in late 2026.
Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the positive momentum, the expansion of our total addressable market, the pure upcoming Gravity SUV and midsize programs provides further opportunities, and I feel very good about our cost optimization strategies and see many opportunities ahead.
With that, let me turn it back to Menard to get to your questions. Thanks, Gagan. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Before we take questions from those on the phone, I want to post some questions that our retail investors sent into the [ Say ] technology platform. Our first question is from Anav. Can you elaborate on Lucid's pathway to profitability? What are the key milestones and challenges the company anticipates facing in reducing production costs and achieving positive gross margins? Thank you, Anav. It's all about scale. The more we can scale, the more cars we make, the more volume we can spread the fixed cost, that's the cost of our investment, our incredible factory and facility, our long-term investments across the sale of each car. So how do we do that? We need to continue growth of Lucid Air sales right now. And right now, we're trending up 40% from Q1 this year relative to last year.
Now in a similar period, we see the sales of Tesla Model S down very, very considerably. We're outselling key competitors like Porsche Tycan. It's a about scale. And the next thing on that scale path is to get gravity into production that will have a multiplier effect upon the market size and gravity is scheduled for startup production late this year. And then beyond that, we need to get a midsized vehicle, our volume vehicle price at around, we believe, about $48,000, get that into production and is on schedule for production for late '26.
And I've got to tell you just how much our current finances are truly dominated by the major investments that Lucid's made for its future. Things like the expansion of our Arizona [ first ] factory, we've got nearly 4 million square feet in there. General Assembly is ready. We're putting the robots in now for building the body structure for Gravity. We've invested in a huge stamping line, we're integrating logistics, we're bringing a powertrain facility right under that one roof, and that's exactly where we're going to make the units that we supply to Aston Martin, all under one roof. And I think there are some photographs in the presentation, Maynard and videos on our social media pages.
And then the other thing is the real big advantage that Lucid's got over everyone else is efficiency. And I don't say that as an engineer, I say that as a businessman. [ The ] efficiency means we can make cars with smaller batteries with less batteries than anyone else. That means because the battery is the most costly part of an EV, we will be able to make cars more cost effectively and therefore, with more profit margin than anyone else, which leads perfectly to your role Gagan. Yes. Thank you, Peter. And two things more scale and continuous cost optimize initiatives. With scale, we'll be able to significantly bring down, number one, the fixed cost per vehicle, including depreciation of the investment we made in the factory, which is a big part of our cost of goods sold. Number two, labor and overhead and you get more efficient when you work at the optimal capacity. Number three, also the BOM cost as volume provides a significant cost leverage.
Now let me add to the cost optimization initiatives that we have been working very aggressively, and I'm personally leading this on a daily basis with big support from Peter. As I said in the prepared remarks, we were able to reduce the bill of materials, which is the cost of the parts that go into the car and also logistics costs significantly this quarter. We have also identified additional opportunities to execute throughout the year. Our next question from the platform is Jason. The stock price keeps dropping. What measures will you be employing to bring the price up considerably? It seems product output is extremely low. Thanks, Jason. Now look, our share price, again -- again, it's all about volume. So forgive me, because the share price and the part of profitability are interwoven. Against a broader EV market, where the -- other makers products are really down. We're up. 40% on deliveries year-on-year. We're bucking that trend. It's all about scale. It's about recognition on the brand, and I believe we're getting there. And we've got Gravity coming. .
Just to put this in perspective, in Q1, for the first time ever, Lucid outsold Porsche Tycan. We've outsold the Mercedes Benz EQE for the third consecutive quarter. We've outsold the Mercedes Benz EQS as well third consecutive quarter. We've sold the new BMW i7, and we've outsold the Audi Itron GT for the [ fifth ] consecutive quarter.
I want to also explain another matter here. We are not manufacturing constrained. This isn't a ramp-up situation. We can [ link ] from it. It's very much an economy situation it's about growing awareness of just how awesome the product is and the sales will follow. And that's the trajectory we're on. It's all about these cells and volumes.
And I also want to just put -- as a final point, I would like to put Lucid's stock price in context for this year. Just for context, Tesla is down about 25.6%. Rivian is down about 56%. We're down 27%. So really, there is a trend here in this sector. But clearly, we've got a path to get out of it. Gagan, do you want to add some color? Yes. Thank you, Peter. And again, we are also very focused on execution and optimization of cost. We have the most efficient vehicle, but it's not just about the sustainability story. It's about growth, it's about scale, and it's about the profitability. I expect it will show in our margins over time as we scale. The third question is from Justin. Is Lucid in talks with any of the legacy automakers to provide battery or motors for production? Thanks, Justin. Thanks for the question. I can't emphasize enough. This is absolutely central to the whole vision of the company, and that's why we call it Lucid Group. The vision is to have a meaningful impact upon the planet upon the environment to take technological leadership. And to use that leadership that we can travel further with less and be truly sustainable and then to share that technology and provide that technology to other companies. And we've taken the first step, we're providing the sapphire technology, our hypercar technology to no less than Aston Martin. And there's a time scale associated with this, I mean the technology that we've got in our current lineup of touring, grand touring, ideally suited to a luxury performance car from another automaker.
But what really excites me is the potential for the technology that we're currently developing right here in this building in listed headquarters where I speak for our midsized tech platform. This is the tech that really is going to suit a high-volume family car of the future. And that's what's going to create the multiplier effect. So as you can appreciate, we can't really talk about specifics. But indeed, we are in talks. There are large OEMs that appreciate the value of our tech, and they are certainly interested in working together with us.
Gagan, would you like to add anything to that? Yes. And of course, under the right economics. Absolutely. And I think [ there in lies  ]another misunderstanding because of our current finances this completeness information that our tech is so expensive. And it's completely the opposite. Our tech is made for affordability at scale. It's designed around reducing the need for battery, which is the biggest cost item of making an EV. So actually adopting Lucid's technology is a route to significantly reducing the cost of making an EV. And this is simply just not sufficiently appreciated or understood. Great. And our last question is from Robert. Will Lucid make an affordable car to compete with Tesla? Well, I've got an answer to that. We already are. The Lucid Air Pure rear wheel drive, finest machine on the planet, $69,900. The price I promised back in September 2020, we're already competing with Tesla. But wait until our midsize comes out late '26. That's when we'll have a car, $48,000, $50,000 and that is the big one, the one that's going to be really exciting. Great. Now we'd like to take questions from the phone lines. Twanda, can we take the first question, please? Our first questions from the line of Adam Jonas. Peter, you said in your prepared remarks and in the statements that you published that sales momentum is building? Can you quantify what supports that statement? Over what period was it measured? Were you talking year-on-year? Or were you talking about momentum building kind of more during the quarter and sequentially? Okay. Yes. Adam. So if we look at 2023 versus '22, I believe we were up by 37% or close to 37% on memory. And if you compare Q1 '24 to Q1 '23, that's where we had the 39.9%, very, very close to 40% growth. So we're bucking the trend of the market quite nicely. Okay. And just as a follow-up, you said that your focus remains on cost. A relentless attention to cost. And you mentioned some big improvements this quarter on BOM costs specifically. Can you give some examples of this improvement in BOM within the quarter? And who are you benchmarking for the BOM cost for the gravity? Thank you for your question. So yes, in this quarter, despite the pricing actions, our gross margin improved and is mainly due to cost optimization initiatives, including BOM cost reduction. And within BOM cost, there are various components, and we are working hard with both the supplier side of things and internally and internally more on the technology side of it, where we are bringing the battery cost down. Our car is the lowest per vehicle range.
But also then on the logistics side of it, we are able to bring our cost down significantly quarter-over-quarter. And in addition, we have identified a few other initiatives that we want to execute throughout the year. We're also managing our inventory very effectively, that helps bringing the cost down. Great. We'll take our next question, Twanda. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Peter, I don't necessarily mean to conflate the company necessary with Tesla for many reasons. But I mean, as we look at the SNX, the company was struggling and it wasn't until the 3-in launch that there was kind of an escape velocity on self-funding. And it seems like we're looking at sort of -- somewhat of a parallel here, I don't mean to make explicit direct comparison, but it does seem like the space or the smaller vehicle launching in late '26 will be sort of where you potentially reach that escape velocity similar to when they hit the [ 3 and  ] the why. So I was wondering if you would maybe kind of concur with that to some degree, right? I hope you don't take a fence to that, but to some degree.
And then also, as we think about that, we're seeing sort of these dribs and drabs and I wouldn't say $1 billion is a drib and drab, it's a lot of money. But sort of this question from investors, will you be able to get the funding sort of guaranteed to get to the launch of that escape velocity or maybe it's the space in 2026. So I mean, one, do you kind of agree with sort of that logic, that's when you reach escape velocity? And will you have the funding to get there? An interesting parallel and a very thoughtful question from you as always I mean, look, the vision is to get to very significant volume. And clearly, that comes in 2 steps -- well, there's 3 steps. First of all, scale Air [indiscernible]  With brand awareness step to going for about 6x the TAM with Gravity. And I really believe there's a very big significant opportunity with Gravity that Model X didn't capture because Model X was a bit car like, a bit CV like whereas Gravity is a proper SUV, and it's a 7-seat 3-row and we've got this unique secret weapon that we can go further with less battery and address the critical cost of making these products. And which you'll see unfold as we get to a degree of scale, which Gravity will enable. But it's true to say that we won't bear full fruition of all that until we get the midsized platform into production and it's scheduled for start of production late '26.
Now regarding our partnership, what really makes sets us lucid apart is the combination of 2 things: a unique world-class technology, combined with our special relationship with the PIF and their relationship with the PIF transcends a nearly financial one because they are invested in us a cornerstone of transitioning the economy of Saudi Arabia to a sustainability model with their audacious Vision 2030. And they are -- we are in this together. They are equally incentivized for success. Right now, running in Saudi Arabia is the first car plant they've ever had operating and it's elusive plant. Right now, we're laying the foundations, literally pouring the concrete our complete business unit, our CBU factory, which is scheduled to sync with the advent of the arrival of the midsize there in Saudi Arabia. They are incentivized for our success. We are mutually incentivized for success, nothing less than success is acceptable here. Okay. That's very helpful. just one second follow-up.  9000 vehicles produced or Airs produced this year. You already delivered more than you produced. I think there's well over 5,000 units or I think there are over 5,000 units in inventory. Could we see deliveries significantly above that 9,000 production number? I think you did 239. Delivery is greater than production this quarter. Should we expect something similar to that go through the rest of the year? Or could it actually be higher? Well, we haven't guided on that. And actually I'd love to see it. what is crucial here is the key message is that management is taking prudent steps in balancing our production with deliveries so that we don't get an undue amount of inventory and have that working capital tied up. This is prudent from management. Thanks Twanda, we'll take our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with City. Just 2 questions for me. First, Peter, can you just give us an update on kind of supplier readiness for the Gravity launch? What would the progress you're making there? And just over how you're feeling about that?
And then maybe a second question, just going back to the gross margin. I know there's a lot of noise in that number. I was hoping you could talk a little bit to what you're seeing across trends for kind of variable margins, they're just kind of looking at parts, material, freight and warranty, excluding kind of labor and overhead costs. If you can give us a little bit of sense of how that's trending? That would be helpful, too. Thanks, Itay. Yes, so we -- I'm personally overseeing the march towards the Gravity start of production. And literally in this room, every morning, my morning starts with a review of the status. And in order to ready the program, we need to sync 3 activity streams, the readiness of the gravity product, the readiness of the factory, Arizona factory and the build-out of that and the installation of all the equipment. And the third thing you covered in your question was the readiness of the supply base. And absolutely, we're all over this. We have literally a few hundred suppliers with thousands of parts. Truly drawn upon some of the best suppliers right around the world. And that is something we're managing very closely.
And to that aim, I want this process to be really super transparent. So I personally commissioned the team to make a series of videos, which will tell the tale for everybody who's following the company, the path to Gravity, the road to Gravity, the series. We launched that just last week, and that's going to trace those 3 connecting pillars, the product, the factory readiness and supply chain readiness. But we've got a major advantage this time with this product, Itay, because we're not trying to do it coming out of a pandemic. So there should be a lot more opportunity for us to do SQA,  which is supplier quality awareness and audit. And we have our supplier quality engineering teams visiting those suppliers and checking and verifying and validating the readiness for starter production late this year.
Now regarding margins, I would like to defer the question to Gagan, please. Yes. Thanks, Peter. So Itay, on the gross margin, we have been working very hard with both the supplier side of things and then taking cost out of the business. And looking at the bond cost first, is a significant effort. We are continuously bringing thousand of dollars out from the cost. But one thing this quarter specifically, I want to call about technology. our car also has its lowest cost of ownership. And if you look at in the investor deck, we added Slide 7 and Slide 8, explaining how our car has the lowest cost. And it will be good for you to look at that.
And then in parallel, our -- the cost optimization team, this team is challenging each and every one and also for every dollar value, and I'm personally leading this initiative with support from Peter. But what does that mean to us, we're able to significantly bring the logistic cost down. We are looking more and more opportunities. Now it's a matter of scale because we today are spending significant amount of money on the fixed cost.
Even on the variable cost, we identify more opportunities, and it will help us because look at it from a supplier perspective, also, they also allocate their fixed overhead to the volume they deliver. But we have part to go there. And with Gravity coming late 2024, we are getting close and close to our capacity, and that will give us an operating leverage. Thanks Twanda, can we move to our next question? Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shepherd with Cantor Fitzgerald. Peter, I was just -- I wanted to follow up on maybe deliveries to Saudi Arabia. Trying to get a sense if it's possible to maybe quantify it a little bit as to how that agreement will develop later this year, next year and onwards. I think in the past, you had mentioned that -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, but that a lot of these deliveries would include the Gravity and the midsized high-volume models, which have yet to reach their SOPs. So just wondering, are we able to quantify what these deliveries to Saudi Arabia will be this year, next year as you work your way up to the Gravity and... Yes. We're not planning to guide on the split in the future, but our deliveries in Q1 exceeded 500 units. I'm very confident that we've got equal demand for our products in Saudi, particularly to the SUV, that's going to be quite an interesting market.
But again, I'm not in a position to guide right now on these. And we haven't decided yet where would guide on that specific split, either Andrew. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. But so over 500 deliveries in Q1 were to Saudi Arabia in the quarter [ particularly ]. That's helpful. .
Okay. And then just a question on liquidity. You touched on the updated liquidity. Obviously, the $1 billion recent capital raise fortifies the balance sheet. In your presentation, you mentioned that liquidity on hand is sufficient to fund the business, I believe, is until second quarter of next year. So I guess my question is, as you're thinking for your next capital raise, do you -- to the extent of the ability that you can answer, do you foresee that coming from the PIF or perhaps would that be from external capital? I guess what I'm asking is with $6.4 billion in funding from the PIF so far year-to-date, do you foresee a situation where the next raise may also be with them or elsewhere? Well, look, we're a technology company. We're on a growth trajectory and it's a capital-intensive endeavor. We know that. And so all I can say is that we will take an entrepreneurial opportunistic view of raising capital when the business requires it. We are very, very aware and appreciative of a very special relationship and the steadfast support that the public investment fund has shown us and gone every single round supporting us to date.
And I think that puts us in a very strong position. It takes us past the start of production of gravity and well into next year. And I think that's an enviable position. It puts us in a very strong position financially. Thanks Twanda, can we move to the next question please? Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Beith with Weber Atlantic. I have 2 questions for Gagan, please, and I'll ask them separately. Through 2024, the expectation is that production processes will become more vertically integrated as you continue to build out the Phase II expansion of AMP-1. Can you confirm whether this will increase losses in the near term while volumes are subscale? Yes. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we typically don't guide gross margin because of certain controllable and noncountable factors. However, I can provide some directional color. In Q2, I expect that gross margin will remain flat despite the impact -- the full quarter impact of pricing actions we took in Q1. In Q1 that impact us for part of the quarter. .
Scaling back to second half of the year, now purchase of gravity components ahead of production, which will result in increase in inventory, i.e., result in LCNRV and also higher depreciation as a result of Phase II activation, we expect to have some negative impact on the gross margin. But then we have Gravity scheduled for production late this year. As we move to next year, we expect things to change significantly. Okay. But -- sorry, just to ask my question slightly differently. On a variable margin basis, do you expect the higher vertical integration to decrease the variable margins in the near term? On both Air and Gravity? Yes, that's a great question. Now it is a game of scale. We're getting better on contribution margin, trim by trim. Now the BOM cost, freight and certain overheads, part of contribution margin gets significantly impacted when you have a low volume. And with scale, it significantly improves because suppliers also amortize their fixed cost based on the volume they deliver. It's a matter of scale. The more we get close to our capacity, our margins get much better. Okay. Understood. And then just to turn back to the question that Adam and Itay asked. If I exclude the impairment charge from your cost of goods sold and make a simplistic assumption that all of the [ D&A ] charges within COGS. Then in the first quarter this year, underlying costs per unit delivered actually increased 5% sequentially. And given that delivery volume was 13% higher with some of these cars presumably benefiting from last year's overproduction. I was wondering if you could comment on what happened? Yes. It is a factor of incentive as well. So if you look at -- we took some pricing actions in the current quarter. So it's because of the pricing actions, which were largely offset by the cost reduction activities. Okay. But -- sorry, the pricing actions, surely, they're not in your COGS anymore because I've excluded the impairment charge. Yes. But it's multiple things that go in that factor. So when we say pricing actions, we basically like for pure and curing that the pricing that we offered and plus mix, both together play a significant role in that component. . Thanks Twanda, can we move to our next question please? Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. I just had a question on the push to have more third-party related sales of hardware and software. I guess I was wondering if you would say over the last few quarters, whether there has been an increasing number of bottlenecks in getting to the finish line on some of these deals. I'm curious just because it seems like you've proven out some cost advantages that you can provide as a -- from a third-party standpoint and the pressures on OEMs to get their BOM costs down, [ it will  ] only increased in the last year-to-date. Any color on that and your progress going forward would be helpful. That's an interesting point, Steve. I would say this that there's a time scale, there's a cadence, there's a chronology associated with any such arrangement with the traditional OE. There's a natural cadence to the pace they work and operate. And also, there's this sort of impending regulatory overhang in terms of the drivers for that transition to sustainable mobility model. So all I can say is just watch this space. We need patients when we're talking to large automakers. . Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP. This is Jake on for James. So if I just look at your liquidity and the implied cash burn with the $5 billion lasting into the second quarter of 2025. It looks like the implied cash burn has stepped up from roughly $900 million in the previous commentary to over $1 billion now. So how should everyone think about cash burn really through next year once you get through the launch of the Gravity? Yes. So if you look at -- there are multiple things go in the cash burn. One, is the capital investment that we're making as we have guided, we expect to spend around $1.5 billion in our investments, which is expansion in Arizona taking from 30,000 installed capacity to 90,000 because of paint shop, stamping, body in white coming later this year. .
And then AMP-2, which is in Saudi Arabia, where we are making significant investment, building our CBU facility. So that capital expenditure play a significant role there. And also in the next year, we have a significant amount of capital expenditure that will continue. Got it. That's very helpful. And then just following up on John's question about the midsize more mass market model. How do you guys thought about providing some more just detail on it, maybe some teaser pictures a little earlier to try to drill up some just some more interest from a broader consumer base and even potentially opening the door reservation to -- just [indiscernible]  in some more liquidity? Well, that's an interesting point. I actually think that the consumer has been ill served by some players in this space by taking reservations way, way ahead of time in a very artificial manner. What we believe is a much greater degree of transparency and really getting closer to that product being an absolute reality. Remember that any such reservations and money taken is a false form of liquidity because it's something we would have to put in escrow anyway. It doesn't really -- it's not true liquidity. And we believe in absolute transparency, and showing the product with a realistic specification as we're doing, say, with Gravity, we've not taken reservations deliberately until we get closer the start of production. This is a philosophy that we've adopted. And we will let you know that time in the future when we open a waiting list for gravity. And we're not even close to. I don't think it's right to be opening up reservations on a product that is over 2 years out. I just don't think -- I think it ill serves the consumer and it's something that I think there's a transparency that's lacking from that. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Just going back to a question about the cash burn. Can you give us any sense as we think getting to the midsized launch sort of the cadence of CapEx necessary in '25, '26 time frame? Well, I mean, it's interesting. We haven't guided on that. But I mean, we are in a very good position, which will see us beyond gravity start of production. We have some amazing incentives from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for a setup of our factory there, our AMP-2 facility, and that's where we're going to put in the midsized product to start with. Great. And just a quick follow-up on the gravity order question. How soon before production begins do you open up gravity orders? It's an interesting point. I think that -- as I say, look, we can look forward to us opening a waiting list when we feel that in absolute transparency, we can release more specific details of the TRIM and specifications of that vehicle. I don't want to do it in an environment of opacity. Gravity is a schedule for start of production later this year. And we're on that runway now. Every day counts as we build up a Crexendo to that launch, and we will let you know watch this space. Thank you. So this concludes Lucid's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you, Maynard. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Now before I get to my prepared remarks, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all Lucid employees as well as all our suppliers and partners. Our record deliveries in the second quarter were no small part due to your hard work. We generated great momentum and progress in the first half of the year, and we'll look to build upon this through the back half of the year and into the scheduled start of production of Lucid Gravity, which is, of course, highly anticipated. .
I'm also pleased to announce today that we executed financing agreements with an affiliate of the Public Investment Fund for additional commitments of $1.5 billion. Through its strategic investment in Lucid, the PIF is not only advancing the company's commitment to sustainable energy and innovation but also propelling it towards achieving the ambitious goals of Vision 2030. This partnership underscores their dedication to fostering a diversified economy and positioning itself as a global leader in the electric vehicle industry.
I'd like to thank them for their continued support. Now turning to deliveries. We delivered a record 2,394 vehicles in the second quarter, and that was up 21.7% sequentially and up 70.5% year upon year. The increase was driven by strength in North America, where deliveries were up sequentially.  Now turning to production. We produced 2,110 vehicles in the second quarter, and we're on track to produce approximately 9,000 vehicles in 2024. As I've noticed previously, production is not our bottleneck, and we are managing production to prudently optimize cash flow and to match deliveries.
Lucid's brand awareness continues to grow, reaching an all-time high in June since we started tracking the metric. Now we still have more work to do, but the combination of our science-based data-driven approach to marketing and increasing number of Lucid Airs on the road and the word of mouth advocacy of our loyal customers is building momentum. I think customers are also increasingly becoming aware of the tremendous value and technology in the Lucid Air. In many ways, we've reached parity or even surpassed gas cars in our class when it comes to range, performance, technology and pricing.
And this is especially true when compared to other electric vehicles. So it may come as no surprise that Lucid Air has once again been named the best luxury electric car by U.S. News & World Report. This is the third year in a row that this award has been bestowed upon the Air and no other car has ever achieved this. But we're moving beyond being known as a luxury car maker. We're a technology company, and people are recognizing that we have the most advanced electric vehicle.
We announced in July that we achieved a landmark 5 miles per kilowatt hour with the Lucid Air Pure, a critical element in achieving this was our software and innovations in our advanced motor control mathematical algorithms. And I am pleased to announce that with an over-the-air software update coming soon, I expect all vehicles in the fleet will see some further efficiency improvement, bringing greater value to the car well after a customer's initial purchase.
2025 Air sedans will also have a Sapphire heat pump and of course, the latest advancements in motor design. Now this collectively is how we were able to obtain a 512 miles of EPA estimated range for the Lucid Air Grand Touring under the more stringent EPA testing and achieved 5 miles per kilowatt hour with a new Air Pure. And we'll continue to provide more features and value. We are planning an over-the-air software update that will significantly enhance our advanced driver assistance system or ADAS. And it's including the introduction of hands-free highway assist, lane change assist, curb rush assist and more.
We also have plans for a comprehensive update to the user experience, new interfaces, new functions and further app enhancements, I think customers are going to be delighted. We're making a really big push on many aspects of our user interface software. So despite the market dynamics, we are making inroads, making constant improvements and gaining market share with Air. Yet again, in Q2, in the U.S. market, the Lucid Air outsold many of the largest and most storied brands in the industry within our competitive set of electric vehicles.
And in some cases, we outsold our competitors by more than double. And with the Lucid Gravity, I suspect we will find greater success in the large and growing SUV market. In late July, the first Lucid Gravity preproduction body shell dropped down from the roof conveyor and into the main production line at our factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. This marked the beginning of the Lucid Gravity preproduction run on our assembly line. And just last week, I had the honor of driving the first preproduction Lucid Gravity off the production line, a key milestone in the journey to the scheduled start of production later this year.
Each unit will help us perfect the process and will be used for final validation testing to ensure top-tier build quality in full scale production. Now we'll be hosting a Technology and Manufacturing Day at our factory on September 10 to showcase our technology and also give you a closer look at the Lucid Gravity and the new advanced factory where the machines build the machines.
We've made significant advances to the factory that will help drive down costs, and I can't wait to show it to you. Now I'd like to emphasize something that may still not be well appreciated by the market. Whilst many may now understand the concept of efficiency and which means how many miles can one go with a given amount of battery, it may not be broadly known as to why this energy efficiency is so damn critical. It's quite interesting.
Some might believe that it's the engineer in me driving the narrative of the importance of efficiency. But actually, it's the businessman in me that's driving the efficiency story. So let me explain. According to the database, A2MAC1, nearly 40% of the bill of materials or the cost of the materials to make an electric vehicle is attributable to the battery pack, almost 40% in cars above $60,000 and in lower-priced car, the battery cost as a percentage of the bill of materials can be even higher than that 40%. And this is why energy efficiency matters so much because the higher the energy efficiency, the smaller the battery needed for a given amount of range.
And this is worth repeating. The higher the energy efficiency, the fewer battery cells we need for a given amount of range. And this is an essential factor to lowering cost when it comes to making an EV and a key element in improving gross margins. It also means less battery raw materials, which is better for the environment. And this is critically important. This is truly our life's mission. And we can start having a greater impact through our technology because not all EVs are born equal.
And our technology licensing and access business enables our partners to accelerate their EV transition and reduce emissions with a goal of achieving the mission of a cleaner environment. I've said this before, making good EV technology is really hard. In fact, using publicly available EPA data, we estimate that if the closest competitor were to continue at its rate of operational efficiency progress, it would take them many years to match where Lucid's core EV technology is today. By this measure, Lucid is many years ahead of the #2 player.
And of course, the traditional car brands are even further behind them. And I think you're seeing this play out. Some are recognizing just how hard it is. And I think it's a matter of time before car brands might look to enhance their own know-how with Lucid's advanced technology. Because remember, product defines brand. I believe many of the products in the market are not yet commensurate to the heritage of their brands, and I believe our technology can be a key enabler.
While it's difficult to identify the exact timing of when we will reach a tipping point, we have been seeing increased interest in our technology. Now there's been more questions at late about our ECU and general architecture.  An ECU or I should say, an electronic control unit, is essentially a computer that controls certain specific functions of the car. Now Lucid has been at the forefront of this for quite some time. And I really would like to share my thoughts here because this is an element of our technology licensing and access business. We were very early on in bringing Ethernet ring architectures to electric vehicles when we launched the Lucid Air back in 2021.
We were also early with Air and Gravity programs incorporating aspects of zonal electrical architecture. We have 16 in-house ECUs, all of which are over-the-air updatable. And in midsized platform, we'll introduce our next zonal architecture where we'll further reduce the number of ECUs down to single digits. These are only possible when you take a clean sheet approach to vehicle design. It's interesting to note that others are just now getting to this place where we have taken the lead for quite some time.
Now these are important because the architecture plays a role in helping costs and efficiency. But we've gone much further than that. We've been able to improve efficiency at a pace that's clearly unheard of in the industry through innovations in our core powertrain technology. This isn't just hardware, but it's also the software. Indeed, we could not achieve the level of efficiency that we've been able to hit without advanced software developed in-house. So in closing, I'm very encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in the market.
The benefits we're realizing from our cost optimization programs, and excitement that's been building into the Lucid Gravity launch. I believe our strategic initiatives and dedicated team position us well for continued growth for momentum and innovation in the coming quarters and years, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Gagan Dhingra to provide an update on our financials. Gagan? Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. Before I get to my prepared remarks, I would also like to start by thanking the entire Lucid team for their tireless work in achieving very solid results. Turning to our 2024 second quarter financial results. During the second quarter, we produced 2,110 vehicles, and we reaffirm our guidance to produce approximately 9,000 vehicles this year. More importantly, deliveries of 2,394 vehicles were ahead of our expectations in the second quarter, up 70.5% year-over-year and up 21.7% sequentially.
As Peter mentioned, we are pleased with the demand we have been experiencing thus far. Deliveries outpaced production in the quarter, which was according to plan and we worked down inventory to much more manageable levels while still enabling a hub-and-spoke model to facilitate shorter customer delivery times. We reported revenue of approximately $200.6 million in the second quarter, up 32.9% year-over-year and up 16.1% sequentially, driven primarily by higher deliveries. Cost of revenue in the second quarter was approximately $470.4 million, The LCNRV impairment was approximately $154.2 million. Gross margin was essentially flat from the first quarter, in line with what we guided to on the last earnings call despite the full quarter impact of pricing actions taken in Q1.
We continued to see improvements in our BOM costs, inbound freight and labor cost per vehicle as part of our cost-optimization initiatives, which were offset by a special provision related to a warranty campaign. Excluding this campaign, gross margin would have improved 800 basis points sequentially. Although we don't explicitly provide gross margin guidance, let me provide some direction to help with your modeling.
We expect to build inventory of components for the Lucid Gravity, which will result in an increase in LCNRV impairments from an accounting standpoint. We also expect to incur incremental depreciation in the back half of the year from Phase 2 activations in our Arizona factory. We expect this will impact gross margin in Q3. However, we expect to see the meaningful benefits from vertical integration and lowering our bill of materials as we move forward.
Longer term, I would echo Peter's comments that our technology and increased scale will be key enablers of our gross margin. As with ramp volume, you will see improving gross margins with efficiency the key enabler to driving a lower bill of materials. Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense in Q2 totaled approximately $287.2 million, up less than 1% sequentially. We expect R&D to increase in back half of the year, which is typical in the run-up to start up production of new vehicle programs.
SG&A expense in Q2 was approximately $210.2 million, down 1.4% from Q1. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower professional services and other cost optimization initiatives. Although we have identified further cost reduction opportunities to execute this year, we expect SG&A to increase in the second half, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses and continued investments into strategic growth initiatives. We ended the second quarter with 53 studio and service centers, excluding our temporary and satellite service locations, up from 50 in Q1. 
On the service side, we ended Q2 with 64 mobile wins in the fleet and 113 approved body shops worldwide. We plan to continue to strategically expand our studio and service center footprint as well as satellite service centers which will cost effectively provide additional locations as well as ensure high customer satisfaction as we continue to grow. We recorded restructuring charges of $20.2 million related to the recent reduction in force announcement. Our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter was $58.5 million, we expect this expansion to grow substantially in the second half due to the timing of new grants.
In Q2, we recorded a gain of $103 million in other income from a change in fair value of derivative liability and a corresponding total accretion of $146.9 million associated with our redeemable convertible preferred stock under a line item below net loss. The adjusted EBITDA loss was $647.6 million, GAAP net loss per share in Q2 was $0.34, and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.29.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and total liquidity of approximately $4.28 billion. We remain committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet to execute on our strategic vision and will continue to be opportunistic in exploring financing. We also announced after market close today that Lucid executed financing agreements with an affiliate of the public investment fund for an additional capital commitment of $1.5 billion. This is made up of $750 million of convertible preferred stock via private placement and a $750 million unsecured delayed drought term loan facility.
Turning to inventory. total inventory decreased 9.9% sequentially, consistent with the decrease over the last few quarters and driven primarily by higher vehicle deliveries. CapEx in Q2 was $234.3 million, up from $198.2 million in Q1. Moving to outlook for 2024. We reiterate our 2024 production guidance of approximately 9,000 vehicles and we will continue to prudently manage and adjust our production to meet our sales and delivery needs. As Peter mentioned, I would also remind you that Q3 is typically a seasonally down quarter for the industry given summer holidays and then ramps up in Q4.
So something to consider in your modeling. Turning to our liquidity outlook, we expect total liquidity inclusive of the $1.5 billion commitment from an affilate of the PIF to give us sufficient runway at least into the fourth quarter of 2025. Moving to CapEx. We are updating our 2024 CapEx guidance to approximately $1.3 billion from our prior guidance of $1.5 billion. This reflects a meaningful reduction as a part of our cost optimization efforts as well as certain [indiscernible] in our capital outlay into 2025.
From a product perspective, the Lucid Gravity starter production is scheduled for late 2024 and start-up production of our high-volume midsized platform is scheduled for late 2026 I want to close by sharing my experience with the Lucid Gravity and why I'm very excited about the future. I recently had the opportunity to get on the road in elusive gravity beta vehicle, and I have to tell you the right was turning the way the car handles the performance, I don't think there's any other electric SUV like this in the market today.
With new products from the horizon, the strong financial commitment by the PIF and progress on cost optimization, I feel we are well positioned for the future. With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get to your questions. Thanks, Gagan. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. Before we take questions from those on the phone, I want to post some questions from our retail investors sent in through the Say technology platform.
Our first question comes from Paul C. Can you provide more information on what you're doing to cut costs. For example, Rivian recently announced a 35% reduction in cost and expect to have positive gross margin in Q4. Can you share your path to positive margins? Yes. I mean this is an absolute key activity. And Gagan and his team are absolutely focused on this. We're doing a tremendous amount across the entire company, looking at cost cutting as well as efficiencies, direct vehicle costs, supplier partnerships, manufacturing efficiencies, quality assurance, logistics, transportation, inventory management, development strategies, we're looking at go-to-market models.
We're looking at internal policies, professional services and CapEx. I can't think of anything more. I mean it's well across the board. And we're also, of course, focused on using our technology to reduce cost and efficiency. This is a huge enabler. For example, we're testing service machinery that I think can not only save us millions across our service centers but it could also reduce our real estate footprint. It could increase employee efficiencies, reduce repair times and it could improve customer satisfaction.
And I think we've made great progress but we're really working -- it's a work in progress. And in addition, we take a lot of the learnings from Air and, of course, incorporated them into Lucid Gravity early on. And I think we'll see a significant benefit from that learning transition from the one product to the other. But Gagan, you're right at the heart of this, could you add to this, please? Yes. Thanks, Peter. Cost optimization has become an essential part of our life at Lucid. First, let me start with company-wide initiatives of cutting costs and part to improving margins, and then I will cover a similar focus around OpEx and CapEx. On cost of revenue, starting with bill of materials, we are able to bring the cost down by double-digit percentage since we launched Air and we have identified more cost action that we plan to implement in the second half of this year.
On logistics, the cost is reduced by more than double-digit percentage year-over-year. On transportation, we have made meaningful improvements in reducing the cost since the beginning of this year. Further, we also reduced labor cost per vehicle this year through efficiency improvements. Looking at our journey over the last few quarters, our gross margin improved from [ negative to 40% ] to negative 134%. And we're also looking into the longer term, although we believe the best rate to reduce battery cost is to reduce the number of batteries by increasing efficiency.
We're also evaluating every opportunity to drive down cell cost. For example, we recently signed a supply agreement with Graphite One. In addition to BOM and logistics cost, I want to remind that a meaningful portion of our cost of goods sold is related to the depreciation of our factories and equipment. We made a very deliberate choice of making our long-term investments, including a leading in-house powertrain and battery technology, software and state-of-art manufacturing facilities. So as we start to ramp volumes, you will not only see improvement in gross margins, but will also have a significant cost advantage to our competition, which we're very proud of.
On other areas on OpEx, we are looking each and every corner, whether it is headcount optimization, professional services or overhead. Each expense is monitored and challenged, which is evident from our results that the SG&A expense went down in the current quarter despite our increased footprint and higher number of deliveries. On CapEx, we updated our guidance today to reduce the annual spend by $200 million and a significant portion is related to savings and cost reduction. Thanks, Gagan. Thanks, Peter. Question 2 is also from Paul C. There are companies working on axial radial flux motors and claiming highest torque and power density while using less materials, some claim to be production ready within 1 to 2 years. How does this compare to Lucid Motors? And how are you staying ahead of the upcoming tech? Maynard, I'll get me started here. So there's 2 sort of categories of permanent magnet motors, There's the axial flux motor, which is larger diameter, and it's short, it's more like a pancake shape. And then Lucid Motors are radial flux. They're more like a drum shape. And it's quite fascinating. I mean, really, I think there's a fundamental lack of understanding just how technically advanced Lucid's radio flux motors are. The axial flux motor stack up reasonably well against other people's radial flux. But compared with what the level of technology that we got used for a battery EV and axial modes of Flux Motor really sucks.
Now because they are large diameter, relatively low revs, and quite flat. They've got a great application in a gasoline hybrid, and you see these in super sports cars. And they're great for that because they rev about 8,000 RPM like a fast, internal combustion engine. But really, the problem they've got is there are very high thrust forces, and they effectively, because they launched diameter, they can't spend very fast. And if you want to get the speed up to maybe 10,000 RPM, you really need to resort to carbon wrapping.
And believe me, anyone who has to resort to carbon wrapping doesn't really know what they're doing with electric motors because it's super high cost. It's super difficult to manufacture. You do not want to do carbon wrapping. It is a last resort. And also actual flux motors are super difficult to manufacture. They've got these segmented laminations and they're radial laid so each laminations are different sizes, They are a nightmare to put together. And so here's the thing that you plan for a similar per to weight ratio get more torque out of an axial flux.
But it's about 23% more something like that are really good example compared with where a lucid radio flux is. But the lucid radio flux we'll spin about 20,000 RPM compared with the axial flux of 8,000 RPM. And what I said in one of my tech talks and motors is what really matters is not just not even gravimetric power density. It's this bandwidth between maximum spin speed and bottom-end torque. And we are just so far ahead of an axial flux motor. And as I say, I think there's a fundamental lack of understanding just how far advanced -- we're not going to get to 5 miles per kilowatt hour anywhere close if we went axial flux, I'm sorry. . Thanks, Peter. And we'll take our last Say question. Can you give an update on the progress for our retail ESS product. Are you still running prototypes? And can you provide information on their performance? . Okay. Well, yes, we are. I mean, first of all, I'd like to say we're closely engaged in this energy sector. At the end of last year, we launched our range exchange feature, and it's got innovative feature. It gives enabled by the Lucid bidirectional Wunderbox and the software that enables Lucid Air to directly charge other electric vehicles. But that's beside the point in many ways, specifically related to energy storage. .
I've got all my engineering teams absolutely laser-focused on 3 things. We're further enhancing Lucid Air, we're looking for further advancements. We've got the launch of Lucid gravity coming imminently and as a whole advanced team working on the development of our midsized vehicle, we have to have that laser focus on our products have that take priority. Now that said, technology leadership is core to our business, and it's a bigger strength. And I believe our core competency in the future in battery tech will allow us to develop energy storage solutions. But right now, our main focus is the vehicles, not ESS. Great. Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to take some questions from the phone lines. Wanda, can we move to the instructions on the first question? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. This is actually John Babcock for John Murphy. Just quickly for the first question. I did want to ask, I mean, are you going to be able to reach free cash flow positive with the small-ish mid-CV. Ultimately, we've been calling it the space, but I'm not sure if it's going to come out with a different product name or that? And/or should we expect that you might get to free cash flow positive before that? Well, I certainly plan to. I mean that is the vision.  Our whole business model is a long-term model of successive growth through successive period and the phasing of product. We move now with Lucid Air off the back of 2 record quarters for deliveries, just 6x the TAM with the Lucid Gravity to potentially 30x the TAM with our midsized platform. And it's that scale that's going to lead us to cash flow positive.  Gagan, would you like to add anything? Yes. I think Peter welfare. We are a high-growth technology company, and we are operating in a capital-intensive space. And at the same time, we have in-house, the way we made our investments, we are like leading in-house powertrain and battery technologies. So that will give us a competitive advantage when our volume increases, and we are very proud of that one. I'd really like to add something here, John as well. I think the key USP of us as a company, when we get to scale, is this efficiency story because we will not rest. We're advancing the technology. We're significantly ahead of the competition, all competition. We have leadership with 5 miles per kilowatt hour. And this is going to play. That means we can make a car of a given range with a smaller battery pack than other people. That is really going to play to our midsize where we'll be able to make it more cost effectively and that will lead directly to help us to become free cash flow positive. Okay. That's helpful. And then next question, I was wondering if you might be able to talk about price elasticity of demand for the year. And also does it -- whether it makes any sense to reduce prices or go down on trend to drive volume? Or if ultimately, the goal would be to protect the brand for future vehicles? Well, what we've done is we've introduced the Lucid Air Pure, which is a real drive car at just $69,900. A lot of people think Lucid is much more expensive than that. But we did actually promise that back in 2020, when we launched the product in our 2020 reveal that we would hit 69,900. So think of this really as us introducing successively more accessible versions of the car rather than price cuts. But clearly, there is a degree of price sensitive in the marketplace. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. 2 questions from me. The first, just quickly, when do you think you'll start opening reservations for the Gravity? Okay. Well, we haven't disclosed that yet. I would say that we will do so at an appropriate time. What we feel is that some companies have really done their customer base of this service by prematurely opening a reservation list, it becomes very speculative and almost meaningless to a certain degree. What we are thinking of is opening a preorder list and we'll let you know as soon as we're in a position to do so. The other picture -- the other question from a bigger picture perspective is as we think about the mid-price vehicle, and I think you said by the end of 2026, yes, how do you -- I'm no sure exactly how to ask this, but how do you calibrate or reconfigure the engine based on your phenomenal technology at a lower price point to sort of help bring the cost of materials down on that vehicle along with the battery. . Yes. So we're using all our considerable experience now. We're creating the most advanced systems in the world to create a much more cost-effective variance for our midsize. And that work is well underway already. I think what we've done is achieve remarkable efficiency. I think we've achieved remarkable competitiveness. I don't think going further compact is the way. We can use all our expertise to reduce the cost, the cost of the bearings, the cost of the amount of copper that we're using, the cost of the materials, the heat treatment in the gears.
And this is a laser focus for us now. But I want to be clear there is this misunderstanding that our current technology is so esoteric, so expensive that's driving our losses. And the truth is so far from this. Our current technology is imminently manufacturable and cost effective for its level of performance. What I'm trying to do now is take all that knowledge and go for even more cost effectiveness for a lower performance unit, which imminently suits our midsize and would suit licensing for a family car from a traditional OE as well. . [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Just 2 financial questions for me. First, on the capital raise announced today, can you just talk about your intentions to actually draw down on the delayed term loan. Do we expect that to happen this year? Just given your cash position should that be maybe more of a next year expectation? And then secondly, hope you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the CapEx outlook reduction for this year? . Yes, sure. Thank you. So we ended the quarter with $4.28 billion of liquidity and yes, we announced $1.5 billion today. Coming to specifically when we take out the money from the facility, so we have enough liquidity today. And also with $750 million convertible, this adds to our liquidity as well. So at this stage, we don't have intention to withdraw $750 million from term loan in the near future, we'll do in the due course of time. Yes. I think there was a misunderstanding, Itay, that I've seen it out there that we had $1.28 billion  cash. But of course, we should be looking at the $4.28 billion liquidity because, of course, we're investing prudently some of that. And remember that we're investing heavily in a few areas. We're looking -- we're currently building out. We just put the steel work up in our new factory in Saudi Arabia. I just got the pictures in this morning. And so we're putting a significant chunk of money into that.
Then we're completing a major investment in an additional 3 million square feet, close to 3 million in our factory in Arizona, bringing stamping in-house, bringing our logistics center, in-house under the same roof to reduce OpEx and bringing our state-of-the-art powertrain plant actually under that same roof and expanding its capability massively. So there's a huge chunk of investment there.
Then we've got the gravity or the tooling and R&D costs, the launch costs for gravity. And on top of that, we're building out our sales and service network internationally. And look, we've got to think of this as a long-term play. This is where the money is going in these crucial investments for the long term. And so to your second question on the CapEx, this $200 million revising the guidance, a significant amount of that is based on the cost reduction efforts, which basically looking at challenging each and every item, the negotiation, how we want to build our -- the factory, how we want to procure our machinery and equipment, the number of units, a very thorough process looking each dollar carefully, and we are able to bring down our CapEx cost, yes, as part of revising guidance. There is also some CapEx deferral, but savings and reductions have played a bigger part. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. I had 2 questions. First of all, when I'm looking at Chart 7, it looks like you're back on your efficiency improvement curve with the latest model year. Can you just talk about, say, over the next 2 to 3 years of improvements? How should we think of the mix between coming from software versus electrical versus battery, et cetera? And then I had a follow-up. Actually, you arethat's right, Steven. It's a fusion software and hardware. I mean we recently announced the most efficient car in production ever with 5 miles per kilowatt hour and 146 PGE. And I think it's just to be good in context because the new way of setting cars by the EPA here in the U.S.A. has become more stringent. And you see actually some -- we saw some today quite a close competitor actually recording worse numbers because it's having to face a more stringent test. So I think that's absolutely key. But this is a technology race. It's yet to play out. And I recently was delighted to commission what we call internally Project Chwech, which is the Welsh word for 6 as we move towards the aspirational 6 miles per kilowatt hour. So Project Chwech is officially go here, and you heard it first. And you might have to look that up in the dictionary, but it's an aspirational how much better than 5.0 can we go? And I've got a brilliant team of scientists and research engineers on that. That's helpful. And I just learned some Welsh for the first time in a while. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about the importance you're finding initially with customers in terms of your ADAS features that you have in place and a rolling out to... We're having a big, big push on software. I personally taken a leading role in driving software. I was reviewing ADAS this morning with the team. There is a new vigor in the company. And we're going to introduce a hands-free lane assist before the year is out. We've got a whole range of improvements that I am personally driving and that isn't just ADAS, that's the whole infotainment stack in the car, and I want to roll a lot of that out this year on air in the run-up to gravity. So people will see [indiscernible] Gravity how awesome it's going to be, and there'll be incremental evidence of improvement on Air as we roll towards Gravity. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald. Congratulations On the quarter. A lot of our questions have been asked, but maybe to touch on the capital raise again. Peter, what is the best way we should be viewing this announcement. Obviously, in the near term, it extends the cash runway into Q4 of '25, which helps to address any near-term liquidity issues. But should we see this as a final straw from the PIF. Or is this -- is it more accurate to view it as kind of restrengthening that relationship and then being more focused on the medium to long term as well? Thank you, Andres. I'd describe it as a resounding further endorsement of their long-term commitment of a long-term relationship, and they are the perfect partners. I couldn't ask for any more and we are so aligned, this transcends a mere financial arrangement. We are a cornerstone of the Saudi Arabia's ambitious vision 2030 to transition their company to a sustainable economy.  And we are proud to participate in this.
And that's why we're currently putting up steel work in our factory in Saudi Arabia. This isn't the case. It's often portrayed how long is it before Saudi is going to get fed up with [indiscernible] It's not that. We have regular dialogues. I have with my Chairman, and we are absolutely both committed the dialogue is much more of Peter, keep things on track. We want this midsized, we want these products, is Gravity on track? This is the commitment that we have together. This is the sense of enduring partnership that Lucid has with the PIM. And also, it's Nondilutionary. so I think this  is an ideal manner of raising capital. And on the significant service to take us through into -- well into Q4 next year.
This means that we go through the critical launch period of gravity through a large part of its production ramp-up. And remember, gravity is just the product that everybody wants. And remember what Gagan said over and over, our economics are driven by scale. And gravity is going to be scale. There's going to be 4 steps to scale sell more Airs, and that's about brand awareness. Get gravity ramps up, get the midsize running and see if we can get technical partnerships with other OEs. Those are the 4 steps and efficiency is going to play absolutely into all of those right now with Pure, getting the 5 miles per kilowatt hour. We're getting 420 miles. We're just 84-kilowatt hours of energy. Nobody is even close. That's why we can make it at $69,000. That's why it makes sense at 69,900. And it's going to make even more sense we're going to have a gravity with the sort of range with half the battery size of some other players out. They're just half the battery size.
No one else is even close; and it really is going to come this whole chess game is going to play out, we get to midsize we'll be able to have a competitive range with a relatively tiny battery pack and much less cost than anyone else. . I appreciate all that color.  Maybe just 1 last quick question. Wanted to touch on something we haven't maybe spoken about in a couple of quarters. But just on the licensing agreement with Aspen Marin, I'm curious if you can maybe expand on how that relationship is going and particularly when and how that might -- that you expect that to ramp up in terms of revenue. Yes. There was an announcement. There's a little delay on their end, which is disappointing because it's disappointing that any EV is delayed. But I completely I emphasized where they are in terms of their customer requirements. I don't think it makes any long-term difference to the relationship. With solid as a rock.
Aston is fully committed, we're all in to ensure that Aston creates the best electric hypercar in the world. And what's great about that is our price range from $69,900. a week up to $249,000 with Sapphire. We're not going to go above that. and as then starts where we finish. So there's no cannibalization there's absolute synergy and a great working relationship. . [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Beith with Redburn Atlantic. I have 3, please, and I'll ask them individually. Peter, I noticed the stated capacity of the 2025 Lucid Pure is 4-kilowatt hours smaller than its predecessor. And this seems to be too small to reflect the removal of one battery module from the pack, suggesting that the cells themselves could be slightly different and the vehicle weight may have been reduced. Are you able to comment on this logic and perhaps provide more information on other improvements that were made to breach the 5 miles per kilowatt power threshold? Absolutely. It runs at 16 module pack which is, I think, 672 volts. If you look at Grand Touring and Sapphire have a 22-module pack which runs at 924 volts. And then Touring has a 16-module pack, which runs at 756 volts, and we've reduced that down to a 16-module pack for Pure At 84-kilowatt hours, and that runs at 672 volts. It's 42 volts per module open circuit on page. So we've got the most efficient car ever, 146 miles per gallon and it's the magic 5 miles per kilowatt hour, no one's even close. And let me tell you, if we were to choose less range, we get even more efficiency because there's even less battery weight.
So what you've got to remember is, we're achieving that 5.0 miles per kilowatt hour with 420 miles range, which has got more range, there's no other competitive car out there from any other manufacturer. A little usage, that's close to the 420, and we still got a world record for efficiency. If we drop that down to 360, would be above 5 miles per kilowatt hour. -- lower-range cars it's easy to get to these efficiency levels. well, relatively. Okay. What is the end game for Lucid's theoretical advantage on the bill of material costs for an electric vehicle, assuming that the needs can be maintained plus volume scale. Is it to achieve superior profitability? Absolutely. The end game is why we exist. There is a misunderstanding and miss interpretation that with some niche luxury car company when and nothing could be further from the truth. We're here to make advance the state of art of the electric car in order to find lot of driving the cost down so that it can be attained by far more people to have a meaningful impact on the planet.
If you look at even the Bloomberg numbers of $128 per kilowatt hour at pack level, I mean if we can say with 15, 16 kilowatt hours less than the competition. This is a multi-thousand dollar cost saving today, and that's going to make all the difference when we look at midsize products. And if we license our tech to another car company that maybe wants to do a $25,000, $30,000 car, this is just like where every dollar counts we can suddenly start saving beyond thousands of dollars.
And in fact, if you look at the agony that some of the other OEs have put with the wrong product trying to do an electric pickup and electricity in electric propulsion, isn't the right solution for a usable affordable pickup, believe you may. But our technology would save those OEs, thousands if that was implied to those pickups because their pickups would require so much smaller battery pack with our high-tech solution. . And to add to this, we made a choice of our long-term investment of having in-house powertrain technology and battery technology. So as we get to scale, we expect long-term investments to pay dividends many times over. This also translates to significant cost advantage compared to our competition, better margin profile than where traditional OEM are today. It's just a matter of scale, and we're getting there. But we already have narrowed down our losses and with scale, we'll be in a better position than competition. absolutely, good point, Gagan, because we're going to hold this technology and manufacturing day on September 10. I hope you'll be able to join us there because. I think if seeing is believing, we really got the world-leading state-of-the-art in-house advanced powered EV per train manufacturing plant, like I don't if anyone has got anything to compete with. . [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas. I have a question on deliveries for this year. You obviously have the production guide of 9,000 units. You saw a nice uptick in North America -- demand in North American deliveries in the second quarter. We could see that in the sequentially lower Saudi revenue in the second quarter. But I think the -- the indication was for lower third quarter deliveries. Just curious what's in play there and what the expectation is for the note for the full year? Sure, sure. So we haven't guided on deliveries. What we have guided upon is that we plan to make approximately 9,000 cars this year. And we've just reaffirmed that today that we're on track for that. Now of course, regarding deliveries, we're on the back of 2 record quarters. 70% up from Q2 this year over last year. But clearly, what we're trying to do is prudently manage the business, manage the efficiency of our inventory. We need some inventory. We need a buffer, and we need to be able to supply to customers directly out of inventory.
So we don't want no inventory, but we won't managed amount of inventory. We don't want that inventory to grow. So therefore, implicitly, that implies that we want to be delivering a very similar number or more than the number we manufacture, although we haven't guided upon that. yes, and right now we believe our inventory is manageable. And it also -- a couple of benefits that bring managing our cash flow better, reducing the risk of obsolescence also reducing the storage cost. So we believe we're in a good position from that perspective. . I think we just, we were cautioning about Q3 because of the summer months. I think we've just been prudent about that. Okay. Yes, that's just ultimately on the deliveries and the demand side. Just seems it's more cautionary. Traditionally, you tend to see a bit of a shutdown with people their long summer vacation and then an upturn in Q4, but we will see. Got it. And then just my quick follow-up. Well, one, is there any discernible difference in ASP between your general deliveries and those to the Saudi government? And then on the quarterly cash burn rate that's implied, we've got the $4.3 billion in liquidity, plus the $1.5 billion that you just raised and announced today, right, and then that gets you into the fourth quarter as you state, right?
So that implied quarterly cash burn rate still is in that $900 million to $1 billion. Just curious what goes into that? Is that just loose math and not necessarily your expectation, which is ultimately of critical importance in terms of the cash burn rate through next year and how that corresponds with your profitability expectation on gross... So a couple of things here. First of all, from a CapEx perspective, we spent around $243 million. This quarter, nearly $200 million last quarter, we guided $1.3 billion for CapEx. So a significant amount of CapEx is going to come remaining part of the year, plus we are working on Gravity as well as midsize where significant investment is going to be there. Plus, we're building a factory in Saudi Arabia, so our CapEx and the R&D programs where we are going to spend a significant amount of capital for us to be ready for the future to take us to the next journey. I mean, please come on -- join us please, visit us in the factory on September 10. We're holding the Technology and Manufacturing Day. I think anyone visiting will realize this sheer level of investment we've made, we've got a state-of-the-art facility. This puts us an incredible position for the future. We're continuing this is a long term play. This is where the money is going. The money is going to new factories in Saudi Arabia, the completing our state-of-the-art facility in Arizona on the tooling to get the best SUV in the world in Gravity into production. We're spending money now investing in the design of our midsize and on the service network around the world. So these are long-term strategic investments that's where the money is going. This is a long-term play, and it will come to pass. . Thanks, everyone. So this concludes Lucid Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference call. I appreciate everyone joining us today. Thank you. .
