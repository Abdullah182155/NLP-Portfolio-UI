With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you, AJ, and thank you all for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call, which is our first as a public company. My co-founder, Alexis and I started Datadog about nine years ago with a mission to break down silos between developers and IT operations teams. Today, we are the monitoring and analytics platform for dev, ops and business users. We provide clarity and actionable insights into software applications and IT infrastructure all in real time. We exist so that our customers can understand everything that happens in their technology stack enabling them to deliver greater innovation, provide an exceptional user experience and achieve faster resolution of performance issues. While we are very proud of the company we have built, we’re even more excited for the future and a tremendous opportunity ahead of us.
I would like to start with a quick review of our business and financial results. For the third quarter, revenue was $95.9 million, an 88% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $638,000, or a margin of 0.7%. We ended the quarter with 727 customers with annual run rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more, which is a 93% increase from a year ago. We achieved this while maintaining an efficient tax payback.
As in past quarter, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased our usage and adopted our new products. And we also continue to be capital efficient as our cash provided by operating activities in Q3 was $3.8 million and year-to-date $6.8 million. Since, this is our first call as a public company, I would like to spend a few minutes providing an overview of our market opportunity, our product, and our go-to-market, before I review our third quarter highlights.
As you all know, a massive IT platforming is underway. Companies are moving from static on-premise IT architecture to public and private cloud as well as other ephemeral technologies like containers, microservices and serverless computing. These newer technologies allow for increased agility and innovation, but also compound complexity in ITs role. Meanwhile, historically separate developers and IT operations teams must come together in order to manage it chaos and better collaborate around a shared view of the IT stack.
As businesses are becoming more and more digital, these challenges are affecting companies across all industries, geographies and sizes. We believe we are at the very early stages of essential market opportunity, which we estimate to be approximately $35 billion based on our bottom-up calculation.
From a product perspective Datadog was founded in 2010 as a real time data integration platform that turns the chaos from disparate sources into digestible and actionable insights. Our vision was a single platform that would provide dev and ops users with a common view across sources, teams, and technologies.
In 2012, we launched our initial use case infrastructure monitoring. Starting with infrastructure, gave us broad deployment across that environment and ubiquity across dev and ops users. In other words, we were deployed everywhere and used by everyone. Since initial launch, we have continue to innovate across more environments including containers and serverless as well as on-premise hybrid product in multi-cloud environments.
Because problems rarely stop at the boundary between infrastructure and application, we saw a need for full-stack observability and we launched Datadog Application Performance Management or APM in 2017. We quickly added Datadog Log management in 2018 thus completing what we like to call the three pillars of observability. Earlier this year we also launched Datadog Synthetics to extend it to user experience monitoring by letting our customers simulate user journeys on their web applications in API endpoints.
All our products, features and functionalities are offered within the same tightly integrated platform or customers can frictionlessly add-up new products or from this end user interface and powered by a common data model. We believe we win in the market for a few reasons. One we are a truly integrated platform allowing us to solve our customers end-to-end problems and innovate rapidly. Two, we were built for the modern dynamic stack offering end-to-end visibility. Three, we are simple but not simplistic, easy to install with no professional services. And four we are designed for use in collaboration across development operations and business team.
From a business model perspective, we have an efficient operating model which has enabled us to achieve best-in-class growth and very modest cash burn. Despite significant and ongoing investment in R&D and sales and marketing we have only burned approximately $30 million in cash since we began. We had a very strong cash pay back. This allows us to continue to invest in our product and solve more problems for our customers. With that in mind, let’s review our third quarter performance.
Overall, we are very pleased with our results. Strength was broad-based driven by both robust new logo additions as well as continued growth of existing customers. Our platform strategy is clearly resonating including strong initial uptake of synthetics product in the quarter. From the R&D perspective, we continue to invest in our product suite. And we announced over 15 new products, features and functionalities this July at Dash, our annual user conference. One of the products we announced was Network Performance Monitoring to allow customers to visualize the flow of network traffic in both club base and hybrid environments. It is an extremely lightweight solution that is compatible with all major cloud providers and on-premise servers, giving customers the flexibility to monitor network traffic without sacrificing performance.
Another new product was Real User Monitoring, which compliments synthetics for user experience monitoring. It allows customers to analyze the performance of applications directly experienced by the end users. We also continue to iterate on our existing solutions. For instance, Log Rehydration allows our customers to load our catalogs into the Datadog platform, to enable full indexing and analysis. And as a reminder the model allows us to chart for data indexing separate from ingestion.
We added several service level objectives to our platform, allowing customers to easily track SLOs, which are relevant to both engineers and business users. And additionally, we announced enhancements to our machine learning and AI capabilities. Watchdog, our always on detection engine, now automatically surfaces anomalies within the infrastructure in APM portable platform. Metric coalition is another new feature that will analyze any metric exiting unusual trend and actively search for others that are displaying a similar pattern. And trace outliers will automatically analyze all incoming APM traffic following our customers who easily spot meaningful outliers.
Last but not least, another exciting development we announced in October is that Datadog is currently in process for FedRAMP certification. And we’re very excited by the potential to extend our addressable market to U.S. Federal departments and agencies. As a quick note, to products announced at Dash in beta and we are not yet charging our customers for them.
Now switching gears to talk about products, we already charge for. In Q3 we began charging for synthetics, which has good enough to a very strong start. This is in line with our traffic cut of new product introductions as our unified SaaS platform allows customers to adopt new products without any friction.
In Q3 we saw strong adoption of our newer products from both new and existing customers. As evidence of our strong platform adoption, approximately 50% of our customers were using two or more products at the end of Q3, which is up from 40% last quarter and 15% a year ago. And we point out that our newer products are no more than about 2.5 years old.
As I mentioned before, we have continued to invest in R&D. For the year-to-date period to Q3 non-GAAP R&D expense was 30% of revenue, which is an increase from 27% in the year ago period. Even our platform strategy and our proven track record of efficiently developing and selling newer products, we plan to continue to invest meaningfully in R&D. That’s it for products.
Onto the go-to-market side. In the third quarter we saw strong new logo additions as well as extension from existing customers. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 9,500 customers up from 7,100 a year ago. We ended with 727 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up 93% from year ago, at an increase of more than 130 in the quarter alone. Given that more than 70% of our ARR is generated from customers over $100,000, we expect this cohort of customers to be a large driver of our future growth.
Now let’s review some our key wins in the quarter. First, one of our new customers is a multinational telecom provider out of Europe. This customer adopted Datadog to support the e-commerce site ahead of the new iPhone launch. Our platform enabled them to have a successful launch without any major performance issues, but other carriers in the country experienced website outages because of traffic surges. This initial six-figure lens includes all three pillars, infrastructure, APM and logs as well as synthetics, second, an established Fortune 500 retailers had a six-figure upsell.
This customer adopted infrastructure monitoring in 2017, followed by both APM and logs in 2018 and more recently synthetics. Over 100 of their internal teams are using Datadog as they adopt Microsoft Azure and container technologies. This customer spend with us has grown more than 5x since our initial deal and we believe there is still a lot more room for growth.
Next, one of our largest Q3 deals was a seven-figure three pillars new logo from the higher education software and services company. These mid-market customers with fewer than 5,000 employees demonstrate the spending power of even midsized companies as they come to Datadog as a strategic partner to support the digital businesses.
Finally, a large Europe based shipping and logistics company, was origins dating back over 100 years had a six-figure upsell in the quarter. This company was previously using built-in cloud provider monitoring tools which lacked the ability to correlate front and back-end issues. And this is a powerful example of how Datadog enables companies in origin and industries who are in the middle of their digital transformation.
As we said during the IPO, we continue to invest in our go-to-market. This includes growing quota carrying reps by 70% year-over-year. As of the end of Q3, we do experience high returns on our sales and marketing investments benefiting from more very efficient business model and driven by our land-and-expand go-to-market. As evidence of our business model efficiency, our cash payback continues to be approximately one year and we intend to continue investing meaningfully in our sales and marketing efforts globally.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Thanks Olivier. As mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Since this is our first earnings call, I would like to begin with a brief overview of our financial model. I will then review our Q3 performance and provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our SaaS platform. Customers have the option to purchase multiple products including infrastructure monitoring, APM and logs as well as additional SKUs such as containers, custom metric packages, and anomaly detection.
Our revenue is all subscription as professional services are not required to implement our products. Customer contracts typically have either annual or monthly commitments. Additionally, customers are billed for on-demand usage in excess of their committed amount, typically monthly in arrears.
Given the mix of annual and monthly invoicing and the variability in billing, we do not believe that calculated billings is the most useful metric for investors to evaluate our business performance. As in any one period, billings growth can vary substantially from revenue growth.
Turning to Q3 results, revenue was $95.9 million, up 88% year-over-year. As Olivier mentioned, the quarter strength was broad based, driven by new and existing customers as well as strong platform adoption and initial uptake of Synthetics.
To provide you with some more context; first, in Q3, we saw strong new logo additions across both sales channels and regions. This is particularly notable in what is typically a seasonally challenging third quarter, involving the summer. Additionally, we saw strong continued expansion of existing customers.
In the third quarter, our dollar-based net retention rate was above 130% for the ninth consecutive quarter. A robust retention rate is driven by increased usage of existing products as well as cross-selling of newer products, including the inclusion of Synthetics for the first time. Once our customers are on the Datadog platform, they can frictionlessly expand with us to increase use of the platform. The cross-selling of newer products is a more recent driver of our net retention rate. Lastly, we’re now strength internationally, specifically a strong sales quarter in EMEA. This is particularly impressive given many of the teams in the region are still ramping.
Calculated billings defined as revenue plus a sequential change in deferred revenue was $112 million, up 132% year-over-year. As mentioned, we do not believe calculated billings to be a focus metric for our business due to the mix of monthly and annual billing terms among our customers. And because billings growth can vary substantially from revenue growth in any one period, nor do we plan to comment on a regular basis going forward. But to give you an example of the variance between billings and revenue growth, we want to add a few comments.
First, we had a multimillion dollar deal which was renewed and billed in Q3 2019. This customer was not billed in Q3 three last year. In addition, we had one large two-year prepaid deal in Q3 2017, which was thus not billed in Q3 2018, but was billed again in Q3 2019. Adjusting for these two customers, normalized calculated billings growth would have been approximately 100%, still very strong and generally reflective of our strong Q3 sales.
Now let’s review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our press release. Gross profit in the quarter was $72.9 million, representing a gross margin of 76%. This compares to a gross margin of 77% a year ago and 75% last quarter. As we have discussed previously, we are in the middle of an accelerated innovation cycle of delivering new products, as well as the build out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. We will over time balance investment and optimization to manage our gross margin.
R&D expense was $26.8 million or 28% of revenue in the Q3, up slightly from 27% a year ago. We continue to benefit from product led adoption and have made extensive investments in our platform.
This is evidenced by the launch of Synthetics earlier in the year and the 15 plus product announcements made it Dash. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to further our innovation and expand our platform, and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D going forward.
Sales and marketing expense was $37.3 million or 39% of revenues down from 48% in the year ago period. The change in Q3 was more pronounced than usual due to both the outperformance of revenues and the timing of trade show events between 2019 versus 2018. We note that for the nine months end of September 2019, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 41% down from 43% in the year ago period showing the development of some leverage in sales and marketing.
We continue to see strong returns from our sales and marketing investments and plan to continue to invest to expand our go-to-market globally. G&A expense was $8.2 million or 9% of revenues slightly higher than 8% a year ago given some IPO related expenses. Operating income was a positive $638,000 or a 0.7% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million or negative 6% in the year ago period.
Net income for the quarter was $695,000 or breakeven per share based on 285 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We have a highly efficient business model and experience a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have operated around breakeven and outperformed on profitability in Q3, we see ample opportunities to continue to invest in the large market opportunity ahead of us.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $771 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. This includes approximately $709 million net IPO proceeds. Cash flow from operations was a positive $3.8 million for the quarter and a positive $6.8 million year-to-date. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was a negative $3.7 million for the quarter and a negative $10.1 million year-to-date.
Our capital expenditures consist primarily of real estate build-outs and was slightly elevated due to projects in our New York and Paris offices. The timing of some of the payments for New York and Paris build-outs shifted to Q4 and we therefore expect another quarter of slightly elevated CapEx. Given we are hosted entirely in the cloud, our hosting costs flow through the P&L, not CapEx.
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019. Beginning with the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $101 million to $103 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 65.5% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating loss from operations is expected to be in the range of negative $6 million to negative $8 million. Non-GAAP loss per share is expected to be in the range of negative $0.01 to $0.02 per share based on approximately 297 million weighted average shares outstanding.
A few things to take into account in our guidance. First, in the third quarter, we saw a meaningful growth of existing accounts and bill for synthetics for the first time. While we have seen meaningful and sustained growth of existing accounts over time and have a history of launching new products, this can be more challenging to predict over short periods.
Second, on profitability. In Q4, we will have the first full quarter of public company costs, particularly D&O insurance, as well as some sizeable trade show expenses. For the full year 2019, revenues expected to be in the range of $350 million to $352 million, which represents 77% year-over-year growth at the mid point. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of negative $18 million to negative $20 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of negative $0.11 to negative $0.12 per share based on approximately 140 million weighted average shares outstanding.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the business performance in the third quarter. We have built the leading monitoring and analytics platform for the cloud age and are generating growth at scales that few companies can match. We are making continued investments for growth in the foreseeable future. We believe we are at the early stages of a multibillion dollar market opportunity and we feel very good about our ability to build a very large and successful company over time.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, let’s begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you for taking the questions and congrats to the team on a successful IPO and your first earnings call and a very strong set of results. So congrats on all fronts there. Olivier, maybe to start off the Q&A, wanted to ask about the quarterly performance this quarter. Did you see strengths coming from competitive displacements? Are you seeing displacing competitors or are you continuing to see a lot of the growth coming just from Greenfield expansions and then I had a follow-up. Yes. So the business is still mostly Greenfield and it’s mostly net new and it’s mostly cloud environments, which by definition are new for our customers. They all went have other solutions, especially, when you talk about large customers and large enterprise customers, they have existing solutions for their legacy environments, but they make new decisions for the cloud environment. We do see also a few competitive displacement, but that’s not the majority of what we do. Understood. And then as a follow-up, it seems like you’re seeing some strong momentum with new products, it seems like Synthetics is some really good early signs of tractions there. And you had some additional opportunities in international and also looks like said to be an opportunity for you. So maybe if you could sort of stack rank some of the opportunities in terms of what are the biggest opportunities that you see over the next one or two years. And what are the some of the more near-term opportunities that you think can drive growth more than near-term, whether it’s Network Performance Monitoring, or that comes off of beta or it’s just continued traction with Synthetics? Sort of stack ranking of the near-term and the medium-term opportunities? Well, near-term we have – our core product – our core infrastructure product is figuring very, very fast and is what we know most of our customers use in conjunction with other products and still grow a lot with that product. In addition to that our APM and log management products are also very recent and they’re in both in hyper-growth. So they drive a lot of our short-term and near-term success.
Newer products like Synthetics are nice add, but don’t represent a bulk of the outperformance within this quarter. Right now, it’s still the basic, still the three pillars the products we have in the market and we’ve been developing over the past few years that are getting us the bulk of our growth. As we mentioned in the call, we’ve been very happily surprised by the performance of Synthetics right out of the gate. It’s a great sign. It’s a great sign, in particular, when we think of all the new products we have in the Wink that we haven’t started charging for. But again, that’s – it will be more material in the quarters or in years to come. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to better understand in terms of the customers that are going with multiple products, both new and existing. How would you characterize how much of that success is coming out of the mid market versus large enterprise? It’s about the same. We see the same behavior in all parts of the market when it comes to that. In fact, the places where we’ll see customers not using us for everything they do is companies that have been earlier into the cloud and that has used other products for a while and then have everything set up, that will vary. That’s where we don’t have any initial opportunity to displace everything at once. When customers are newer to the cloud and they’re starting their migration, which is the case of most of the enterprise customers as well as the higher end of the mid market there’s an immediate opportunity to land on two or three or four of our products at once. That makes sense. And then one follow-up question. The market has seen your pricing that you’re using for logging as very disruptive. And I think we’re starting to see some of the competition make changes to their pricing. Wondering what you’re seeing in the competitive dynamics with all of those changes. We don’t see any change in the competitive dynamics yet. I think we’ve seen some pricing from some other vendors. But ultimately it hasn’t changed the central dynamics for their customers and in the conversations we’ve had so far. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you very much. Maybe can you just talk a bit about how the ongoing shift to containers has changed the competitive landscape for you at all? Is it, I guess, increasingly important in terms of your ability to monitor these workloads? Is that an increasingly important factor in determining why you win with customers? Yes. So it’s definitely – when you think of what makes the old guard of tooling and approaches just not work at all, like containers as one big part of that. And we’ve been monitoring containers at scale for many years now. We’ve had – we’ve seen our customers run containers in production since before it was advisable to do it. And that’s been a big part of our in-production monitoring product for many years now. We don’t have numbers to share on the volumes we see. But I can tell you that, we already see several times the numbers of containers at any point in time as we do the number of traditional instance OEM. Okay, great. And then as you continue to invest in R&D, maybe can you just talk a bit about some of the main projects there? I mean, I look obviously, you have a very strong and comprehensive suite in the market already, but with the incremental R&D investment, are you looking to go broader in terms of product from here? Or is it just maybe more focused on deeper in terms of functionality with some of your existing products maybe to help with even further traction in the enterprise? Well, it’s a bit of both, right? So we have, as I mentioned earlier, our infrastructure product is still growing very fast. And there’s a lot of ground, we can still cover it to make life easier for customers there. So we are heavily investing in our partnership product, on log management and APM products are in hyper growth and we’re very rapidly innovating there. So we’re investing heavily. We’ll have a few more products we’ve announced at Dash that we have to fully bring to market. As I mentioned earlier, most of these products are in beta and we haven’t started charging for them yet. And that’s something that you’ll see in the next few quarters. And then there were few larger categories we talked about in the IPO road show that we think we can enter in the future. But that’s I would say mid to long term plan. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Great. Congrats on a very strong start as a public company. My first question is for Olivia. Olivia, I wanted to ask a question about open telemetry as we head towards the official convergence of open census and open tracing. And obviously, you’ve supported the project up until now, but looking forward to the extent the project is successful in standardizing instrumentation for metrics and traces. What sort of impact would you expect it to have on your business model, if any at all? It’s always for us. I think we’ve always thought that the data collection in the customer side was not going to be the long term differentiator. And that’s why we’ve actually opened source all of our technology that leaves on the customer side, our agents, our libraries, our APIs everything is open source. Supporting open telemetry is not a step in that direction. At the end of the day, what matters is to make the product as easy to deploy as possible, as easy to get information in and out as possible. And that’s where we invest heavily on the backend of our products. That makes perfect sense. And David, can you update us on how we should expect gross margins to scale as you continue to see strength internationally and need to ramp compute capacity overseas? I think we gave in our long term model, a slight improvement over time. We said that, we’re in investment mode. So right now, we’re balancing the investment versus optimization. You see we’ve been in the range of 75%, 76%. We said we will – as we get to 75% start to try to balance a little more. So that’s our approach to that. But we’re still in investment mode and we’ll still expand geographically. Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks. Congrats from me as well. Olivier like, if I understand you correctly, like people come to you when they move over to the cloud, because the old tools, the on-premise tools don’t work anymore. And there my first question is more big picture question. Where are we in that cloud migration? It feels very, very early that’s beating this and even on infrastructure monitoring, there should be huge opportunity of initial workloads coming over, but then more and more workloads come in. Well, I just want to hear your big picture thinking there. Yes. So look, nobody knows exactly where we are. Like it’s a – it’s hard to wrap your arms around the whole thing. But depending on the device people, you can ask device folks, who have tried to APM at that, it’s either a single-digit percent or it’s in a low teens basically of the workloads that have moved from legacy IT to public and private cloud. So, with that in mind, we have basically 95% or so 90% of the end market that is – that hasn’t been attributed yet, which is why we think even for infrastructure, which was our first product, there’s a tremendous amount of runway ahead of us.
This is also combated by the fact that, as companies transform and become digital businesses, the overall impact and footprint of their application and software is going to grow. So, the end state, we’re not just looking at the transition from whatever had before data center into something that’s more cloudy, but of equal size. We think that the end state is going to be a lot larger. Again, it’s hard to quantify. You can lead with a lot of kind of report and things like that, but we were confident that this is a very large opportunity and we are the very, very, very beginning of it. Okay, perfect, team. thank you. And then the follow-up was like, as you launch a new product, like what’s your thinking around just marketing or selling this as a platform versus the individual product. So, Raimo, the way we do this is we message around the platform. But we approach customers with the infrastructure first and the infrastructure is the immediate pain that customer feel that needs to be remediated that we get our foot in the doorway so to speak. But we always miss it with the platform. So, it’s a bit of both. Yes. Okay. Perfect, team. congrats. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Matt Henry from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey guys, I’ll offer my congrats as well. Olivier, my question is on APM and it’s sort of a follow-up to Raimo’s. When we talked to folks out there in the industry, a lot of people think that maybe, only 5% of apps are being monitored. I’m curious, I guess why is that? And five years from now, where do you think we could be at as an industry? Yes. So – and that’s a product mostly used in conjunction with legacy APM. So, the APM that was used in the traditional data center apps. And the reason for the slow instrumentation rate is that these APMs are very, very, very heavy weight and they’re very expensive. So, it’s very hard actually to deploy them and get value out of them and it ends up being limited to a small set of extremely high value applications, for which you can be convinced to make an investment and get some ROI out of it.
When you think of the – what we’re going into the world of the cloud, the world of companies that are becoming increasingly software companies, they’re going to have many, many, many, many more apps. And the solutions we’re providing to them are a lot easier to deploy and it’s actually a lot more affordable for each unit of compute they have to deploy our solutions. So, we’re going to end up with a market that is significantly larger and there’s going to be a lot less investment needed to get to see returns. So, that’s the big difference between the – this world of the 5% of the apps being monitored with APM to the wall of the future, where companies will try mostly digitally and they will end up instrumenting most of the applications. That’s super helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, congrats on the early successes of synthetics, I imagine a lot of that greenfield wins, but could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape for synthetics? Thanks. Yes. So, there’s a few different aspect to it. And the first one is a number of the APM vendors have a Synthetics capability on top of their APM product. So that’s, I would say, the first set of competitors. And then there are a number of companies that offer a pure player Synthetics testing. Some of them I would say fairly low-end, so some cheap products that you can very easily adopt. And then there’s another part of the industry that is more in 2Q replacement in a high-end software testing. That’s the overall landscape.
our initial focus was not really to try and compete with any of those specifically. It was to fill a gap we saw in the world customers could understand and maintain the performance of the applications. So, we didn’t drive it from an intent to compete head-to-head with those companies. We drove it from what we think the future is going to look like in terms of an integrated platform that covers everything including simulating user traffic. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Yes. Just a quick follow-up in Synthetics. You mentioned a strong uptake, I was just curious if you could you dive a little deeper into that comment and in terms of what you’re seeing and perhaps what you think the incremental revenue uplifts you’re seeing. And the second part is you continue to expand this product portfolio, which is obviously very – you have robust, is there an easier way that you can go to market with an enterprise license agreement or some type of suite pricing that will make it easier for the sales force to go to customers and engage as you roll up more and more features? Are you seeing desire from customers for that or is it still too early? Thank you. Yes. On the first part, so look, yes, we’re very impressed by what we feel right out of the gate with Synthetics. I think it’s we can set, it’s a couple percent of the overall growth rate that comes from Synthetics, which was more than we had expected. I will say though that this includes a few months of pent-up demand. As we – onboard customers do the beta, we – also you didn’t start charging for the product right away after the product. So, when we started charging Q3, we already had some buildup usage basically.
We, over time, that product, we expect it to grow. We don’t know if we’ll see the same impacts next quarter as we had this quarter again, because we had some pent-up demands when we started charging for it. But we’re bullish. on the pricing and the way to sell multiple products, we already do that in a way, we let customers commit to a certain amount of spending on Datadog with rate card less than by any of the products and combine them in any way they see fit without having to commit to specific level of use for any of the products.
And that’s something our products, our customers love, because it lets them just negotiate a rate for everything ahead of time and not have to worry about what their teams are going to use or not use. And today hasn’t been a problem for the sales force to sell that to customers, and that in great part because the buyers are the same for everything we sell today. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brad Rebeck from Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks very much. If we compare the first time on to this year to last year, have you seen any difference in customer draw down rates on existing contracts? Well, we continue to see the same effect, which is customers are drawing down in both periods more quickly than the pro rata, so they’re consuming the products both from the uses of infrastructure as well as additional product. So we continue to have the same muscle, which is that customers are finding there. They’re using more quickly and sort of come back for more reserved instances, some more fixed capacity that happened last year and that’s continuing this year. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Next question is coming from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Hello, David. Congrats on the IPO and on a great first quarter out of the gate. You guys have pioneered so much in terms of monitoring and looking at this from a multi-siloed approach, there have been some competitive responses from a couple of companies in the APM space and the log space. Do you see any change in sales cycles or decision cycles in response to that broadening of the marketing people following your lead? No, we don’t see any changes. And again, I mean, we did it. We do expect that as what our approach of combining the silos and solving the end-to-end problem for our customers is obviously successful. We do expect that it’s not lost on our competitors who we are having high regard. So, that’s – we see that as that validation of our approach, but today we haven’t seen any changes in the competitor dynamics.
And I think as we said, in Q3, we had a very strong new logo, you can see that in the customer account. So even over the summer months and then we also have had maintained the retention rates with increased usage as well as, as we talked about earlier an increased adoption of the platform, so all of those things are continuing in that quarter. And then follow-up for David, great feed EBIT and a nice guide on EBIT for next quarter. If I model it quickly, it looks like the OpEx that’s implied is less than we had originally modeling. Is there any push out of spending into very small either in the next quarter or into next year? Not at all, we’re continuing to grow the sales team and the R&D team and invest. Similarly I think you saw revenues has outperformed and with our gross margins that’s dropped to the bottom line. But we’re continuing with the same investment pace that we had when we met during the roadshow. Great. Thanks, David and Olivier. Again, congrats on a great quarter Olivier. Thank you. Thank you. Next question coming from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So one for each of you, Olivier, I’d love to hear your thoughts on where customers are in their journey towards DevOps maturity and maybe how you see it differ by geography or by industry or by size of company? Yes, so it’s interesting because we see – so if you think of the transition to DevOps and mold related to cloud, the markets in EMEA and APAC are about two or three years behind what was seen in the U.S. So when we’ve seen in particular large enterprises in the U.S. start going to public and private cloud at scale two to three years ago. It’s something that is just starting to happen in other parts of the world today.
So we’ll just add a main comment I will have otherwise, we’ve seen the first companies to move to the cloud and to DevOps where the small companies, there is no tech oriented companies. After that you still do the larger enterprise companies that need to modernize and I think last are going to be the mid market, more traditional companies that are trying to mobilize as well. So we see all those various parts of the market turn on one after each other basically. Yes. And is the – like federal government even behind all those where we… Federal government is having to – I would say it’s a bit of a different beast. Yes. Okay. And then David, congratulations on the ninth consecutive quarter. Just I would love it if you could set our expectations a little bit in terms of the dollar base net expansion rate and what we should expect as we think about it from the future? Yes. I think we had set as time with the IPO that we would comment on that relative to 130. And we’re continuing to do that. We’ve seen no change in the environment relative to what we saw when we went public relative to the drivers of that, increase usage and cross-sell. Yes. And we – in our perspective 130% is already best-in-class and that’s the number we’re going to use moving forward. All right. Great. Thank you both. You’re welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is now open. Well good afternoon and congratulations on the results. I wanted to see if you could drill down a little bit more on just trends in terms of the new logos, specifically that you’ve been landing. Are you seeing different – perhaps higher ASPs? Are you still predominantly landing with infrastructure or perhaps form multi-product deals? Any more color on the new customer wins you’re experiencing would be helpful? Thanks. Yes. So the trends remains the same as what we’ve detailed during the IPO. If you still have some of the data in the S1 or in the road show that all of that remains true and some of that you can extrapolate a little bit and you get the good idea of what is happening today. On the – that’s on the new logos and on the ASPs again, the trends remain the same. I think we had – they’re similar and I think we’ve said a couple hundred thousand for enterprise and 150, 160 for mid-market continues to grow with the customers and continue to have a meaningful contribution. We talked about of customers landing with more than one logo – with more than one pillar and so it’s very much what we said on the IPO road show continuing. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Yes. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand it over the call to Olivier Pomel, CEO for any closing remarks. Thank you. Well in closing I’d like to repeat that we are incredibly proud of what we built the Datadog. We believe we’re in the early stage use of a substantial re-platforming opportunity. We are very focused on executing on our growth strategy today and we believe we have the potential to be essentially larger and profitable company in the long-term. And I would like to thank all Datadog customers for their trusts and of course all Datadog employees for their hard work and dedication. We have a complete great thing so far and I believe the best is yet to come. So thank you. Thank you everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you, AJ, and thank you all for joining us today to review our Q4 and full-year 2019 results. Q4 was a great finish to what has been a milestone year for us. Results were driven by broad-based strength across customer segments and geographies and supported by the continued traction of our integrated platform.
To summarize Q4, revenue was $114 million, close to 85% increase year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance. We ended the year with 858 customers with annual run rate or ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 89% year-over-year. The majority or about 60% of our customers are now using two or more of our products as of the end of the year.
As in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. We also continue to be capital-efficient with the free cash flow of $11 million and a [indiscernible] that is still around a year or less [indiscernible].
For the full-year, we generated revenue of $363 million, an 83% increase year-over-year, which was above the high-end of our guidance and free cash flow was approximately at breakeven or around $800,000 for the year.
To step back a little bit, our results clearly indicate that the market wants a unified observability platform for DevOps teams, which is becoming more important lever, but also more difficult to accomplish in a world that is platform into cloud and internal architectures. Our performance in 2019 shows Datadog is a winner in this converging world.
And our success is driven by our origins as an integration platform that collects many disparate sources of data across teams and silos, by our ubiquity seeing as deployed everywhere and used by everyone. And by the efficient adoption we get from lending with our infrastructure monitoring product.
As a result and today more than ever, Datadog is the monitoring and analytics platform for dev, ops and business users in the cloud age. We provide clarity and actionable insights into applications and IT infrastructure all in real-time. And we do so to enable our customers to deliver greater innovation and consistently provide an exceptional user experience.
With that background in mind, let's review our Q4 performance. First of all, we are very pleased with our results. Strength was broad-based driven by both robust new logo additions, as well as continued growth of existing customers. We added approximately 1,000 net new customers in Q4, which is a record for the Company and almost twice the number we added in the same quarter a year ago.
For the year, approximately 40% of our growth came from new customers, with our new logo ARR demonstrating very strong growth, while net retention of existing customers performed just as well. And our platform strategy is clearly resonating, including strong uptake of our newer products.
From an R&D perspective, we accelerated our pace of innovation with multiple exciting developments in Q4. After the launch of Synthetics earlier in the year, we extended our suite of user experience monitoring products with the launch of Real User Monitoring, or RUM, to monitor the journey of actual users within an application.
And continuing on our vision for full stack observability, we launched Network Performance Monitoring, or NPM, to monitor network traffic flows across public and private clouds, as well as on-premise environment.
We more recently implemented a monitoring offering, with the beta of our SNMP integration, which connects to physical network devices and extends visibility to customers with meaningful on-premise networks. We are pleased with the initial uptake of NPM and RUM, which demonstrates our opportunity to drive additional value for our customers and create future revenue drivers for our business.
In Q4, we also announced security monitoring, as a first step to apply the power of our platform beyond observability used cases. We envision a future where silos continue to break down beyond dev and ops and extended security teams.
As it becomes clear that securing applications in the cloud world needs to involve all three. We also believe that by harnessing the massive amounts of data already collected across metrics, traces, and logs, we can help our customers better operationalize IT security.
In 2018, Datadog became the first to unify the three pillars of observability with the launch of our logs product. In 2019, we believe we have proven ourselves to be a most comprehensive observability platform, and this is evidenced by our customer adoption.
As of the end of the year, the majority or about 60% of our customers are using two or more products, which is an increase from about 25% a year ago. This means that today over 6,000 of our customers are using multiple products, which is more than some point solution vendors have today. We also know that penetration is relatively even across enterprise, mid-market and SMB segments.
Additionally, as of the end of the year, approximately 25% of our customers are using all three pillars of observability combining infrastructure, APM and logs, which is up from 5% a year ago. This is especially impressive considering that our third pillar logs has been in the market for less than two years. And this makes it clear that customers are finding value by adopting our platform in full and benefit from coalitions and workflows that can cross boundaries between teams and systems.
Finally, one of the greatest surprises to us this year has been the success of newer products and initial land deals. In 2019, approximately 65% of our new logo deals had two or more products, up from only about 25% in 2018. This demonstrates the pent-up demand for our integrated platform and our ability to add value from the very start of a customer relationship.
To summarize, we believe we have a very significant opportunity to further expand our product portfolio and increase our wallet share with customers. We are a product-driven company and investing in innovation is a core part of our business strategy.
Now, let's move onto the go-to-market, starting with a look at our approach. We have been expanding coverage in both commercial and enterprise channels to capture the opportunity across company sizes. While continuing rapid growth in North America, we are also expanding in new and existing territories internationally.
Additionally, we have been expanding in new markets, such as building a government-focused team. And finally, we are investing in the partner channel, as announced in January with the launch of the Datadog Partner Network. We are excited about the opportunity with channel partners and plan for continued investment.
Turning to our Q4 sales. We saw strong new logo additions, as well as expansion from existing customers. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 10,500 customers, up from 7,700 a year ago. As mentioned earlier, we added approximately 1,000 customers in Q4, which is a record for the Company.
We ended Q4 with 858 customers, with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up 89% from a year ago and an increase of more than 130 in Q4. Given that more than 70% of our ARR is generated from customers over $100,000, we expect this cohort of customers to be a large driver of our future growth. We also ended the year with 50 customers with ARR of $1 million or more, which is up from 29 a year ago, and only 12 two years ago.
Now, let's review some of our key wins in the quarter. First, we had a multi-million dollar upsell with a global financial information services company. This customer started with Datadog in 2017, and has since increased spend by a factor of 20, adapting all three pillars. With Datadog, this customer has unified disparate teams on a single view and reduced tools [indiscernible] caused by point solutions.
Second, we had another seven-figure upsell to a large e-commerce retailer. This customer first came to Datadog in 2017, after experiencing large amounts of [indiscernible] alerts, right before Black Friday. Today, they have increased their spend by a factor of 15 and adopted infrastructure, APM, Synthetics and more recently Network Performance Monitoring.
Third, we had an exciting land this quarter from a large US-based global airline. As the Company embarked on the cloud-first initiative, it realized that its lack of cloud-scale monitoring was causing a significant risk. Datadog has enabled an improved time to market and a move toward [indiscernible]. And as a six-figure initial deal, we see ample room for growth over time.
Fourth, one of Europe's largest national railways had a seven-figure upsell. After using over 20 different monitoring tools, this organization has turned eyes on Datadog as a single source of truth across metrics, traces and logs in its cloud environment. This deal was also won through a public procurement process, which demonstrates our potential in the public sector.
We can't go over every deal we made, but there were many other exciting deals in the six or seven-figure range, such as the traditional US bank, 100 years old global beverage company, an Asia-based public sector organization, a manufacturer of industrial and transportation equipment, a Fortune 500 insurance company, and a professional services firm with over 50,000 employees.
We believe these examples demonstrate that the massive IT replatforming driven by cloud migration is happening globally and to organization that span all industries. Datadog today is a strategic partner to a diverse set of customers across both cloud native and traditional enterprises.
As a conclusion, we are in the early stages of what we think is a tremendous market opportunity, which we believe we are well positioned to capture. We have been performing at a very high level and our focus is on doubling down on what has made us successful today.
So in 2020, we plan to continue to invest in hiring great engineers and delivering innovation to our existing and new customers. We also remain committed to investing in our go-to-market, expanding our sales capacity globally across all geographies, as well as investing in new opportunities such as a partner channel in public sector.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped off an exceptional year for Datadog. I will now review Q4 results in detail. Revenue was $113.6 million, up 85% year-over-year. As Olivier mentioned, the quarter's strength was broad-based, driven by new and existing customers, success across segments and geos, as well as driven by strong platform adoption.
To provide some more context, in Q4, we saw strong new logo additions with contributions across sales channels and regions. This was a record quarter for new logo ARR, demonstrating very strong growth year-over-year. Additionally, we saw strong continued expansion of existing customers.
In the fourth quarter, our dollar-based net retention was above 130% for the 10th consecutive quarter. Our robust retention rate is primarily driven by the increased usage of existing products, as well as cross-selling to newer products. We continue to see robust and frictionless expansion as customers continue their cloud migrations. The cross-selling of newer products is a more recent driver of our net retention rate.
Next, we would note strength across segments with robust growth across enterprise, mid-market and SMB segments. This demonstrates the power of our simple but not simplistic platform, which is powerful enough for the largest of organizations and also easy to deploy and use for the smallest.
I'm happy to report that the average ARR of our enterprise customers at the end of 2019 was about $230,000, an increase from $160,000 at the end of 2018. And average ARR of our mid-market customers at the end of 2019 was about $170,000, an increase from $110,000 at the end of 2018. We believe there remains ample room for continued penetration of each of these segments.
Lastly, we had a very strong quarter internationally in Q4 with both EMEA and APAC performing well. Q4 saw record international ARR adds and strong momentum with international growth outpacing that of the aggregate business. I note that many of these teams in the region - in these regions are still ramping.
Turning to calculated billings, defined as revenue plus a sequential change in deferred revenue, which was $130.3 million, up 77% year-over-year. Adjusting for the timing of a large invoice that changed its timing that we discussed last quarter, calculated billings growth would have been 85% in Q4, in line with revenue growth.
As discussed previously, we strongly discourage the use of billings as a gauge of momentum as it does not accurately portray the growth of our business. Revenue is a better indicator of growth given the mix of monthly and annual billing terms among our customers and the tight relationship between revenue and ARR.
Now, let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $88.4 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 76% last quarter and 75% in the year ago period. Improvement in gross margin was driven by efficient use of our cloud hosting spend.
As we have discussed previously, we are focused primarily on product development and innovation, as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. Therefore, our gross margins may fluctuate within certain ranges as we prioritize product innovation over resource optimization.
R&D expense was $31.6 million, or 28% of revenue consistent with the year ago period. We continue to benefit from product-led adoption and have made extensive investments in our platform. This is evidenced by the launch of Network and RUM products in Q4, as well as the announcement of Security Monitoring. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore, plan to continue to make investments in R&D.
Sales and marketing expense was $39.3 million, or 35% of revenue, down from 46% in the year ago period. The change in Q4 was pronounced partly due to the outperformance on the revenue line. Furthermore, we note the greatest leverage came from marketing expenses, which grew at a lower rate year-over-year versus sales expenses, which grew closer to the rate of revenue. We plan to continue to invest aggressively to expand our go-to-market globally.
G&A expense was $10.4 million, or 9% of revenues, slightly higher than 8% a year ago given some public company-related expenses. Operating income was $7 million, or 6% operating margin, compared to an operating loss of $4.3 million and a negative 7% margin in the year ago period.
Net income in the quarter was $10.1 million, or $0.03 per share, on 327 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Profitability outperformance was driven primarily by the revenue outperformance.
We have a highly efficient business model and have experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and in R&D. While we have operated around breakeven to slightly profitable and outperformed on profitability in Q4, we see ample opportunities to continue to invest in the large market opportunity ahead of us.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $778 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was a positive $17.4 million in the quarter and a positive $24.2 million for the full year.
After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was positive $10.9 million in the quarter and approximately breakeven or around $800,000 for the full-year.
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and the full-year 2020. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $117 million to $119 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 68.5% at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of negative $5 million to negative $7 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be negative $0.01 to negative $0.02 per share based on approximately 296 million weighted average shares outstanding.
For the full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $535 million to $545 million, which represents 49% year-over-year growth at its midpoint. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of negative $20 million to negative $30 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of negative $0.03 per share to negative $0.07 per share based on approximately 302 million weighted average shares outstanding.
A few things to take into consideration in this guidance. First, while we saw strong efficiencies in our gross margin in the fourth quarter, we continue to focus on product development and diversification of our cloud hosting vendors and regions. Therefore, our gross margins may fluctuate within a certain range as we prioritize innovation over resource optimization. Second, we have some important corporate events in Q1, including our sales kick-off.
Next, our intention remains to invest much of our recent outperformance, including aggressive hiring targets in R&D and sales and marketing. Then some notes below the operating loss line. We expect approximately $10 million to $13 million of interest income for the full-year based on our cash and marketable security investments.
Second, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer but have a tax provision related to our international entities. For the full-year, we expect a tax provision of $1 million to $2 million. Note that our share count forecast for Q1 and 2020 reflects our basic share count, since we are forecasting a loss in each period.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the business performance in the fourth quarter, as well as the full-year. We have growth at scale that few can match and have demonstrated efficiency in our model. We are making continued investments for growth for the foreseeable future. We believe we are at the very early stages of a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and we feel very good about our ability to build a large and successful Company over time.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Sure. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, and thank you for taking the question and congrats on a really exceptional 2019. Really strong performance across the board. I wanted to follow-up on a point, Olivier, that you made in your script about 25% of customers adopting all three pillars. Could you give a better sense of sort of the market momentum in terms of going toward these unified platforms like Datadog? Where are you in that journey in terms of the different customer segments, whether it is mid-markets, which it seems like they are moving pretty aggressively, but also sort of the enterprise? And who are you sort of displacing as customers consolidate and standardize more on the Datadog platform? Yes. So the momentum is the same actually in each and every one of the segments, whether you talk about SMB, mid-market or enterprise, we see the same momentum. And in all cases, by and large, we are going to enter through net new deployments in cloudy environment. So we typically don't displace anything from day one.
What we are going to displace is going to be majotarily homegrown open source systems. That is when we lend these multiple customers. Over time, we will displace, for some of the customers that has spent more time in cloud environment and already had one of the pillars with a separate vendor, we will displace that, but that is not the majority of the deployments we have. Understood. And as my follow-up, it is sort of related to some of the momentum you are seeing across product. So if I look at the product portfolio and let's say, three buckets, core infrastructure monitoring, two of the products that you have released in 2017, 2018, that would be APM and logging and then sort of the 2019 cohort where we are talking about Network Performance Monitoring, RUM, the Real User Monitoring and Synthetics. Could you sort of give us a sense about the customer attraction across those three buckets? They are obviously going to vary, but just want to get a sense of what is picking up sort of faster than expected and where momentum is still sustaining? Thank you. Yes. So what I can tell you is, if we single that infrastructure monitoring, which was our initial product, in its own right, it would be a super high growth SaaS company and could keep building its own. The APM and logs products are both in hyper growth and have significant scale, we are not disclosing the exact scale, but I can tell you that they are growing faster than data that grows at a similar scale, the infrastructure products initially.
And then for the other products, the only one that is really been on the market for some time is Synthetics. The others, we either just started charging for them, or we haven't even yet started charging for them. For example, we haven't started charging for RUM yet, but we started charging for NPM in December. So these are very new.
We have some exciting stories about them. I mean, we mentioned one customer in the script that adopted - one large customer that adopted NPM and we have more stories like that. But we see so far, less scale from the newer products, obviously, because they are more recent, but we see very good adoption.
Now, Synthetics has been in the market, they will start charging for - during the summer has a large user base and keeps growing. And so, we are very hopeful. We can't tell which of these products is going to grow faster in the end, or have the biggest footprint, they are still very early for many of them. But in general, we are very satisfied with the adoption we see and we believe that there is going to be a lot of long-term growth, thanks to all of these products. Appreciate the color, Olivier. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. So, I just wanted to ask about the traction you are seeing, in particular with enterprise accounts. Can you talk about which of your non-infrastructure products in particular are resonating with that segment? And what are some of the reasons that you are hearing from those customers about why you are winning relative to some of the competition? Thanks. So, in enterprise - look, we are going to land in the majority of cases with two or more of the products, right? The breakdown is the same as we had in the other categories and it is going to be typically infrastructure and logs or infrastructure and APM. There is not a very notable difference in the attach rates there. Though, we will see that there is a bit more friction in adopting APM at scale.
So typically the dollars - even though they are going to use multiple products, dollar from day one are going to be higher for customers that adopt logs than they are for customers that adopt APM, but both are going to grow over time. So there might be a longer fuse on the growth on APM, for example. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on pricing. You, obviously, came up with a new pricing mechanism for the logs that seems to be resonating in the market and now, I guess, a lot of competitors are trying to replicate the broader products that you have put together. So when you talk to customers, is there a lot of sensitivity to price or are they just very much more focused on the functionality and therefore, you have less sensitivity around how you are charging for the products? Well, the real sensitive of customers is not so much on the price itself, but as you know, there are two things: one is the value and two is the control they have over it. So the way we make all of our product - all of our pricing work is that, we want to give all the controls to the customers, so they can align what they pay with the value to get for it.
So that is what we have done with what you have mentioned on log side and where we have also have versions of that for APM and infrastructure monitoring products, where we want to make sure customers have the controls and don't end up being prisoners of a pricing agreement that they don't like it at scale. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking my question, and congrats from me, as well. Olivier, just a quick one on security, like that obviously brings you into a field there you haven't played in before and there are some decent vendors out there. What is the investment needed in terms of sales support there? Is that kind of a whole specialist sales force that you need, because you talk - start talking to CECL, etc., or how you have to think about that? Yes. So right now, the bulk of the investment we are making is in the R&D and product side. So that is where we are starting. We are still very early in security. We are not charging for anything yet there. So it is going to take some time before we see a full ramifications on our go-to-market organization.
But I would say in the short-term, the signals we get from customers and from the early products we have that, one, there is a great deal or great amount of open space when it comes to cloud environments - new cloud environments that need to be secured.
So customers have a need, they have a gap there and it is net new and the realty is also amenable to being adopted bottom up, which is the rest of what we have done - which is exactly the rest of what we have done.
So initially, the go-to-market is very well aligned with what we have done in the past and we see signs of that being a fit. In the longer term, there might need more changes required and more customization to the sales team.
But in general, anyway, we are making changes in customization to the sales team as we have more and more channels to go-to-market and we get out to customers that are in different geographies, different sizes that might need different ways to address them. Okay, perfect. And then one on the networking side. So historically, the networking monitoring guys were always a little bit different because you had - where you had to be on the different switches, etc. Is that changing with kind of some open source projects, etc., or how is it possible to do it now? Because it used to be like a separate game. Well, so, first of all, we are not going to network monitoring with the objective and ripping and replacing everything and that people already use on-prem today. Our starting point is customers that have a significant footprint in public and private clouds, and then want to extend that visibility to on-prem network devices. So, this already limits the - I would say, the subset of devices we are starting with, just by selecting these types of customers.
And then, when it comes to integrating with all of this and it is sort of what we do already here, right? I mean, with our infrastructure monitoring product, integrating with a lot of different devices, [indiscernible] testing, integration in the real world with a lot of small customers testing them, that is a core competency of the Company. So that is not going to happen overnight, obviously, that is definitely something we keep investing in. Okay, perfect. Thanks. Very helpful, well done. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Excellent. Thanks so much and congratulations on the very impressive results, especially the metrics you have shared around multi-products adoption. My first question for you, Olivier, I wanted to touch on the competitive dynamic for logging specifically and who you are mainly competing against. Perhaps if you could touch on what sort of success you are seeing in the enterprise market? And how you compete for business that spans both public and on-premise environment specifically in logging? That would be very helpful. So, today, we see great adoption from the logging product in large enterprises. I would say, on equal footing give or take with the APM product as the second product is being adopted in this environment and it is a higher dollar amount typically because there is less friction to submit a lot of data from day one, it is also growing very fast again because of those environments are growing very fast themselves.
In terms of the competitive dynamics, in most cases, customers don't have anything in those cloud environments to start with. Even though, they all have some other logging vendor on-prem, so the most large enterprises are going to have a Splunk, everybody knows that.
And the fact they have a Splunk on-prem is not in - it looks like a lot of them adopting a different platform altogether in some environments. So that is what we typically see, we don't try to go and replace the on-prem environment before we are well-established in next-generation public and private clouds. That is our strategy. Thanks, Olivier. And maybe just a follow-up to that, in reference to the competitor that you mentioned, have you seen any changes in the market now that they have had pricing changes in effect for a number of months? Does that in any way change the pricing dynamic for you and the competitive win rates that you are seeing? There is no changes that we could feel on our end. The situation is exactly the same as it was in the last quarter we commented on. Very helpful. All right. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson for Matt. Olivier, you put out a really interesting report a couple of weeks ago on the state of server less, it really makes kind of a strong case for the growth in the technology. Could you talk a little bit more about how this trend impacts Datadog specifically? And then maybe things you can do to invest to be positioned for it? Yes. So to answer the last part of your question first, we are definitely investing heavily in supporting server less. To us this is the next stage in a continuum of evolution for the way infrastructure is being package and run. To step back a little bit, when you look at what infrastructure was like 15 years ago, we had stable hardware then we moved on to VMware type VMs and they were very static and go anywhere.
Then you had cloud instances that were smaller VMs that could go up and down, every second. Then you had containers that were smaller VMs, smaller cloud instances that could go up and down every millisecond, sorry. And then you had this server less that are basically - select functions that are basically smaller containers that go up and done every microsecond.
So, all of that is basically one big continuum that goes from stat - a few things that are moving very statically to lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of tiny components that keep being coming up and down and being combined in different ways. So the way we see it, there is really a shift that is actually happening in terms of the value to provide that goes from the run time toward the observability of the understanding of that run time.
So we think in the end this creates more value for us, our job in the end is to solve the problem of complexity for our customers, make sure that the people understand what the machines are doing and can keep changing what the machines are doing and manage it and manage the experience of it and the more complexity, the better it is for us. So we think it is definitely a development that tilts the market in our favor. Thanks. That is really helpful. And then, David, it kind of feels like this is another quarter that we describe as accidentally profitable, but when we are thinking about investments into 2020, can you just talk about some of those levers you have during quarters or during the year to ramp up investments if you continue to see outperformance on the top line? Yes. I think that is what we said last time, which is a lot of the outperformance has been going to the bottom line, it has to do with hiring plans. We are planning based on a little more of a conservative case and then we have been outperforming. The levers to pull are to hire more quickly, most of the hiring is in R&D and in sales. And then, the second would be to change the marketing dollars to the extent we can do some more marketing or trade shows, those are the levers we can essentially pull in a quarter. All right. Thanks for the time. Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. So wanted to dig in on the 1,000 net adds in the quarter, a big uptick and what I'm wondering is, are you seeing an inflection in terms of the gross new customers that are coming in, an improvement in the overall renewal rate of customers or both that is driving that metric? It is a bit of both. So the renewal rates are generally stable, I would say, trending up softly overtime, they are already pretty high. So there is not a lot of room for them to grow. And just seeing more customers go through the door. As we scale the organization in general, we are seeing more customers go through the door. Yes. I would say, the new logo performance in the second half of the year was stronger in the first half. It is related to our development of the sales team and the ramping and as we said, it is broad-based, for instance, EMEA, which we were developing performed very well in the second half of the year in new logos and that is because of the ramping and the sort of the build out that we had been doing last year and the year before. Got it. And then one follow-up, when you look at a new enterprise logo that comes in and buys all three pillars, where are you finding that primary point of contact is in the organization for that type of customer? Are you all the way to the CIO level in an enterprise account, or are you finding that you are still finding success either in a division or a geography and then expanding upwards from there? Well, typically, it is going to be a cloud initiative and it is going to be small because it is cloud and it is new. So there is going to be a relatively small team that is driving that and that team is going to - because it is new and because there is the future that team is going to be connected to the leadership team in general. So, sometimes the CIO, sometimes some other people there. And that team is going to have preview of the whole environment to start with, which is the way it is relatively straightforward for us to enter with multiple products at once. Perfect. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. You talked about strong net new ARR adds on the international front. Just any commentary on whether - on how either purchasing pattern, sales cycles, competition sort of compared from what you are seeing here in North America and Europe? The main comment is that, we really see the cloud migration happening in the rest of the world. It is something that is starting to happen at scale. This is combined with the fact that we installed sales teams and start ramping them in most parts of the world in EMEA two years ago and in APAC last year. The combination of that is what drives the success we are seeing there. I will say, it is still early, those things are still ramping.
They are still, obviously, things that will take more time to work well reliably, but we are seeing some great signs and in Q4, we had very strong performance in EMEA and APAC, great logos and great successes there both on the mid-market side and on the enterprise side. So we are very, very optimistic in the future, but it is still early. Got it. Okay. And on the lending ARR side, are you seeing anything meaningful with the cohort in the fourth quarter relative to prior quarters, either greater infrastructure usage on lending or attach of multiple products when the initial deal is signed? We see a bigger attach of more products. Which is causing a larger land slowly but surely. And it is just been progressive throughout the year as the attach rate of additional products has gotten larger. Okay. Makes sense. Thank you, guys. Congrats. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks very much. Two quick ones for me. I think during the fourth quarter, you [indiscernible] any FedRAMP process, any update on where you are there? And how should we think about potential upside from that? So not yet, we will dutifully file a press release once we have the outcome of it. There is going to be upside at some point, I would say, not in the very short-term, we still have to be fully build out the teams there and there is number of more things we need to do, but we are investing. Got it. Okay. And David, on your last comment there a moment ago about larger labs, is there any risk in the short-term that with bigger lands you start to see less net dollar expansion because of the bigger starting point? We said that is one of the reasons we said that we want it to be prudent in our guidance long-term, but we haven't seen that today. We have seen as Oliver mentioned, that net retention be very stable and strong in the second half of the year. Perfect. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Thanks. This is actually Robert Majek. I believe you mentioned that you haven't started charging yet for some of the new products. Should we expect a high level of pent-up demand next quarter? And has that been fully built into your Q1 guide? Thanks. So, in general, this summer we had a lot of pent-up demand from Synthetics because we actually had customers using it for five months before we started charging for it. I think in this case, we will start charging quicker, so there probably will be a bit less pent-up demand, the products might have also a bit more friction than Synthetics, which we found to be a very low friction product, [indiscernible] this for tons and tons of customers to get started with it.
At this point, our expectations for these products are baked into guidance. But as we multiply the products and obviously, some of them are going to be bigger hits than others. So in the long run, we are optimistic that we will get a lot of upside. But in the short term, they are going to have a relatively small impact. Appreciate it. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews of Needham. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, I mean, just given the proliferation of new products that you are introducing, how would you describe your sales force, the maturity and their ability to understand and appropriately sell these products. Yes. That is a great question. So that is also a bigger area investment for us in enabling the sales force and making sure that everybody knows everything we can sell now. In most situations, though, when we land a customer, which is where the bulk of the - I would say, the hard part of the sales job is taking place.
We land with the marquee infrastructure monitoring, which is very, very, very, which has great fit for the pain that customers are feeling from day one when they are deploying the cloud. And then, logs and APM, that customers also understand very well and fully expect not to be part of the same platform. So there is not a lot of challenge there in terms of training the sales force and making sure we can present everything in a way that makes sense for the customer.
Now, as we grow with customers over time and as we put more products in front of them and make sure that they know they can also use Real User Monitoring or Network Performance Monitoring or Synthetics and others, I think there is definitely more investment we need to do there to make sure that we can fully capitalize on that. So that is one of the levers for growth we have and one of the things we are investing in. Yes. And as we mentioned, I mean, we are pretty much selling a platform. So, I mean, you can tell that from the attach rates. And so, in that case, the salesperson is able to sell that platform, that is what the client wants. We also augment the salesperson with sales engineers who are expert across the platform and in products. So they are not out there alone, they are being helped by some technical pre-sales. But at the end of the day, the adoption for all of this product is mostly frictionless. So for example, we see adoption dynamics that are fairly similar between large enterprises that are higher touch with enterprise sales and sales engineers and SMB, mid-market that are going to be lower touched and handled by our customer success teams. So this show that customers can find their way and adopted new products. There is still probably some upside if we can figure out the best way to enable the customer success teams and the sales teams to go and proactively present new products to customers. Great. I appreciate the color. And just as a follow-up to that, could you explain a little bit more on the new partner network? I mean, which channel are you most excited about? And who should we be keeping an eye on in terms of partners who could really move the needle for you? Well, it is very broad coverage and it really depends on different parts of the world. In the U.S., it is going to be mostly SIs, either local SIs or global SIs. In other parts of the world, you are going to find - more importance to VARs in Europe, in Asia, you would have a lot more channel, for example. So it really depends on the part of the world. The program as it is designed has broad appeal, and then we have teams on the ground that are going to leverage this program to go and recruit very specific types of channels and resellers. Great. Well, congratulations, and thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Let me echo my congratulations, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, just to start with something much more strategic here, when you think about the platform as a whole, there is an underlying sort of data elements, right. So we are capturing all the data and then there is the next step, which is, hey, what we are going to do? And we think about DevOps and one of the challenges with DevOps is integrating dev and ops or CICD together. And as you think about the data element and capturing all the data and one could have quit their relational database is always where there is fields is, there is all that management. I guess, I would love to understand how you guys think about approaching the data opportunity to really delve into more of the ops side and the dev side, right? So as I develop software and I try to do continuous integration, continuous appointment, how do you guys think about sort of how that plays out and how your product roadmap flows into that over, say, the next three to five years? So our product actually - the business or solving the problem of complexity for our customers, and that problem of complexity doesn't start or stop at the infrastructure or ID logs or what is happening when you trace an application in production. It actually covers everything wall to wall between the source code the engineers are writing, the output of the application for the business and all the various remediation tasks that need to take place to keep it going in production.
So as time goes by, we extend the footprint of that platform to really recover as much as possible of that space. So, for example, we announced a profiling product that is very interesting because it is another step toward bridging the gap between the code the developers write and what is actually running in production.
And we had a fairly differentiated approach to it, we are actually very excited about it, even though it is also not a product we are charging for yet. So we do see the value of having as broad coverage as possible end-to-end between all the way between the developers and what the machines are doing. I think it is helpful. I would love to say that once and then just figure out what bridges that gap? You guys, obviously, a player, the other players in the market, but at some point the gap still exist between that idea of development and integration and implementation and a lot of people doing real time CICD - and it feels like given the data and the model you have that the gap should be easier for you to bridge than anyone else. Olivier, how would be the respond to that or not? Yes. That is the idea. I mean, that is why we are so optimistic about the future. That is why we keep investing, that is why we think there is a very large opportunity because when you think of what makes us valuable is that, because we started from the infrastructure we deployed everywhere, not just in the small sets of machines or environments, we deployed everywhere. We need to see to tell you if it is working. Therefore, we deployed everywhere.
And then, because of the way we design the product to bridge the gap between different teams and be very easy to adopt, were used by every single engineer every day. And that combination of deployed everywhere, or used by everyone is what gives us the success of contact with the customer, so that we can actually keep filling their gaps and add stuff in the middle and cover more and more of the program space. So, obviously, as you mentioned, there is tons and tons to do, I mean, it is a very large program space, which means there is a lot of value we can provide. Got it, got it. I mean, I have a quick follow-up there, just more tactical now on the vertical side. Obviously, verticalization matters, it matters probably less in your space, but love to listen how you guys think about verticalization and how you approach the vertical markets? Thank you. Yes. I think, we are not there yet in terms of verticalization. Right now, the opportunity as far as we are concerned is very horizontal. I think, maybe when we are further along in the cloud migration, that is something that might make more sense. Maybe also when we expand into different product categories, that might be a little bit more specific to what all customers are doing with the data. That is also something that might make sense, but today with our current set of product, we are not really verticalizing. Got it. Thank you for taking my question, guys, and congrats again. Appreciate it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Oh, great. Thank you, and congratulations. So, Olivier and David, I would love to hear your perspective, each of you on the same question, which is, I mean, 85% growth and working on so many things, which has come up in all of the questions on this call. I mean, Olivier, what is sort of your number one focus right now? And David, same question for you in terms of where you are spending your focus and your time? All right. So I seem to have two focuses. Yes. So focus number one, hiring enough of the right salespeople and enabling them everywhere in the world and that is the best predictor of success one year from now. And focus number two, hiring enough of the best engineers, and training them and retaining them, which is the best predictor of success two years from now and that is - if we can get all that done, we will be fine. Yes. And my focus is on providing scalability in the infrastructure and the transparency of information to support that, whether that would be in the hiring process, the information around sales or products, et cetera, and support that, so we can see what is going on and make good business decisions. All right. Very good, thanks. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you. So congrats on a very strong impressive results. Echoing Brad's earlier remarks and others, one of the most impressive trend within your results is that you are able to land initial deals with more than your core infrastructure product. Obviously, that is what you guys are known for. And then, obviously, there is also a fairly high percentage of customers already adopting multiple products, which is obviously, again, very impressive. Just trying to better understand, is there a concerted sales effort, perhaps additional incentives or the sales process to push for this multi-product adoption, especially on the initial land deals? Or is it just simply customers asking for them from the start? Again, just trying to better understand what is driving this very impressive multi-product adopting trend. Thanks. No, there is no incentives for it. The incentive is that customers want it more if we have more of the products. So it is easier to sell. Yes. The platform single pane of glass, observability platform is being led by the clients. As we talked about, we are looking at clients first and where are our product strategy and we are following that and it is very much pulling incentives. But the compensation is converting useful to it. For the sales. Yes. Okay. That is great. So it is definitely market driven, which is validation of your products and technology out there. David, real quick, deferred contract costs was up quite a lot, which is obviously a good sign. Just curious if there is any kind of special commission payout for a certain product or on higher payouts on initial land deals, just because it seems like that performed well in the quarter. Just trying to better understand the strong uptick in deferred contract costs beyond stronger sales execution and perhaps some accelerators kicking in? Thanks. Yes. There is no special deals or anything different in the commission plan. It is purely the sales performance and those getting into accelerator. So it is all related to the sales performance. I will add, anybody is listening to this call and is in sales, we have high expenses because of accelerators with a large commission, so feel free to apply. All right. Thank you so much. Congrats. Yes. Thanks. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue, Olivier. All right. Thank you. So in closing, I would like to repeat that we are very pleased with results for Q4 and for 2019 as a whole. We are achieving growth at scale through companies can match, we have proven the efficiency of our model and we have demonstrated our platform traction. That being said, we still feel that we are just getting started, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and have many ambitions to goal to execute on in 2020 and beyond.
With that, I would like to thank all Datadog customers for their trust and, of course, all Datadog employees for their hard work, dedication and success to what has been a fantastic year. Together, we have accomplished great things, but I believe the best is yet to come. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. Before reviewing the quarter, I'd like to take some time to address the situation we're all facing with the COVID pandemic and in particular our internal response to the crisis the ways in which the pandemic intersects with our business but also some of the data we've seen in March and April as well as our stance for the year and our perspective on the future.
So, starting with our response. We communicated three objectives internally: first to keep our employees safe healthy and sane; second to be good citizens and members of our communities and contribute to our collective health and economic success; and last, but not least, to serve our customers level down innovation and be the best at what we do for challenging times as well as good.
In keeping with those objectives, we have mandated work from home since March 12th. In addition to that we have allocated a grant to each of our employees to support their productivity and safety. And at three discretion employees could elect to donate all or a portion of their grant to charities that help with COVID relief.
I'm very proud to say that this program has already resulted in $1 million of donations from our employees and reflects the generosity and our commitment to go through this crisis together with the communities in which we operate.
I also have to say that I've been extremely impressed with Datadog employees' resilience, continued productivity, and innovation through this time. Our success in pivoting to operate remotely does demonstrate the advantage of being a digital-first cloud-based business.
Regarding the way the pandemic may affect Datadog, there are a few important structural points to understand about our business. First, we have a very diverse customer base.
We estimate that less than 10% of our ARR comes from categories most negatively impacted by COVID such as hospitality and travel airlines and in personal entertainment. On the other hand we also have exposure to categories that have experienced increasing traffic such as streaming media gaming food delivery e-commerce and collaboration.
Second, we also have a great diversity of customer sizes. We have low concentration and approximately 75% of our ARR comes from customers that pay us $100,000 or more. Also less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our ARR comes from a long tail of small businesses.
Third, we price according to our customers' infrastructure footprint and not per seat. So, our product usage is not directly affected by reductions in the workforce.
Fourth our business model is low-friction land and expand and our platform is adopted bottom up. We often land fast and small as enterprises begin their cloud migration and then we frictionlessly expand from there as more workloads move to the cloud. This makes our sales effort less dependent on physical meetings and makes our model is extremely efficient and less reliant on larger front deals.
Lastly, we are pure SaaS and require no professional services or hand-on-keyboard implementation.
Now, turning to what we've seen in March and April. First of all, the COVID escalation happened late enough in the first quarter to not materially affect our financial results. Throughout the quarter, we saw consumption continue to increase across the platform and growth of the number of hosts, containers metrics traces and logs, for example, have remained consistent with historical trends.
We started to see some negative effects in impacted industries such as travel, hospitality and airlines. But we've also seen substantially increased usage from other categories such as streaming media, gaming, food delivery and collaboration, as these customers scaled up their operations in this environment.
We also saw a surge of usage and surge in accounts in March in response to COVID that we expect could be more transitory in nature and may normalize over time. In terms of new deals, we did have a strong end of the quarter with limited impact from COVID.
As far as Q2 goals, our pipeline is robust and relatively consistent with prior quarters, but it is still too early to know the impact COVID could have on the road. Because of that and given the macro uncertainty, it is prudent to expect delay of some new cloud migration projects as well as some impact on churn. As David will discuss, the effect of COVID has been incorporated in our guidance.
To close on the COVID dynamic, let's step back and look at our stance for the rest of the year and perspective on the future. While there is a lot more certainty across the industry and the broader economy in the very near term, we believe it is more important than ever for businesses to operate online, and that the trends of digital transformation and cloud migration remain very much intact over the long-term and may even be accelerated or amplified.
We believe we are well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of this trend and continue to win in the market. And we also believe that the efficiency of our business, whether it is our unit economics or balance sheet, our ability to innovate will be an advantage in a difficult market.
As such our plans remain clear. We are investing across the board. We're investing in the development of existing and new products including aggressive R&D recruiting targets and taking advantage of the opportunity to attract talent that would otherwise not be on the market.
We're investing in the growth of our go-to-market team across segments and geographies. We're investing in our relationship with customers as some of them go through difficult times and it is more important than ever for them to operate digitally. And we're investing in our existing employees to keep them safe and sane through this crisis.
To conclude on this point, I would say that while I can't promise for macro reasons that we'll see the same incredibly fast return on these investments as we have historically. We are very confident in the mid and long-term opportunity in front of us and in our strategic plan to live up to it.
Now on to Q1, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Results were once again driven by broad-based strength across new logos and expansions as well as across customer segments and sales channels.
To summarize Q1, revenue was $131 million, an increase of 87% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 960 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 89% from last year. These customers generate approximately 75% of our ARR. We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million and a tax payback that is still around a year or less.
We ended the quarter with about 11,500 customers, which is about 40% growth from 8,200 last year, which means we added about 1,000 net new customers in the quarter, which was twice the number we added last year. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products.
From an R&D perspective, we continued a rapid pace of innovation. We recently announced the general availability of our Security Monitoring products to unify visibility across security dev and ops teams.
As with all our products, it is available in the same integrated simple-to-use SaaS platform. We are pleased with the initial response to this product, and it has been the most demanded beta in company history. But I'll remind you that we are just beginning on the journey to break the silos between security dev and ops, and we plan for continued innovation in this category.
Additionally, we recently crossed 400 out of the box integrations. And among a number of new and improved, I'd like to call out Tenable, Nessus and VMware Carbon Black, which support our new security use cases.
Looking at product usage, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. As of the end of Q1, 63% of our customers were using two or more products, up from 58% in Q4 and 32% last year.
In Q1, approximately 75% sorry of our new logos landed with two or more products. And our success in both landing and cross-selling our platform has resulted in the number of customers using two or more products nearly tripling year-over-year.
We are very pleased with this continued adoption of our platform, which includes strong initial uptake of our newest products, Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring. And as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to believe we have a significant opportunity to further expand our product portfolio and grow our addressable market.
Now, let's move on to the go-to-market. I have been personally very impressed with our continued productivity across teams during this time. Enterprise sales teams in particular, who are serving companies of more than 5,000 employees, have successfully adapted to selling by phone and video.
And as you know, tradeshows and marketing events have been canceled or going virtual. So, we have been redeploying those investments into online advertising, webinars and other activities. Our own user conference Dash is going virtual likely in Q3.
Now, let's review some of our key wins in the quarter. First, we had an exciting seven-figure new logo win from a Fortune 100 pharmaceutical company, embarking on a migration to a container-based hybrid cloud. The incumbent legacy tools didn't keep up with their new dynamic stack and Datadog allows for mass adoption across DevOps and executive teams through a single observability platform that all teams can use every day.
Next we signed a six-figure new logo deal to provide monitoring for a large health insurance company, embarking on a multi-cloud migration. What's really interesting about this deal is that it was won through a new partnership with one of the world's largest system integrators. This is a great example of success after we announced Datadog Partner Network in January, though, of course, it is still early days for our channel and alliances go-to-market. By the way, both of the new logo deals I just mentioned were closed at the very end of March.
Next we had a sizable upsell to a mid-market on-demand logistics company which now spends more than $1 million a year with us. This company has been a customer since 2018, started with infrastructure monitoring and then adopted both APM and log management in 2019. Today this customer is also using Synthetics, NPM and Security Monitoring.
What's really interesting in this case is that this customer partnered with us to build out security products and has quickly found value in scanning logs to detect security threats. It is also worth noting that this logistics company has experienced dramatically increased demand with COVID and it has successfully scaled up its operations, avoided performance issues and enabled all its engineers to collaborate remotely all with support from Datadog.
Lastly, I'd note a large six-figure upsell to one of the world's largest global financial institutions. This customer plans to migrate thousands of applications over the coming years, with Datadog being the standard across multiple public and private clouds. This is an interesting customer to single out for both its extremely stringent security requirements and its adoption of our serverless monitoring capabilities.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we were very pleased with our first quarter results. I will now review Q1 results in detail. Revenue was $131.2 million, up 87% year-over-year. The quarter's strength was broad-based, driven by new and existing customers, success across segments and sales channels, as well as driven by continued platform adoption.
To provide some more context. First, in Q1, we saw strong new logo additions with contributions across sales channels and regions. Additionally, we saw strong continued expansion of existing customers. In the first quarter, our dollar-based net retention rate was above 130% for the 11th consecutive quarter.
Our robust retention rate is driven primarily by increased usage of existing products, as well as cross-selling to newer products. As Olivier mentioned, we are pleased with the initial uptake of our newest solutions NPM and RUM. However, I would note that these newest products were immaterial to the results of the first quarter.
Lastly, we saw strength across segments, with similar growth rates across enterprise, mid-market and SMB. We were encouraged to see this broad-based strength, including many large enterprise deals which closed in March, as well as strength from our SMB customer base. In the quarter, we saw continued robust dollar rates -- net and gross retention in each of these segments.
Now turning to billings, which was $137.9 million and up 55% year-over-year. There are two dynamics here I'd like to call out. First, while we saw billings duration come in a bit in some of our renewals and upsells in the quarter, as some of our clients move to quarterly or semiannual payment terms from prior annual terms, I want to note that this did not result in reduced duration of contract length, merely the payment terms.
This was due to customers' cash flow planning amid COVID and our accommodation to their billing preferences. The impact of shorter duration on the quarter was approximately $10 million to billings. Given our very efficient land-and-expand model, however, we are still not dependent on large upfront payments for multi-year deals.
Next, there was a smaller impact from the invoice timing of a sizable existing customer, that was invoiced $4 million in Q1 last year and then due to growth was invoiced a second time in 2019, but was not invoiced in Q1 this year. Normalizing for these two impacts, calculated billings growth would have been approximately 70% year-over-year.
In addition, as of the end of Q1, our Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was $256 million and grew 82% year-over-year. RPO measures commitments rather than billing terms. The higher growth of RPO indicates increases in longer-term commitments even when billing terms may be altered.
As discussed previously, we discourage the use of billings as a gauge of our momentum as it does not accurately portray the growth of our business. Revenue is a better indicator of growth given that our revenue is directly tied to consumption and due to the tight relationship between revenue and ARR.
Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
Gross profit in the quarter was $105.2 million representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 73% in the year ago period. Improvement in gross margin was driven by efficient use of our cloud hosting.
As we said before, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies.
R&D expense was $35 million or 27% of revenue compared to 31% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth in our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue has outpaced even our substantial investments. We continue to see meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue making meaningful investments in R&D.
Sales and marketing expense was $42.1 million or 32% of revenues compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has also outpaced this investment. While we have experienced cancellation of marketing events due to COVID, we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generation activities, but not quite on a one-for-one basis.
G&A expense was $12 million in the quarter or 9% of revenue slightly lower than 10% in the year ago period. Operating income was $16.1 million with a 12% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $7 million or a negative 10% margin in the year ago period.
Beyond the improvement in gross margin and the other factors discussed above, I'd also like -- I'd also note that reduction in T&E and facilities overhead related to COVID contributed slightly to the operating margin improvement.
Net income in the quarter was $18.8 million or $0.06 per share based on 328 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a highly efficient business model and experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered three consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top-line growth. And we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market.
We have been very successful in interviewing hiring and onboarding remotely. As a result, our plans for hiring and investing remain largely the same as before the corona outbreak. We are investing across the board and believe we are well-positioned to execute on our plans of growth.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $799 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was a positive $24.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software free cash flow was a positive $19.3 million in the quarter or a free cash flow margin of 15%.
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2020. Given our recurring revenue model, we have not yet felt the effect of COVID-19 on our top line results. It is early in the quarter and we expect that we will see some deal slippage particularly in new logos. We also expect that despite a relatively high net retention rate, we may see some downward pressure in net retention rate in the next two quarters.
As Olivier mentioned, the usage of some client surged in March and have adjusted somewhat in April, but remain above pre-COVID levels. It is too soon to know how usage will trend for the remainder of the quarter. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to expect some impact from the above effects most likely in Q2 and Q3 and potentially throughout the rest of the year given our ratable model. And as a result, we have incorporated this into our guidance.
Beginning with our second quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be in the range of $134 million to $136 million which represents a year-over-year growth of 62% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 positive per share based on approximately 329 million weighted average diluted shares.
Turning to the full year. Given our first quarter strength and the drivers of our business, we feel comfortable raising our guidance for 2020 based on what we know today about COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment. For the full year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $565 million, sorry, $555 million to $565 million, which represents a 54% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of breakeven to $10 million positive. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.02 positive to $0.06 positive per share based on 330 million weighted average shares outstanding.
A few things to take into account in our guidance, while we do not guide to billings and continue to discourage this as a key metric when putting together your models, we would note that the shorter billing duration impact we talked about in Q1 is likely to continue for the next couple of quarters as customers plan for cash flow amid COVID-19, related to cost drivers, while we've seen continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability.
Next, our intention is to invest meaningfully and continue to do so in R&D and sales and marketing. As noted, we have been successful in hiring and on-boarding during COVID. In Q2, we expect an approximately $5.5 million non-cash tax adjustment related to the expiration of a payroll tax liability. Similar to Q2 2019 this will be a benefit to GAAP operating income, but we intend to normalize for it in our non-GAAP results. And, therefore, it is neutral to non-GAAP operating income. Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2 million of interest income per quarter throughout 2020 based on our cash and investments.
Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer but have a tax provision related to our international entity. For the full year, we expect a tax provision of a range of $700,000 to $1.5 million. Note that our share forecast for Q2 and the full year are diluted, given that we expect to be a non-GAAP net income profitable company for both periods.
Lastly, while we're not giving guidance to cash flow a few things to note. Related to our employee stock purchase program, we've realized an inflow of about $3 million in cash flow from operations in both Q4 and Q1. As the first program concludes, there is a change in geography, whereby, cash flow from operations will decline by $6 million and cash flow from financing activities will increase by $6 million, resulting in no net cash effect. In addition, our new ESPP will produce $2 million to $3 million of new positive cash flow from operations in Q2.
Lastly, we expect pressure on billings duration and potentially on DSOs related to COVID, which may cause lower cash generation in the near-term. Given our efficient model, proven cash flow generation, and meaningful cash on the balance sheet this will have no impact on our liquidity.
To summarize we were very pleased with the business performance in the first quarter. We continue to deliver growth at scale a few can match and have demonstrated efficiency in our model. While we recognize the challenges that COVID-19 and the macro environment may present, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned for the long-term and plan for continued investments to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator let's begin the Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on a strong Q1. And I hope everyone in the New York headquarters is doing well, the employees are doing well, just given all the challenges that we've been going through over the last couple of months, so great to see the Q1 results. I had two questions, one more of a short-term -- shorter-term question and one more of a longer-term question for Olivier. To start with the short term question, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, from what you guys have seen in March and through April and now in early May, the -- what's the sort of the net impact in terms of what you're seeing in the business from the customers that are more impacted the sort of less than 10% of ARR customer -- the spending trends in those customers that are less than 10% of ARR versus some of the increased spending you're seeing in some of the other verticals. So does that sort of net out to neutral in terms of your business plans for the year? Or is it -- are you seeing a net positive effect? So I'll answer that. So far, what we see in March, April is that, we see growth. April actually is a robust month. And we -- some customers are impacted and are going slower. Some customers have been scaling up. We have some questions on our end as we discussed on the call on which parts of the scale-ups are going to normalize in the future since we've seen some customers that scrambled late in Q1 and then in April to reorganize the operations and may normalize after that.
I would say it's too early to tell where everything nets up. I would think, we need to be prudent in estimating what could happen over the next couple of quarters. But so far from what we can see, we see a lot more reliance on online. We see actually a success story around the cloud. The cloud scaled up. All these companies have been able to move their operations and scale their operations. And we see more investment going on that side. So that's the story so far. And you had a second question? Yes. My follow-up is sort of trying to think about the world post COVID. And when we look at the product portfolio, it seems like you guys have continued to maintain a rapid pace of innovation. And in terms of coverage, it seems like across security, across the -- I guess now four pillars you have all the products in place that is going to drive really healthy growth for a long time. I'm trying to understand like what the next sort of key buying criteria is going to be.
So as we go from observability, is there going to be an element of taking action right? And beyond just monitoring and alerting, do you have the data? Are the products going to be in a place where you can start -- where customers can start taking prescriptive action in terms of their environment? Or maybe even said more simply, where do you see the product portfolio going as we get past COVID? Yes. So we -- look we already have a lot on our hands, right? So I should just restate the fact that our more recent products like APM and logs are in hyper growth. The products we've added after that like Synthetics for example are growing very fast. And there's still a lot of investment that goes into all of these products including our core infrastructure monitoring product. So we still have a lot that we're doing there.
When it comes to security, we're still very, very early. What we have is the first product. We're happy that it is in GA. We're happy that it's getting traction. But it's still very early and it has a very long road map. And there's a lot more that we intend to build around it.
So now regarding the categories of product you've mentioned like there definitely are some things that are interesting to us in there. And we do have some internal developments in a number of areas. I can't tell you exactly when that is going to be presented to customers and we really have a lot going on. Fair enough. I’ll leave it there. Congrats on the Q1. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Okay. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on the phenomenal results. So in the prepared remarks, you talked about some impact from the delay of projects. But I guess at the same, time there's an opportunity for the pace of digital transformation to actually accelerate in a recovery. And perhaps that's particularly true for customers that were unprepared for a remote workforce. So, can you talk a bit about your customer conversations on that particular topic and how you think about how these trends could impact Datadog post COVID and in recovery? Yes. So, I mean -- look we see what's happening with our customers that have one foot in the digital world and one foot in the -- I would say physical brick-and-mortar world. They're investing heavily in digital art and they see these parts scaling like crazy right now. So that is not going to slow down. And that is actually going to we think accelerate the transformation for the broader industry. Now, at the same time this is happening it is difficult for companies to transform and modernize and make big investments or new investments at a time where many of them are in trouble and have pretty stern constraints on cash and have to make some very hard choices in the short term.
So this is -- this is not new. Many other companies have discussed that before over the past few weeks. But I think what we're trying to balance here is, the uncertainty in the short term as these companies go past this urgent transformation or urgent survival mode and the fact that the underlying trend that underpin our success of digital transformation and move to the cloud are just going to accelerate and become more prevalent once the world starts recovering. So the balancing act, it would end up in the guidance we've given basically. Got it. I guess as a related question I think one of the themes we've seen in the space is convergence and that was actually true before COVID. So I mean particularly as customers go through a time when they got to think about perhaps consolidating some of the tools that they have are you seeing actually any benefit from that? I mean could there be a tailwind to the cross-sell motion for specific products? Just curious how you think about. This is definitely – like this was appealing to customers before COVID. It's as appealing if not more to customers now. Some customers might look into ways of rationalizing costs in the short term. So these are all opportunities. At this point none of these – we don't have data on any of these to be – to tell you whether it's going to be a big factor or not over the rest of the year. Look this is our strategy. We've been building towards that. So obviously in the long term we believe in it. Got it. Thanks so much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks. hi, guys. I'm curious in terms of the net new ARR that you added in the quarter how would you characterize how much of that is coming from kind of high-level CIO large complex transactions versus maybe some more kind of day-to-day orders that you get at a divisional or departmental level? Well the way we sell in general is always bottom up. Even in large enterprises even when we start the conversation at the CIO level and we end it to the CIO level, the adoption of the product is bottom up. And we start small. Even when we land – I mentioned earlier on the call like some six or seven figure land deal even when we land those deals these are still a small fraction of what the total opportunity looks like at these customers. And this represent bottom-up adoption and some deals that are going to grow significantly over time. So that's the way it used to work. That's still the way it's working as far as we can tell in Q2. That makes s ense. And then can you give us maybe some qualitative color on the mix of business in terms of you gave us the 75% that landed with two or more products but just give us some color in terms of the strength of infrastructure versus APM versus logging in the quarter. Well, I mean look they're all growing. Infrastructure alone would be one of the best SaaS companies around APM and logs. So if we single out those products – and look we don't really like to do that because as we like to say there's quite a bit of fungibility between the different products and which you attribute to one you could attribute to another. But the – those products are in hyper growth. They're growing a lot faster than that or used to grow when we were at the scale-up of those products. And that's still the case. That growth hasn't slowed down.
Synthetics is still growing much faster than we thought it would. And it's a great product for us. We're pleased with the initial uptake of NPM but it is still not material to our results. We mentioned it earlier but it's a product that has a higher friction than Synthetics for example to get adopted but it has a very long runway. So we're investing in that product.
We've seen some adoption of RUM. We started charging in March for some portion of it. So we started charging for a part of it that is – part of our customers' contract is committed as opposed to being usage driven. So it's still also not material to Q1 but we should see more of it in Q2. And the security product we haven't started charging for yet in Q1 we started in Q2. So we don't have anything to say about it yet. Sterling I think the trends have really continued. The net retentions were very consistent in Q1 to what they had been and also the contribution from usage and new products and cross-sell. So much of what we've been saying in the last two quarters has continued in Q1 with really strong contribution to net retention from both those effects of usage and cross-sell. Makes sense. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Thank you. The – if you – you talked about the net retention and the assumptions that you're making as the crisis kind of continues. Can you remind us – if there's going to be more churn then it's probably going to be more in the SMB space. Can you talk a little bit about your exposure there and what you're seeing so far? It's my first question.
And then on the billing side, can you remind us David like in terms of what's monthly versus annually versus where the quarterly biannually that you talked about just to get an idea about the mix. Thank you. Yes. I'll about SMB and maybe David can talk about the billing mix. So we actually – or ARR is as we discussed before is what split evenly between enterprise mid-market and SMB. But even within SMB we – most of that revenue comes from companies that are on the larger side and on very solid footing financially.
Some of them are publicly traded and tend to be closer to the 1000-employee limit there. We mentioned on the call that less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our revenue came from companies that are on the smaller side which is less than 100 employees.
If you look at our SMB customers, they're very diverse. And we're actually less exposed on the SMB side to some of the higher-risk categories around COVID. And so far we haven't seen a big change in trends. I mean, we did see a tiny uptick in churn in SMBs, but it's actually consistent with levels we've seen just a few quarters ago. So there's nothing out of the ordinary. And at the same time, we saw an increase of net retention for that same cohort of SMBs. So it has nothing conclusive there. We don't see anything that we didn't see before.
Now when we try to guide for the future, we have to try and guess where our exposure is going to be and what can be weaker. We'll have to guess that the SMBs are going to feel more pain and are going to be where we'll see more churn. And so that's what we've incorporated in our guidance. David, do you want to take the billing mix? Yes. And in billing two-thirds of our – of ARR is associated with annual commitments or greater. And three-quarters, when you add in the usage related to that so three-quarters of our billings are associated with annual commitments or longer. What we said before was, our average length of commitment went out slightly in the quarter resulting in an acceleration of RPO. And our average period of billing duration came in a little bit more resulting in the billings discussion. But about three-quarters are related to annual commitments or more. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks so much. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. And as well, I hope everybody at Datadog and everyone listening is doing okay these days. My first question I wanted to follow up on what Sanjit has asked and I think Raimo is alluding to as well. Just trying to understand the impact on the business from COVID. Specifically, if I hear your comments about the potential for deal slippage obviously with more pressure on new logo business and the downward pressure that you might see on net expansion to what extent are you seeing it coming versus just preparing for it? And maybe, if you could perhaps can you compare and contrast consumption trends versus pipeline progression and the conversions on that pipeline that you're seeing in March and into April? Do you want to go first Oli and I'll weigh in? Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So look it's for the most part we're guessing because it's too early in the quarter to actually have a good sense of what may slip or not. At the end of Q1, we did have a few deals that slipped and that were marked. The reason for slippage was uncertainty around COVID. And several of them have closed right after. And I would say it's not like every quarter there are a few deals that slip. And the number of deals that slipped in Q1 was actually not out of the ordinary compared to previous quarters. So we don't have really anything to quantify the effects we might see but we do anticipate that we will see some.
When it comes to usage, again, it's also a little bit more difficult to compare because some of the usage patterns have changed a little bit as companies have scrambled to reorganize. So there's a little bit less predictability in there, which is also why we're baking that into some of our guidance.
So overall, look, we do anticipate some uncertainty and some pressure on some fronts in Q2 and Q3. I would be worried, if that didn't happen. But we don't have anything that makes us particularly concerned in front of us right now. David, do you want to add anything? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Our pipeline remains consistent. We don't know as Oli said is – what is the harvesting percentage what's going to happen this quarter. So we think that our model given our model of land and expand and usage that were less dependent than other models on going to land in a large three-year deal, but we don't know in new logos particularly what's going to happen as the quarter progresses. The main request we've gotten so far has been some modest can you chunk our builds up a little bit. That's been probably what we've seen a little more. But again, it hasn't been a significant percentage of our ARR either at this point. Thanks very much. That's both very helpful. If I can follow up with just a quick housekeeping question for you David, RPO up 82% in the period I think is strong by just about any way you look at it. But to just put a finer point, can you give us a duration-adjusted RPO growth or even a current RPO growth? We don't release that. We're just making comments on the fact that, it was higher than the pro forma billing due to longer contract commitment duration in two and three year deals, but we haven't really commented and broken that up publicly. Okay, thanks for taking my questions, Dave. You’re welcome. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I'll echo the strong results this quarter. Your ability to sell two or more products is obviously impressive. I'm wondering if you can share maybe some examples of how some of your largest G2K customers are adopting APM and logging. And in particular when they do, are you seeing these customers migrate off of other vendors' APM and logging solutions? Or are they often run in parallel for a while? So we do have a number of G2K customers that are adopting APM and our logs. In all of those cases when we start, we don't actually replace whatever they were using on-prem because they're still using that. Their on-prem world is still separate from their cloud world which is the net new which is where we come in.
So we typically land usually with two or more products and we grow in that footprint in the cloud. We're still in most of these cases very early in that growth because those customers are very early in their migration to the cloud which is where we solidify our footprint.
And we basically set ourselves up to later -- much later offer standardization of the whole tool set on us as the majority of their footprint ends up being on the cloud. But we're still not there with most of these customers. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to make sure I understood churn a little bit better Oli. You noted earlier that you're not being impacted by workforce reductions. But when we think of higher level churns embedded in your guidance is that assumption that some customers might go out of business on the smaller side? Or might we see some seat-based contraction inside of existing customers at some point? So we don't sell per seat. So we don't -- there's no user-driven -- these are account-driven component to one billion. So that part doesn't affect us directly. What we might see is some effect from our customers contracting their infrastructure. But in most cases our customers actually have to keep that infrastructure up to serve their own customers. And there's a limit to what they can contract there. So that's not an effect we've seen so far.
I think we don't exactly know where the churn is going to come from if it comes. It's a fair assumption that a number of small businesses are going to disappear. We also see some medium and large businesses that are affected and we'll need some form of help or bailout to survive. We're all aware of that. So some of that might happen. So we want to be cautious. We want to be cognizant of the fact that if the economy as a whole is affected some of it is going to ripple to us considering the fact that we have a very broad-based customer base. And this is David. Yes we said -- as we said in the comments that we do have some new logo accumulation and some lower retention rates implied in the guidance. We said we haven't really seen that materially yet, but we're trying to be prudent relative to what might happen in the world. Well done. Thanks guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. I realize the security SKU is brand new, but just if you can just give us any color initially back from the field? And I have just a quick follow-up after that. Well we're actually very happy with the uptake there. It's we've had while the product was still in beta we had some customers that wanted to buy and they did buy and some customers that already adopted the product at scale. So that's very good.
Now it's still super early both in terms of the -- what's inside the product all of the feature set the integration and everything else also very early in the way we make customers or go to market for it. So for now we should assume that there's going to be a lot more investment and going to take us a lot more time to get these new products to interesting scale. And then just as a quick follow-up. Are you changing any of your hiring plans or product plans from here given everything that's gone on? Or are you still tracking to kind of original plan going into the year? We're tracking mostly to original plan. We've made a few adjustments for areas where it didn't make sense to hire for example things around organizing local marketing events or office management. Obviously that's not -- that's less of a topic when we don't have an office and you can't meet people in real life. But for everything else we stick to the plan. And we have ambitious plans. And we think it's actually a great time to be hiring and a great time to be building up our team.
The thing I warned about in the call earlier was that, it might take a bit longer for those investments to pay-off because the market might be a bit softer on the customer side. They might be more uncertainty. But we are – we think for us it's an opportunity to stand on the ground of our strong platform and the efficiency of our business. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Rebeck with Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks very much. David, when a customer comes to you and asks, as you said to chunk a payment up in smaller bite-size amounts, do you ask for anything in return, like a longer contract or anything along those lines? Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. We try -- we have a discussion with the contract -- with the customer. And we try to extend contract or do something around products. So we do that. But we're also here to grow with our clients. And what we care about given, what we've seen is keeping our clients and having them, grow with us over time. So we have a discussion. But we try to extend contract or get something else. Yeah. And I can comment on that. We're doing this on a case-by-case basis really. But we do it in the spirit of partnership with our customers. And that's what I mentioned in the call too, that we're co-investing not only in our product and our team. We're also investing in our customers. We're investing in relationships. We know some of them are going through a very difficult time. And we think there are some two-way partnerships to be built on that. Excellent, thanks very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks and congrats on the strong results. Can you break out the vertical exposure of your customer base? And perhaps more specifically, what the contribution is from some of the more macro-sensitive sectors, including travel and entertainment? And I have one follow-up question. Yes. Let me pull up my number. And call back. Yeah. Let me -- while Oli's doing, you're that. Do you want me to go or... Sure, yes. Go ahead. Yeah. We said, we have 10% or less that are subject to -- that are in the most exposed which are travel hospitality, dining and those types. So, about a 10% exposure and we have exposures on the other side to some of the work-from-home, collaboration and food deliveries and others. So, we're pretty diversified. We've always said we have a diversified customer base. And our concentration is not above 10% in those, impacted industries. Thanks guys. Just perhaps one more, you touched on it earlier in prior questions. But can you just give us some more qualitative insight, into your conversations with new potential customers, and the willingness of these customers to pursue new modern deployments, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment? Yeah. So actually, I can speak to that. So, so far these conversations are not any different. Obviously, there is some scrutiny on spending and cash outlays. In particular, everybody is careful about cash, in the face of uncertainty, which is why we discussed also some -- in some cases, different payment terms for some customers.
But the conversation so far as I'm saying, we actually see an interesting effect where some customers in very affected industries will reach out now. Because they actually have time to invest and prepare for the future because they are less -- they have less to operate on a day-to-day basis. So we've seen some of that happen.
It is anecdotal. There's not -- we can't tell that if any of that is actually going to come to fruition before the world's fast recovering. But we see some of that happening. In general, we're still early in the cycle still that, we don't really know if there's going to be -- if the impact will be really felt in Q2 and Q3 or not. But we've been careful, in the way we set guidance. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey guys. Can you hear me okay? Sorry. Yes. Thank you and congratulations for a great quarter. I guess I wanted to touch quickly on some of the product stuff. You obviously talked a little bit about the new Security Monitoring product, last quarter. It's fairly early days for that product. You weren't charging for it at the time.
But I'd love to understand. I think became it generally available towards April. Early traction early interest how is that playing out? And obviously security is a big part given remote access given everything else that's happening with COVID, just how that's going. So far so good, we -- the customers that have been -- part of the beta are using it and some of them have actually turned to paying customers, so some of the beta users are turning to paying customers already. So we're happy with the traction. But again, there's a lot more that needs to happen there.
One thing that's interesting to us is that, we've seen adoption from the -- both sides we were trying to bring together. We've seen adoption from dev and ops in one side, but also some security folks on the other side. So that's very interesting. And that's what we're shooting for. But again, still early, but a lot is going to happen to it. I'm sure we'll talk about it again in future calls. Okay. And then one quick question on the pricing environment. Obviously, given the conversation with Dynatrace and others AppDynamics, New Relic, et cetera. You view it as kind of the most attractive price point out there. How often would you say pricing is an important driver of the conversation especially in this environment? Like are people -- are customers really thinking about pricing right now? And is that something that comes up as a decision point right now? Would love to understand sort of what the sales guys are seeing in these conversations. Yes. So in general, we -- the way we differentiate is through the integrated platform and the outcomes we give through our products and less so the pricing that we have. We do have a pricing model that disaggregate certain elements so that our customers can align the price they pay with the value they get, and especially when it comes to matching data and logs and things like that.
I would say, we haven't seen any changes in that environment. The one thing that we think is might be an advantage is that we also -- we operate by starting small and growing with our customers. Our model is not predicated on very large multi-year upfront deals. And that's something that is attractive to customers especially in an environment where they're trying to manage cash. Yes. Obviously, that's an issue given cash constraints. But you obviously have small SMB exposure as you talked about today. It's interesting you haven't seen those conversations, but appreciate the color. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations on running such a tight ship over there. So Oli, you've been doing this for 20 years a little more. I would love to hear your thoughts on how you think this recession is different and maybe similar to 2008, 2009. Pat, that's a hard question. Well, I think the one thing I remember from the previous one is that you don't really know where they're going until they're over. So that's why we've been prudent. Another thing that we wanted to communicate through this call is that we -- look our business is very healthy. We see growth. We -- from everything we can tell the drivers that made us successful so far are still there and everything is working.
At the same time, we've been growing 80%, 85%, 87% now year-over-year. And for that to work you pretty much need every -- to fire on every single cylinder, right? Everything needs to come together. And this almost guarantee that not everything will come together in the end if part of the world is impacted by COVID. And we're trying to be cognizant of that. Great. And then David if I can ask you one RPO growth has been sort of in the same ballpark as revenue the last couple of quarters 3% less in Q4, 5% less in Q1. Yes. Is that a reasonable way for us to think about it going forward? Or should that diverge? Well, as I mentioned we've had extension of average contract. We've had a number of companies who we developed long-term partnerships with and they've wanted to -- and together commit out to the door three years. So I think that's going to depend much like on billings as to the timing of those contract renewals. And I think you'll see in some period that happened and in other periods not mainly because of individual contracts that are up for renewal during that period or extension. Okay. Great. Thank you both very much. Thank you. And our last question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in the call and congratulations on the results. I just want to ask about what trends you're seeing in terms of Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring. Do you see these as more displacement opportunities? Or are these greenfield markets? And I was also wondering if you -- how big do you think that the market opportunity is around this given perhaps a different pricing point than your core infrastructure and APM products? Yes. So the strategy there is the same as with the rest of the product which is we start from cloud environment, which tend to be new. In most cases, our customers are using other products. In some cases, they did. But the vast majority of the cases is net new in cloud environment. And the way we charge for those products is also aligned with the rest of our pricing philosophy, which is -- it's charge per usage, while giving the control back to the customer so they can align the price they pay and the value they get. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up. Are there any international trends that are worthwhile noting in terms of just specific regions pockets of areas of strength or just other changes that you're thinking about in terms of aligning resources in particular international regions? No. I mean at this point, we see success -- some success in all regions even though some are fairly recent. Even when you think of impact of COVID, we've had -- I mean that's sort of everywhere, but we don't have any -- we don't have anything that makes us think that any region is going to behave very differently from the other at this point. I'll give you an example. We even closed some new logo deals with large enterprises in Italy, while the whole country was completely locked down. So there's no -- there's really no data point to tell us anything is going to be different in any part of the world today. Got it. Thanks very much. Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. All right. Well thank you. In closing, I'd like to repeat that we are very pleased with the results for Q1. We continue to invest in our long-term opportunity and we believe we are very well positioned for it. In what has been an unprecedented time for all of us, I want to thank Datadog employees for their dedication and resilience. And of course, I want to thank our customers for their trust in supporting their businesses through a challenging time. Thank you all.

With that I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you, AJ and thank you all for joining us today. Before discussing the results of the quarter, I want to proudly report that together with our employees, we raised over $1 million for charities supporting COVID release, as well as organizations working to dismantle the systemic discrimination experienced by black communities. We are living in unprecedented times for many reasons, and we want to do our part to help.
And as always, Datadog is committed to supporting diversity and inclusion within our company and communities. Now turning to Q2 results, we are happy to report another quarter of strong growth and demonstrated financial efficiencies. Execution was strong during challenging times, including robust new logo generation and continued platform adoption. While we are pleased with our execution in the quarter, we did experience some impact to the rate of usage growth of our customers related to the micro environment.
While this macro uncertainty remains in the near-term, we continue to believe that this environment accentuate the need to be digital first and agile and confirms the cloud as the best path to achieve these outcomes over the long-term. And we see evidence of this in growing overall demand in the form of new customers and new use cases for existing customers. To summarize, Q2 at a high level, revenue was $140 million, an increase of 68% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range.
We ended the quarter with 1,015 customer with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 71% from last year. These customers generate about 75% of our ARR. We have about 12,100 customers, which represent growth of 37% from about 8,800 last year. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted on newer products. So we are continuing to deliver high growth at scale.
Now looking at Q2 in more detail. New logo generation was robust in the quarter as new logo ARR grew both from last quarter and year-over-year and gross new customers additions matched to the record set in Q1. We saw companies of all sizes and geographies prioritize cloud migration and digital transformation. For instance in the quarter, we had a few small yet notable new logo wins from two global auto chains, an amusement park chain, a large US university and a European airline. These wins showed that even in the face of challenging times for these customers, transforming to ensure business resilience and longevity is a top priority.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q2, 68% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 40% a year ago, we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products and I would add that over 15% of our customers are now using four or more products, while we had zero last year. We are also very pleased with the uptake of our newest products in a short period of time, with Synthetics, RUM, NPM and Security all released over the last year.
We are winning in the market, because we are cloud native, our support of cloud and other ephemeral architectures is more important than ever as a rapid change from work from home has demonstrated the limitation of legacy infrastructure. And we believe recent events will accelerate the migration to the cloud as the economy improves. We win because we offer the broader solution with end-to-end visibility from backend infrastructure, all the way through to the end user experience and now security as well. And we win because we offer a truly integrated platform, voicing OpenView into the IT stack.
Now, as we mentioned earlier, while execution was strong, the macro environment did have some impact on our top line results, and in particular on growth of existing customers. Our customers continue to grow usage of our platform in Q2, but the rate of this growth was below the trends we saw before the pandemic. This dynamic was primarily seen in our larger customers, who already had sizable cloud environment. Given macro uncertainty, we saw these customers look to conserve cash where they still could and therefore, optimize the consumption of cloud infrastructure.
On the flip side, smaller customers and large enterprises that are earlier in their cloud journey continue to see stronger growth. To put it plainly, customers with large cloud deals from AWS, Azure or GCP look for short-term savings. Note that this is not a new motion, as we see many enterprises go through these optimization exercises on a regular basis. What was unusual this quarter was to see a large number of companies going through it at the same time. I would also note that while these customers are the greatest scale in the cloud, they mostly remain at a low penetration relative to their overall IT environment. Therefore, these customers continue to have a long runway of growth in their cloud adoption over time.
Lastly, while we do not want to get into the habit of providing intra-quarter update, I'd like to provide some commentary on what we saw in July. Given the unique macro seconds ended. We saw over the last month, a notable improvement in usage growth relative to Q2, driven by broad-based strength across our customer base. It is however too soon to know, if this growth will sustain given the macro environment. As a result and while we are encouraged by these trends, we remain prudently conservative in our outlook for the remainder of the year, which David will speak to.
As a reminder, we have both a subscription and usage based revenue model and the growth of our revenue is relative to the growth of our customer's cloud footprint and data volume. Finally, to bookend this topic, I'm very proud of the performance of our go-to-market teams during the challenging times. As we are executing well against what we can control and our teams are delivering record levels of new logos and product cross-sell. Next on to R&D, we continue to make significant investments to rapidly deliver innovation. We have a proven track record of success introducing new products and we see many new opportunities to expand our portfolio.
For example, we recently announced the general availability of private locations for Synthetics, which enables dev and ops teams to proactively test internal applications that are not accessible from the public Internet. We also acquired Undefined Lab, a provider of observability for dev and test workflows. This will enable Datadog to be injected earlier in the software lifecycle starting before code is even committed to a central repository. And this will equip customers with better tracking of continuous integration and deployment workflows and enable them to identify issues before reaching production.
Other continued product innovations include the general availability of the Datadog mobile app to provide engineers with access to the alerts and dashboards on the go, support for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to enable streaming logs directly from AWS services to Datadog; and the preview release of the Datadog IoT agent to provide visibility into Internet of Things devices. We have also added and improved a number of integrations including AWS 1-click deploy, HiveMQ, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast.
As we keep investing in R&D, we plan for continued rapid pace of innovation and we'll be showcasing some of our newer products at our Annual User Conference, Dash, which is held online next week on August 11. Switching gears a bit, we recently achieved FedRAMP authorization for low-impact SaaS, and Datadog is now fully available in the FedRAMP marketplace. We continue to build out our public sector go to market motion and while it is likely to take some time. We are excited about this long-term opportunity. Now let's talk briefly about several wins in the quarter. First, we had a seven-figure of sale with a large FinTech company.
With Datadog, this customer has been able to move from multiple disparate monitoring tools using a single platform for all three pillars of observability. This allowed them to refocus engineering teams on building new features and they expect more than $1 million in savings from consolidating disparate monitoring logging vendors into Datadog. Another seven figure expansion came from a European automotive company, which is modernizing and adopting Microsoft Azure. Through adoption of Datadog Infrastructure Monitoring APM and NPM, their teams are now collaborating on a share platform and are moving to an increasingly agile development model.
Next, we saw a large entertainment platform that had been using more and more of our products, commit to over $10 million in ARR. This company has made a decision to increase investment in observability and their use of Datadog both with new products and by scaling up on existing products. And we also mentioned a high six figure land deal with a leading asset manager, which is now using us for infrastructure monitoring APM and logs as well as Synthetics and early adoption of security.
And last, we had a six figure upsell to a seven figure ARR with a social networking platform that has seen tremendous growth during the pandemic. At record levels of scale, they can use Datadog to quickly drill down into any sale request and easily identify layers, this company is now using all three pillars, including Synthetics, RUM and NPM, and has standardized monitoring on Datadog. Now, moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we remain very excited about our market opportunity. Recent events have made one thing very clear, it is more important than ever to be a digital first business and the cloud is the best path to achieve this outcome.
We continue to believe Datadog is the primary beneficiary of these trends and remains very well positioned to win in the market. In the near-term, the macro environment is likely to continue to cause uncertainty, but our focus remains on executing on executing against our strategic priorities, which have not changed. First, we are building on our strong track record of innovation by introducing new products, entering new categories and continuing to improve existing solutions. Second, we continue to hire rapidly in R&D and are pursuing talent that would not otherwise get in the market. And third, we are aggressively expanding our go-to-market globally and into newer channel. We are very confident that we continue to sustain strong growth both in the near-term and over time.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong second quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $140 million, up 68% year-over-year, against the challenging compare. Execution was strong with robust new logo generation and continued platform traction. While the macro environments did pressure usage of existing customers.
To provide some more context. First, in Q2 we strong -- we saw strong new logo additions with robust contributions from both enterprise and commercial sales channels and sequential growth of new logo ARR. Execution against our platform has been very strong with 68% of customers now using two or more products versus just 40% a year ago driven by both lands and cross-selling. In the second quarter, our dollar based net retention was once again above 130% for the 12th consecutive quarter.
We saw continued growth of our existing customers, driven by both increased usage of existing solutions and robust cross-selling to newer solutions. Our net retention rate, which remains best-in-class above 130% did however decline from Q1. As Olivier discussed, macro factors pressured usage increases. To add some detail. First, while existing customers did grow, the rate of growth was below pre-pandemic levels. This was primarily seen from our larger customers with a greater scale in the cloud, who experienced business pressures and softer save in the near-term by slowing down their consumption.
Additionally, one dynamic, which we discussed as a possibility on our Q1 call is that we did see the normalization of some spike usage from Q1. In March, we had a number of customers such as streaming media vendors, scale rapidly in the face of COVID. Over the following months, some of these customers were able to optimize usage and save on cloud spending amid budget pressures and normalization of business activities. Next, some customers such as delivery and media companies, have continued to see elevated demand and therefore have continued to meaningfully grow their Datadog usage.
Lastly, we saw some of our COVID impacted customers reduce usage. As a reminder, these customers such as those in hospitality and travel contribute less than 10% of our ARR and therefore, they were a mild track detractor. Lastly, churn was a bit elevated related to the most hard hit COVID customers, but better-than-expected. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Performance of our SMB customer base has been robust including stable dollar based churn and continued rapid growth year-over-year.
Now turning to billings, which was $160.1 million and up 62% year-over-year relatively in line with revenue growth. Entering the quarter. As we discussed on the last call, we thought it was possible some customers would seek to renegotiate terms or slow payments but that did not happen in a material way, pointing to the importance of our solution. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $287 million, up 53% year-over-year. We did not see a material change in billings durations in Q2.
We did see some slight shortening of contract duration year-over-year related to large multiyear contracts closed in the year ago quarter. We continue to have great success in closing annual committed deals, which remains our strategic focus. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenues based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage.
Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $111.8 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% also last quarter and 75% in the year ago period. Year-over-year improvement of gross margin was driven by efficient use in our cloud hosting. Our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter with an acceptable ranges, as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies.
R&D expense was $38.3 million or 27% of revenue, compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D as Olivier mentioned, including high growth of our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue continues to outpace even our substantial investments and we did have some leverage from T&E and overhead savings related to work from home. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D going forward.
Sales and marketing expenses were $45.7 million or 33% of revenue, compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was the first full quarter of no in-person trade shows for marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the event's budget to advertising and other lead generating activities. It is not so on a one-for-one ratio.
G&A expense was $12.5 million or 9% in revenue, in line with the same ratio a year ago quarter. Operating income was $15.3 million or an 11% operating margin, compared to a loss of $5 million and a negative 7% margin in the year ago period. Beyond the improvement in gross margin and revenues outpacing investments, the reduction in travel and entertainment and facilities overhead contributed to the operating margin. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $17.5 million or $0.05 per share based on 331 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Note that our non-GAAP net income, does not include the $5.6 million non-cash benefit related to payroll taxes. We have a very efficient business model and experience a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered four consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue investments aggressively in R&D and go to market.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, which includes the $641 million of proceeds from our convertible note issuance during the quarter, net of issuance costs and the cap call transaction. Cash flow from operations was $24.7 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $18.6 million in the quarter for a margin of 13%.
Free cash flow includes an approximately $4.4 million outflow related to the conclusion of our first employee stock purchase program. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year 2020. We are pleased with our execution and ability to drive new sales in an uncertain macro environment. As discussed, we did see some lower growth in usage from our existing customers in Q2, due to the overall slowing of the economy.
As Olivier noted, however, in July, we experienced an improvement in usage trends relative to Q2 that were closer to our pre-pandemic historical levels. However, it is too soon to know if this will prove to be sustainable and given the lack of clarity of economic trends, we are assuming usage growth of existing customers below pre-COVID growth rates. Additionally, while we have not yet seen a material impact to our new sales, we think it is prudent to expect some impact in the second half given that the macro backdrop.
Beginning with the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $143 million to $145 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 50% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to an income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 per share based on approximately 333 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now for the full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $566 million to $572 million, which represents a 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $34 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share based on approximately 332 million of fully -- weighted average fully diluted shares. A few things to take into account in our guidance. First, when evaluating our quarterly growth rates, it is important to consider the accelerated growth rates in the second half of 2019 creating more challenging comps.
Next, while we see continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top end of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability. Next, as I mentioned earlier, our intention continues to be to invest meaningfully, including aggressive hiring in R&D and sales and marketing and we have not changed our plans during COVID.
Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2.4 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including interest income in our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expenses of our convertible debt. Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but have a tax provision related to our international entities, we expect a tax provision of approximately $350,000 per quarter. Note, that our share count forecast for Q3 and the full-year are diluted given that we expect to be non-GAAP net income breakeven profitable for both periods.
To summarize, we are pleased with our execution during a very challenging time. While the macro environment has impacted our topline results in the near-term, we believe the current environment will prove to be a catalyst for digital transformation and cloud migration over the long-term. And we are very well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of those trends. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi and thank you for taking the question. And I really appreciate all of the detail that you guys provided in a rough environment and usage, that's very helpful context. So I guess, maybe to start with, Oli, you sort of singled out the sort of primary factor and correct me if I'm wrong, but the primary factor being large customers that have large scale cloud deployments. And would sort of just makes sense, right? It's sort of a large, large numbers impact there as well. What gives you kind of confidence Oli that you think this is a temporary pause with those customers versus something more sustained? Is there any sort of customer conversations you're having -- or was it just kind of like the secular tailwinds of digital transformation. I just want to get a sense of what gives you guys the confidence that in these large customer cohorts that it's more of a digestion period after a period of strong growth versus more -- a more sustained downturn? Yes. So the first thing I'd say is, it's something we've seen before, it happens from time to time like companies ramp up their cloud consumption at some point, their bills going up and they ask themselves can we optimize. And look we've done that too as a company. If you've seen our gross margins. For example, go up from last year that was fairly similar in that respect. What happened there is that everybody has the same idea at the same time like everybody ask themselves, how can we save some cash.
The word came pretty much every single company effected down by COVID, because of the uncertainties, cash have to be conserved. One of the good things about cloud is that a lot of it is opex and a lot of it is -- still had to be paid -- has to be paid in the next bill, it's not some costs, so there are still savings to be made. If you take action, so that's what we saw happen. In terms of it, continuing on that, again it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the near-term, but in the broader scheme of thing, companies are still moving to the cloud, but new companies are moving to the cloud that were not before and we've mentioned that on the call. That we've had a number of asset -- key companies that started using us right now, when you think of hotel chains and amusement parks and things like that.
We see though -- in the July data and even some of the June data that companies that have optimized their cloud infrastructure. And by the way, in general what we mean by that is not that call Datadog to cut their bill to cut data bill, is that they're trying to figure out what they could shutdown or optimize on the Amazon side, or on the Google side on the Azure side. And so while we see some decrease of their data volume or infrastructure side view over -- period of a few weeks, but then what we see after that is that they start going again, because then their team keeps building and they keep deploying, keeps having customer etc, etc. So it's not an exercise that is new or unexpected. I think what's different now is that, it's a -- it makes sense for all of these companies to be at the same time and it just happened. Understood. That makes total sense. And then David, if I think about the guidance, right? 68% growth this quarter, and I look at Q3, the high-end is roughly around 50% and the Q4 is roughly around 40%, at least by my math. I think what would be helpful to understand the underlying assumptions behind that guidance? And particularly around those usage trends, right? So, I know there was a -- prior to COVID, there was a significant amount of customers that were sort of overspending relative to their committed usage. If you could sort of give us like the pre-level of usage, anyway to sort of quantify that -- although it looks like post-COVID, to understand the underlying assumptions behind your guidance. Because I think what your guidance assumes is that some of the weaker usage trends persist for the second half? And so anyway to frame that out I think would be very helpful in terms of understanding that, the guidance. Yes, I think that's right. We have our guidance throughout our history as a public company been fairly prudent and our forward-looking usage and implicit net retention and we're particularly cognizant of that given COVID, most of our guidance has conservative assumptions in that and we continue to do that. I think as we said, we had strong cross sell. And so we see a continued adoption of the platform, which is a good sign and as far as the usage. The more variable usage we saw as Oli just mentioned some constraints. So we tried to use conservative assumptions going forward in our guidance. Understood. I'll leave the floor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Okay, thanks very much for taking my questions. For Olivier, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on pricing, particularly in light of -- or the convergence that we're seeing going on within the observability space. I remember with your log product when you launched it, you had a pretty disruptive pricing strategy where you were charging at very low price for ingestion and you're letting the customers pay just for the logs that they actually want to index. And now we're seeing other players in the space give away entire aspects of their platform for free and creating free tier. So I guess the question is how do you see your pricing model evolving if at all in time and as you keep up the industry leading pace of innovation. Do you see the ability to even raise price as you deliver more value to your customers? Thanks. Yes. So I think we are -- so we are very careful about pricing, in that the way we do it is, first of all, we encourage having the maximum deployments with our customers, meaning that's why we don't charge by the user, we want absolutely everybody to use it. And then we want to make sure that customers have the levers to align pricing to able to pay to Datadog with value they get. And in our case, that means, having differentiated pricing for very different parts of our platform, because not every single gigabytes of data that is being sent to us has the same value to the customer and represents the same amount of processing and other things online. So we try to align that.
Right now, we're happy with our pricing model. It works well in the market. It gives customers the flexibility, but look we've had our pricing model evolve over time, it will probably still evolve in the future. We believe in our ability to winning the market -- at least winning the market and give a more and more value you have pricing power in the long-term and that's where we are today, we want to be in the future. I think when you -- when your only tool is to play on pricing, like it's usually bad news. It means you can't actually win based on the quality of your products alone. Understood. Thank you. And maybe just follow-up for David, would you be able to share some more detail about some of the trends that you saw by customer segment during the quarter, as it relates to net expansion or good churn or any metrics you could share, I guess across SMB and mid-market and our enterprise customers. Thank you. Yes, that was one of the surprises we had very stable gross churn, dollar based gross churn and it's very similar to what we have discussed in the last call that all over the metrics and growths are in the 90s with enterprise tending to be towards the upper part of that range and SMB towards the lower, but all of them strong and in the 90s. We really didn't see very much disruption from that. And similarly, we saw net retention rates come down, we said a little more at the larger end because of this concentration on costs. But all within the same type of bands, we've had since we've become a public company. Great, thanks very much. Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So in terms of the macro impacts and the slowing of usage of existing customers. Is there any evidence that you've seen of some of those customers slowing the usage of your tools, but supplementing it with maybe the cloud platform tools or something else or they're just slowing the usage and that's it? No, I think what we've seen mostly is they're slowing the usage of the cloud infrastructure that's directly related to how we recognize new revenue. So that's what we thought. To put in another terms, they use less Amazon instances or containers or less Azure instances and containers. And that's -- that would end up move the needle for us. And I should say, this is something that we used to see it in the other way, we used to see, like the way we sell it, we send to customers and they're still early in their cloud transition and we grow with them as they grow.
What happened this quarter is that their growth slowed overall during the quarter, they still grew and they are still going to grow and what we said in the call is -- in July, so towards the June, we saw some acceleration of the growth again, but we want to remain prudent considering all the uncertainties there is right now in terms of, how long the COVID crisis is going to last and what's going to be the impact in various parts of the economy. We remain prudent in what we think is going to happen in the near-term. Understood. And then one follow-up, how would you characterize the ramping of the new sales resources that you've hired over the last couple of quarters of ramping at the same pace that you've traditionally seen, are they ramping faster, slower? We haven't seen any changes there. And everything that that is within control of the sales team actually worked pretty well. We mentioned during the call but -- so we had a record level of new logos, both in terms of numbers and in terms of revenue. We had a record level of new product attach. And this is where our sales team spend their time on. The growth of customers once they are set up every single month, it did only partially related to the world of [indiscernible] like we don't have full control over that, which is also why when we set expectations around our net retention initially, we said we're going to sell at 130%, because we don't fully control that number.
A great part of this is driven by the rate of migration to the cloud and the rate at which customers are scaling to the cloud. Again, we're very early in that transition and customers are going to keep transitioning for much longer time, they keep scaling and we see that they only wanted to do that more now they see the impact of COVID on their business and the need to transform. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis. In the near-term, we don't exactly know where that's going. Understood. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mr. Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Brad Zelnick. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask -- can you help us understand a little bit more the relative size or recent attach rates of your APM and log management solution, both of which I think you mentioned last quarter were growing faster than the overall business. So that remain the case in this recent quarter? Yes. So they are both in hyper growth. So the picture hasn't changed a lot since the last time we talked. The infrastructure iPhone would still be a great public company, logs and APM are still in hyper growth not growing much faster than Datadog grows at this scale and the other products that are smaller and earlier are also growing extremely fast right now. So we -- overall we're fairly happy with those. And the attach rates and their contribution to net retention, has been very similar to the trends that we've talked about last time. So we continue to have increasing number of customers using the platform and there -- what they're spending on the additional components of the platform continues to grow in hyper growth. Yes, which is important to understand. The signs of active demand are really strong, whether it's new logo, new products that we -- that rate is actually up from what they've been before and we keep -- this keeps growing over time. So all that is great. The one thing that's been a detractor this quarter has been I would say the passive consumption. I don't like the word passive, because it sounds like we're not doing anything, and customer is not doing anything, but it's something that not directly related to an actual customer they are taking with us today. Thanks, that's helpful color. And then if I could building on Chris's question from earlier and appreciating that the majority of your lands are Greenfield. How do you think your -- one of your competitor's recent pricing changes and packaging changes will impact your ability to cross sell APM into your customer base? And overall, what do you think that the medium or long-term implications are for your business as you know this one competitor in particular seems to be focused on competing more aggressively on price and total cost of ownership at this point?Yes, so for this kind of changes like we -- we always have to keep an open mind, while we see, what can work and not work.
At the same time, look we don't see that having a major impact on us, because we don't actually, our business as you said is mostly Greenfield and you saw today on the strength of our individual product that get tied together in a platform, and there is no problem with our customers adopting our products, little by little. Like they can adapt as little as they want as APM, as little as they want as log and that of their infrastructure, or as little as they want Synthetics, that's not an issue, that's already something we have. We actually give them differentiated pricing that tells that is more tailored to the value they agreed to get for each of those product. So I don't see anything very disruptive there or anything very different. So again from our end, there is no, it won't be a change there. Yes, so for this kind of changes like we -- we always have to keep an open mind, while we see, what can work and not work. At the same time, look we don't see that having a major impact on us, because we don't actually, our business as you said is mostly Greenfield and you saw today on the strength of our individual product that get tied together in a platform, and there is no problem with our customers adopting our products, little by little.
Like they can adapt as little as they want as APM, as little as they want as log and that of their infrastructure, or as little as they want Synthetics, that's not an issue, that's already something we have. We actually give them differentiated pricing that tells that is more tailored to the value they agreed to get for each of those product. So I don't see anything very disruptive there or anything very different. So again from our end, there is no, it won't be a change there. All right. Thank you for the color. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thank you. Quick question from me. So you mentioned about like this slowing usage in the public cloud. I mean, like the one benefit we have is that we see Azure and Amazon and AWS then report numbers before you. And so in the way, you were always seen as a little bit of a derivative of those and if I look at AWS growth slow down, Azure slow down. I am just wondering, like they almost -- you almost seem more directly in terms of their growth numbers. But in terms of directionally related. Is that something that you're paying attention to as well, because it seems like there seems to be a correlation here? Well there is definitely a correlation, and we don't call it exactly with them, right, because they have different product portfolios and some of these tied to what we do today, the kind of the products that we already have for our customers to consume. But the -- what I will say is we understand the dynamics of what happened to these top providers. We saw it happened to these -- to their customers basically, which is they try to save for the next deal, because every million dollar counts in big companies right now.
And before they know where their prices is going, they want to make sure they do everything they can. So we have -- we have quality today. And the one thing I will say is, we are growing a lot faster than the cloud providers, because we keep adding more products and we're still underpenetrated in the market. So we are growing a lot faster than they are. And we are still growing faster even in more recent quarters. Yes, exactly, no. No. Exactly yes, and that's, true. The -- and then the other question I had is on that subject. But in theory the one offsets you have is like one is consumption usage and there's not that much you can do about it. On the other hand, you mentioned some stats around product uptake etc. Have you taken any action, you kind of change or the incentivized sales force or a push more towards more up selling and cross-selling of other products. Or is this something look we are writing it up, because like COVID is there for everyone, you saw some better trends in July or you taking extra action here? No, we didn't change anything. The sales incentives are the same. The way we sell, we have the teams to do is the same. So we haven't changed anything to the -- the way we proceed. The -- we're doing right now is working, right. What we said earlier is, we did bring the right numbers of new logos, the right numbers of product cross-sell that was our focus before, that's still our focus today. The rest, the growth in usage will come because the transition into digital businesses move to the cloud is not going to stop. Yes, it makes sense. Perfect, thank you. Welcome. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. It's Dan Bergstrom for Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. Wondering about linearity in the quarter, given call-outs around the macro and then large enterprise, you provided some color in July. That was helpful, but anything else from a linearity perspective in the quarter to note or maybe different than what you expected? Yes. So this quarter was actually. I mean, David, I hope you don't -- let's say, if I take a numbers question. But... No. Go ahead. The way the scope that this quarter was a little bit different in that what we saw from early July was fairly consistent with what we had before in Q1. So we saw good growth and great behavior on the logos, which is what we discussed in last call. Sorry, I mentioned, not July -- April. The first few weeks of April were very good growth and new logos. Our new logos remain for the rest of the quarter. But what we saw is towards the end of April and then the full month of May, we had much lower growth.
And then things recovered -- had started recovering in June, so growth was going up in June, and is recovering further in July. So these are the trends we've seen. Now, so this is what we saw past quarter, it was a lot noisier than what we used to. Like we're used to having very consistent numbers month over month. We can't really tell whether in the near-term, we will see some return to the previous normal or if we'll still see some oscillation as the state of the economy and other things provoke the same emotions in our customers. Great thanks helpful. And then Security Monitoring that's been generally available here for a little over three months. Just curious of initial reception from customers and security engineers. I know, it's a strong demand in beta. And then maybe where should we think about you heading with security? Certainly, a long runway left there? Yes. So we -- now if look, it's still super early right, it's a very, very early product, it has some very focused use cases to start with for some very focused types of customers. We're very happy with the uptake that we did get a good start in terms of customers planning to use it and pay for it. But again, super, super early. So I think maybe we'll talk about it some more in the future when it becomes more material and we have -- when we have more products to talk about there, but we are -- we say we're excited, but still early, still a lot of work to do. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Rebeck from Stifel. Your line is now open. David, I know you don't guide to billings. But I believe looking through my notes next quarter, you had some difficult comps with pretty significant contracts that paid up last 3Q, any color on that would be super helpful. Thank you. We didn't have that and what we -- we didn't present the pro forma, because it wasn't as impactful. We did say in RPOs we had the multi-year contracts, and a quarter ago, which were more concentrated than we had in creating RPO, but it didn't affect the billings numbers that much. And so there was nothing to point out. Okay, and no issue for 3Q, as we look forward? Sorry, I can't hear you. No issues with? Sorry, any issues for 3Q with difficult comps from the year before? Yes, we haven't -- nothing that we are pointing out on this call. So we -- nothing that we wanted to point out. Okay, thanks very much. Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is now open. Well good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on the go-to-market strategy, you talked about -- you haven't really changed anything, but I'm just wondering, as you continue to innovate rapidly and roll out these new products. Are you running into new buyers or new personas within organizations. And how do we think about the implications of that whether you might need to either make more investments or maybe change your strategy over time? Yes. You're thoroughly right. I think on the -- for the bulk of our product portfolio. We still talk to buyers that are going to be the same or working the same way, for everything that relates to observability I will say. When it comes to security, in some cases, now we are starting to see some different buyers.
So today, we are still selling the same way. I mean, the security product is focused enough in terms of the customers we're going after that it works that way, but it's something that we're monitoring, it's possible that we'll make changes in the future to that motion. Nothing yet, we'll get more data, we'll get more and we'll see more how the product behave and how the customers behave as we keep expanding the target audience for that product. But that's something that we're aware of, and we're monitoring. Okay, great. Just as a follow-up, could you elaborate on how you're thinking about the opportunity for the private locations for Synthetic Monitoring product. I mean is this essentially a new way to leverage your technology for employee use? Or how do you think about the opportunity around that? Yes, I think it's more for all of the internal services that are being exposed. In fact, companies that don't have a web safety UI. One of the -- in fact as many great advantage is but for me it's more difficult to go and reaching to test some endpoints that are not exposed to the Internet. So that solves that.
So it allows customers to put probably inside their own networks to automatically test and verify their APIs and their web application, but it also allows them to install probs in a networks they might manage or their -- or that their employees might be using for example, they might deploy that at either a cable providers or basically cloud providers things that we -- we're not hosted in as Datadog, but they want to monitor it directly. So it opens a whole range of possibilities for them. Great. Well, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Your line is now open. Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Bhavan Suri. You announced the launch of your formal Partner Network in January, which expands support for partners via things like go to market collateral, self-training for implementation, opportunity registration, partner locator listing. Can you talk about early interest across partner categories in your near and medium term channel strategy. And how important of a growth lever, do you see this channel being over time? And at least qualitatively, can you talk about how it's been impacted by the macro environment. Thank you. Thanks. So, yes, so we've -- since it's a fairly recent program for us. We've had great uptake like we signed up for large number of partners, actually larger than we thought we would. I don't think we've communicated that number publicly. So I will not do it today. But it's been off to a strong start. I think we're working on making sure we have the right process in place, so we can enable those partners and develop them, so not enough to just be a partner, but there are different levels of partnerships, that are also going to have different expectations in terms of what they provide to us, we will provide to them.
And so we're working on promoting for partners to -- for different levels right now. So far we've seen some interesting outputs on that. So we've closed deals, large deals, much earlier than we thought through partners. And we've done that in multiple regions. We haven't seen a specific impact on COVID just because that partner network is still new, that it's growing very fast, no matter what. And we can focus on the partners that want to grow now and that have opportunities now as opposed to maintaining the large base of existing partners. So far with the early plus signs, but a lot more to do. That's very helpful. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit more on your international performance this quarter. Are there any specific regions where you're seeing particular strength. And additionally, could you talk about your plans for international investment this year and where you maybe see the most opportunity? Thanks. David, do you want to take this one? Yes. We are continuing as we've talked about before, to build out regions either when we get to critical mass and have a successful sales team or when we're landing in new territories, so we're continuing the same plan we had which is to build out Asia complete, the build out of EMEA, as well as to expand in some areas like Latin America. We saw good performance as we've talked about before in the second quarter in EMEA on the back of the build outs we had done, and as we said all along, we're earlier in Asia, building out teams and filling out teams for the first time. So we'll continue that as part of our plan in the remainder of the year. One thing that's interesting is that the pandemic is hitting different parts of the world at different times. So we have these -- very possible to get turned out and turned off at different times and we've seen that through Q2 basically. Again, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in Q3 with respect to that. Okay, that's great, thanks for the call. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. Hey, Oliver, I wanted to ask about the Undefined acquisition, can you help us frame the opportunity for observability in the application testing spaces. I guess, how should we think about the usage patterns in development environments relative to production environments? Yes, so what's very interesting with Undefined is that they focus completely on what happens when developers check their own codes first on their own machine and then to share Naxi ITD process until it ends up being deployed in production. So it's not an area where we've been present before it, we haven't been typically used with developers on coding their machine before they commit anything towards shared. So that's new for us.
All of us to be closer to the developer, closer to the clients in many ways and also allows us to really get extremely high flexibility information for what happens from the time the code is committed to all the way through the release of production. So very good change level with there. So we are super excited about it, because it's a company that built a great product in a short amount of time and we are very excited about the -- about building a common product together. Right now, we are busy, that we're planning to sunset the [indiscernible] and to rebuild in the data platform to have it being maximally integrated and the team is hard at towards that right now. Okay, got it Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Sec. Your line is now open. Thank you for getting me in. So Oli, I'd like to ask you pretty much the same question, I asked you last quarter, which was -- you've been doing this for 20-years, you've seen a number of sort of slowdowns in the economy. How does this point feel in comparison? And then just to remind you, last time you said that the one thing you've learned was that you don't really know where it's going, until it's over. So do you still feel the same way or what have you learned? Yes, I think, we knew, like this thing we knew last time was that we wouldn't exactly know what would happen. We had some ideas and some of the things we thought would happen -- did happen, some others happened a little bit differently. So when we thought about Q2 back in Q1, we thought we might see elevated churn. We thought we might see certain parts of our customer base being much more affected than others. And it's not exactly what happened. We actually, didn't see the churn we're expecting to see, but we saw a broader slowdown among a certain category of our largest current customer.
I mean in retrospect, you can explain easily, you understand the behavior, you see what's happening. And it makes sense. I think predicting it before that would be a difficult part. So going back to where we are today, we're super confident about where we are, what the products doing in the market, core customers are adopting it, developing the various parts of it and are growing with it. The one thing we are a little bit more careful about is, our understanding of what's going to happen over the next few month -- the next few quarters as we will maybe get it's way through the end of the pandemic hopefully. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks very much. Hi guys, and thanks for taking the questions. For Olivier, the increased level of cloud optimization among larger customers that you saw this quarter. Do you think that this will have any impact on the pace of multi-cloud adoption going forward? I don't think so, because when customers are adopting multi-cloud, like they typically have one cloud of scale. You know, the smaller one in addition to that. So I think it is going to adopt the -- to impact mostly their cloud of scale first. That's my guess. And maybe what we've seen in some cases, but we'll see what happens. Again, it's a little bit harder to tell, so that's my guess. Okay, thanks. And then just for David, your growth in RPO on a year-over-year basis did decelerate quite a bit this quarter. I think you said that your annual contract billing has remained strong and that you were coming up against some longer duration contracts from a year ago. And I know, you don't break out current RPO. Just wondering, if you have any commentary on duration adjusted RPO growth or just how we should be thinking about that? Yes, you're exactly right. The RPO -- the current RPO is similar growth to the billings much closer to the revenues in the 60s. The difference there is the timing of multi -- of some multi-year contracts in the second quarter of last year. So the billing duration didn't -- the billing period you see didn't change. The contract duration came down slightly, just because those contracts are being consumed, and that's the reason why we had a current RPO, it would be much more aligned with the billings and the revenue. Okay, very clear. Very helpful, thank you. Yes. And right now, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Olivier Pomel. Please continue. Thank you. All right. So to close this call, I would like to repeat that we are very pleased with our execution in Q2, against what has been a challenging backdrop. And while the macro environment has presented near-term uncertainties, the situation has made it more imperative than ever for businesses to be digital first and in the cloud. We believe Datadog is ideally positioned to be a primary beneficiary of these long-terms and we continue to invest to capture that opportunity.
So, I want to thank you all for attending the call. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participations.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thank you, A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q3 which showed continued high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It was an exciting quarter in which we maintain our high velocity of product delivery starting with the new products and features announced at DASH, our annual user conference.
We are building on our strong track record of innovation and expanding our lead at the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform. With the majority of our employees continuing to work from home, I am extremely impressed by our productivity. Our engineers continue to build and ship innovative solutions. Our go-to-market teams continue to efficiently deliver value to our customers, and we continue to hire rapidly across R&D and sales and marketing to best position ourselves for the future.
We are strategic partners to our customers like never before as the importance of being digital-first and agile is more pronounced than ever. The companies everywhere are continuing to migrate to the cloud, investing in their digital operations to achieve these outcomes. And as our market opportunity driven by multiple platforming and cloud migration has become clearer during this time, so has our ability to execute against it.
Now, on to a review of Q3 results. To summarize Q3 at a high level, revenue was $155 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,107 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 727 last year. These customers generated about 75% of our ARR.
We have about 13,100 customers, up from about 9,500 last year, which means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, meaningfully more than the 600 in Q2. We also continue to be capital-efficient with free cash flow of $29 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products.
Now, to review Q3 in more detail. Throughout the quarter, usage growth of existing customers was robust which was a return to more normalized levels after slower usage expansion in Q2.
To be more specific, the pace of usage growth in Q3 was broadly in line with pre-COVID historical levels. As a result, we feel comfortable that some of the rationalized cloud usage from our larger customers that we've seen in Q2 was transitory as many of those customers have now returned to steady growth in multiple consecutive markets [ph].
Strength was also broad based across customers of different sizes and within different industries.
In addition to that, new logo generation continued to be robust with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and churn remained consistent with historical rates. Taking all of this into account, total ARR at the end of the quarter was a new record for the company making this a very successful quarter.
Next our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q3, 71% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 50% last year. Approximately 20% of customers are using four or more products which is up from only 7% a year ago. We had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products, and we continue to be pleased with the uptake of our newest products, including Synthetics, RUM ,NPM, and Security. I will point out that Synthetics has now been commercially available for about a year. And today, it is used by thousands of customers, has reached eight figures of ARR and continues to be in hyper growth.
Adoption of Synthetics has exceeded our expectations, which will attribute to the combination of the strength of the product itself and the product platform. As a reminder, frictionless adoption is a key value proposition of our platform, which we expect would benefit all of our products.
To conclude my review of the quarter, our ability to both land and expand during what has been a time of uncertainty demonstrates Datadog’s importance as companies of all sizes and across all industries even in the most challenged sectors are turning to their digital operations as the most strategically important segment of their business.
Now on to R&D. We have a proven and long track record of innovation, and our team lived up to that standard in Q3 with the introduction of eight new products and major features at DASH. Those announcements include introduction of the Datadog Marketplace to enable technology partners to build applications on top of our platform; the general availability of Continuous Profiler to measure cloud-level performance to an always-on and low overhead solution; expanding Synthetics to continuous integration and deployment pipelines, which ended testing earlier in the development process.
The introduction of mobile Real User Monitoring for both Android and iOS; the general availability of error tracking to aggregate triage and prioritize front end application errors; the beta launch of incident management for develops and security teams, the beta launch of compliance monitoring, which extends our security solutions to proactively notify on misconfigurations and compliance threat [ph], and lastly the beta launch of recommended monitors, a suite of preconfigured curated and customizable alerts.
Additionally, we recently announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft currently in public preview, which will make Datadog available to purchase, implement, and use directly from the Azure console and Azure and Datadog sales teams will increase collaboration for cross-selling to enterprise clients.
Today, we also announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Google Cloud Platform, which extends our GCP presence into new regions and enhances our go-to-market collaboration and sales alignment between Datadog and GCP. We believe this partnership along with our existing alliance with AWS demonstrates our leadership in cloud environments as well as the collaborative nature of our relationship with the public cloud vendors. These are just a few of the new features and enhancements we shipped this quarter.
Rather than listing them all, I'll conclude on R&D with two main takeaways. First, I am very proud of the continued productivity of our teams. Together, we have not allowed the pandemic and work-from-home to slow down our roadmap. And we have also been able to successfully hire and onboard at scale throughout the challenging times. Second, we continue to deliver the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform, and yes we are only getting started.
Now, on to the sales and marketing. As you know, this quarter we hosted DASH our annual user conference. While this was our first time hosting it in an whole -virtual format, this enabled us to reach a broader audience of over 7,000 attendees, which was more than 5x last year's count.
That was a great success bringing together our customers prospects and partners to show the power of Datadog and many of the new products discussed earlier. And I want to give a special thank you to our events and community teams for excellent execution in a quickly environment.
Now let's discuss some of our wins this quarter. First, I'll highlight three notable up sales that demonstrate the broad move to digital channels that has been catalyzed by the pandemic and our ability to rapidly scale with our customers. First the 7-figure upsell with a large Latin America e-commerce company that has been handling record level of orders. This company brought down silos and now has hundreds of users in Datadog collaborating around the share view of the IT stack.
Next a European on-demand company that has seen its business more than doubled from last year and has grown standard of usage more than 4 times. The company has standardized monitoring on Datadog with a seven-figure deal, featuring all seven of our platform products, including security to enhance real-time threat detection.
And last, a U.S. gaming company that has seen material growth in their platform and now has a seven-figure commitment to Datadog. In addition to using all three of our pillars, they are using Datadog to support their server-less architecture, they harness our machine learning to detect anomalies before they occur and they also report on key business metrics to finance and advertising teams.
We also had good success with customers from traditional industries that need to transform. We had a six-figure new logo win from a 150 years old postal service in Europe. This organization aims to deliver more digital services to its customers, while undergoing a transition to a multi-cloud and containerized environment. They are using four products including Synthetics to monitor back to front-end across both on-cloud and on-premise environments.
Next, we had a sizable upsell to a European financial service institution. After joining as a customer just over a year ago, this company increased spend more than 4 times for their consolidated monitoring on Datadog to now exceed $1 million in ARR.
Finally, we had an upsell with a 100-year-old global shipping company, which we mentioned on last year's call for Q3. Back then, this customer was spending mid-six figures on Datadog infrastructure monitoring. Today this customer's ARR has crossed into seven figures, using infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, Synthetics RUM, NPM and Security. This is a great example of not only how companies of all stages are undergoing digital transformation, but also of our powerful cross-selling motion as we introduce new products to market.
Now moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the final quarter of 2020, we continue to be excited about the market opportunity ahead of us and we are confident in our ability to execute, given continued strong performance through challenging times.
After some of the rationalized cloud usage which was in Q2, we've seen a clear return to normalized unit growth. It is apparent that cloud migration is not only resilient in the current environment, but may even grow stronger longer term. Companies globally and across all industries are prioritizing digital operations like never before. And the cloud is a clear strategic winner to enable greater agility and innovation.
We continue to believe Datadog is a primary beneficiary of this trend and that we remain very well positioned to win in the market. In other words, while the near-term macro environment remains uncertain and could cause bumps along the way, we are very confident in the long-term opportunity and in our positioning. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth, both in the near term and over time.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter top and bottom line results, amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $154.7 million, up 61% year-over-year. Usage trends were robust and return to more normalized growth after the pressure that we saw in Q2.
Meanwhile, platform traction continued to be strong. New logo generation was robust and churn was in line with historical norms. To provide some more context; first, on usage, usage from existing customers was robust. And our third quarter dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 13th consecutive quarter. After some pressure seen in Q2, driven by optimization efforts from larger customers at scale in the cloud, Q3 was characterized by a decisive return to more normalized growth from our existing customers.
Throughout the quarter, we saw usage growth that was more in line with pre-pandemic historical levels. The trend was broad-based and sustained throughout the quarter. This provides us with confidence that what we experienced in Q2 was a transitory optimization effort that were related to the challenging macro environment.
While further optimization may happen periodically, as we've talked about previously, we feel confident that cloud migration is very much intact and perhaps even strengthening longer term. Recall that we have a ratable SaaS model.
Therefore, while Q3 usage growth was back to pre-COVID levels, the pressure experienced in Q2 can still be seen in our year-over-year comparisons for a number of quarters. Our powerful land and expand model continues to be driven by both usage growth of existing products, as well as the cross-selling to our newer solutions.
Next, in the third quarter, we saw continued strength in our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products and about 20% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 7% a year ago. Continued product traction is being driven by adoption in the initial land as well as strong cross-selling. The newest products continue to perform well growing run rate quarter-over-quarter. I note that many of them such as RUM, NPM and Security are still early and therefore small contributions to results in the quarter.
Next, new logo results were solid with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and strength across sales channels and regions. And lastly churn was stable, in line with historical levels and improved from the slight elevation seen in Q2. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s.
Now turning to billings, which were $155.9 million, up 39% year-over-year against an exceptionally difficult compare. We have said that we will provide a pro forma to more clearly align billings growth with the economics and growth of the business.
And in Q3 there were a number of timing and duration differences that affected the growth of billings in the quarter. First, on last year's Q3 call, we had disclosed that there was an invoice timing difference, which increased billings by $6 million. Pro forma excluding that bill billings would have been $106.4 million.
Next, in the quarter, we had an $11 million impact to billings and deferred revenue from a few long-term large customers, which moved from annual billings to semiannual or shorter duration upon their renewals. Notably all of these customers continue to commit on an annual basis. They're simply breaking up their bills as we talked about on the last call into smaller increments.
If we pro forma for these timing effects, Q3 2020 billings would have been $166.9 million. So now, comparing the pro forma billings of $166.9 million to the year ago apples-to-apples of 106.4%, the growth is 57% relatively in line with revenue growth.
Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $316 million, up 50 per year. Current RPO growth was similar to pro forma billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate as we've just discussed versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage.
Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder unless otherwise noted all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials release. Gross profit in the quarter was $121.5 million representing a gross margin of 79%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago period.
Year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by more efficient use of cloud infrastructure. The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially was due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation as we have discussed.
As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense in the quarter was $45.8 million or 30% of revenue compared to 28% a year ago. We've continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth of our engineering headcount. We've been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding, enabling us to deliver multiple record quarters of engineering headcount additions.
We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D.
Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $49.7 million, or 32% of revenue compared to 39% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth continues to outpace that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events.
While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead-generating activities, it was not on a 1:1 ratio. G&A expense was $12.1 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter. And operating income was $13.8 million, or 9% operating margin, compared to operating income of $726,000 or 1% in the year ago period.
In addition to the improvement in gross margin, the continued reduction in marketing events, travel, and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID contributed to operating margin. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $16 million, or $0.05 a share on 333 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a very efficient business model, and have experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered five consecutive quarters of breakeven or positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go to market.
Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $36.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $28.6 million in the quarter, or a margin of 19%. Cash collections have been very strong amid COVID, a testament to the importance of our solution to our customers.
Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. While we saw usage growth in Q3 that was consistent with pre-pandemic historical levels, the pandemic is still ongoing and uncertainty remains. Therefore, we are being prudent by factoring into our guidance, usage growth trends below what we have seen in Q3 and conservative new business assumptions, as well as continued strong investment in R&D and sales and marketing.
Beginning with the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $162 million to $164 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 43% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.01 per share positive to $0.02 per share based on an approximately 335 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year 2020 revenue is expected to be in the range of $588 million to $590 million, which represents 62% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $48.5 million to $50.5 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.18 per share based on approximately 332 million weighted average diluted shares.
Then some notes below operating income, we expect approximately $1.9 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities less the interest expense on a convertible debt. And we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer again, but have a tax provision related to our international entity, which we estimate to be approximately $450,000 in Q4.
To summarize, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. Usage growth was strong, as companies are prioritizing cloud migration and digital transformation more than ever, and we continue to execute at a high level. We delivered an impressive velocity of product innovation in the quarter, and are investing to continue that track record. While uncertainty related to the macro environment remains, we feel very well positioned to capture what is a large and growing long-term market opportunity.
And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the Q3 results. David, maybe just to start with you. I think the message I heard off the script was a pretty emphatic view from your guidance perspective that the cloud rushing that you saw certainly improved and then became less of an issue.
Expansion trends look like they've gotten back to pre-COVID levels. If you could just bridge for us, the slower revenue growth sort of in the low 60s versus the 80s, but at the same time I think you mentioned or I think Olivier mentioned, a record new ARR quarter.
And if I look at kind of the RPO based bookings, it seems like there's an acceleration there. If you could sort of just help us understand how those three metrics sort of tied together and give us a sense of whether the business is truly rebounding versus what seems like slower revenue growth? Yes. We had, as we mentioned, organic growth is a very strong contributor and that rebounded particularly in the larger customers to more historical trends. And we continue to have new sales in line. It's a combination of the two that contributed to the record ARR growth. And so, those are the main factors. The organic is always the majority of the growth in a quarter complemented by the new business. And just to complement on that, this is Olivier. If you compare it to last year, so one thing to remember is we have a ratable SaaS model. So the growth we did forego in Q2 is going to be with us in the year-to-year comparison a little bit. Last year at the same time we had an acceleration also, which makes it for a tougher compare.
And it's going to – the increases in ARR only show up in revenue when they're actually incurred in the usage. So it depends on when we added those in the quarter and also put the flexibility of ARR was in Q2. So basically this is how you bridge the record ARR with the revenue as it [indiscernible]. Okay. Understood. That makes sense. And then Olivier, on the partnership which you signed a follow-on partnership with Google Cloud that you announced today, and then you signed another strategic partnership with Azure sort of intra-quarter. On the Azure front, can you sort of frame out what the opportunity is here? Give us a sense of what Azure represents as part of the business today.
And with the ability of customers to sort of draw down on their Azure credits using Datadog, how much of an opportunity is this in terms of sustaining revenue growth or potentially accelerating revenue growth with this Azure partnership? If you can just to sort of frame out the opportunity for us that would be great. Yes. So, first all, I should say we already have customers non-stop [ph] providers. We've been working with them before. So today our customer distribution follows a little bit the arrival of the cloud providers. So, we still have many more customers and more revenue volume on AWS, for example than we do in Azure. We – what's interesting with this new partnership is that we get more tightly integrated into the Azure console itself and we're the first vendor to do that.
What's interesting there is the user base for Azure tends to be a bit more homogeneous or used to be a bit more homogeneous in the technology they use mostly for Microsoft. And so the ability to be more integrated with Microsoft really can reduce friction and help onboard new customers onto our platform.
So we see that as a great opportunity to get more customers and more usage from Azure as Azure itself is growing and as their customers are diversifying their tech stack. I should say that this is only one of the cloud providers we're working with. We have – we're active on all of the other platforms. We announced another partnership with GCP today. We have another one with AWS. So this is an evolution not a revolution.
To your point also, our customers can use their Azure credits and there will be some cross-selling involved with the Microsoft team. So, we're excited about the lift in go-to-market there.
One last thing to remember is that this is still in preview. So the -- we don't expect any significant volume fallout in the near term. That's something that's going to kick in over the next few quarters. Understood. Thank you, Olivier. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Oli, you kind of answered it with your last comment there, but I just want to make sure that we level set in terms of the timing of the ramp of the partnerships not only for Azure, but also what you announced with Google as well. How should we think of the timing of that flowing into revenue? It's not going to be immediate, all right? So the Azure one is just in preview right now. It's not completely live yet. The GCP partnership involves a number of new technical things that need to happen, but also some new go-to-market motions we're putting in place. So, there's not going to be an immediate impact, but we see that as being potentially meaningful contributed in the mid to long-term. That makes perfect sense. Thanks. And just one follow-on to that. Are we looking at across the three pillars or just specifically for infrastructure on both of these partnerships? Well, the entry point for most of our customers is usually infrastructure. But the -- as we mentioned earlier in the call, in 75% of the cases, it also comes in with [indiscernible] of our products. So we see that really as a get way into the platform and then a way for us to have customers use all three or four products in the end. Got it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Okay. Thanks very much for taking question. I was hoping you could talk a bit about what you saw across the customer segments in the quarter. I think you mentioned that the strength was pretty broad-based. But I guess within the enterprise segment specifically are you starting to see more standardization around the Datadog platform not just with infrastructure obviously, but the log APM? And of course there's much, much broader suite of products that you now offer? Yeah. That's definitely what we see. I mean, we see -- I think, it's very obvious for customers that they need to integrate various parts of observability together and then having all that on top of the same platform is desired outcome. So we see more and more of that, but it's not specific to the enterprise. We see that happening over all segments at this point. Great. And maybe just a follow-up. In terms of usage stepping back up it's very encouraging to hear. As you talk to customers, is there any pushback on pricing? I mean, I would think not given that you're saying usage step back up here, but just curious what those conversations have been like and how you're thinking about the pricing model from here. Or is there something that really works well for your customer base as it is and there's unlikely to be any evolution of that? Thanks. Yeah. Look the one thing I should say is anytime you charge customers for millions of dollars, they're going to ask questions about the price. It's the whole department in enterprises that are built just for that. That being said at the end of the day what matters is how much value you deliver for that price. And I think for that we're doing a pretty good job.
I think the one thing everybody is grappling with and as more and more applications moving to the cloud and those applications generate more and more data, what's the best way to align how is that is being used for observability reasons, for security reasons other reasons to align that with all the value with the price being paid. And when you look at our product offering and what we've been adding that's why we've added all of these new SKUs to really unbundle what we're doing with the data so customers can really buy to align with the needs they have.
For example, we announced more recently treating without limits, which is a way to send extremely large amounts of data to our APM, but only retain the part of it that actually makes sense to customers and they want to retain long-term. We've done the same thing with before. We're doing something with our infrastructure product. These are the way we basically put our customers in control so they can align what they pay with the value they get. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks so much, and congrats on another strong quarter and really nice to see usage growth returning to more normal levels. David, as investors try to think about the growth algorithm for Datadog in the years to come, clearly, you're levered to digital transformations and cloud migration. And we can look to many proxies for this opportunity perhaps the growth rates of the large public clouds themselves which by the way great to see the deeper partnerships with Microsoft and Google.
But I'd be curious to know how internally from a planning perspective, how you all think about this? And although I get you're not going to give us guidance right now for next year, how should we think about how you're framing it and the rate of investment against that opportunity? And along with that how would you characterize the ability to hire in this environment? Yes. Yes good question. So on revenue, we said that over -- about 60% of our revenue growth comes from existing customers. So we start with the land and expand and look at those cohorts inorganic. And I think we referred to looking at pre-pandemic and historical trends.
So that's at the sort of lynchpin making the business relatively predictable even in uncertain times. And then we look at the market size, the opportunity which tends not to be a limit. And so what is, is that the execution, how many salespeople we get in how we can ramp them etcetera.
And we then essentially have some experience in understanding ramp and understanding productivity. And those are the algorithms we use in looking at growth. I think we feel and we said this over and over again that there's a very big market and we're very early on.
So both in terms of product investment, but also in go to market there's a lot of areas that we are still building out. There are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of successful territories where we have to put more feet on the street. So we tend to build that from a bottom-up with sales headcount.
And that's resulted in sales and capacity as we've talked about in the 60% to 70% growth. And we see that and we see that opportunity and based on our success in bringing people in and getting them productive. As Oli mentioned we have been successful in COVID in hiring and it hasn't really held us back. We've seen a lot of good opportunity and continue to do that throughout the pandemic. Yes. And I'll complement that. Sorry, I'll just complement that on the growth side. I mean right now we're so early in the opportunity that the way we think about the way we grow our team isn't directly related to the way we think about the growth we're going to get next year.
We really think of it in terms of how fast we can grow them while optimizing for both short-term and long-term growth. So we are growing the team as fast as we can basically and we think there's enough opportunity to justify it. And that's true both on the R&D side and on the sales and marketing side which we are in and we are very convinced that the opportunity is there. And just to put that into -- to frame that a little bit we're growing a lot faster than the cloud providers as a whole which would mean plenty, plenty of market for us to get. Thank you for that. Maybe just a follow-up and perhaps put a finer point on this correlation of sales headcount growth with top line growth, just as the portfolio continues to expand especially recently with DASH all the new product announcements, how should we think about the evolution of the sales force to drive efficient cross-selling and specialization that might be required in order to hit all the different buyers and cover all of the product capabilities within the customer base? Are there -- do you envision having to make any significant changes in the go-to-market? It's very possible. Every company that -- which is a large scale and grows at some point start specializing their sales force. We haven't had to do that at this point. And I would say, we're optimistic that for the observability part of the stack at this point we'd be very successful at having one sales team sell that.
I think the issue might come first for the new categories we're entering such as security where the barriers might be a little bit different. There again these products are new enough. And the customer base is for these products and the I would say the customers for which these products are mature not are a small enough group targeting enough group that we don't need to specialize for 30 years that's definitely something that's on our minds for the future. Excellent. Thanks so much for the thorough explanation today. Congrats again. Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Yes. Two quick questions and congrats from me as well. Olivier like what are you seeing in terms of competitive dynamics? So we had like some one wonder in your – in the broader space is kind of bring pricing down like crazy and it's doing a lot of free stuff. Other guys are just trying to broaden the portfolio coming up with new cloud product – just a word on what are you seeing in that space? So broadly, there's no change. The space is very much the same as it's been for the past few years. We don't see anything different today with customers. We don't see anything different in the adoption cycle. We hear a lot about it so around earnings time. But that's about it. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then as you think about like as you kind of look at the landing motion and – more the landing motion with all your new customers have you seen like a change in terms of what people are taking up? You mentioned at the beginning of the call, a couple of extra stats around how many modules et cetera. But do you see a change in nature in terms of people understanding observability better and kind of going from more than just infrastructure and just kind of thinking more about this whole thing holistically. What are your observations there? Thank you. Yeah. This definitely customers expect definitely to get to do more with observability than just infrastructure, I would say. The field is there. It's understanding what it needs better there. At the same time, when we land with customers, the balancing act is between having them use more products on day one, but also slowing down the landing which is why the number has been pretty stable around 75% of the land that, include two or more products. I think that corresponds to the right balance right now between landing fast and landing with more than one product. Again, landing fast is critical. Like it's a very important part of our business and we've been very successful with our infrastructure products in particular. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. At DASH, it was really good to hear the application marketplace going GA really seems to open up a nice halo effect for developers to build application on your platform. Can you talk a little bit more about what sort of interest you're having from developers? And ultimately, you're not alone in software vendors doing this. How do you think about monetizing this? Or is it more of just trying to build up more awareness for additional features that you don't deliver as first-party features yourself? Well, it's a collection of all of these, right? I think, we're still super early in this. At this point, we're working with our very first few partners to make sure that we define – we develop the platform in a way that serves go to them. And we think, if we make them successful, they'll make us successful in the long run.
So as far as monetization comes in, we worry about them more than we worry about us at this point, just to make sure they're successful and they get what they want out of it. So super early, we think it's important. We think it's going to play a dividend in the future but we have many, many, more quarters of innovation to come on these to fully deliver on the business. That's great. And then maybe just one for David, your explanation of billings was super helpful. Just trying to – kind of think about that on a normalized basis given all the nuances from Q3 of last year. I guess, I'm curious though, when we look at deferred revenue this quarter and maybe there's an obvious answer to this. But it looked kind of sequentially flat. Was there anything that impacted deferred this quarter not necessarily looking on a year-over-year basis but just sequentially from Q2 to Q3? Yes. It's the same factor that resulted in the pro forma analysis. There were $11 million of billings from some large customers that had – would have been 100% in billing, which were chunked up anywhere from semi-annual to monthly billing. So the way to look at that, and do the apples-to-apples would be at that same $11 million, which reflects the economics, and you'll see the deferred revenue in the mid-50s like the other metrics that we talked about. I got it. So really just a relic of what happened last year then repeating itself this year the renewals? Exactly. It's – its deals that renewed annually and grew and as we said last time that we're trying to work with our clients, keep the commitment. These are some very long term large customers, who are staying with us, but to accommodate them in this environment in their request to chunk up build that's what it is. Got it. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys. Thank you. And just a point on that. We'll see more of that in the future, right? I mean the beauty of our model is because of the efficiency of our go-to-market, we don't actually care if customers pay us upfront; we want to align with them on that. And so we're -- I'm pretty sure we'll see more of that as we grow. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David, I'm curious if you could just expand on the normalization comment, you mentioned from Q2 to Q3 add a little more detail in terms of just overall customer behavior. And I'm curious if you could also just drill down on the security initiative what you're seeing there and what metrics are standing out to you from that business unit? Thank you. Yeah. Let me just go over some of the metrics around organic growth and then Oli to Security. So what we said in Q2 was that we had some of the larger customers rationalize. So, therefore, the slowdown of organic was concentrated first in the larger customers and that about 10% of our customer base and ARR was in impacted industries where there was some pressure.
And what we saw in Q3 was sort of return to normalcy in those, meaning the larger customers continue to now after that optimization grow in pre-pandemic rates. And we also saw that the COVID impacted -- the impact was taken the medicine was taken and they also continue to be stable to slightly up. So essentially it was across enterprise mid-market and SMB. And it was across also the large customer the small customer that exhibited similar types of organic growth, which is what we've seen over the long period in the company but saw a different effect in Q2.
Oli on Security? Yes. On Security, I think it's too early to have a lot to share there, but the product is growing very nicely. We're getting great adoption stories from customers but it's growing very quickly from a very small number. So -- and it's still very early in its life cycle. So we fleshed out the offering a little bit at DASH with the compliance product. There's a lot more we're working on both of the existing base and on new base for security, so let's say it's still early.
And just to restate some of what David said on the growth, we're very happy with the growth we've seen in Q3. It really showed a reversion to normal for the month-to-month growth. I mean if you look at the most growth in ARR any of the month in Q3 like it could have slowed this month in Q3 or Q4 -- sorry in Q4 or Q1 they would have sit right there.
So I think it's not that we're very happy with what we've seen. At the same time, we're still very careful about because we don't -- in the macro backdrop, we still question what can happen towards the end of Q4. Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. As part of the continual shift to a more multi-silo approach, curious if you could elaborate on the experience for results you've had as of late penetrating further into the log monitoring pillar? Into the log monitoring, you said? That's correct. Yeah. I mean look the log product is in hyper growth right? And it's a very exciting and also a challenging one for customers because it's one of the products, for which is the easiest to generate a lot of fairly useless data and have to pay for it, which is why a lot of the innovations we've made initially on that product were around giving customers more control to align what they pay with the value they get. So we've done quite a bit of that.
As we keep growing that product we're getting into situations where customers are not standardizing on us for all of their observability including logs. And we've been basically pulled by our enterprise customers to add a lot of the enterprise features that they would expect from a platform that they and all of their extremely confidential data into. So that's a lot to do what we've been doing more recently. And I know we're just three months out of DASH, but how has customer feedback been so far and some of the new announced products and features? What's resonated the most with customers? It's interesting because it's -- we've announced many new products and they all got quite a bit of attention. I would say we've got quite a few eyes on the new incident management product which is only in beta. We've got a lot of excitement for the profiler product. So, there's a number of different things that customers are excited about from DASH.
I think we still have in all of those cases it's still early for those products. So, we still have to fully bring them to market. For most of them we still have to charge for them. And we have to basically work with our customers to make sure that these products fully deliver on their promise and our vision. But that's the way we build, right?
The way we build is we build with our customers. We put the products in their hands. We make sure they see the value. We make sure they have the controls so they can align what they pay with the value they get and then we grow those customers on those products. Great. Thanks. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks very much. Ollie as your product set continues to diversify and the revenue stream with it, do you think that has any impact on gross margin longer term? Thanks. Today we don't think so. There's no reason to think we're going get this in the model we have so far. We might still see some fluctuation mostly because of the back and forth between building more products and optimizing our use of the infrastructure because they are the same engineers that do both and also because of our expansion to new geographies and new data sets and things like that which might push down a little bit. But there's no reason to believe that we're headed into a completely different ZIP code there at least not today. Great. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks and congratulations on the results. I was wondering if you could just perhaps frame for us what percentage of your deals today are partner sourced and just how we should be thinking about new logos that could be generated from your partnership ecosystem given the launch of your partner network I think in January of this year. Yes, today it's a very small part of our business that is partner-sourced. And so all of the partnerships we've discussed are basically all upside for us. And that's why we're investing in all of those. We think there's a number of we can get thanks to these partners. And we're investing in the partner organization in general. We launched our partner program earlier this year. It's starting to see a bit amount of success but it's still a small part of the business. Okay. Thanks. And then if I could ask as a quick follow-up could you describe some of the if you need to make some go-to-market changes in particular to scale your federal business and how we should be thinking about how big this business could become relative to some of your other vertical markets? Yes. So we started building a team for that right? And we are as you know we have a number of things in process for FedRAMP and et cetera. We think it's going to be similar in many ways to the way we sell to other customers and different in a few other ways.
In terms of the importance of the business, we think it can be a big part of the business. And if you look at other communities in comparable spaces like it is a big part of their business but providers or other vendors in security or observability. So, we believe that there's really a good opportunity there. So, again, this is all upside for us. Got it. Thanks for your perspective and thanks for taking my questions. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thanks. Oli, I'll start with you on the cloud partnerships that you've talked about and mentioned before. Can you highlight what's unique? Or – first of all is there anything exclusive in those relationships, number one? And number two, in what way will it be either easy or difficult for some of your competitors to replicate either the quality of the relationship or the depth of the relationship with those client guys? Well I mean there's nothing exclusive in most of these relationships, right? But in many situations like the way they are implemented and what the [indiscernible] is really different. And they're also different depending on the cloud provider we work with. So for example, the way we integrate – we're going to integrate with Azure plugs directly to their console which is not the case with some of the other cloud providers. So that's something that's interesting there.
Now in terms of what others could or could not do it's hard for me to comment. I mean I believe that it's software so we can do it. Others might be able to do it. I think what we've proven time and time again is that, because of the overall structure of our products, because of the structure of our customer base not go to market, we end up having a product that is a lot easier and has a lot of traction to adopt and ends up being more widely adopted by our customers and more successful in the end. And I think that's what we – that would guide basically the way we run all those partnerships. So what attracted us to the edge partnership with the ability to reduce friction there. And that's why we decided to invest in that first. That's great. And then David a question for you again, sorry going back to that duration on that large customers, the $11 million. Can you at least confirm that those customers have expanded at your – roughly your net dollar expansion rate? Just trying to make sure that this isn't just taking a bill and splitting it by half but he was taking a bigger bill and splitting it by half? Yes. No they've been customers that have grown substantially. One of them is a customer that's more than doubled over the last year or so. So this is merely that we have changed the billing terms but they are all customers that have been growing with us over the last few years. Got it. And then lastly on your underlying assumption for some softness in usage in your 4Q guide, half pretty much into the quarter. It doesn't sound like there has been any unusual usage softness in that 1.5 months, correct me if I'm wrong. So aren't you just being a little bit too conservative here? I mean what is it the scenario that truly worries you with so little time left in the quarter? Yes. I think just overall we've tended to be conservative in our guidance to incorporate usage growth rates that are lower than what we have seen and new logo accumulation that's lower. And I think we said last time, that given that velocity and the fact that we're in the pandemic and we can't predict what might happen around the world, we wanted to continue to roll that conservatism forward. So it's really that at the core of the guidance rather than anything that in particular that we've seen that's different than what we said on the call today. Very good. Good luck, guys. Yes. Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey, gents. Thanks for taking my question. Olivier, I guess I'll touch on first a little bit about the technology architecture. This comes up a lot even we're talking to investors. Maybe a little help in understanding. So today when you look at sort of even the infrastructure monitoring space and the way data works in the sampling model with logs, which data makes sense or it doesn't. But this is idea that with sampling you're not getting all the data and some of the vendors in other markets are saying, we can absorb all the data. How do you think about that? And would it be difficult for you to absorb all the data? Is that too much data with the….? We totally absorb all the data. We totally absorb all the data. Absolutely. There's no sampling. Sampling is something customers can choose to do if they don't want to retain everything and store everything. But absolutely, we take all the data.
And actually one thing we announced recently with our treating without limit product. It actually allows us to be -- we're the only ones to actually take absolutely 100% of the data sent to our infrastructure and available in the real-time even in extremely high volume environment and then we go to environments where they're keeping track of millions and millions of requests per second.
So we do that and it's not something that the other vendors don’t do. So we -- there's no sampling required. Sampling it's just the way for customers to decide, hey, the millions and millions of debug logs, my developers are sending, I only need to keep 10% of them to see what's going on as they written that in storage for a longer time and for many checks without having to pay for that. Great. I appreciate the clarity. And my second one is kind of a more longer-term question, but it's about the machine learning. So, some of the other vendors in marketing heavily the focal point of machine learning. And I'd love to understand sort of how you think about that vis-à-vis competition? And so to what extent are you seeing APM customers, especially leverage the Watchdog automatic anomaly detection service you introduced maybe news last year, 12 months ago. So I'd love to understand a little bit of the thought process there. Yeah. So, a couple of ways in the case. So the first one is we actually think it's a because of the model and we are fully SaaS, machine learning is a strength of ours, because we actually see all of the data we can train or algorithms of all of the data. We can seek to choose the problems and the use cases that we want to solve with machine learning, which is the ones that we don't. So it actually strengthens the long-term structural strength for what we do.
That being said, we don't like to lead with the promise -- the promise of an AI that teaches everything for you, because we think in general those promises under deliver. They look great in the demo. But then a number of specific states you're going to find them to fall short and that's not what we want. And that's true of pretty much all the products you see there today.
So our approach is to basically under-promise and over-deliver and we think we have long-term structural strength in there because of the way run of products and the data line that we see, which is not something that most of us competes can do or have.
Now in terms of the adoption, we see -- we've been purposefully selective in the situation in use cases we saw with Datadog today. But we see without being used by our customers in real situations and they rely on it and that's something that we keep building upon. Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color. Congrats and thanks for the commentary you've done. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick clarification on the billings. I understand the larger customers are growing at pre-pandemic levels and your COVID-impacted companies are slightly up. So it sounds like the environment and the usage, the cloud usage significantly improved from Q2 to Q3. But I'm wondering if you look at your billings on a sequential basis after -- even after normalizing that is only up $6 million sequentially despite that significant improvement in the environment. So I'm wondering is there any other factors there that we should consider, given that the billings only went up $6 million? No, we said all along that, billings has to do with when bills went out. The advice is to take the revenues for the quarter and then multiply that by 34% 35% or something. And that's the -- and then times 12 and that's sort of the linearity. And that's what drives the business.
What we're doing with billings, despite the fact we don't run is, we're trying to clean away some of the noise of when a bill went out this quarter versus that quarter, which isn't germane main to the top line growth of the business. So I would say, urging everyone back towards the ARR approximation and the top line and we're just basically giving pro formas here, which all are sort of in the 50s percent and RPO, et cetera, which is more in line with revenue growth. Okay. And then, I'm just wondering if, just -- could you touch on the competitive landscape both for the APM space, as well as log management? Thank you. Yes, we'd like to know in the community space. I mean, it's very much a same as it used to be, fortunately or unfortunately, a little bit boring. So any particular question on the computing space? Well, have you seen any sort of win rate improvement now that your cloud usage is certainly getting better? I'm just wondering if your win rates have improved versus competitors like Splunk and Elastic and the log management space, or Dynatrace and New Relic, because they get different pricing changes. Most of our business is not replacements, right? Most of our business is net new. So the -- we do see some replacements from time to time, but that's a small minority of the accounts will end. The world is moving to the cloud. Most companies are new to cloud.
Most companies are new to this environment and maybe observability and don't have anything yet in that cloud environment, even if they have on-prem and they start using us for that. I don't have a win rate improvement to report, but I'm also not unhappy about win rate. Actually, I don't even look that often at win rates, because that's not what drives most of the acquisition for us. Okay. Thanks. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. Thank you. One second. My apologies. My one-year old was just barging in. That's what you do -- what you get for working from home. In any case, in closing, I'd like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our execution and I want to thank our employees for the strong productivity that they've shown during the quarter.
We recently said that we’d do 10 years anniversary this summer. And I want to say, I'm incredibly proud of the culture we created, incredibly proud of the work, with a calculation of the value we deliver to our customers. But I'm even more excited about our future, the strength of our team and about the magnitude of opportunity. So in other words, the message you should get from this call is that we're just getting started and we're also very excited about it.

We are very pleased with our performance in Q4 which once again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. Despite the unique challenges presented by COVID. We continued in 2020 to introduce new products at a high velocity growth top line at a rapid rate and demonstrate stronger product efficiencies. We are in particular, very proud of the way our team have handled the pandemic as well as the years others unprecedented challenges.
We ended the year with 2,185 employees globally. The 56% increase year-over-year with high growth of both our go-to-market and R&D teams. One of our strategic decisions at the beginning of the pandemic was to keep on hiring and we have been able to interview, hire and onboard remotely for maintaining high employee engagement and productivity.
Throughout the year we have worked to keep our employees safe and productive and to be good citizens of our communities as they face significant challenges. We are very proud of the exceptional grants we have awarded to our employees in Q2 and Q4 both to support them individually and to allow them to donate nearly $1 million to charities focused on COVID relief, as well as social and racial justice efforts.
Last but certainly not least we have maintained our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers. And while the pandemic has been a source of challenges to businesses this year, we believe it will prove to be an accelerate to our cloud migration and digital transformation over time. In other words, we learned a lot this year, including our ability to execute in the face of challenges as well as confirmation of a very large and growing market opportunity.
Now onto review of the quarter, to summarize Q4 at a high level revenue was $178 million, but increased a 56% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We also ended the year with 97 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more, almost doubled a 50 last year and more than three times the 29 we had just two years ago. We ended the year with 1,253 customers with an ARR of 100,000 or a little more up from 858 last year. These customers generate over 75% of ARR.
We have about 14,200 customers up from about 10,500 last year, which means we added about 1,100 customers in the quarter making it another strong quarter of ads after the 1,000 we added in Q3. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $70 million. As in past quarters our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted on your product. For the full-year we generated revenue of $603 million, the 66% increase year-over-year, which was above the high end of our guidance and free cash flow was $83 million or a margin of 14% from the year.
Now to review Q4 in more detail. Execution was very strong with outstanding sales performance, particularly against the macro backdrop. New logo generation was very strong, including a new record of new logo ARR added that was significantly above last year’s number. Very strong performance across the board from commercial and enterprise sales channel as well as a record number of million dollar plus new logo customers. Gross of existing customers was robust as customers of all sizes continue to grow their user to Datadog for both increased consumption and cross-selling and Q4s growth of existing customers was broadly in line with pre-COVID trend.
Lastly, churn remains very low and consistent with pre-pandemic historical rates. Next our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q4, 72% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 58% last year. Additionally, 22% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 10% a year ago. And we have another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos branded with two or more products.
We are very happy with our platform traction, including uptake of the newest product, NPM, RUM and Security each of which has which hundreds or thousands of customers in a short amount of time. As a reminder, our newer product are often adopted first by staff selection customers at small scale before our land and expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from a single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers.
Overall, our ability to both land and expand in a very challenging time speaks to our strong execution, to our leading product and to our status as a strategic partner to our customers as they prioritize the digital operations.
Now onto product and R&D. Today, we announced two acquisitions. First, we announced an agreement to acquire Sqreen, a SaaS based security platform that enables enterprises to detect, block and respond to application level attacks. Sqreen’s technology provides Runtime Application Self-Protection or RASP and in-app web application firewall also known as WAF and is already used by hundreds of companies today. Security issues in the application layer are complex to solve, because application security causes lines of responsibility between dev, ops and security team. As a result, we believe this will be a powerful combination for our customers using APM or Synthetics.
Next, we also announced the acquisition of Timber Technologies, the developers of Vector, a vendor-agnostic, and high-performance observability data pipeline. With Vector customers can collect, enrich and transform logs and other signals across multiple tools and data sources in both on-premise and cloud environment, and can route this data to the destination of their choice. We expect this technology to further empower our customers to control their observability data, while providing broader points of entry to our platform. I speak for everyone at Datadog is saying that we are extremely excited for the teams of both companies to join us in our quest to break down silos.
Beyond the acquisitions we had a number of new developments in Q4. We launched the general availability of Incident Management, which allows users to declare incidents, investigate root case and collaborate without leaving Datadog. And we also delivered more than 60 other new capabilities and features across our products, including new and enhanced integration, such as Snowflake, Oracle Cloud or vulnerability analysis monitoring Snyk with our brand new Continuous Profiler.
Now taking a step back, we exit 2020 with nine generally available products. To put these in context, just four years ago we had only one product and we have been able to build the most complete integrated and cloud-native observability platform because of our filing as an integration platform that is extensible to various cases.
Looking forward to 2021, we continue to feel that we’re just getting started. First, we are doubling down on building out our platform for observability. This core market alone is a very large opportunity and is growing quickly with a re-platforming to cloud architectures. We are still early in this transition and are aggressively adding functionality to both the new SKUs as well as the more mature products.
Second, we are just getting started in security with our first product launch in 2020. We consider security a very large opportunity with a long runway of planned product development and we envision the silos between dev, tech and ops working down in a similar way to what we have seen between dev and ops.
Third, we are investing in the platform and ecosystem. In addition to building up the Datadog marketplace, we now have strategic partnerships with all of the major cloud vendors. For example, we announced the expansion of our partnerships with Azure and GCP last quarter, which should be in the market in 2021.
We are also introducing new cloud instances in regions such as Go Cloud. Our goal is to gain distribution across vendors and regions and in customers where they are to lower friction to adoption and two lower time to value. And as we think longer-term beyond 2021, we do believe there may be more use cases we can solve for our customers beyond current reach of our platform.
Let’s move on to the sales and marketing. As I mentioned earlier, I’m very pleased with the continued productivity of our go-to-market teams and Q4 was a very strong sales quarter. So let’s discuss some of our wins in the quarter.
First, let’s talk a bit about the way COVID has accelerated digital transformation. As expected in the quarter, we saw a seven-figure AR increases from COVID beneficiaries such as a consumer device company, a large e-commerce platform and a global video games company.
Perhaps more surprisingly though we also had a number of notable upsales in companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including a seven-figure upsales with a travel technology company and six-figure upsales with two separate airlines as well as a physical event company. These deals demonstrate that Datadog is a key strategic partner to companies that are scaling rapidly overlap in line as well as the [founded] businesses even in the most negatively impacted industries are investing heavily in their digital operations.
Now let’s dive into some of our other key wins for the quarter. First, I’ll highlight two notable seven-figure lands both with Fortune 100 companies, the retailer and an insurance company. Both have been struggling with teams in separate silos and are consolidating dozens of tools into Datadog giving a single view to both dev and ops teams.
Next, we had a seven-figure land from a streaming sports platform in Asia, which was enabled by our new Datadog partner program. This company adopted the full data platform and our Tracing without Limits approach was a key differentiator as they are previous [ATM] solutions suffer compliance spots due to sampling and to a lack of integration with infrastructure data.
Next, we had yet another seven-figure land this time from a SaaS company based in India. This company moves to us from a build it yourself approach and free its engineers so there could be more products and deliver innovation.
Lastly, we had a nearly $1 million upsale to a very large management consulting firm. This company is now using our network direct monitoring products to replace the legacy point solution and getting visibility into physical network devices. I would also note that this was one of the first expansion deals to benefit from a brand new marketplace offerings. In this case a partner developed integration with Office 365.
Now moving on to our outlook, it is clear to us that the market trends that have driven our success so far have only gotten stronger. Businesses must be digital first like never before. The massive - platform driven by cloud migration is still in its early stages and engineers and developers are truly strategic employees whose productivity and ability to collaborate are key drivers of business performance.
While there is a possibility for more near-term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute in our long-term opportunity. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth both in the near-term and over time.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Yes. Thanks Olivier.
As mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $177.5 million, up 56% year-over-year against the challenging year-ago comp. New logo generation was very strong, usage trends were solid, platform traction continued to be strong and churn was in line to better than historical norms.
To provide some more context. First new logo results were very strong. Both new logo ARR and the number of new logos were records for Datadog displaying strong growth versus a year ago. New business contributions came across regions and from both our commercial and enterprise sales channels.
Remember that given our usage based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into revenue. Growth of existing customers was robust and our dollar based net retention remained above 130% for the 14th consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which showed continued adoption of our platform and their cloud migration even in the face of the macro pressures.
To go into a little more detail. Growth of existing customers was broadly in line with long-term trends and meaningfully better than the level experienced in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, even though we have now experienced two quarters of usage growth that was approximately in line with pre-pandemic levels, Q2 was meaningfully pressured and that pressure will impact our year-over-year metrics, including revenue growth and net retention until we lap that compare.
Next in the fourth quarter, we saw continued strength of our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products and 22% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 10% a year ago. Given that 75% plus of our lands now come from two or more products, we believe the overall share of customers using two-plus products is closing in on that number.
Lastly, churn was in line to slightly better than historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers even during challenging times. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid 90s.
Now turning to billings, which were $219.4 million, up 68% year-over-year. After adjusting for the timing of $6 million of billings in last year’s fourth quarter pro forma billings growth was 61% year-over-year, strong and approximately in line with revenue growth. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $434 million, up 78% year-over-year. Both billings and contract duration extended in the quarter, driven by strong annual billings and commitments as well as a few larger multi-year commits.
It is important to note that those multi-year commits were built annually and we do not incentivize our sales force for multi-year deals given our high net retention rate. Current RPO growth was strong in the mid-60s similar to billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage.
Now let’s review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $137.6 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 79% last quarter and 78% in the year-ago period.
The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially is due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation. As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter to quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of our cloud data centers in newer geographies.
R&D expense was $53.5 million or 30% of revenues compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering headcount, which we added approximately 370 net R&D heads over the course of 2020. We have been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding during COVID.
Sales and marketing expense was $52.5 million or 30% of revenues compared to 35% in the year-ago period. Similar to R&D we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it was not on a one-for-one ratio.
G&A expense was $13.5 million or 8% of revenues, slightly lower than the 9% in the year-ago quarter and operating income was $18.1 million or 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $7.9 million with a 7% margin in the year-ago period. The continued reduction in marketing events, travel and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID were the primary drivers in the year-over-year leverage. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter.
Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $19.1 million or $0.06 per share based on a 334 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities.
Cash flow from operations was $23.8 million in the quarter. After taking into consider capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $16.7 million for a margin of 9%. For the full year free cash flow was $83.2 million or 14% margin.
Now turning to the outlook. For the first quarter and the full-year of 2021. As Olivier mentioned, we believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future as we are addressing a very large Greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity.
As we look out to 2021, COVID continues to present some uncertainty. On the one hand, we believe that the pandemic will accelerate digital transformation and cloud migration once the near-term pressure subsides. However, the timing and path of normalization remains uncertainty.
Taking in combination, we are initiating the following 2021 guidance which includes continued high growth. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $187 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 42% at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.02 to $0.03 per share based on approximately 345 million weighted average diluted shares.
For the full-year revenue was expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million, which represents 38% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.14 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares.
Now some notes on the guidance. Embedded in the guidance are prudent assumptions on growth of existing customers as well as new logo at payment, which reflect some of the current macro uncertainties.
Next, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. Therefore, we’re planning to continue aggressive investments in both R&D and go-to-market throughout 2021. While we have been profitable throughout 2020 and plan to be in 2021, we are not focused on optimizing near-term profitability. Rather the efficiencies of our business are clearly evident and we are confident in our ability to be a sizable materially profitable company over the long term.
Additionally, our model assumes a return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility presently on these topics, but believe it’s prudent to incorporate that in our outlook.
Next, of the two acquisitions, Timber Technologies has closed and has no impact to our guidance. We also announced the agreement to acquire screen, for a total transaction cost of $260 million, of which approximately 25% is deferred in a mix of cash and stock. We expect screen to close in Q2 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Screen is not included in our guidance, but we expect it to have an immaterial impact to both our revenue and operating income guidance in 2021 upon deal closure.
Now below operating income. We expect approximately $1.2 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense of our convertible. Next, we don’t expect to be a federal taxpayer next year, but have a tax provision related to our international entity and expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q1 and $3 million for the full-year.
Lastly, we have early-adopted ASC 2020-06 as of January 1st which changes the accounting for our convertible debt. Therefore going forward, our convertible notes will be accounted for wholly as debt on our balance sheet. GAAP and other expenses should now be more aligned to non-GAAP as there is no longer a non-cash component related to the debt discount.
More importantly, our share count forecast now considers an additional 8.1 million shares as the new standard requires all underlying shares of the convert to be included. And this has been taken into account in our EPS guidance.
To summarize, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Execution was very strong, including strong sales results and continued product innovation. Customers continue to consume more Datadog both in terms of usage and the cross-selling to newer products.
Our continued execution throughout the challenges of 2020 give us even greater confidence heading into 2021 and the importance of our solutions will only be heightened long-term by the pandemic. Therefore we’re continuing to reinvest in our business and are very excited for the year ahead, sorry.
Finally, we would like to thank AJ, who is having his last earnings call with us today at Datadog. I’m sure our investors have appreciated his contributions as much as we have.
And with that, we will now open our call for questions. Operator, let’s begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] First question we do have Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. You are now live. Hi, this is Mark Rende on for Sanjit. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results and continued strong growth here. First, I just want to quickly get an update on the headwinds you're seeing the top line from the lower expansion you saw last summer. It seems like those trends have largely turned around, and we should expect another quarter of two to kind of work through those impacts. I guess my question is, as we get into the back half of next year and the growth comp become easier, should we be expecting the combination of easier growth comps and ramping kind of products and partnerships with like Azure to result in an acceleration of growth is that an appropriate way for us to be thinking about it? I think that we’ve given our guidance taking into account all of the potential upsides in rev, but you are right. The headwinds created in Q2 do create a drag on the revenue growth as we talked about, through Q2 of next year, and while we are not providing that quarterly guidance through next year, we expect that headwind in terms of the comp to a beta in the second half of the year. Got it helpful. And then maybe just on the two acquisitions announced, so on the security side with screen, you're building out quite a portfolio now across observability and insecurity at Datadog. And I guess my question on screen is kind of how does this integrate with the core Datadog platform? How does it work with core Datadog versus being a standalone functionality? And then on the timber purchase, what is, you know, what's the need for an observability data pipeline in the platform? Can you help us kind of better understand what timber is bringing to Datadog and in the platform and why customers really need this functionality? Thanks so much, really helpful. Yes. So I'll take the questions on M&A. So on the screen side, and then what's really interesting is that the focus is application security, and application security is one of the areas where the conflict, I would say between application to that basically ops and security is the, is the most present. And the responsibility is on that really clear cutting there.
And we think its one area where we can show particular strength because our APM is already deployed already in the heart of the application. And we can inject the security protection and detection in Dell directly. So we, we think this is a product will make a lot of sense to our customers that are using APM, and, that's going to be code the same way basically.
So that's those Korean for, timber in vector, which is a product what's really interesting varies, we hear and we see from customers over and over again that they have a number of different data sources that produce lugs in particular, but also other kinds of observability data, and many of those sources of our legacy system, log management systems, for example.
And one thing they want to be able to do is to aggregate all that data before it leaves their own network environment. Make sure they have the right privacy controls on them, so they can filter PII for example, and things like that, and then decide to rock these data to us, for example, that's to I've got sororities, but also maybe to other places, maybe to an archive, they want to keep them in-house. So we think this would allow us to do is to satisfy that need from customers, make sure they're fully in control of jobs diversity data, and make it a lot easier for customers to in the end send us all the data that is relevant to them. Great. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. You are now live. Okay. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about new lands. I think you called out that 75% of those lands are with two or more products. So beyond infrastructure, can you give us a sense of where you're seeing the strongest traction more recently with the rest of your sweet thanks? It's pretty much in the order of introduction of the products, so the, the most mature behind that are APM and logs that are authentic and neck in terms of we all the other ones that are getting a dash first, and then you go one step down to synthetics, and then you go one step down to NPM and rum, and then you go down to security.
And so that's the order, which by the way I think you've a question we might get later, but we're planning to invest a lot more because we see so much success with that platform approach. We see all these products have a pretty interesting growth curve, and we think there is a lot more public space for us to cover, which is why we are aggressively building the team and hiring. And we're also proceeding through these acquisitions. Great. Thank you. And just to follow up, if we look at billings, I mean, on a portfolio basis, I think you said it was up 61% RPO, CRPO was up in the mid-60s, but then the revenue grow guide for 21 is in the high 30. So I realized billings aren't going to factor in usage, but can you help us think about how to reconcile the really strong feelings for if we saw exiting ‘20 and with the revenue growth guide for ‘21? Thanks. Thanks. Yes, I think we had a strong new logo. We also had, as we mentioned extension of the duration of billings and contracts from our clients. So those were some of the factors that cause the strong performance, we try to get everyone sort of back to the revenue growth and then the linearity within the quarter, which one can look at ARR because of the variabilities in billing and RPO due to billings. But we did have strong new sales as well as the extension of duration in the quarters we mentioned, which contributed to that performance. Understood. Thank you. Next one on line is Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. You are now live. Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to revisit the security topic again and traditionally when we think about whap adoption, that's usually been the security so-so organization kind of driving that adoption. Rasp is a newer area. And what I'm curious is do you need a dedicated security Salesforce to properly penetrate the opportunity or is there enough buying decision and influence coming out of the dev ops areas that your existing Salesforce can adequately push the security products that you have? So the short answer to that is we don't know yet. First of all, it's going to pass it. The deal is not close yet, right? So we're spitting in a hypothetical with the companies and the companies are not murky yet. But the way we sing it is by starting from an APM product, we really lowered the friction that is involved in deploying an application security product, which typically is the problem you have when you try to deploy or last product, there is a high friction to the low and the person who wants to deploy it is not the person who actually has the authority to do it. Or can manages the server the managers the application, and we sold that with Datadog, so we think it opens up new avenues of frictionlessly deploying those products. Now how we translate on the go-to market side, if we need to officially sale, we don't know yet we're open to it. All right. Great. And then one follow-up would be just in the two plus products, you mentioned kind of the land and the adoptions by the maturity curve. But what I'm curious about is are you seeing the use cases, especially for log in APM, driving into newer areas than what you saw, let's say maybe three or four quarters ago, are you getting expansion of those products in particular new areas of your customers? So those products are still expanding a lot, right? So the adoption curve for our customer, they usually start small and then they grow and they expand the products to more and more and more of their business units and various activities, and so love and APM on the different, like they keep going with customers that way. So even when we say 70% of the customers have adopted updated product, there is still a lot of growth to be had in those customers. Got it. Thank you. Next one on the queue is Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. You are now live. Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a strong end to a crazy year. Oli, my question is on timber. Yes, for sure. My question on timber is the idea of vector to be an agnostic data pipeline and to be able to feed data to any observability platform. And in that case, how should we think about then rolling that into your offering, potentially create cooperation if you will, amongst observability platforms, or am I not thinking about it right to express it that way? No, I mean, you're right. I mean, it's important for like - if you want customers to send all the data from all the sources, they have to have some flexibility to send it to various places, right? So that's actually part of the mix there. We think it actually makes sense for us to do it, easily the, integrity experience with that will be that deacon so that it makes the most sense. And we could use the most interesting from a value perspective to send him any better, but it is important for these to be open and to cater to devalue sees Casey's who our customers have.
Another destination they want to consume the data or another source they want to add or some flexibility to filter on the fly with this end. In a way you can see that as an extension of login without limits that reaches back into the customers and prospects. Sure. Got it. Thank you. And maybe a up for David. David, how should we think about the level of sales hiring this year and the ability to ramp reps on the entire portfolio, which has expanded quite significantly? Yes, we've been successful last year as well as our plans for this year and ramping sales higher, slightly ahead of revenues. So we've been - as we talked about in the 60s, we have plants do it again. And as we've talked about, it involves both expanding into new geographies. It involves building out the teams within geographies where we've been successful. And it's what we did last year and believe we can do it again the next year. Great. Thank you guys. Yes. Next one on the line is Mohit Gogia from Barclays. You are now live. Thanks for taking my question and all in all congrats on a very strong quarter as well. So my first question is only Mendix deals that you announced last week. So I am wondering if you can give us some more color there. It sounds like this is Mendix standardizing on Datadog as its substitutability platform. I think the release also mentioned that you guys replaced the existing convenience, which were like five or six tools that the customer is using. So if you can go into some stuff like the dynamics or of your land there, or maybe you're already there and expanded from there, but any more color on the customer will be very helpful. Yes, I actually don’t have much more color, I can provide, because I am not sure which I can speak publicly, we didn't prepare anything for that, but interestingly - this was not one of the customers we mentioned in the rest of the call in the prepared notes. But I think as - has mentioned it’s - have to be a press release, but it’s typical of what has been happening with the expansion of the products across the platform where most of the motion is landing smaller and then expanding given the value of the platform to across the product set. So it’s a typical type of motion. Understood. My follow-up question is for David. So David in terms of - so I think you followed up the record new ARR in Q3 another strong quarter here in Q4. Right. So if I mean, obviously we understand the puts and takes to billings and RPO, but if I just look at ARR it seems to be things coming together very nicely off-third like a slight or other dip in Q2. So like, how should we think about the guidance? I know this question was already asked, but if I… Yeah. If I sort of like compared that to next fiscal year guidance, what to say this really two strong quarters of ARR and can you help us reconcile that? Yeah, as we said last time, and it’s a typical approach there’s a lots of positives and we are very proud of it, but we continue to take a conservative approach towards guidance given the uncertainty in the world from COVID and what might happen to enterprises. As we said, we’ve seen a less bowel to world in terms of both the growth of client usage and new logos, but continue to remain prudent and conservative when we provide guidance as we have in our quarters as a public company. One thing I will say is, when we look at our metrics internally and our usage metrics in particular those are still noisier than they were before the pandemic. And that’s - because they basically track the way the various economical impacts of the pandemic we pull through the world and the various layers of the economy. And so we want to be a little bit cautious there, if people’s behaviors have changed - and I could tell it different from what it was a year before, an example of that is, TPP at the last year or the next week of the year, there is a drop in activity, because pretty much everyone takes the week off.
And some companies turn off their development environments and things like that. This year it was more pronounced, I think because many people hadn’t taken any time off during the year, and everybody took that time off at that time. So we want to be a little bit careful about what we predict in the future. We’ve learned in Q2 that the numbers can change fast as changes to the economy happen. Okay. Very helpful. Good advice. Thank you. Next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. You are now live. Yeah, great. Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. Olivier the strengthened multi-product adoption has trended well throughout the year. I know we talk a lot of time as well your opportunity being Greenfield in rather than displacement, but when we start to talk about more and more customers adopting more and more solutions, is this leading you into more of a displacement cycle? And how does that kind of affecting your go-to-market strategy and the sale cycles to those upsales? We’re still, I would say just as - by Greenfield as we were before. And I think it’s going to be the case for the foreseeable future, which is why a lot of what we’re doing today is investing in building more products and in growing the salesforce. So we can capture as much of these Greenfield market as possible. Yeah, that’s helpful. And then I know security is a newer opportunity, but could you touch on any changes you’ve seen following sunburst, maybe even outside of security. It feels like there might be some elevated concerns for enterprises around observability and just kind of a renewed focus on knowing what’s happening in their environment. Yeah. Well, it’s both a challenging opportunity right. I think the whole world has asked themselves what was happening with their software supply chain, where they were running, which is good. I think it opens some opportunities that some, I would say minor short-term opportunity, because we do see some customers that want to replace their network monitoring and our network device monitoring product is fairly new, but we see some interest in that for that reason.
I think longer-term, there’s definitely a growing problem that is understanding what’s running, understanding your supply chain, understanding what your applications doing, and that’s why we’re investing in security. I think there’s going to be a long-term opportunity there. So many short-term some replacement there, but the real opportunity is the longer-term. And with the – can happen to prices basically was going on in their network and in the applications. All right. Thank you. Next question comes from Jack Andrews from Needham & Company. You are now live. This is Colin for Jack. Can you provide some color on how your relationship with Microsoft with Azure is progressing and expected ramp time in 2021? How should we be thinking about a new logo type contribution from partnership compared to organic code emotion given Microsoft leverage? It’s still not in library, still in preview. So we have some customers that have limited access to it, and we’re expecting these to be live in the first half of the year, but we don’t fully control it. So there’s two or three billings out before that. We look at hard to tell, would be in fact going to be - we do expect it’s going to have a positive impact. I don’t want to tell us before it happens. What I will say though, is that we already got back from existing customers and - already in our pipeline that this integration and the partnership with Microsoft is helping them move with confidence in better again and extend with us. So we’ve seen a few last steps really very positively to that. So we are, I would say we’re already pretty satisfied with the impact. Thank you. That’s helpful. And can you talk about some of the gains you’re seeing from customers to adopt solutions from your marketplace in terms of sales cycles and ease of use or using any changes in my cohort behavior, given that these customers can derive value from your platform more quickly? So we democratize telling you, right. So it’s still quite a bit that needs to happen in terms of the offering there and the breadth of the attorney, I would say. But we do have some - Not clear anymore. I might on mute. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let me try again. I would be saying that the platform is still fairly new like the marketplace. And but we do see some customers that are only the adopting applications to the marketplace, and completing their additive platform with software that we haven’t written it out which is very, very interesting. And some of these marketplace it’s actually fairly meaningful. So this is I would say this is an encouraging sign. Again just see a lot of work to be done, a lot of building and lots of partners to recruit on to platform. So still fairly early, but we have some very good validating signs very early on. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Next line on the queue is George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer. You are now allowed. Thank you for taking my question. So Olivier kind of following up on the strong multi-product adoption. Are you seeing any consolidation of the number of tools at your customers and kind of just a broad look at the overall competitive landscape? Yeah, so we definitely, we mentioned a few examples of customers that are considering on us, right. Because they don’t want to have their teams jump between tools. They don’t want to have separate tools between the teams. So we definitely see that. In terms of the competitive landscape, it’s a bit boring in that we haven’t seen any noticeable change in the past year, I would say to a pretty much the same situation as it was before where the most of the opportunity is Greenfield, a lot of up in petition is open source to yourself. And then occasionally, we’re going to have some large lends from customers that have already had something before and switched to us, but that’s not the dominant motion. All right, thank you. And then David, when you talked about the duration extending a bit. When you’re looking at your guidance, do you expect that to either flatten out or start to contract maybe later in the year? We think that that can be ascetic with, as we talked about with that particular quarter and the contracts that come up. There hasn’t been any change in strategy. Our strategy is to get annual commits and to offer mainly upfront billing on demand. That’s still the dominant way to go-to-market. So what happens in the variability is some clients want a multi-year arrangement, or they want a certain billing, but we really haven't changed our assumptions sort of where we are longer term in terms of duration. Thank you. Next one on the line is Bhavan Suri from William Blair. You are now live. Thanks for the question guys. And I'll echo my congrats. And that was a solid quarter. I guess, I just want to touch a couple of quick things here on Synthetics. You started charging for Synthetics. I think it was - correct me if I'm wrong. Q3 ‘19, you've talked about seeing all attractions, just not to assume what the growth has been in that business specifically, attach rates maybe how it's trending relative to your expectations, because you do bring up a little bit in the call, but we didn't get much color. I'd love to hear how that's doing? Yes, it's going very well. I think we talked about the size and growth of the products is really aligned to when they were initiated. And we set last quarter, we were having tremendous success that Synthetics was multiple tens of millions of dollars type customer, early in its growth, had very strong adoption, and it's been as we talked about sort of the number four product in terms of the size after infrastructure logs and APM together. So we're continued to see very strong reception as part of the overall platform. Yes, look, we're very, as we said, and I said, if you go to your network monitoring and run, which were introduced after Synthetics, both have adoption is very similar will occur and a very good growth curve. So we have to think about all those products. The curves might differ a little bit between the products, because they have different levels of friction to heavily from levels of applicability and both maps and have in depth I would say, but overall, we so far we don't have any data in our platform, so we feel good about that. Good to know. Absolutely. And then one other one from me, you usually you disclose this metric and maybe a better wrong, but I don't think you've given the 1 million customer count in previous quarters. I'd love to understand how that trended through the year. And if you saw a budget flush of December, which might've driven a jump in seven figure deals? Yes, we said that we would be delivering that once a year and providing some color. So it's the end of the year. As I think we told you, we saw steady growth of that in a year. I think it sort of mimic the rest of the effect in the business where that type of evolution either from land or expand was more difficult in Q2 and improved throughout the year commensurate with our new logo around our expansion. Got you. That's super helpful. Thanks guys. I really appreciate you taking my question. You're welcome. For the next question we do have Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. You are now live. Thank you. This is Joey Marincek for Pat. I was going off that last question, I wanted to dig in on those larger customers. I'm just wondering, has your conversations changed at all of these larger customers, maybe just how you're approaching them? Thank you. The conversation hasn't really changed much. I think continuity, which is what has happened in the past, which is that those customers are adopting more and more of our products, and they're deploying us more and more broadly, and they themselves are getting deeper and deeper into the cloud.
So the boundaries between customers that are million plus or 10 million it's arbitrary, but we have a large number of customers right above it, large number customers with below it. And we keep pushing customers up. Basically there's nothing new or different there, I think, would you speak to leave customers continue to end up more of a product and more of a platform and they continue to move to the cloud. Thank you so much. Next one on the line is Brad Rebeck from Stifel. You are now live. Thank you very much. Oli, traditionally you've talked about the frictionless adoption of the platform as being a key, focus. So as you continue to build out into new areas, how important is it to maintain that frictionless type of environment versus taking on some more difficult problems that may include get deeper sales efforts up front? Thanks. Well, we're okay with both, right? But we can also - like there is a lot - we can still do to play to our strengths. And we're very far from covering the full spectrum of problems we can solve in a completely frictionless way. So in summary, as especially security, like it's possible that we will need different kinds of sales. And I would say a bit more friction that deployments, but we're not done with the frictionless products. And the one that we have today are still very far from being fully penetrated and maybe variety of customers. So there is a very long runway for all of that. Great. Thanks very much. Next one on the line will be Michael Turits from KeyBanc. You are now live. Hi, David and Oli. One of your competitors has made some very extensive changing to change their pricing structure. Are you seeing any impact from that or any pressure to make any kinds of changes structurally in the way you press? We haven't seen any developments there though. I think it's - and look it's possible that customers want to change the way to consume services and things, but we haven't seen anything so far to where, as I said, the competitive landscape is boring in ugly so far. And David just a quick housekeeping, you talked about billings getting some boost from duration extension. Can you quantify that for this corner? Both in contracts and billing that were both a couple months. So both of them had been sort of in 7 to 10, 12. And so they both extended a couple of months, but again, we want to caution everybody that may be related the bill that went out at the end of the year, et cetera. And we don't expect any real changes in the way we're sort of going to market and interacting with our customers. And what is the invoicing duration on average now, what has been roughly? That range has been sort of in the six to eight range. And the contact duration has been a couple months longer than that, and they both expanded, but again, we're not drawing conclusions based on one quarter, I'm pausing everybody. So it has been six to eight and it was up a couple of months this quarter on invoicing duration. Next one on the queue is Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. You are now live. Okay. Thank you. Hi guys. So it's great that the usage trends were good again this quarter and that you're now approximately back to pre-COVID levels. And what I was curious about is now that we're another quarter removed from the Q2, just to get your thoughts on the likelihood of a similar spike in cloud optimization reoccurring at some point. In other words, do you think that we would probably need to see another exogenous shock or long tail type event for usage to move around materially in any given quarter? So I don't have - even what is going to happen to the vaccines in the rest of the pandemic. So I'll defer on that. In terms of what the cycles of optimization that, they happen from time-to-time from our customers now, whether they all got on the same schedule, not because they would optimize at the same time. I don't know. I don't think we'll continue to work the same way. But again, we want to be a little bit prudent with our numbers because as I said, the early it'll be a noisier than pre-pandemic. And we won't set the right expectation there. Okay. Thanks Oli. And then just David any changes to average deal size of this quarter across either new or existing customers? We did have more an increase of the new logos. Broadly speaking, we have some, some range of that. So we talked about that was part of our new logo performance in Q4. And over time, we have a steady increase of the average spend with our customers as they grow with us as part of the land and expand. All right. Thank you. Next question comes from line of Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. You are now live. Thank you. So, Oli, there was an earlier question on the impact of solar winds and summers. Are you seeing that events dragging closer collaboration between dev ops and security ops? And is that what's driving somewhat of a waiting… I'm sorry. I think you got cut off. We will take the next. Yes, Maybe David and operator we end the call here. So we are ending the call. So yes, thank you everyone. Again, I'd like to reset the setup. We're very pleased with performance in the fourth quarter and as well as the performance for the full-year. As a closing word, I am very proud of the execution, and I want to thank our employees for their hard work and a high output is what has been a difficult year for most people. One thing that's important to remember is that we are more critical to our customers than ever before, and as we move to cloud is proving to be truly essential. So I and Datadog are excited to continue to make their life easier in 2021 and years to come. So thank you all. Ladies and gentleman this concludes today’s conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks Yuka. Welcome to the team at Datadog. And thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong start to the year and are very pleased with our performance in Q1, which was strong across all parts of the business and again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It has been a busy start of the year, we had two products become generally available, Continuous Profiler, and Incident Management. We closed the acquisition of Sqreen and Timber. And we continued to release new features and innovations across our platform. In addition, we continue to hire and build our team at a very rapid pace.
Now to review the quarter. To summarize Q1 at a high level, revenue was $199 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,437 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 960 last year. These customers generate over 75% of our ARR. We have about 15,200 customers, up from about 11,500 in the year ago quarter. This means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, making it another strong quarter of adds and consistent for the last few quarters.
We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $44 million. And finally, our dollar-based net retention rate continues to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and added to our newer products. In addition to that, the positive business trends from recent quarters have continued in Q1. First, usage growth from existing customers was stronger than expected and above historical levels. Among other factors, we are seeing the benefit of new logos signed in the back half of last year as they grow into their commitment.
Second, new logo ARR was strong in what is normally a seasonally slower quarter. Showing our go-to-market investments are paying off. And third, churn continues to remain very low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added. In fact, we hit an important milestone, as we added over $100 million of ARR in a single quarter for the first time.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q1, 75% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 63% last year. Additionally, 25% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 12% a year ago. And we also have hundreds of customers using six or more of our nine generally available products. But it's still early. We think this is an interesting proof point that shows the continued sell opportunity in our customer base.
And we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products. I’d like to provide an update on some of our more recent products, Network Performance Monitoring, Real User Monitoring and Synthetics. Both Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring became generally available a bit more than a year ago and we are excited to share that both are at approximately eight figures of ARR, and are showing high growth. And Synthetics also continues to grow rapidly, and it’s an increasingly important contributor to revenue.
As a reminder, our newer products are often adopted first by just selecting customers at small scale before our land-and-expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from our single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers.
Well, we are very pleased with the performance of our newer products, I also want to spend some time on the core of our observability platform. Infrastructure, APM and logs, all three added record amounts of ARR in the quarter, showing the strength of our platform. APM and logs have both reached last scale, and remaining hypergrowth while infrastructure continues to grow at a healthy base. To give you a sense of scale, APM and logs together added more ARR this quarter that the business as a whole did one year ago. So it is clear to us that these products are each strong enough to the best of breed solutions on their own.
And to that point Datadog was recognized as a leader in Gartner’s 2021 Magic Quadrant for APM for the first time. And in fact, we were the only vendor in the leader quadrant that improved its position to the last report. Gartner have specifically highlighted or strong history of product development, and our ability to bring products to market rapidly. As a reminder, we entered the APM market just four years ago. And our APM product has a robust feature set, including end-to-end distributed tracing with no sampling and seamless correlation of traces with end-to-end observability. The ability to triage problem was also highlighted as strength with a unified platform assisting in root cause analysis and reducing resolution time.
And lastly, our transparent pricing, which is available on our website, was also recognized as helping to build customer trust. We also continue to make investments in the Watchdog, which is the brain behind AI-based features across the Datadog platform. In Q1, we announced a few enhancements, including Watchdog Insights, which is a recommendation engine that is always on and automates manual investigations by automatically detecting anomalies and outliers and allowing for faster times resolution. We also announced the beta of Watchdog root cause analysis, which automatically identifies closer relationships between different issues across applications infrastructure, and pinpoints the root cause.
In addition, we continued innovating across our platform, releasing 38 features in Q1 and crossing 450 out of the box integrations. A few features to highlight include Network Performance Monitoring for Microsoft Windows, which is a very differentiated feature for Datadog NPM. New marketplace integration, including Oracle Cloud, as well as the official launch of our GovCloud instance allowing us to onboard early customers in the government space.
Lastly, on the product side, I want to briefly discuss our acquisition of Sqreen, which closed in early April. We find it Datadog to breakdown silos between Dev and Ops teams and as we’ve discussed previously, we are working to extend that to security teams as well. Stream is an application security solution that actively detects attacks and can track trace them down to the impacted function call. It prevents application security exploits and enables response across development, security and upstream. We are very excited at the combination of Sqreen with our APM and security offerings, as we expect it to allow our customers to protect APM submitted applications with very little additional friction. And we will share updates as we progress with integrating external platform.
Now, let’s switch gears and move on to sales and marketing. I am very proud of the continued productivity from our go-to-market team. As we mentioned last quarter, we have been hiring at a rapid pace across our sales order, and are seeing more teams and reps becoming productive. Now, let’s discuss of our wins this quarter. First, we had a seven-figure land was one of the world’s largest consulting firms undergoing a multi-billion dollar cloud migration. With Datadog they have reduced their monitoring costs by more than 35% with greater visibility into every layer of their stack, including several functions.
Next, we had a six-figure or high tech figure, I should say, land deal was a major transportation company. The company is moving towards a DevOps culture, but was hindered by a proliferation of siloed and underutilized monitoring tools. After implementing Datadog engineers now have a single easy to use platform that facilitates mass adoption.
Next, we had a six-figure land from the largest supermarket chain. The company has 1000s of stores and is in the process of migrating from legacy IT to an Azure based cloud. Datadog unified platform help enable this migration and reduce mean time to resolution by up to 50%.
Next, I want to discuss a seven-figure up sales EVA online gaming company. Prior to Datadog business units were spending too much time responding to incident and look for a single source of truth visibility across all teams and systems. This company reduce its usage from eight observability tools to one and Datadog is also used by executives all the way up to the CEO.
Last, we had a seven-figure up sale to an existing million dollar plus customer in the financial services. During COVID this large enterprise accelerated its digital transformation journey as they enhanced their digital tools and money presence. And it continues to grow with Datadog as they migrate more workloads to the cloud and have adopted newer products like NPM and Synthetics.
Moving on now to a longer term outlook. While the pandemic continues to impact the macro environment, businesses are starting to turn to priorities in the post-COVID world. Business is must be digital first, which we expect will move forward digital transformation projects, massive IT platforming is still in its early stages. We believe we are in a great position with a unified observability platform. While there is the possibility for more near term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute and in our long-term opportunity.
Before handling the call to David, there are two changes to the management team I would like to bring to your attention. First, our Chief Revenue Officer, Dan Fougere will transition out of the company this quarter to take some well deserved time off after a few decades of hard work. We are very grateful to Dan for many quarters of growth and for developing a world class organization. We are confident that the team is built will continue carrying the torch and will exceed expectations, the data the way. We also running a search for new CRO, now evaluating both internal and external candidates.
Second, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon be joined by our first ever Chief Operating Officer, Adam Blitzer, who joins us after a successful tenure as an EVP and GM at Salesforce. Adam will help us scale as a SaaS platform company and will oversee a number of our front office functions.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David? Thanks, Olivier. We had a very strong start to the year revenues was $198.5 million, up 51% year-over-year against the challenging year ago comp. Usage trends were strong and show broad-based growth. New logo generation continues to be strong and customers continue to adopt more products across the platform. To provide some more context first, growth of existing customers was robust again, and our dollar base net retention rate remained above 130% for the 15 consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which indicates continued adoption of our platform and continued migration to the cloud even in the face of macro pressures.
As Oliv mentioned, usage growth was stronger than expected and above historical levels and usage growth was broad base across our customer base. Also, we added a record number of 100,000 plus customers in the quarter given our land and expand model, a majority of these ads were existing customers. In addition, we had a strong uptick in the quarter in million dollar customers.
Next, our new logo results were strong. In fact, it was our second best new logo, ARR quarter ever, and a record for Q1. Contributions were strong across our enterprise and commercial sales channels. Earlier Olivier shared several large new logo wins across more traditional industries and encouraging sign as companies across a wide spectrum, start embracing digital transformation projects. Remember that given our uses based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue.
Next in the first quarter we saw continued strength, as Olivier discussed in our platform strategy, with 75% of our customers using two or more products, and 25% of our customers now using for more products, up from only 12% a year ago.
Next churn was consistent with historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers. Our dollar base gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the mid-90s. And this was true across customer segments, and in each of our infrastructure, APM and log products. Taken together, this resulted in a record quarter of ARR at over $100 million and up significantly versus Q1 last year.
Now turning to billing. Billings worth $220 million, up 59% year-over-year, there were no major proforma impacts to call out in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations are RPOs was $464 million, up 81% year-over-year. Contract duration continued to be at an increased level from the year-ago period. RPO strength is driven by strong annual billings and commitments, as well as a few large multi year commits. It is important to know that those multiyear commits are billed annually. And we do not incentivize our sales force for multiyear deals given our high net retention.
Current RPO growth was also strong in the high 60%. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts, while revenue incorporates customer usage.
Now, let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $153 million, representing a gross margin of 77%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 80% in the year ago period. The slight decrease in gross margin as we've discussed before is due to our investments in product and platform innovation.
We expect gross margin to continue to be slightly down from last year in the remainder of the year, as we build out new cloud data centers and prioritize product development. R&D expense was $61 million, or 31% of revenue, compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including a high growth in our engineering head count. Engineering head count continues to grow slightly ahead of the pace of revenue growth and we have been able to attract talent and are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans, despite COVID.
Sales and marketing expense was $53 million, or 28% of revenues, compared to 32% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. But the pace of the revenue growth has outpaced pace investment growth. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows and marketing events. And while we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it is not on a one-for-one ratio.
G&A expense was $16 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter and operating income was $20 million or a 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $16 million or 12% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $20 million or $0.06 a share, based on $344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash from operation was a strong $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $44 million for margin of 22%. Free cash flow was driven by strong collections stemming from our strong billings in Q4 and Q1.
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2021. We believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future, as we are addressing a very large greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunity and have seen an uptick in metrics driving our business growth. Taking this into account with our usual conservativism implies, we're updating our guidance as follows. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $211 million to $213 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 51% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million.
And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.03 to $0.04 per range, based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenues are expected to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million, which represents a 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.16 per share based on $345 million weighted average diluted shares.
Now, some notes on our guidance, while usage growth was strong in Q1, when providing guidance as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Next, our strategic focus remains investing to optimize for the long-term. Therefore, we are planning to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-markets throughout 2021. We believe the efficiencies of our business are evident, and we are confident in our ability to be a sizeable and materially profitable company over the long-term.
Additionally, our model assumes the return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility on these topics, but believe it's prudent to incorporate this in our outlook. Finally, in early April, we closed our acquisition of screen. We are pleased to welcome more than 50 members of the screen team today to dock. The acquisition has an immaterial impact on our income statement. And our cash flow statement in Q2 will reflect the $190 million of cash that we paid for the acquisition.
Now below the operating income line. We expect approximately $1 million of Q2 non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in 2021, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. We expect the tax provision to be approximately $700,000 in Q2 and $3 million for the full year.
Now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of the quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both in terms of usage and cross selling to newer products, and the execution remained strong. We believe the importance of our solutions will only be strengthened long-term by the continued trends of cloud migration and digital transformation.
And now, with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Hey, thanks and congrats on an amazing quarter. Olivier, can you – you talked about the growing momentum you have around APM and the recognition you get from the industry experts? Can you talk a little bit about where we are in terms of APM adoption in your client base in terms of number of applications that are getting properly monitored? And what are you seeing in terms of where you are getting used where maybe some of the traditional legacy guys are getting used for APM? Thank you. Yes, so great question. I think we are seeing a lot of adoption from APM, I think anyway, we back an eternity ago, when we took the company public, we were saying that APM probably had a bit of a longer fuse to it, but had a very long runway as more and more applications move to the cloud and more than become critical, and that's what we see happen today. In terms of our penetration among customer application, that keeps up with the ratio of the – let's call it the instances or containers that are covered with APM from the total recycling containers that we see for infrastructure monitoring. There is quite a bit of runway in there, but that ratio is already higher than the famous Gartner Quadrant of 5% applications being monitored. So we think we're clearly targeting to build applications in major cloud environments.
We are starting to see from some of our larger enterprise customers, some of their on-prem applications that are being instrumented with our APM as well, but I would say that’s more of a Phase 2 of adoption as opposed to what we have and how we start with customers. Thank you. And we do have our next question from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats to the team on a really exceptional quarter, really good start to the year. To follow on Raimo’s question, I think what sort of impressing me is the multi product adoption, and frankly, in some of the newer category, so you mentioned APM logs, but you also called out networking as well, and some of the other new products. When you think about the networking opportunity, what's driving that strong growth? Is it just maturity of the product sort of being a year two product? Or did you see some benefits from some of the competitors like SolarWinds, of course the SUNBURST attack? How do you see that networking opportunity for Datadog relative to APM and some of the other products? I think it's a combination of – there is a lot of market need, because networking, especially in next-generation cloud environment, and especially for companies that have one foot in the cloud and one foot in prem, is not something that is well covered in terms of monitoring and understanding, so there is a big need there. And the second part of that is, as you mentioned, the product maturity, I mean, that product is getting better and better, it covers more and more of the use cases, which means it goes from being great for a small number of customers to be in great form larger and larger fraction of our market and customer data.
When do we switching off that is what we announced – mentioned in the call today, which is the our performance monitoring today also works for Microsoft, Windows. And as it turns out, it's very differentiated to have a cloud-based network performance monitoring product that also works on Microsoft, Windows, and it helps a lot of those customers with very hybrid deployment. Makes a ton of sense, Olivier. And then as a follow-up question, as we think about the new announcement with a great hire for the CEO position. Can you sort of walk us through the thinking around why now is the right time to bring the CEO on board, is it about where the businesses in terms of scale, was there a certain new market segments that you want to target? What’s sort of the thinking behind bringing on a Chief Operating Officer in today’s doc? Well, the thinking is we need to scale the team. We – fast forward a few years will be a lot bigger, and we're building a platform, there is a number of things that we'll need to do, right and there is a number of – there is going to be a number of times to solve along the way. And it was always given that we need to grow the bandwidth of the senior management team. And as we embarked on that, we also thought to bring into the company some experience with later stages of scale and growth look like for SaaS companies, and especially SaaS platform companies, which explains to you the hire we're making here. Makes a lot of sense. Congrats again. Thank you. And we do have our next question from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Thanks, I just wanted to follow-up on the question around Adam, obviously a huge endorsement for you guys. But Adam was the founder of a company and effectively was running a lot of the outbound activity. And I'm curious, most COOs, at least the definition of taking care of the inside of the company versus the outside. Can you just talk to his role on the outside and with customers in the interaction versus the folks on the inside, I think there is just some – trying to understand, where he is going to be spending most of his time? Yes, it's a great question. And the focus is actually on a lot of the [indiscernible] function. And these are going to have to do with servicing our customers and growing our customers. I won't go into too much details – our teams are – like, we have a fairly idiosyncratic setup for how we go-to-market and how we serve customers. That is aligned with our learn and expand low friction model. But, Adam is going to lead a number of those teams. Okay, great. And focus is outwards instead inwards. Okay, that's great. A quick one for David, just you mentioned duration is up. Can you remind us what the duration is now versus what you saw a year ago? Yes, the billings duration we said, it's in the seven – around seven months and the contract duration spread out towards – more towards a year and then nine plus months. And it's maintain that so what we saw was over the last couple quarters, given the multi-year contracts and the increase of annual billing, the contract duration increased. Okay, thanks for the color. Yes. And we do have our next question from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Yes. Thank you. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. So thinking about the capabilities of screen and the potential cross-sell opportunities, could you give us a little color on what type of solutions your customers currently have to address these needs? And if you think of this as a competitive environment within your customer, it's more of another greenfield opportunity. So it's really more of a greenfield opportunity. Today, customers typically don't have anything or they have something it's not really deployed. And the reason for that is that to inject application security inside the application, there's actually quite a bit of friction. Where the combination with Datadog and with our APM makes sense is that we've already incurred that friction to instrument the application with APM and the point of infection is the same. And that's where we think the proverbial one plus one equals three happens by adding Sqreen to Datadog.
And I should say, it's only going to be the start, right. I mean, we – there's a lot more we want to do in application security. In the rest of security, the first step is we need to plug the detection protection directly at the APM level with Sqreen. And that kind of leads directly into what I wanted to go to for my second question, which is, Olivier, you guys are really have a front row seat to digital transformation. And you obviously then get to also see some of the security challenges that arise from that so what are some of those other areas of security that maybe you're seeing as pain points for your customers? Well, there's many. Look to the – it seems like every other month, there's a large scale attack that brings a new array of security into focus. But the way we see the world and the way it leads to us, we're focusing on applications in the cloud. And for that, we think there are important aspects of it that happen at the application level, which is what we're addressing with Sqreen. There are important aspects of it, that are happening at the infrastructure level. And we have a few different products that we started last year.
And that we're still developing and shipping around that, then there's one big part of it that has to do with putting all this information together into an actionable system of record. In the on-prem world would be a team. We also have a product, a security monitoring product that is a precursor to a team that we're building into a team that's not there yet. So we really intend to cover that whole spectrum specifically for applications to the cloud, and specifically for use cases that are going to bring together DevOps and security.
In general, when you think of the problems companies have in this current environment. The first one is that the tooling is very bare bones, most of it doesn't exist or is too high friction, it doesn’t get developed, it doesn't get deployed. But the other thing that happens in most of the companies that is really, really hard to operationalize security because it's hard to get that in ops and security to be on the same page and work together. And that's where I think we can make a big difference if we use our platform the right way and if we build those products right. Thank you. And we do have our next question from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another well executed quarter. I want to touch on the partner network. You announced kind of the launch of the former partner network in January kind of expands go-to-market, sell service for implementation and things like that. Can you just talk about the early interest you're seeing there, the traction because you're not a heavy services companies. There's not a lot of implementation or lift here. So how is that playing out? And kind of how does that play into sort of more of a medium term, long-term channel strategy. Is this really a growth driver? Is this sort of efficiency driver? How should we think about that? So for us, it's really a growth driver, right. I think when you look at Datadog, we have plenty of efficiency. And the way we think about everything is how do we get the biggest part of that market, which we think is going to be gigantic? How do we build the products we need to get to all that? How do we reach all the customers across all regions in all segments to get there so that's how we think about it. So when we look at our partner program, we see it to that lens, and we are very happy with the adoptions we've had there.
There's a number of things we need to do still, I mean, it's still I would say very early, we have validating wins, like we've talked about some of those in previous calls. But there's a lot more we want to build over the next year. I would say so, more specific update in this quarter. But I do expect that we'll talk about it again. Got you, got you, got you. And then I want to touch a little bit on sort of pricing and competition kind of combined. If I were to look at pricing in general, you're viewed as kind of having a really attractive price point in terms of modern vendors. But then, as you get into enterprises, given the scale, you're being deployed at, whether pricing is cheap or expensive is different, but it becomes a big number. And guys, like New Relic, Sumo, Splunk, have all made adjustments to pricing models in the last 12 months. In your last quarter, you said you're having a pricing model. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any pushback at the enterprise level? Are you seeing customers after price concessions?
Anecdotally, just some sense of the confidence you have that there is sort of a non-issue around pricing at the enterprise level, given the scale again, I'd love to understand how you think about that, and what you're seeing competitively those guys sort of use pricing as a FUD or maybe even as a way to get into some accounts. Yes, so first of all, on pricing and price push back. Look, we have customers that pay us more than $10 million a year. I knew that somebody’s paying them $10 million a year and is not asking for a lower price. But look, at the end of the day, the way we think about it is this is very high leverage thing for our customers. And this is a tiny compared to what they spend on their infrastructure and on their engineering teams. And the way we think about pricing for all the data and everything they send us is that these models are going to grow exponentially over time. They're going to grow faster than these customers top line for all practical purposes.
And so pricing will have to adapt, how smart we are about getting, interpreting that data, or how we price and how we structure the model that is customers care more and more with us. I will say that while we do have pricing conversation with customers, especially large ones, we don't see the kind of competitive pressure, you might imagine if you read the competition in the marketing website. The best illustration of that would be, David mentioned in the call that we had gross retention in the mid-90s. And this is stable across various segments of our customers. Also stable across products if you take each of our infrastructure APM and logs products individually, you see the same numbers. What this tells you is that there's very little that goes away. There's not a lot of room there for control price-driven competition. Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions and great job again. And we do have our next question from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Hey, guys, first of all quick regulations. I’d like to continue on the competitive front relative to a couple of directions. One, obviously, announcement from Splunk recently; secondly, the impact of Open-source OpenTelemetry; and third, whether or not there’s any change from the cloud vendors recent announcement AWS. So, I have the usual boring answer, which is that we don’t really see any change to the competitive landscape. It’s a bit early for me to comment on the Splunk announcements, because if they just did that yesterday, but from what we could see, it seems to be somewhat announcement from the repackaging of the product they had been doing for the past few quarters, and that we had seen in the market. So there’s no big change of surprise. And on the other side, that we don’t see from anybody else, we don’t see any big change that is impacting us much. The biggest impact of competitive announcements I see is, is typically the day of the announcement where somebody has to figure out what’s going on and explain it. And that’s about it. We don’t – we are not condition given a productive document, and we also know condition given in our go to market. So let me follow up on that maybe just drill down further, I brought up OpenTelemetry, is there any sense that with those open to energy that the agent is essentially commoditize is that. So is that forcing you in any way to focus even more, so let’s call up the stack in terms of analytics or other value at. Also we were so first of all, we fully – we all only know OpenTelemetry as well. And to us, it’s not a change, right, our agent was Open-source already. It’s – it was free for everybody, including our competition to reduce. We lean into open source format and libraries to instrument obligations for a very long time. And we support a large number of them. The way we see the problem is not like what matters is not with technology we use to get from here to there. What matters is to solve the end to end problem for our customers. And to make it as easy as possible for them to just plug us in and everything just work everything to show that we don’t get our mess, a gigantic mess with all these different technologies and applications and clouds, everything else. We turn that into something that the understanding is well ordered, without any effort. That’s what we hit the market in the end. And that’s what we see all of this and device bits and pieces that appear in the middle like the format’s and the libraries and everything else is will change and it has changed, will change its doesn’t matter. Okay, thanks very much. Nice quarter. Next question from Jack Andrews from Needham. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, I’ve been jumping around calls. But I just had a broader question. Just – when we think about just the proliferation of new products that you can continue to introduce, how would you characterize where your Salesforce is in terms of just their knowledge and ability to really understand and appropriately sell all this functionality that you have to offer? Well, so far it’s working. I think, look, we do have a fairly differentiated go to market and the way we organize internally, which to know where we land. We’ll end with and hope customers adopt your product, and how they learn about those products. So, it doesn’t rely on having every single sales rep, understanding every single little feature we have in every product to product, that wouldn’t be practical. So it is working, we’re very confident in that. I would say, there’s a point at which we might have to consider tweaking the way we go to market. And I think that we’ll have to do more with when we start actively selling to what might be different buyers. And I think we’ve discussed this before. But as I’m thinking more specifically of the security market, we’re not there yet. We’re not actively pushing to the security buyers today with our product. But when that happens, we might have to make some tweaks, win a day. Okay, thanks. So just as a quick follow up, can you maybe just talk about how much of your new business today is perhaps generated from partnerships with the public cloud vendors, I believe, have strategic relationships with all three of the big clouds entering the year here. So, how should we be thinking about their relative contributions moving forward? So, we don’t have any, any numbers to share on that. I will say that, a lot of the historically a lot of that has been informal in that we work alongside the provider, but there’s no formal agreement or RevShare and everything else. We started to put some of those in place more recently, around the committed resources for going to market jointly, things like that. But we didn’t have anything to share on that. Okay, thanks. Congratulations on the result. And we do have our next question from Andrew Nowinski from Davidson. Customers, I think he had 97 in Q4 that spent over a million in ARR. Can you just give us any more color around what do you call the strong uptick in those customers this quarter? And then did you have any outsize deals in the quarter? Let me just take that as a metric. We said we were going to announce that once a year and give some comment on flavors. So, we’re not going to give the number but, it was a – it’s a strong uptick. And as we talked about, it has a lot to do with the expansion of customers into that $1 million range. As far as a concentration in the quarter, nothing out of the ordinary, we continue to have some very needy labs, but given the land and expand model and the number of customers bring on we don’t have a concentration that produces a quarter. Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow up question on the gross margin side, you ticked down a little bit lower than expected. Was there anything abnormal on the gross margin side? Did you expect that to come back up going forward? It’s the way we see. Go ahead David. Yes, sorry… Yes, so on a gross margin, so the way we think about this is due to us having the product teams work on product development, instead of working on optimizing, and we’re still happy with gross margins where they are, they might still fluctuate, they probably would fluctuate a bit lower than they were last year because we’re very busy building product. But there’s nothing fundamentally changed around our margin. And there’s many other things we can do in the future to optimize if we so wish. So right now the call we’re making is we focus on product development, we focus on making sure that we grow the top-line in the short and mid-term and then we – if things get out of hand on the gross margin side, we’ll spend some more time on optimization. Got it? Thank you. And we do have our next question from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. All right, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the CRO position, I think you mentioned that in prepared remarks looking for a new one. I mean, should we take that to mean that perhaps is more even more of an enterprise focus as it relates to your go to market organization? Just curious, what type of person you’re looking for? And what if anything we should read in queue as we think about any sort of evolution with the go to market motion of the of the company. Thank you. Yes, there’s really nothing to read to it. I think it’s a continuation of what we have. Right now where we have a deep bench on the leadership side, we’re very happy with the leadership we have in place. And we’ll still be looking at going to be looking for a new CRO, and we’re going to be looking at candidates both internally and externally for that, but there’s no willing desire to change course or anything fundamentally different from where we were. Got it, thank you. And apologies if this has been asked, but in terms of duration, I know that, in prior quarters, it seems like that was coming in customers were looking to do shorter deals, anything changing on that front? I mean, it seems like all the work has been in the business, certainly, as we get into recovery here used to just going higher. Just curious, if you could comment on duration? Yes, it pulled in, and we talked about in Q3 as risk management happened. And then we said in Q4, both billings and contract duration pulled back out basically, in billings, in the seven to eight and contract duration nine, 10s around that. And it has to do with, client preferences. And we continued to have that same sort of duration in Q1 that we had in Q4. So it's very similar to the trend we talked about last time, which is more duration on contracts year-over-year but between Q4 and Q1, there really wasn't much change in the way clients approached the contracting. Got it. Thank you very much. And we do have our next question from a Yun Kim from Loop Capital. Great. First, congrats on a strong quarter Oli and David, you mentioned that a strong usage trend, driving strong results in the quarter, is there any way to qualify whether that joins in usage came from, existing deployments, or relatively new deployments that just happened to ramp in the quarter and then also, on usage, I know it's only Q1. But how much of that strings in usage was already captured in the contract versus, the usage that came in well above contract provision, so that cause customers to kind of renew at a higher contract volume. Thank you. Do you want to take? I'll start with that. So we had, it was very broad based across industries, we had a combination of customers that we brought on with the strong new logos in the second half of the year, and in Q1 begin to ramp because we are land and expand. And customers that were already using us and have been using us for a year or more increase their activities. We think it has a lot to do with the increase of activity on digital transformation and workloads.
As in previous quarters, about two thirds of the increase of usage was from customers using more of the products they had purchased in the previous period and about one third was a cross sell or new and that continued in the quarter. So it was a combination of new logos, increased usage of existing products, and very robust cross selling and adoption of the bought one. Okay, great. So there wasn't any necessarily different trends that kind of draw the outside in the usage trend in the quarter, per se from previous quarters. It was very, it was brought all that, all three of those were positive in terms of both the scaling of new customers, the cross-sell and the increased usage of existing products. Okay, great. And then just last question for me, can you just talk about any geographical trend that you're seeing out there that you expect to see for this year, especially in Europe. Thanks. Europe, let me take that. Europe has been strong for us. We have not seen the slower vaccination attract and we have seen, pretty good resumption of growth across all the geographies. We'll have to continue to watch it because there's variation in back to work and back to office but as it relates to Q1 and Q4 we saw fairly uniform strength across the regions. Okay, great. Thank you so much. And we do have our next question from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Okay, thank you very much and really nice quarter guys. First question is on Datadog continuous profiler and now that it's GA, what sort of trial and paid activity? Have you seen so far? It would seem like there would be a lot of interest in getting ongoing visibility into COVID performance. But any early anecdotes would be helpful there? Yes, so very happy with the product being very strong out of the gate. We don't have any numbers to share. And just to explore early in its cycle that is still number of things that we need to do to the product so that, it works well for everyone who wants to use it. But it's a product that is very beloved by its users put it this way. So it's got a very strong fan, a feeling that they can give you. Okay, that's great. And then, you mentioned earlier that you saw an uptick in metrics, would you say that your internal metrics are back to pre pandemic levels or not quite yet? Well, I think it's at this point, I'm losing track of what we're comparing to that pre pandemic level. So far back, but we love we're very happy with what happened over the Q3, Q4 and Q1. We had a very, very strong Q1. We still think, we don't know what the macro is going to who is going to impact us we still think the, because all customers are having an affected the same way, the same time. We just feel a bit more uncertain. There used to be, but look, we feel good about the business, right. I think we just increase the guidance for the full year. I think it went from 38% so close to 47%. That should tell you that we forget about where we are in about the business. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Olivier. This concludes the question and answer portion. I will now turn the call over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. Thank you. And in closing, I would just want to reiterate that we're very, very pleased with our performance to start the year. That I am personally very proud of our execution that I want to thank all of our employees or Datadog’s for the continued hard work. Thank you all. Thank you.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us for our morning call today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw real strength both across product lines and across customer segments.
For a quick review of the quarter, revenue was $234 million, an increase of 67% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range.
We ended the quarter with 1,610 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,015 in the year ago quarter. Those customers generate about 80% of our ARR. We have about 16,400 customers, which is up from about 12,100 last year.
We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $42 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products.
We are pleased that positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q2. First, usage growth from existing customers remained very robust. Among other factors, we continued to see the impact of our strong new logo growth in the past several quarters as those new customers grow into their commitment.
Second, new logo ARR was again strong and we continued to execute against our go-to-market strategy.
And third, churn continues to remain low and in line with historical rates.
Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added with over $100 million of ARR added for the second consecutive quarter.
Next, our platform strategy continued to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 75% of customers are using 2 or more products, up from 68% a year ago.
Additionally, 28% of customers are now using 4 or more products, which is up from 15% last year. And this quarter, approximately 70% of new logos landed with 2 or more products.
Our platform saw strong growth in the second quarter, which included another record of ARR added for infrastructure monitoring in a single quarter. This product is still early in its fast cycle.
Meanwhile, we continued to see very strong performance with other products in our platform. Our APM suite, including RUM and Synthetics and log management, together, reached over $400 million in ARR. The APM suite and log management also remained in hyper growth mode, but our newer other products are growing even faster. As a result, we are very pleased with the customer uptake of our end-to-end observability platform as well as the beginning of our Cloud Security Platform.
Now let's move on to product and R&D. Our teams continued to innovate and solve customer pain points. We announced 73 new features in Q2 and have continued to ship in Q3. To discuss just a few of these, we announced the general availability of 2 new security products, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security, which target security issues around infrastructure. Cloud Security Posture Management runs continuous configuration audit so customers can track environments to industry benchmarks and regulatory standards. And Cloud Workload Security performs real-time threat detection directly within the workloads themselves within hosts and containers. These are our second and third GA products in security, alongside Security Monitoring, which performs a threat detection on events and loading data streams.
With these offerings, the first building blocks of our Cloud Security Platform are coming together, and we can start delivering on our vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. And with the addition of these 2 products, we now have 11 GA products on the Datadog platform.
We are also at the beginning of our opportunity to bring observability to the CI/CD space, and we announced the beta of our CI Visibility product in late July. CI/CD is a combined practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery, allowing software to be consistently written, tested and released to production. The problem is that developers also don't have visibility into their CI/CD pipelines. They have a hard time figuring out if tests are failing and why and where in their CI/CD pipeline they are experiencing bottlenecks and issues.
Our CI Visibility product, based on our acquisition of Undefined Labs last August, helps customers gain visibility into their testing pipeline with the goal of lowering costs and increasing efficiency for their developer teams.
So we are excited about these announcements, but we're not standing still on our existing products and we'll continue to expand features to make each and every one best-of-breed.
In Synthetics, we have enabled cross-product testing and our customers can now test on Microsoft Edge and Firefox in addition to Chrome. Mobile RUM will now support Android, iOS and cross-platform frameworks like React Native. Our RUM product now covers the whole user space, including RUM applications on desktop, mobile and tablets as well as mobile apps.
And finally, we continue to improve the AI/ML capabilities of our platform with our most recent addition, including automatic detection of faulty deployments in APM and anomaly detection in Security Monitoring. These are complemented by the continued extension of Watchdog Insights, the recommendation engine we are embedding directly into our users' workflows across our platform.
As you can see, our end-to-end observability platform continues to broaden and deepen. Meanwhile, we are beginning to see -- to move forward in our cloud security, and we are in the early days with our CI/CD use cases.
As always, I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their creativity, their productivity and their continued ability to deliver the right solutions to our customers' problems.
Now moving on to sales and marketing. As hinted by our customer growth this quarter, our go-to-market teams continued to be very productive. So let's discuss some more Q2 wins. First, we had an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen financial services company, which is experiencing a surge of traffic in their core application. They rely on Datadog log management as the platform across the organization to find the root cause of issues. They saw a significant increase in usage of our existing product and recently added our Continuous Profiler to better understand their good performance in production.
Next, we had a 7-figure up-sell with a European e-commerce company. They were using multiple commercial observability tools, and one of their 2021 strategic initiatives was to consolidate and reduce costs by standardizing on Datadog to satisfy that goal while improving their team's collaboration and communication.
Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a large global accounting firm. This company is experiencing rapid growth with their online product and its teams were forced to jump from tool to tool to try and mitigate problems. With Datadog as their chosen solution for infrastructure monitoring, APM and Synthetics, they are able to decrease mean time to resolution and free up internal resources.
Next, we had a 6-figure upsell with a 30-years-old analytics software company. This company is moving more workload to Azure. With this new upsell, they standardized on Datadog for their log management needs. With our Logging without Limits functionality, this company will lower costs by an order of magnitude for log management without sacrificing any of their log data.
And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a large back-office software company. This company is growing rapidly and is planning a move to hybrid cloud. But their previous monitoring adoption rate was very low, which made it difficult for their teams to collaborate. With Datadog, their entire team now has a single platform for all their operability needs, and they recognize Datadog's impact on improving adoption and alignment across teams.
So as you can tell, we are incredibly proud of the performance of our go-to-market team this quarter, and I want to thank them for their hard work and for partnering with our customers to deliver another quarter of strong results.
Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. We see businesses now moving forward with their longer-term digital strategy. Businesses must increasingly be digital first. Azure platforming remains in its early stages, and we believe we are in a great position to help our customers with our Unified Observability platform.
Meanwhile, we are making progress on our long-term vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. As a result, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we see to democratize data and help customers increase visibility and manage complexity. And we're confident in our long-term plans and continue to work hard to execute on our strategy.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to mention that our teams are busy preparing for Dash 2021, our user conference, which will be held in late October this year. Every year at Dash, we showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show everyone what we've been up to this year. We also expect to hold an investor session at Dash. So please look out for that announcement in the fall.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David? Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q2. Revenue was $233.5 million, up 67% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong and showed broad-based growth. New logo generation was also strong and customers continued to adopt more products across the platform.
To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was again robust in Q2 and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 16th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong, driven by customers' expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our customers are continuing to pursue their cloud migrations. And as we expand with our customers, we see opportunities for them to standardize on us and consolidate their observability tool vendors.
Next, we saw a -- we saw for the second consecutive quarter of ARR adds over $100 million with broad strength across product lines, including our newer products, and strength across our regions.
New logos were also very strong. We had a record number of both gross and net new logo additions in the quarter. Both our enterprise and commercial sales teams executed strongly in the quarter, and we continued to see broad opportunities across industries and customer size. Remember, that our -- given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but do so over time.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And 70% of our customers are now using 2 or more products and 28% of our customers are now using 4 or more of our products.
Lastly, churn remained low, in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rates remained unchanged in the mid-90s and they are similar across our customer segments and products.
Billings were $270 million, up 69% year-over-year. And there were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $583 million, up 103% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity and increased contract duration. The increase in contract duration was driven by a higher mix of annual and multiyear commitments relative to the year ago quarter. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are billed annually and we do not incentivize our sales force towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was also strong at over 80% year-over-year.
I should note that we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $178 million, representing a gross margin of 76%. This compares to a gross margin of 77% last quarter and 80% in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was due to investments in our product and platform innovation.
We expect gross margin in the mid- to long term to be consistent with our historical performance.
R&D expense was $71 million or 30% of revenue compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering head count. We're pleased that we are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans in R&D.
Sales and marketing expense was $61 million or 26% of revenue compared to 33% in the year ago quarter. We continued to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but revenue growth has outpaced our investment growth. We had only a few in-person events in Q2, but we continue to plan for increased travel and event costs later in this year, of course, depending on local health and travel guidelines.
G&A expense was $16 million or 7% of revenue, down from 9% in the year ago quarter.
Operating income was $31 million or a 13% operating margin compared to the operating income of $15 million or an 11% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Although strong in the quarter, we are not optimizing for near-term margins as we see a large and dynamic market opportunity in front of us, and we are striving to invest heavily against that opportunity. But Q2, of course, demonstrates the efficiencies of our business model.
Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $32 million or $0.09 per share on 342 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $42 million with a free cash flow margin of 18%.
Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2021. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities and believe we will deliver high growth for the foreseeable future. We are addressing a very large market and are executing well against that opportunity.
Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows: for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $246 million to $248 million, which represents a 60% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.06 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
And then for the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of $938 million to $944 million, which represents a 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $87 million to $93 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 per share based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Now some notes on our guidance. First, while usage growth was strong in Q2, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Second, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. We are planning for continued aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market through the remainder of 2021. And next, our model assumes a return to the office and the resumption of travel and in-person events during Q3. That said, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees.
Regarding items below the operating income line, first, we expect approximately $0.9 million of Q3 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes the interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in Q3, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. And as a result, we expect a tax provision of approximately $600,000 in Q3 and $2 million for the full year.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our results this quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both using more of their existing products and choosing to begin using new products. We added 2 new products this quarter and now have 11 products to offer to our customers. Our execution against our R&D and go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help customers to manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation effects continues to grow.
And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. If you could maybe provide a little more color on the large customer growth. The last 2 quarters, you had exceptional results in that segment. Maybe if you can just give us a little more color on what you're seeing as these larger enterprises are standardizing on your platform? Yes. So we're still seeing some of those. I mean, I think some of those -- what we mentioned in the call in that category where customers were using something else before a collection of different things and they're standardizing on our platform and -- which creates a larger land for us. But that's still not the vast majority of our customer acquisition. By and large, we're still starting with smaller customers and going with them and then they standardize with us later on as they're further down the road in their migration to cloud environment. So we feel -- we see some of that in the proportion that is comparable to what we've seen in different quarters, but we don't see any particular trend there yet. And David, just in terms of the sales hiring plan that you have in the second half versus the first half, can you give us just some color on your quota-carrying capacity and what you're expecting to add by half of the year? Yes. As we said previously, we're trying to grow our ramp quota approximately in line with revenues. And we had, as we said, throughout COVID last year and this year, we have aggressive hiring plans, which we are executing on. And we haven't changed our sort of goals for hiring and quota expansion throughout the last couple of years. Just to rebound what David just said, we – unlike many companies that have stops and starts, we kept hiring steadily, which put us in a great position today. Right now, it’s an interesting time for hiring because the job market is very hot and there’s also many people taking some time off. So it’s a lot of effort to grow at the level at which we want, but we’re happy with the place we’re in and we’re very happy we made the choice to keep steadily recruiting throughout the pandemic. Our next question is from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Congrats on the impressive Q2 results. Olivier, what are the -- see if I can get a little more understanding of a comment you made in your script around infrastructure monitoring still being in its early days. From your perspective, what drives that sort of sentiment around infrastructure monitoring? It's been your core product that was sort of the foundation of the company and you're saying that there's still a long runway ahead. Can you just expound upon that line of thinking a little bit? Yes. I mean there's 2 aspects to it. One is in terms of penetration, I think the intersection of what we have and what's in the cloud in the next year is still a small fraction of what there is in the market total. So there's a lot more we can get from that.
The second aspect is that the world is transforming digitally so the market, like the overall -- the size of the infrastructure that will have to be monitored probably is a lot bigger than what had to be monitored 5 years ago. So when you look at those 2 things, there's a lot more ground to cover in terms of those market penetration and so how much stuff we can cover with infrastructure monitoring.
In parallel to that, it's a field that is still evolving, right? There's still -- the name of the game in the cloud is that there are ways of innovation and new ways of running workloads. And we've been through a few of those in Datadog. We started with cloud incentives and then containers and now serverless. We don't expect that to stop there. We think there's going to be new modalities for running infrastructure. And so we're investing heavily in our products to be at the forefront of all that. Makes total sense. And as a follow-up, I think one of the words that I heard multiple times in your script was standardization and what we've been hearing from customers is that APM has really come into its own. How much of a driver has that been? And where would you put sort of the log analytics solution in terms of its maturity? They came out of a year or 2 later after APM. Where does that capability and product stand from your perspective if we use APM as an analogy? Well, I love all my children the same. The APM and logs are neck and neck in terms of the adoption across our customer base and I would say the level of maturity. Both products win in situations where we're starting with those products in the back-of-grid kind of setup by customers. And they both can serve as the second leg of the stool in managing to infrastructure to be the basis for standardization for customers. And so what we see today, we've proven at meaningful scale is that customers are standardizing on our offering. They buy into the platform. And the 3 main legs of that stool are going to be APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Given the number of comments that you talked about, usage in the prepared remarks is helping drive strength. Can you maybe just spend a quick minute talking through -- remember, we had the overages item in kind of the first half of last year. How is this different? And how is the kind of usage and consumption growing now? I'll take that. I think what we said was we had a flattening and an optimization in Q2 of last year. And since that time, which is now Q3 of last year through now, we've had a return to more normal or consistent with the long-term trends. And we continue to see that in Q2, a very strong and similar quarter to what we've seen in the last 3, 4 quarters and very consistent with the company's long-term positions in that. And that is reflective, we feel, of a return to normal in the rolling out of cloud migrations and digital projects.
And so like we said in previous quarters, the usage growth was very widespread, balanced in products and types of customers, very similar to what we've seen in the history of the company. All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up. In terms of the investment in go-to-market, when you gave guidance for this quarter, I think similar items. Obviously, sales and marketing came in well below what, I think, ours and most forecasts had. Can you help give us a sense how much of the sequential increase that is baked into the guidance is from head count versus, as you pointed out, the return to office and the travel? Yes. Let me start with that. So we said all along that we have 2 drivers. One is in terms of sort of percentage of revenue in the marketing and sort of travel, sort of 3% or so – 3%-plus is sort of a benefit from not having that travel and the event. That does have some volatility depending upon whether you’re in a quarter where you have re:Invent and Dash, which is what we’re having in Q4. Net, I think we’ve performed, as you can see on the – in the revenue line sort of above where we were planning. So essentially, we had a positive surprise in the revenues and that sort of drops down to the bottom line.
And secondly – and lastly, as Oli mentioned, we have very aggressive hiring plans. We are essentially trying to get that done this year. It takes a while to get that done in this market. And so we expect that growth to accelerate, that sort of people side of things, to accelerate in the second half of the year. And we’re already seeing that in our hiring numbers. But we have, over the last couple of years, sort of ramped up into our hiring during the course of the year. Our next question is from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on extraordinary results. Really awesome to see this, Oli and David. My question is as you really start to experience the benefits of standardization, what are the sales cycles looking like? And how do we expect the kind of hiring that you do to prosecute these options, which are showing up in the pipeline? And if you could, as a result, talk about how this gets Datadog into the upper end of the enterprise market as things evolve over the next couple of years, that would be great.
And also, if you do have the time to answer this, as the economy -- if the economy opens up, your results are fantastic as they are. What could be the incremental benefit of the opening up of the economy when we get to travel and get out there? Thank you. So I’ll start with the standardization. At this point, it doesn’t change our sales cycles too much because the way we do it is it mostly starts small and we grow with customers. And then by the time we standardize, we have a solid foothold at that customer and their engineers are using us all the time and it gets increasingly easier to make the case for standardization. Obviously, there’s going to be some changes over time as we cover more and more of the globe with our sales force and that we have customers that have more and more years with us, you know that, right? I do expect to make some changes over the time to the way we operate. But at this point, there’s no major tweaks to the sales process or the time it takes.
It does -- the standardization does inform a road map from a product perspective because we are investing more and more in technologies that are not necessarily plug-centric. And we’re doing that in order to help our customers who standardize bring some of their legacy IT or on-prem IT back into the – under the same or most of their cloud technology. So this is something really that informs that part of our development. And it will also, in all likelihood, inform some of our efforts around professional services and spending more time bringing those customers across.
On the question on the opening of the economy, I mean, look, we – what’s interesting to us is that it looks like the – we’re back to the way the world would move into the cloud more or less before the pandemic. And we don’t know if things can go any faster. There seems to be some – there was a very steady historical trend for us there and we’re back to that steady historical trend, so we’re happy with that. So the main thing that we’re working on right now to maintain long-term growth is make sure that we keep building on the platform so we can add more products, cover the full – solve the full problem or increasingly large part of the problem for our customers, while at the same time, scaling the go-to-market teams so we can be in all of the conversations everywhere in the world for our customer segments. And we still have quite a bit of work to do in order to achieve that. Our next question is from Tyler Radke from Citi. I wanted to ask you just about the pricing environment broadly. Obviously, a year ago, kind of in the depths of COVID, you saw some customers rationalize spend. Obviously, it didn't seem like that was an issue this quarter. But just how do you feel kind of longer term about your pricing strategy? And as you continue to innovate and build out new features, do you feel like you could potentially have that pricing power to charge even more over time? Yes. So I think there's 3 parts to that answer. The first one is what we saw last year was not price pressure. What we saw last year was customers really seeing their [indiscernible] footprint with Amazon and Azure and the others. And these were the customers with the largest deals because they saw this greatly could still save money when they were facing a lot of uncertainty around cash and that we pulled to us. That's one.
Two, when you think long term, the -- it's almost a given that there will need to be a different way of charging for some of the -- for capturing some of the value provided to customers that can't just be attached to the straight volumes of data that are being exchanged because those volume of data are exploding exponentially while our customers' revenues are not going to explode exponentially.
So that's one thing that we're working on with all of our products. We have this denomination for all of our products that is without limits, which is basically a way to align the value customers get with the price they pay and give them leverage for that and make sure that we keep unbundling things on our end. So we would give them the power to do that.
The third answer to that question is that over time we made the choice to add new functionality largely in the form of new SKUs when they saw new classes of problems for our customers, which is a way basically to maintain price and increase price as we grow and as we see the functionality. We like the fact that it also gives us very good signal in terms of the value these products provide and helps drive the road map of those products. And just a follow-up on the competitive environment, Oli. I think you talked about just how customers are consolidating observability tools or maybe you kind of see that opportunity. Just as you've seen more of that, and obviously, the deal sizes have been really, really healthy this quarter, especially around the RPO growth, are you seeing kind of more kind of legacy observability solution replacements? Just help us understand as those deal sizes grow, what that means competitively for you guys. It’s similar to what we’ve seen before. And the motion is really on-prem or legacy that is being consolidated into the cloud. That’s what we see. So we see the same trend that we’ve seen in the past, there’s nothing – there’s no other very interesting comment to make about that today. We see what we still see. Our next question is from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Oli, obviously, you talked a little bit in your script about really building security portfolio of solutions. Obviously, a little different buyer than sort of core -- sort of your core infrastructure or even logging products for that matter. Can you talk about sort of how you're building out the sales motion there and really how you see additional leverage there? Yes. So the sales motion there is very much built on -- for now and what we had with observability. And as we're building those products, we're leaning on those customers that are already brought into the Datadog platform and that can self-select to start adopting from our security products. So that's step one.
Step two will be as more and more of those products reach GA and reach the financial critical mass to actually start pushing them more directly through the sales force. I think for that, we're actually learning quite a bit from the Sqreen acquisition we've done recently. And we expect that, that will have some interesting things to do in the future. We don't have anything specific to share today, though. Got it. Okay. And then, David, one for you. You noted in the call that you had a higher level of multiyear commitments. And obviously, we realize you don't necessarily push for that. Just wondering, what were some of the customer conversations that drove that behavior? I think it has a correlation to larger customers who are investing more in Datadog as their standardized observability and want to commit long term. It generally is pulled from the client rather than we go out. Remember, when land and expand, we often see the motion of growing over time and amending contracts with more commitment. So this is really more of a factor of enterprise customers and larger cloud natives committing to Datadog as a core platform and wanting that commitment to be longer term. Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Congrats on the incredible quarter. So it's great to hear about the platform expansion. So you embedded 2 offerings. You have Datadog Dash coming up in a few months and yet research and development expense, I believe, is up 84% year-to-date. Can you give us more detail around the decision to accelerate the level of R&D spend? And how should we think about the pace of new product introductions? And given the increasing diversity of your offerings, what changes do you need to make to the sales organization to support the sale of these new solutions? Yes. We're investing as aggressively as we can on all fronts. So we -- when we have opportunities to accelerate the investment in R&D, which we've done through a few acquisitions also and these actually largely show up in our R&D expenses on an ongoing basis, so we're doing it. We still think we are very early in what's a very, very, very large opportunity across observability, security and we mentioned today also some of the developer use cases around CI/CD. But also, later on, there's a lot of things we can do in real-time BI, maybe in [indiscernible]. Lots of different things we can touch on. So we're very early. We intend to keep investing heavily in R&D for a very long time.
In terms of the impact on the go-to-market, really where we'll see the first need for some changes in the -- on the go-to-market side is as we stop pushing the sell side of the security product more aggressively. It hasn't happened yet. It's not something that we're doing today as those products just barely reached GA for a few of them, but it's something that we'll certainly do in the future. So nothing to share today on that, but it's definitely something that we're working on. That's great to hear. And quickly, can you just give me an update on the competitive backdrop? Is there any change in who you're seeing on deals? And have win rates improved? And how might that vary by product? So it’s very boring. We see the same thing as before. From where we stand, the company’s landscape hasn’t changed. And our focus is still mostly greenfield, new environments, teams that are going to start small with us and are going to grow with us until they standardize on us for just about everything they do. That’s the motion, hasn’t changed and/or the landscape around us hasn’t changed that much either. Our next question is from Brad Reback from Stifel. As we think about new customer growth in the platform, is the recent cohort of new adds growing into their commitments faster? So are they ramping faster than customers a couple of years ago? So it depends a little bit because we also have some larger commitments on day 1 than we used to. We mentioned that in the previous -- on the first few calls. So overall, the cohorts are longer, they start larger. The ASPs are going up over time generally. And -- but the growth we see is very commensurate with what we've seen in the past in terms of growth in usage on the first month they're with us to the 6 months and 12 months and everything. So it's a 2-part event there. Broadly speaking, when you look at the consistency of the net retention and the longevity of it, it’s still very, very similar in the land and expand with cohorts expanding similar to previous periods, and very importantly, expanding for a long time. So they last – the cohort expansion continues on for quite a long time, which is very consistent with what we’ve seen in previous periods. Our next question is from Jack Andrews from Needham. Congratulations on the results. Oli, I was wondering as you continue to push more into security, what are the lessons learned from the previous conversions of the dev and ops personas that could be applied to gaining traction in DevSecOps? And how is this conversion to security perhaps different than when dev and ops merged that you need to account for? Yes. So it's a great question. There's a lot of commonality in that. A lot of it is about reducing friction and making things that otherwise we go out, look around with a lot of effort and a lot of different people involved and a lot of different departments involved to be very easy and that we can do early on. And so that's -- we know how to do that. That's what we've done throughout the history of the company and so that's the first part.
The second part, though, is that the buyer is a little bit different, and in some cases, a buyer might need to be addressed a little bit differently. And that's something a few other of the questions touched upon earlier, so I won't repeat myself too much there, but it's still something that we're working on in terms of how we add that to the motion we have for setting the platform. And then just as a quick follow-up. Again, when we think about the broadening portfolio of your solutions, could you just update us in terms of just how you're keeping your sales force and your partner ecosystem just up to speed with their ability to understand the value propositions and the nuances of everything that you are offering these days? Yes. So it’s a major effort. The – it’s actually one of the areas, Adam, who joined us as the Chief Operating Officer recently. It’s going to be his major area of focus today is to make sure that we scale the team that does enablement and that teaches everyone on the sales team and all the go-to-market teams with the product offering, even how it works and who to bring in into every single deals, that we understand exactly how to match the right product to the right customer. So that’s one of his major areas of focus. So we’re investing in that. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Great quarter. Oli, I want to follow up on the security questions and really talk about the 2 new announcements you've made: the posture management and workload protection. There isn't a security vendor at this point that doesn't have those solutions available as well. So even though the market is early, it seems like everybody is chasing this. Maybe you can help me think about what differentiation you can bring into the security space from your perspective? And also, I know it's still early, but perhaps maybe you could talk about the ARR contribution of your Cloud Security Platform at this point? Yes. So on the second one, I mean, we don’t have anything to share here yet. We’re actually – the only thing I can say is we’re very happy with the way it’s trending and the way it’s growing. And we’ll probably share some more at some point, but we don’t have anything to say today.
On the differentiation, what we’d bring to those categories, we already are instrumenting all those workloads. So we are present on those machines. Our agents are running there. The logs are being collected by us already. We already connect to all those cloud configuration. So there’s nothing else to be done really by our customers to turn on security, and that’s a major, major differentiator.
And we also have all the developers and all the ops people that are watching what we do all day. And they can get – they can teach the security team as well. They can be part of the solution as opposed to living in a separate silo from the security team. They are tasked with securing those workloads.
So when you combine those 2 things, I think we have something that’s very powerful, very different and I would say almost impossible for the competition that comes solely from instrumenting the workload from a security perspective to replicate. Our next question is from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. First, obviously, a great quarter. The pricing discussion, so you talked, Oli, a little bit about the need to change pricing at some point. There has been in the market already some changes from some of the competitors in their pricing, which does seem aimed at commoditizing usage of data in particular. Has that had any kind of impact in terms of competition? And how does that relate to some of your thoughts about what you would do with pricing long term? Well, it's -- we've seen some of that in the market, but it hasn't had any impact on us directly. But I should say that we are investing and we have been investing a lot in new models for charging customers and putting them in control of their spend and making sure that we align with the value adjustments of all data volumes they're producing. And that's a lot of what our without limit offerings are doing. We started with that for logs. We're also doing more and more for APM and infrastructure, and that's something that our customers subscribe to when they standardize on us.
And we've mentioned that on the call, some of our customers are able to slash their spending on logs, in particular, because they can spend on what matters to them. They can get over there. They can categorize and retain it. We can only index some of it for some of the very specific purposes they need. They can make direct queryable on demand if they want it, like they can do anything they want. We'll give them all the levers and all the flexibility for that so that their bill doesn't grow linearly with their data volume. So that's something we've already been investing in. So it's not a big change for us, just a continuation of what we've been doing. And then, Oli, you made an interesting point about legacy -- investment in R&D for a legacy replacement. I mean we've done some of that in the past. So what do you need to do from an R&D or product perspective to enable that? And are we at the point where that could unlock an upgrade cycle that would be very important to you? I mean right now, we're still early in that, too. I mean we're connecting to all sorts of noncloud equipment, so network equipment -- physical network equipment, power distribution units, that sort of stuff. And we'll do more and more of it until we reach a point where a significant part of the market is maturing up in the cloud that it's time for them to standardize.
Today, I would say that the customers that standardize and bring their legacy IT into the cloud are still the ones that are at the fore -- or we're are the forefront of their cloud migration to start with their leading edge. So there are signs of things to come, not that we are at that space just yet. Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. I'll echo my congratulations on a very strong quarter. I guess the first question, just regarding the Cloud Security Platform. In addition to a la carte, is the plan to offer CSPM, CWS, Security Monitoring and app security as a suite as well? There will likely be a few pricing options there. I mean we haven't communicated any of that yet, but we're thinking hard about the various ways these products can be packaged. Okay. And then, Oli, one of your competitors recently spoke about a large uplift in the number of deals closed with their hyperscaler partners such as AWS and Azure. Can you update us on your cloud partnerships and the go-to-market activity that you're seeing there? So we still continued to do with what we’ve been doing before. So we’re getting more and more from those cloud partnerships, and all of these cloud partnerships are developing more and more. We really see on the GCP marketplace recently, where there is – it makes it easier for customers to deploy or partnership with Azure has taken another step forward recently also as we’ve been integrated directly to the console. There’s still a few parts of that partnership that needs to be implemented. So we’re still not completely done yet, but there’s still – we’re still making progress on that. And we’re also working on deeper partnerships with AWS.
So it’s happening across the board and the things are trending in the right direction. And at this point, this is not a major part of our success, I would say it’s more of a potential upside for the future. And our next question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, can you talk -- going towards CI/CD now, obviously like it's a whole new market, but not my people have really come there before. Like can you talk a little bit about like how this will play out for you? How big the opportunity is? Like how important it is? In theory is like that's where everything starts, but like I never thought about it from a monitoring or observability perspective. Yes. So it's interesting. It's very early. We know the product space is very big because engineers spend a lot of time wrestling with testing and deploying. And so we know it's spending a lot of time and spending involved there. It's interesting to us because it pushes the boundary of where we operate also and we get closer and more clearly embedded into the developer workflows, what happens on their laptop where they write improvement in the break and test loops on their own environment before they reach even development of steady environment. So it's very interesting to us for that reason.
It's more of a massive category in terms of observing and optimizing those environments. So we'll have to see exactly what the market opportunity is there, but we know the problem space is very large. Yes. Okay, perfect. And then one question for David. You were 130 NRR number. You remember last year when the number kind of came down a little bit, you mentioned it. Just -- and I know you're not going to give me a number, but like trend-wise, is the number trending higher now? Is there a lag effect? Or like how do we think about it? I know you're not going to give me a number, but just directionally within that 130 above, what are you seeing? Yes, we won’t give you a number but help you a little bit in trends. Yes, I think we said the combination of the strong sales and the continued uptick from both use of more products on the user side and adoption of products, combined with the compare from the flattening in the second quarter, has resulted in the point in time metrics there increasing in the quarter. And I'll now turn the call back over to Olivier for closing comments. All right. Thank you. And just to close this call, I'd just reiterate that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank again all Datadog worldwide for their very hard work and for a job really, really well done. So thank you all. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this evening. We are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw broad-based strength across product lines and across customer segments.
Let me give you a quick summary of the quarter. Revenue was $270 million, an increase of 75% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,800 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,082 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 80% of our ARR. We have about 17,500 customers, which is up from about 13,100 last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash flow of $57 million. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted on newer products.
At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q3. Usage growth from existing customers was very strong this quarter across products. New logos ARR was robust with some large new deals closing and churn remains low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a record quarter of ARR added, and we crossed the milestone by exceeding $1 billion in ARR in Q3.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 77% of customers are using two or more products, up from 71% a year ago. Additionally, 31% of customers are now using four or more products, which is up from 20% last year. And this quarter, about 70% of new logos landed with two or more products. Most strikingly, our whole platform saw strong growth in the third quarter. But in particular, that all of our major products added a record amount of ARR during the quarter, but also that the year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR on its own accelerated this quarter. And finally that our log management and APM suite, which includes Synthetics, user monitoring and continuous profiler, remain in hyper growth mode. Together in Q3, they exceeded $500 million in the ARR.
Now, let’s move on to product and R&D. Our teams continue to innovate at a rapid pace. We had 40 new product-related announcements in Q3, and we made many announcements last week at Dash, or Annual User Conference. You can review our Dash press releases as well as two nights earnings for further description, but to summarize this briefly, we announced the availability of CI visibility, session replay, funnel analysis, network device monitoring, Datadog Apps and Online Archives for Log Management. We launched private betas for Cloud Cost Management, Observability Pipelines, Universal Service Monitoring and Application Security. And we also announced official Datadog support of the Vector open source product.
Now looking back at a couple of these announcements. Some of them will increase Datadog’s usefulness for business personas. Users who are not engineers, and can benefit from all the data flowing to Datadog. With Session Replay and Funnel Analysis, we believe support organizations, product designers and product managers can get value from understanding user behavior and interactions with applications. And we expect Cloud Cost Management will be useful to anyone involved in understanding and controlling the expense of cloud implementations from engineering teams to product managers to finance teams.
We are also advancing our efforts to support our customers with large-scale complex data needs. So, I want to talk a bit, Vector, Observability Pipelines and Online Archives. Nine months ago, we acquired Timber, the developer of Vector. Vector is an open-source product that allows users to collect, enrich and transform observability data and automatically route it to the destination of their choice. Our Observability Pipelines product extends Vector and increased enterprise-level of capabilities for its data pipelines, and the ability for users to seamlessly manage it from Datadog across both on-premise and cloud accounts.
Vector and Observability Pipelines let customers make value-based decisions on data as early as possible before they send data to Datadog or any other partner. We are always looking for ways to give customers more control over how they use their data and how they manage the cost of their cloud deployments. This is another step in that direction. And with online archive, we are aiming to solve the growing problem of storing all logs and being able to run complex historical investigations on them. Online Archives is an always-on log-warehousing solution that provides 15 months or more of extremely cost-effective storage online query capabilities. I also wanted to mention database monitoring, which we announced for general availability in August, and which gives our customers deep visibility into the performance and execution of queries across all of their databases.
Finally, as announced in the press release issued this evening, we acquired Ozcode, a live debugging solution for net applications, which lets developers solve problems in real time, whether in development or in product environments. It is another example of our growing push into developer workflows. So, as we can tell, we were very busy in Q3. And I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their relentless focus on our customers.
Now, moving on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to be very productive, and we added 1,100 net new customers this quarter. So, let’s review some of our Q3 wins. First, we had our largest deal ever by total contract value, and over $60 million five-year upsell with a multinational financial services company. Our history of success with this customer has led to the use of nine products, including early adoption of newer products such as RUM and Synthetics and APM. This customer began the second phase of their migration to the cloud and is standardizing on Datadog, adopting our newer products as we add them to our platform.
Next, we had a seven-figure upsell with a global fashion retailer based in Asia. These customers saw e-commerce sales increased dramatically during the pandemic, and they began to use Datadog after several outages resulted in missed sales. After a disappointing implementation of a competing solution, they chose Datadog APM across their global e-commerce sites and saw immediate improvement in stability.
Next, we had a six-figure land with a U.S.-based professional sports league, which came in partnership with Google Cloud Platform. This customer experienced a large spike in application usage as funds are returning to games for in a pandemic, but they had no clients at monitoring and therefore, nowhere to analyze and optimize the user experience. With Datadog Real User Monitoring and Synthetics, along with infrastructure monitoring and APM, the customer now has a single solution to manage experience from front-end to back-end.
Next, we had a seven-figure land with the advertising division of a Fortune 10 company. This company has very strict SLAs for their platform as their customers rely on always-on availability to adjust ad budgets in real time. After conducting a full evaluation of internal solutions and APM providers, this customer began using Datadog infrastructure monitoring and APM and are motivated to expand their use of our platform within the enterprise.
Finally, we had a large six-figure land with a U.S. distributor of plumbing and building equipment. This company needed to migrate from on-premise to Azure, and to deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service. But its existing APM solution had limited visibility into containers. With Datadog, this customer is able to effectively monitor the health of their Azure ecosystem, allowing them to confidently and efficiently complete migrations in retail legacy infrastructure.
As you can see, our go-to-market teams had another quarter of strong execution. I want to thank them for once more successfully helping both new and existing customers to generate value from Datadog.
Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. If you could not join us for our investor meeting last week, I encourage you to watch a video on the Investor Relations section of our website. At the meeting, we described our long-term opportunities, our differentiators and the expansion of our platforms over the years. To summarize my beat of the presentation, we see digital transformation and cloud migration as large forces driving exponential growth. We believe Datadog helps solve the growing problem of managing complexity for our customers and that our open-ended unified platform, designed to be simple but not simplistic, is deployed everywhere and used by everyone at our customers and that it helps break down silos between teams. We believe it is still early days for our opportunity in observability. And while we have made a lot of progress in building out a broad observability platform, we still have much to do to solve all of our problems customer pain points.
One next step for us is in security, with our cloud security platform. And we believe we have a part to play in breaking down silos between development, corporations and security teams. But we’re also making offers inroad in pure developer workflows with the general availability of CI Visibility. And we think over time, we have opportunities to help our customers in several other large adjacent markets as well. In other words, we are just getting started.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO. David? Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q3. Revenue was $270 million, up 75% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong, and showed broad-based growth. Customers continuing to adopt more products across the platform, and new logo generation was also strong.
To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was robust in Q3, and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 17th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was very strong, driven by customers’ expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our new customers from the last several quarters have expanded their usage quite rapidly, and we had some significant renewals with large customers in Q3. We also had a record quarter of ARR adds, including record ARR adds in all of our major products. And we saw strong growth across geographical regions, with all regions accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q2.
New logo results were also strong. Our enterprise and commercial sales teams had a crisp execution in this quarter, and new logo ARR was up strongly year-over-year. We continue to see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And as we mentioned, 77% of our customers are now using two or more products, and 31% of our customers are using four or more products. And lastly, churn remained low and in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rate remained unchanged in the mid-90s and is similar across all our customer segments and products.
Turning to billings. The billings were $309 million, up 98% year-over-year. There were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Note that we called out shorter-term billings duration in Q3 2020 last year. And billing duration in 3Q of this year is in line with recent quarters, but is higher on a year-over-year basis, driving higher year-over-year billings growth.
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $719 million, up 127% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity, increased contract duration, and it was growing against an easier compare in the third quarter of last year. The increase in contract duration was driven by several large renewals with multiyear terms. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are built annually, and we don’t incentivize our sales team towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was about 100% year-over-year as our mix shifted away from month-to-month deals to – on a year-over-year basis more towards semiannual and annual. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now, let’s review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Starting with gross profit.
Our gross profit in the quarter was $210 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 76% last quarter and 79% in the year ago quarter. Due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies in cloud costs, we expect our gross margin to increase sequentially in Q4. In the mid-to long term, we expect gross margin to remain in the high 70s range, typical of our historical performance.
R&D expense was $84 million or 31% of revenue compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth in our engineering headcount.
Sales and marketing expense was $65 million or 24% of revenue compared to 32% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see strong efficiencies with our frictionless land-and-expand selling motion. We also had relatively few in-person events in Q3, but we continue to plan for increased travel and events cost going forward depending on local health and travel guidelines. G&A expense was $17 million or 6% of revenues compared to 8% in the year ago quarter.
Operating income was $44 million or a 16% operating margin compared to an operating income of $14 million or 9% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest heavily against the large and dynamic market opportunity we see in front of us. But our product innovation, coupled with a strong go-to-market effort and a frictionless land-and-expand model is driving strong revenue growth and business model efficiencies.
Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $44 million or $0.13 per share based on 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $67 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $57 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%.
Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. We remain highly optimistic about our long-term opportunities, and we continue to work hard to execute against these opportunities. Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $290 million to $292 million, which represents 64% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.12 per share based on 347 million average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of 293 to – sorry, $993 million to $995 million, which represents a 65% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $113 million to $135 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.39 per share to $0.40 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average shares outstanding.
Now some notes on guidance. while usage growth remained strong in Q3, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. We would note that we typically see slower business activity towards the end of the fourth quarter as employees take vacations around the winter holidays.
Next, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for the long-term growth, and our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward. However, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees.
Regarding items below operating income, we expect approximately $0.7 million of Q4 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense of our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but of a tax provision related to international entities, we expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q4 and $2 million for the full year.
And now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of this quarter. Our platform is resonating in the marketplace, and we saw strong performance across our products in Q3. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D. And with the launch of database monitoring and CI visibility, we now have 13 generally available products to offer our customers.
Our execution against our go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help our customers manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation efforts continues to expand.
And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let’s begin the Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on another really, really strong quarter. I had a question for Olivier. It’s kind of more of a higher-level product-related question coming off of the user conference. And I guess the theme of it is that we hear the word observability much more often in 2021 and in 2019. I think you’re starting to refer to different aspects of software in different domains.
And I’m wondering from your perspective, you guys obviously have a lot on your plenty of opportunity. When we’re talking about bringing observability into other domains, whether it’s the data pipeline or going to potentially in process mining because you guys do have log analytics solutions, are those potential opportunities in terms of bring observability to different domains from the Datadog perspective? Or are you sort of kind of come finding it to more of IT? We know, we’re all about breaking down silos and bring more use cases, more personalized under the same roof. And we are strong believers that with digital transformation, the application is going to run the business. And so if you understand the application, you can understand everything that has to – that happens around the business, which gives you an opportunity to bring many more teams in.
So long term, yes, I mean all of these are interesting things for us to do, and we see some of our customers implementing some new use cases that we haven’t productized on Datadog already today. I would say, today, we’re still focused on the products we have brought to market and the ones that are still in beta, and we’re taking it step-by-step. But yes, there’s much more we can do and want to do. Understood. And then sort of talking about some of the usage and cohort behaviors that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, coming off the slowdown that we saw at the end of last summer, I think the theme has been is that the usage trends and the expansion trends have sort of been reverting to normal and getting back to even higher than the pre pandemic – sort of in line with the sort of pre-pandemic levels. As we stand in sort of going into the end of the year, how have those cohorts sort of changed? Is it just sort of continuing sort of usage? Or are you seeing different longer-term contracts? And in what sense – or what commonalities are you seeing across these cohorts that are different than just sort of the recovery off the end of last year? There’s actually not many differences between what we see in the most recent cohorts in the previous cohorts. The two main trends that we see that are underpinning the success you’ve seen in the past few quarters – as you identified earlier, the fact that the pace of cloud migration and digital transformation has resumed to where it was. That’s the first ingredient. The second ingredient is that our newer products are reaching scale and are being successful and are basically propping up our growth as we solve a larger and larger problem for our customers. So the combination of those two things really is what drives the success you’ve seen. And we continue to have our usage increase be about two-thirds, usage of products the client had already, and about one-third adoption of new products. That’s been pretty consistent over time. So, we continue to see similar types of adoption path. Makes some sense and very helpful, David, in terms of shedding some light on the split between those two vectors. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong Q3. And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Hey thanks. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, can you – you mentioned some of the large renewals you saw this quarter. And obviously, that we would think they’re kind of heavy users of Datadog. Can you just describe like how much of their estate is actually getting monitored by you, i.e., like how much have you penetrated then? And what kind of differentiates those customers from guys that are kind of smaller on your platform. So is that just a maturity thing? Or what are the drivers here that we need to think about? I think it depends a little bit on the customers, obviously. But for some of the customers we’ve mentioned, it’s very clear that they’re standardizing on Datadog. As I mentioned, a very large five-year deal, which is still somewhat atypical for us. But what this shows is that this is a customer that is far enough in their cloud transformation that they know where they’re going. They’re standardizing on us, and they plan over those five years to basically bring substantially everything they have into the cloud and in Datadog. So that’s the – that’s what’s behind it.
And Again, right now, we only see that from the – those of our large customers that are far enough in their cloud migration, and many of the – of our large enterprise customers have started this cloud migration more recently. But we think it’s representative of what’s going to happen at a larger scale a few years from now. Yes. And then one for David. If I look at the billings growth, you pointed out that you were at slightly better duration this year last year? Like do you think you would be able to quantify that a little bit? Is it like a – like is that a 20 points swing, a 10 points swing like some material, some materiality, but not too much. Like could you help us there? What we said in billings duration was we had large – generally been in sort of the seven months plus or minus then we had, had some contraction when in COVID last year down into the sixes. And now we’re back up into that same range on billings duration that we had before in sort of the seven to eight months. The same thing happened in contract duration. Although the contract duration, we said was complemented by multiyear contracts, which expanded the RPO in this quarter, and maybe a bit unique in terms of the number of multiyear’s that happened this quarter. Okay, perfect. Congrats. Well done. Thanks. And our next question comes from as Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi, this is [indiscernible] sitting in for Kash. The question we have for you is, number one, can you please take rank for us the factors that have been contributing to revenue reacceleration? You talked about all the various pieces of the puzzle here, but is there any way to stack rank them in terms of most influential versus list influential? What drove the revenue acceleration here? The two main factors really are the resumption of cloud migration to the speed it had before the pandemic, and that’s number one. And this one, we don’t fully control, right? I mean that’s something that is highly dependent on the business environment around us. The second factor is the success of our new products and decide that we’re – we mentioned on the call, our APM and log products together reached more than $500 million in ARR. So not only are they growing very fast, like they say in hypergrowth but also they contribute quite a bit to the revenue of the company.
And we have more products coming up after that, but are also going very fast. So this is the second factor. The third factor is that on the back of that, like with all the demand environment being there and with us solving a larger and larger problem, we successfully scaled the go-to-market teams, so we can actually go after this opportunity. So combine all those three. That’s how you get the direct generation of growth, yes. Thank you. And as a follow-up, can you please comment on the hyperscalers to what extent they be contributing to growth? You signed deeper relationship with Azure last year, GCP as well, and others. How important of that – how important those partnerships can become in terms of go-to-market motion for you? Thank you. Thank you for taking our questions. So we see that in a number of deals. I would say it’s – there’s no drastic change from what we’ve seen before. It’s a continuation of what we’ve done with the hyperscalers before. I think in some areas, we’re a little bit more deliberate now in terms of the partnerships we put in place, and I think they are a little bit more defined than they used to be before maybe in some cases. But I would say they are not – like these partnerships don’t have any specific capacity – set capacity attached to them online, but they are not part of our model for growth going forward. They’re all upside from where we are. So we keep investing in those partnerships. We think they are part of what we do, but they’re not the main way we go-to-market. Got it. Thanks so much. And your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. I’m curious in terms of your existing customer growth that you saw in the quarter. Can you characterize how much of that growth is just coming from their growth and expansion in the number of cloud hosts versus adopting more Datadog products? Yes. I think we said that similar to previous quarters, about two-thirds of our growth. And that’s comparing the size of the customer today versus the previous year comes from – has come from expansion of their use of products that they had already bought. And about one-third has come from their adoption of the new products, and that’s been pretty consistent over time. So that’s how that splits. At the back of the, you know roughly how the cloud providers are growing, and you see how we’re going compared to them. So it gives you an idea basically of the lift we’re getting from additional sales capacity around additional coverage, but also the – the growth of our product suite. Understood. And then one quick one on sales. Can you characterize where you are on sales capacity and your efforts to continue to hire, to fuel the growth? Well, so we’re doing – we have more capacity than last quarter and much less than next quarter. So we’re still investing heavily. We’re growing those teams. And we’re also investing not only in the hiring of the retention, but also in all of the enablement and training and the career pathing so we can make the most of our go-to-market team. So there’s no – again, no big change there from previous quarters where we keep investing. Got it. Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Great, thanks very much. Oli, on that massive financial services deal that you signed in the quarter, how much influence it newer on-prem products like networking and pipelines have on the decision there? Or is that potential longer-term upside even with that large client? With that specific client, without getting into too much detail, not much. Because it’s a client that is, I would say, a bit further along in their cloud migration. And they’re moving a lot of their workloads into cloud environments in the end. For some other of our customers that we’re not mentioning on this call, this is a big deal, and this is something that they’re spending quite a bit of time on with us right now. So it – you probably will hear us about it in further calls, I would say. That’s great. Thanks very much. And the next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler, if you’re on mute, please unmute your phone. Hi, there. Can you hear me now? Yes. Sorry about that. I wanted to talk about the strength that you saw on some of the larger lands. And I think you called out a number of 7-figure lands. And I’m curious, do you think at a high level, this is mainly driven by specific go-to-market investment? I know you’ve obviously been growing the sales force including the enterprise? Or is this simply just the product set kind of at a maturity point where you’re just kind of seeing this demand more organically? It’s a bit of everything, right? So obviously, the product strength is what we rest on so that it solves the problem – the customer problem really well and it’s very easy to adopt in not fractions. So that’s not new. That’s what we’ve built the company the whole time and it’s still there. But also with a product that is growing very fast at customers, as you grow your go-to-market teams, you have to be deliberate about the way these go-to-market team so that you don’t just stop at the customers. You have the data already drive a lot of growth. You also go out of your way to acquire new ones. And so we’re also always tweaking the way we’re on the go-to-market teams to make sure that we focus the teams and reward the teams for landing new customers. So yes, we keep tweaking that over time to make sure that we don’t become victims of the success of our product when it comes to organically growing within customers. Yes. And just a follow-up on that. I’m curious, obviously, at Dash, you talked about a lot of security products. To what extent is the product road map around application security really influencing these larger deals? And is that an important consideration with these customers making these commitments, just kind of where they see your product road map going? It starts coming up in conversations more and more, but it’s still early for the convergence of DevOps and security. So when you talk about a five year strategic alignment with customers, security is a part of the conversation. But for most of our customers today, it’s still a second step. Like they start with sustainability. They start with the cloud. They start with what we have today. And then they want to actually bring security under the same roof as observatory data. Thank you. And your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Yes. Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg. And my congratulations on the quarter as well as the new acquisition in Ozcode. Could you go a little bit more into the technology there? And specifically, kind of what you’re adding, that’s differentiated from your automated incident management product? Because I know you said you could do debugging production. Is it just part of the actual beginning stages of the DevOps life cycle? Or is that maybe you could get merged into that product? Yes. So it’s actually – where it stands in the stack is it’s like the debugging meaning that the same way you can use a debugger on your laptop and place a breakpoint in and see what the code is doing and the variables in the code are and things like that. You see technology that lets you do that in production environment. So you can – in your ID, you can breakpoint in the code and the current production is actually going to tell you what’s going on in the code at that moment at that time. You don’t have to update the code. You don’t have to shift software. So it’s something that developers are used to doing in development environment. And this is technology, lets you do that in production as well.
So it’s very interesting to us. It’s also something that corresponds to some work we’ve been doing internally. So there’s three things that are interesting to us about the Ozcode acquisition. One is live debugging technology, which is very interesting. Second is it’s a quite that focuses specializes on .NET, which is capability that is very interesting to many of our large enterprise customers. And that is often underserved by newer – I would say newer innovations in the market. And then the third thing that’s interesting to us is that this is going to be our first engineering team in Israel. And we do intend to grow that team and invest quite a bit. That’s really helpful. One other thing, I guess, thinking more from a higher level, when we think about DevSecOps. I feel like it’s a term that we’re hearing more and more from more companies. So I mean, kind of core to establishing – breaking down those silos is going to be consolidating spend down to certain vendors. Is there a way you guys think about kind of the gravity of those budgets between the three sections. Is there 1 area that you need to be at the core of? Do you think developers have the most power, security has the most power? I’m just trying to think as more and more companies try to build across those three areas. What do you see as deciding who wins that consolidation? Yes. Well, I think there are three things that have been massive. One is there’s many more developers than any other role. So they have power by virtue of being the most populous and the largest salary mass and everything else. So you get quite a bit of yield in serving developers. The second thing that is massive is the amount of friction for instrumenting applications. And the third thing that is massive is the data volumes in terms of logs. And I think we have a strong advantage on all three compared to pure-play security vendors for that space. Fantastic. Thank you. And your next question comes to Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. David, the numbers are obviously all accelerating. I guess, kind of underpinning the numbers, is there anything new you would call that was striking to you that you haven’t seen. Is there any common themes that maybe we can’t see in the numbers that also account to the strength and what you’re seeing in the overall results this quarter? I think it’s a combination of a number of things at the same time, strong lands over a number of quarters, which then began to use the product and accelerate – acceleration of budgets around cloud migration, which caused the usage to increase, and continue to be strong, and cross-sell of other products as our product suite gets adopted and the success there, more of the products as we showed are getting adopted by the clients. So the combination of all of those at the same time and strength geographically across all the regions caused the acceleration from last year’s post-COVID type of results. And maybe for Olivier, just as it relates to cloud migrations, one of the things we continue to hear about is a dual-cloud strategy or even multi-cloud strategy. Are you seeing that starting to help your business? Or is that still yet to come? We definitely see it. Our customers are very clear on the fact that they are going to be multi-cloud. They often start multi-cloud even though initially, they’re going to have more weight in one cloud than another. So it’s frequent for customers when they start the cloud migration to have – to pick two of the major cloud to have maybe 95% of their volume in 1% and 5% in the other. But their goal is always to be able to, further down the road, choose whether they make further investment in one or the other or even on a third on-prem option that would be a private cloud. So this is a plan that we hear more and more from pretty much all of our customers. And we see that – as we see our customers getting further along like some of the ones we’ve mentioned on the call today, we definitely see them making multi-cloud decisions there. Thank you. And our next question comes to Michael Turtis from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Hi guys. I just want to ask two overlapping questions about the sales force. On the one hand, and I think Tom may have talked about this a bit at Dash, but how are you addressing with the single primary sales force, the different buying centers and buyers between security, development and business users. And also, how is the sales force evolving from reps that probably, really sold essentially one product and now have to sell so many more products. That’s frequently a tough time for transition in the sales force. Yes. So today, we’re still not specializing the sales force. We’ve discussed a little bit in the past call, we still – we think with security, we might have to do a little bit of specialization. We’re testing a few things, but we haven’t felt the need to do anything drastic just yet.
For the rest of our products, today, it works quite well to have the same sales force carry the various products. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, the adoption of those products tends to be frictionless. And so we don’t need to land all the products at once. We’re going to land a few. And then we need to nudge our customers a little bit to start adopting more of them over time as they get more and more values from Datadog, but the lift there is not as heavy as if we had to come back and do a big bank sale every single time. So today, no specialization, yet. I think it – some of it is likely to happen over time in all likelihood with security, but we haven’t done anything yet there. And as I said, do you find that the sales force that’s been with you selling – I mean your product is always diverse, but was essentially an observability product, more in the traditional monitoring sense. Is that same sales force adapting to this much wider portfolio? Or are you starting to see a turnover in that sales force to accommodate that? Yes. The sales force is adapting. I think mostly what we’re working on is the structures behind the scene to target the sales force and to enable the sales force, so they know basically who to talk to about what product when. And it’s actually one of the things that Adam Blitzer has been working on, bringing to us a bit of his experience with similar problems at his previous company. Thanks, Olivier. And your next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the amazing quarter. It’s great to hear about the record deal and the record ARR adds across the platform. As your largest customers scale and standardize on Datadog, can you talk about how conversations have changed around pricing? Are there any particular modules where maybe you’re seeing relatively higher levels of pushback on cost? And given the rapid – especially given the rapid growth in data and the pricing changes made by some of your competitors over the past two years? Well, I mean, usually the module for which is the most pushback is the one that happens to be the biggest item for that customer. Overall, the – there’s one thing that you’ve correctly identified, which is data volumes are just going to explode much faster than customers’ revenues are going to go up. And so we need to be able to differentiate from a technical perspective to solve these problems in a different way of our customers or to give them more control so they can target what they are – they need to keep.
A number of these things we’ve announced at Dash last week actually, were meant to help with that. So I’ve talked about observability pipeline as one of them. The live archive for logs is another one of them. And there’s going to be more of a time to address that. So we didn’t make any pricing changes, but we are innovating from a product perspective to have new ways of solving these problems and to give more control to our customers. It makes a lot of sense. And on following up on the product innovation, your R&D expense is up more than 80% year-to-date, well above the 2020 levels of growth. It’s great to see the fruits of these investments with the numerous announcements of Datadog Dash, but can you give us more detail around the decision to accelerate the level of R&D spend over the past year? And has anything changed about the broader opportunity versus pre-pandemic to drive this elevated level of spend? And how should we think about the targeted cadence of future product introductions? I know there’s a lot there. Thank you. Well, we’re going as fast as we can on the engineering side. It so happens that we could sustain a very high growth on the recruiting and retention side. And we’re very confident that our platform lends itself to solving bigger problems, more problems and to making those products successful. So we’re scaling them as fast as we can. It’s important to go fast when scaling those teams because there’s quite a bit of a lead time between the time when you hire engineers and the time when you get new products on the other hand. I’ve mentioned in other calls like maybe hiring now is a good predictor of output two years from now on the engineering side. So we should get started. That’s why we’re doing it. That’s great. Congrats, again. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the soli quarter as well for me. But Oli, you’re already bigger than all your near-term or nearest competitors growing faster than all of them by a couple of magnitude. You talked about enterprise standardization trend that led to your largest deal in the company’s history. So are you seeing more and more of that enterprise standardization trend with large organization? And as a result, are you seeing more and more displacement deals out there rather than just simply selling into large Greenfield opportunities? So I would say it is still – the bulk of the standardization is still has to come, right? And it depends on the maturity of our customers’ migration into their – into the cloud more than the adoption of our product, I would say. But we definitely think that it’s something that’s going to play a big role in the years to come. When that happens, when standardization happens, there is typically some displacement because what was used on the legacy side or on the other side of the shop is going to be left behind, and we’re going to replace that. And that’s part of the valid rationalization that takes place. But again, today, it’s still a small part of what we do. We – the bulk of our business is still net new cloud environment, a lot of growth in the cloud environment with the occasional replacement of unsuccessful deployments of previous tools. So just for your existing customers, are you seeing many of your customers having a mixed vendors of the observability products like, for instance, they have your product, along with some of the other parts of the organization may have some of your competitive products as well. So it’s just a matter of time before the customer needs to standardize on one platform. Yes. So there is a – what we see is any time we land into a large enterprise, for example – and we’re going to start in the cloud environment. Their on-prem environments are going to have a collection of other things. They’re going to have older infrastructure monitors like the BMCs and [indiscernible] of the world. They’re going to have older ATMs. They’re going to have Splunk and Elastic somewhere in on-prem as well. It’s a given. But we’re not going to displace that from day one. We’re going to be a solution that are going to be in environment and we’re going to displace those products as the customers reach critical mass in the cloud, and this starts standardizing.
So we – but we think from what we see, the customers that are doing that today are the ones who are far along in their cloud migration and started that one like a few years ago. So we think this is going to be low in the years to come. Thank you. And David, just a quick question on cash flow dynamics. Obviously, your contract link is increasing. You’re getting more and more large number of deals. Do you expect the cash flow to be more or less – see more greater seasonality maybe weighted towards more second half of the year going forward? No. We – I think we said in the script that even though we’ve gone – we’ve had some more multi years, there’s still annual billing at most. We don’t go for financing the company through collecting events. So there really is very little, as we talked about, long-term change in the billing dynamics. In terms of cash flow, we tend to see a little bit of seasonality at the end of the year when we go through our sales – end of the year sales cycle and then collect in the first quarter. But I wouldn’t see too much change in the cash flow dynamics from either the longer duration of contracts or seasonality. Okay, great. Thank you so much. And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you. Olivier, just to follow-up on the security go-to-market. Your security monitoring product has now been GJ [ph] for a while, whereas some of the other components of your cloud security platform are much newer. But what I’m wondering is, how would you assess the readiness of your sales force and your channel to sell security to your installed base today? Today, it’s still a product that is being adopted by customers when they already let at our customers that we don’t – we really land with it first. And that’s by design, right? That’s – as we keep developing it, and we keep making it applicable to a broader set of customers. We are starting though – we’re getting to the point where soon we’ll have the full V1 of our cloud security platform. I think for that, we’re still missing the general availability of the application security component. Once we have that, I think we look into accelerating the go-to-market side a little bit and maybe doing some of the specialization we’ve been discussing earlier in this call, but we haven’t done that yet. Okay, perfect. Thank you. And the next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. I suppose it’s a two for one deal today. Thank you so much for taking me and along with my colleague here. As you look at calendar 2022, you’ve had a see of new products that you’ve added to the portfolio, including some of the demos that you apply enable demonstrated to us last week, I believe. Any changes, enhancements or tweaks to go-to-market as you look at 2022. And also, as you look to clearly signing these five year contracts and mega contracts are a change in the way customers look at Datadog.
I’m curious if you’re embolden to pursue a specific enterprise sales channel and having a separate go-to-market effort that is in pointedly in pursuit of mega deals. Thank you so much. Just like our friends at Salesforce started doing some five, six years back or so, and it was definitely fruitful. I’m wondering if you see the same kind of opportunity. Yes. So we do – so first of all, I mean, we – I mean, yes, customers see us differently over time. I mean we are definitely – like we’re becoming one of the platforms that they are going to standardize big points of their business around, and that’s definitely a different relationship with them than just something some people on their team are using. So that’s the change we see. And we see across a large number of our customers.
Now in terms of pursuing the – larger deal, I mean, we do have different ways of structuring our teams internally so that we have folks that are going after new logos that might be smaller, folks that are going after growth of reaching customers, folks that are going after the growth of the very biggest customers. And we have some segmentation internally on that, and we’ll have more and more segmentation as we grow as we need to focus a little bit every one. But we’re still not looking for those very large deals. We do them today when our customers want them. When they need the – for their own planning purposes.
And when they want to commit their own organizations, we’ll do those deals for them. But this is not something that we actively seek. Our product and we’ve seen throughout the year that our product is very sticky, and then our product grows very well with our customers. So there’s no point on our end in pushing for very large, very long-term deals. Wonderful. Thank you, Olivier. Congratulations. And I think on these good words, I think we’ll close the call. So I want to thank you all for this – for sticking with us to the call. We’re all very happy obviously with the performance this quarter, which is all thanks to the team at Datadog and Datadog’s worldwide and their hard work.
And so I want to congratulate against everyone, and thank everyone for a job very, very well done. And we’ll see you all next quarter. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating.

And I will now turn a call over to Yuka Broderick, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, John. Good morning. And thank you for joining us to review Datadog’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning.
Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog’s CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022; our gross margins and operating margins, including investments in R&D and go-to-market, our strategy, our product capability and ability to capitalize on our market opportunities.
The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other filings and reports that we may file with the SEC. These filings are available on the Investor Relations section of our website along with the replay of this call.
We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our performance in Q4, where we showed high growth at scale, as well as strong business efficiencies.
Looking back at 2021, not only do we continue to see a very strong demand environment, we also kept innovating at a rapid pace. And our team executed extremely well to help our customers manage complexity in the COVID era.
Let's start with a quick scenario of Q4. Revenue was $326 million, an increase of 84% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range.
We had about 18,800 customers up from about 14,200 at the end of last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,010 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,228 at the end of last year. These customers generated about 83% of our ARR. We had 216 customers with ARR of $1 million or more, which was more than double the 101 we had at the end of last year.
The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash of $107 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase our usage and adopted our newer products.
At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters, continued in Q4. Business growth from existing customers exceeded our expectation this quarter, and we saw strong growth across all the products in our platform in all business segments.
We had record new logo ARR in Q4, including some large new enterprise wins. And churn remains low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another record quarter of ARR added.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 78% of customers were using two or more products, up from 72% a year ago, 33% of customers were using four or more products, up from 22% a year ago and as a sign of further adoption of our platform, we saw that 10% of our customers were using six or more products, which is up from 3% last year.
We saw strong growth across our platform in Q4. Year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR has accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. In addition to that, APM suite and logo management products continue to be in hyper-growth mode. And we're very pleased to report that our newer products added about $100 million in ARR in 2021. These are the newer products we launched in 2019, which excludes core infrastructure, core APM and log management.
Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams have not been slowing down and delivered another strong quarter of innovation. We announced the general availability of Sensitive Data Scanner in December. Sensitive Data Scanner gives customers an easy and cost-effective method to discover, classify and protect sensitive information. With modern applications, data moves across many important teams, making it difficult to know when services are storing sensitive data. This is particularly important for enterprises in regulated industries like health care or financial services. Sensitive Data Scanner is available today for log management, and we will be working to extend it into other areas of the platform in 2022.
We also announced this morning the acquisition of CoScreen, a screen-sharing platform that allows participants to interact with a joint work space in real time. Engineering is a team sport. CoScreen lets us bring individual work into a shared team environment. And unlike general purpose video conferencing tools, which are one-to-many and focus on presentation and conversation, CoScreen is many-to-many, allowing multiple participants to share and collaborate in each other's windows as if they were local applications. We believe this will help our customers in a number of use cases such as incident response and alliance with our funding goal of breaking down silos between teams.
Now let's take a moment to review our accomplishments in 2021. We ended the year with thirteen generally available products, up from nine at the end of 2020. We significantly extended our visibility capabilities in 2021.
In infrastructure monitoring, we made it even easier to instrument and monitor. We launched over 80 new integrations covering clouds, CDNs, web platforms, automation platforms and more. We now have over 500 integrations and continue to go deeper into cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure and GCP. We launched network device monitoring for physical network devices and appliances, we created new container center views as our customers continue adopting [indiscernible] at massive scale.
On the serverless front, we have expanded our coverage to include visibility into not only the functions customers develop, but also the ecosystem of data, security and routing services that surround them. And we launched a beta of universal service monitoring, which captures service level health and performance without needing to modify any application code.
Our APM suite was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant in 2021, and we doubled down on innovation in APM. We expanded release and we’re monitoring meaningfully, particularly for Android and iOS mobile devices. We launched session replay, database monitoring and automated tracking of faulty deployment. We expanded Synthetic Monitoring with support of numerous new browsers and locations.
In Continuous Profiler, we added support to provide many new languages such as .NET, Ruby, PHP, CC++ and NodeJS. And we invested to get close with developers’ day-to-day experience with synthetic testing in CI pipelines, now detecting problems before they happen in production, they are tracking no covering front-end devices and back-end services. And source code integration enabling developers to type production to the right line of code.
In Lab Management, we continue to aggressively invest, providing more sophisticated analytical and governance capabilities and giving our customers more flexibility with data storage and retention. Our improvements unlock many sophisticated use cases, for example, in cybersecurity and business analysis.
We also announced Online Archives, a new long-term data store for extremely large data volumes. Now further extending obtainability to development workflows, we launched CI Visibility to help developers ship faster and more safely. And going beyond observability, we launched our Cloud Security Platform, including Cloud Team, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security. In addition to those, our application security product is currently in beta. And we're now very pleased with our early momentum in security as we have thousands of customers using our cloud security products today.
We also kept opening up Datadog as a platform with the release of Datadog apps. And finally, we'll continue to invest and innovate with Watchdog, Datadog's AI engine. Watchdog automatically detect and correlate anamolies, and we've been busy extending Watchdog to provide information in context throughout our platform. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their focus on our customers.
Now moving on to sales and marketing. Earlier this month, we announced the promotion of Sean Walters to Chief Revenue Officer. This is a well-deserved promotion for Sean, who has been an enterprise sales leader at Datadog for four years now and has shown excellence in building strong teams and delivering high productivity. We've all been impressed with his performance over the past few quarters as well. Sean has a deep experience in the field with over 20 years of increasing responsibilities in software sales, and we are excited to see him build on his successes as CRO.
In addition to this, we are pleased to have received a FedRAMP moderate authorization. As a result, we can now sell to U.S. Federal Government agencies as well as the other public sector customers who use FedRAMP as an indicator of compliance and security. We have been working to build our go-to-market teams for the public sector, and we intend to expand on those efforts aggressively.
We also announced a global strategic partnership with AWS. This is a recognition of our success and growth with AWS and our commitment to further invest to accelerate our joint opportunities. Among the areas of further partnership, we have already integrated Datadog more tightly into the AWS marketplace. We are also working with AWS to build deeper integrations not only for observability, but also for security use cases, and we are also planning to extend our joint go-to-market activities. Meanwhile, our sales teams continue to execute at a very high level.
So, let's discuss some wins for Q4. First, we had a six-year land deal with a major U.S. airline. This customer has chosen Datadog as the de facto monitoring solution for all new IT projects and applications. They plan to start with six products in the Datadog platform with an expectation to expand significantly with more teams and applications over time.
Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a major European car company. Prior to using Datadog, this customer has five disparate monitoring tools, which created focus alerts while leaving gaps in coverage. With Datadog, they were able to break down silos between teams and reduce the frequency and duration of outages.
Next, we had an up-sell to [indiscernible] ARR with a major financial infrastructure company. This customer has consolidated multiple monitoring tools in Datadog, helping them ensure stability and support growth. This customer estimate savings of 2.5% [ph] by migrating to Datadog. And the up-sell also includes new products such as Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. And this customer now uses 10 Datadog products.
Next, we have seven-figure up-sell with a multinational, beverage conglomerate. This expansion makes Datadog their global observability standards with enterprise adoption across six international zones. Thanks to Datadog Correlation, what used to take three people an hour of data gathering, now it takes one person less than ten minutes.
And finally, we wanted to spend some time discussing our largest-ever, multimillion dollar land deal with a major media company. This media conglomerate sees massive amounts of traffic with this customer-facing content. And the most critical content such as live sports and entertainment requires highly optimized observability. This customer also decided to embark upon a significant digital transformation project, eliminating its data centers over time in favor of cloud. This operational overhaul hinged on proper end-to-end observability. But the customers' existing monitoring solutions failed to innovate quickly enough to support this growth and increasing complexity.
In addition, reliance in open-source tooling was a strain on engineering resources. Datadog provided a single integrity cloud solution, and the customer planned to replace eight different commercial and open-source tools with a Datadog platform, starting with five of our products.
So, as you can see, our go-to-market teams are successfully helping both new and existing customers get value at Datadog. And I want to congratulate them for their incredible work this quarter.
Now looking ahead to 2022 and beyond, we continue to see digital transformation and cloud migration as critical for our existing and prospective customers. The cloud and other next-gen technologies are creating complexity that customers need to understand and manage. Meanwhile, security threats can occur anywhere in this broad and dynamic set of infrastructure and applications, making identifying vulnerability and attacks absolutely crucial.
So, there's a lot of demand out there for observability and security for [indiscernible]. As a result, we continue to feel that we are still very early with respect to our products and our market opportunity. And looking forward to 2022, we will make further progress in expanding the Datadog platform. We have a lot to do, and we're excited about what's in front of us.
On a final note, we feel that 2021 was a very successful year for Datadog, which we recognize, and it's been a tough time for many others. This is why we're happy to report that together with our employees, Datadog dedicated over $3 million to nonprofit global organizations at the end of the year, and we look forward to giving back more to our communities in 2022.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of financial performance and guidance. David? Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q4 and fiscal year 2021. Revenue was $326 million, up 84% year-over-year and up 21% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers exceeded our expectations. Customers are finding value from adopting more products on our platform. And new logo ARR grew robustly in Q4.
Let's go into some more of the details. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q4. And our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 18th consecutive quarter.
Usage growth was very strong. Our customers expanded the usage of our largest products meaningfully. Infrastructure monitoring year-over-year ARR growth accelerated from Q3 levels. And the APM suite and log management products remain in hyper-growth mode. And our newer products are all growing very rapidly.
We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region. North America, EMEA and APAC all accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q3. Our go-to-market teams delivered a strong quarter in new logos and new logo ARR. We added 1,300 customers sequentially, a new record for us. And new logo ARR was also a record and included our largest ARR land ever, as Olivier discussed earlier.
Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 78% of our customers using two or more products, 33% using four or more products and 10% on using six or more Datadog products as of the end of Q4.
Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has gradually improved over the years and is now in the mid- to high-90s, and it's similar across customer segments and major products.
Turning to billings, billings were $408 million, up 86% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q4 were similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $815 million, up 88% year-over-year. And contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter.
Current RPO growth was over 80% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review the income statement. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
Gross profit in the quarter was $262 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and also 78% in the year ago quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we saw efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter. In the medium- to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high-70s range.
Operating income was $71 million or a 22% operating margin compared to an operating income of $18 million with a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. This is occurring despite continued, aggressive investments in our long-term opportunities, particularly in R&D and go-to-market.
Finally, in Q4, we hosted our DASH User Conference virtually and had a strong presence at AWS Reinvent.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was a strong $116 million in the quarter. After taking into account – taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $107 million with a free cash flow margin of 33%.
I want to briefly summarize our fiscal 2021 results. Revenue was $1.03 billion, up 70% year-over-year. We generated $165 million positive in operating income for a 16% operating margin compared to $64 billion with an 11% operating margin in 2020. And we generated $251 million in free cash flow at a 24% margin in 2021 compared to $83 million at a 14% margin in 2020. I want to thank all Datadog employees for their hard work and strong execution throughout 2021.
Now for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022, we continue to believe we are in early days of our opportunity in observability. And we are at the very beginning of our potential in-cloud security and developer-focused observability. At 18,800 customers, we believe we are still very early in our penetration of potential customers worldwide, and we see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes.
As we look on to 2022, we believe companies have learned to manage around the potential business disruptions and remote work life over the past couple of years. And we believe that the need for companies to embark upon digital transformation and cloud migration projects is higher than ever and our strategic imperative to drive competitive advantage. So, we are initiating our fiscal 2022 guidance, which includes continued high growth.
With our usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $334 million to $339 million, which represents 70% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $41 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.10 to $0.12 range per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares.
For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.51 per share at approximately 350 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And now some notes on the guidance. As usual, when providing guidance, we use more conservative assumptions than we have seen in our historical results.
Our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for our long-term growth. Next, our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward, but we remain flexible depending on further COVID developments, and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees.
Finally, as it relates to our capital expenditures, we are catching up on office build-outs and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q4 and 2021. We continue to innovate rapidly and broaden our platform capabilities with many more products planned to be launched in 2022. We have grown our go-to-market opportunities, including in the public sector with our FedRAMP Moderate Authorization and deepening our relationships with our cloud partners. And across the company, we are working hard to execute against our opportunities in 2022 and beyond.
And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q& A.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Thank you. Raimo Lenschow, my name. Congratulations. I think it was an amazing quarter. Olivier, you mentioned a higher usage in this quarter. What's driving that? Is that just kind of people standardizing? Is it just traffic as the clients getting better, because that's kind of in a very, very strong number? What are the factors there? Thank you. I don't think there's one specific factor that's driving it. I think it's a combination of everyone's digital transformation, cloud migration still happening. And happening with the, I would say, the historical rate we've seen through the history of the company. That plus us covering more and more surface with those customers having more product that they can adopt they can grow into. And so that's what we thought through the quarter.
We did see – like this is a Q4, right, so we did see the same compression at the end of the quarter as we see every year. It was also a bit more pronounced like it was last year. We've seen them to be a bit more pronounced in a post-COVID world. But overall, the quarter was very, very strong and definitely stronger than last year. Okay. And then one follow-up on that one. You talked about some of the very big wins and how they are consolidating on you. Do you see that consolidation about more in-house build tooling and open-source tools? Or is it also consolidating like some of the kind of more established competitors in the space, in the kind of upper APM load areas, et cetera? It's a mix of both. Really, it follows the distribution of tooling out there. Like whatever customers have is what they end up consolidating on us. And this movement, we're still early in this consolidation movement. We see it happen, I would say, maybe a bit more often than we used to. I mean we're mentioning a couple in every earnings call at this point with the large ones are fairly notable. But we expect to see more of that in the future, but not necessarily right away. Okay. Perfect. Congratulations. Well done. Thank you. Our next question is from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Thank you so much, what a superb quarter, Olivier. I'm curious to get your thoughts on a couple of things. One is as the product suite broadens out, how are you thinking about distribution? Are you going to have more specialized distribution attacking, say, the DevOps market for the app market in your core markets in APM and monitoring? And I have a follow-up question. Thank you so much. The answer is, we're open to whatever we work. We still haven't made any changes to the way we distribute. We still have one sales force that sells everything. We still land largely with infrastructure and the expand from there. And we actually see some proof points that we can get some very good wins that way. I mean I think we mentioned on the call the fact that one of our very large customers in finance adopted our security suites. And that was done with our standard land-and-expand motion.
So, we see that working in at least some cases. That being said, as we fully mature newer product, especially the security product, we might have to have to get some go to market, but we're not there yet. Got it. And second and final one, thank you so much for that. As you look at the consumption model, when trends are improving, obviously, those revenue outcomes can be as impressive as the ones that you have. As you've become a larger company, are you contemplating things to minimize the volatility of these results and have a little bit more predictability on the other positive side? And that would mean like a snowflake gives concessions to its customers as they keep making technology improvements, they pass back some of these savings to alleviate any potential pushback as you become a more strategic vendor? Oh my god, I'm spending those so much. It is of great value, but at the same time, can you elaborate a little bit on how you can think ahead and anticipate some of the things that can get underway? That's it for me, thank you so much and congrats. Yes. So, the way we deal with that is – and again, the backdrop there is the explosion of data volumes. So, if data volume at our customers grow a lot faster than the top line, at some point, you can't grow what you charge for that linearly with the data volume. The way we deal with that is, we give them more and more options. And those options are differentiated technologically at least so that we can keep developing new ways of storing the data, different types of data in different ways for different periods of time and let customers choose what they want to use out of that.
So that's what we're doing with Online Archives, for example, which is – which we announced last year and which is going great this year. That's also why we invested in – we're investing in the ability pipeline. So, there's a number of things we're doing to help put customers in control and make sure that what we deliver always, always aligns with the – what we charge always aligns with the value customers get. Thank you so much. Our next question is from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Thank you for taking the questions and my congrats on exceptional 2021. Olivier, I wanted to talk a little bit about your comment about the early days of the opportunity on sort of two-dimensions. If I look at some of the big software companies that we've seen, whether it's Salesforce or VMware or other large companies, they have north of hundreds of thousands of customers, right? And you're sort of sitting at 18,000. I was wondering in terms of your guys' vision, do you envision Datadog getting to the sort of customer account levels? That's sort of part one of the question.
On the other hand, it seems like you guys are doing better and better up-market at despite this largest stuff or land and win with this media company. Do you start to feel that the large enterprise market is now moving more and more towards the sort of Datadog platform versus kind of this sort of hybrid cloud approach that they've been at, sort of mobility that they bid in for the last couple of years? Any sort of views on traction in enterprise and what sort of customer comes can get to longer-term? Yes. So, on the first question, we definitely – we build a product and a company that serves the whole market, like the whole gamut of potential customers. We think that developers at small companies behave, especially in the cloud, they behave very much the same way as developers in very large enterprises. They have the same toolbox. They work the same way largely. And so, we built a product that service everyone. We do expect to have very large counts of customers in the end.
But to your second question, we also see, right now, a lot of the demand, a lot of the growth is coming from mid-market and larger enterprises and also the higher end of the market. And we feel good about that part of the market, like we see it successfully standardize on Datadog. We see it successfully land-and-expand with us. I think we're growing faster. Well, I would say we're an equivalent size and growing faster than anybody else in the market for that specific part of the market. So, I think we feel good about it. That's a big part of what we're doing. That makes a ton of sense. And I guess my follow-up question relates to security. I understand that's still early days in the move into this area. I wondered if you could talk about it in sort of two-pieces. One, selling security solutions to your core set of users, how confident are you that you're going to see traction in that motion sooner versus maybe selling securities solutions to operations team, which might require more of an investment, more of a specialized go-to-market motion? If you can sort of – how do we think through traction on sort of part one of that selling to like Datadog users versus the big operations? So, the traction is here. We see the traction, right? So, we mentioned on the call, we have thousands of customers on security products. And so, the adoption is there. It's happening. It's happening across our products. We have a number of products we started charging for in Q4, such as Cloud Workload Protection, for example. And those actually are off to a strong start. So, we are pretty impressed with the numbers we see there. So again, it's too early to pass judgment. We have to see them perform for a couple of quarters.
We have to see what’s working, what's not working as customers get multiple quarters into the adoption of the product. But the size we see today are very positive in terms of the adoption, in terms of the fit of those products, in terms of the way our story makes sense for our customers. It's still possible we have to make changes to the go-to-market motion and specialize the teams and do a number of other things.
I would say it might come in a bit later when customers are – start embarking on the same standardization motion for security as they do right now with us for observability. But today, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of the fit and the adoption of those product. This is happening according to plan, I would say. So, we're very happy. Very encouraging. Thank you, Olivier. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Thanks. Hi, guys. Maybe we'll switch over to the margin side. So, David, in particular, I was impressed by your sales and marketing spend increased less this year quarter-over-quarter than it did last year, but the revenue incremental dollars that you added was much higher. Can you kind of go through, is that all just because of the usage based in existing customer contribution in the quarter? Yes. That's because of the usage and the cross-sell and the efficiency of it in our frictionless adoption. So, it's an indication of both the robotics and the end market as well as the ability for clients to adopt more of the platform. Got it. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Same thing on gross margins, it was a very big sequential bump. What's contributing to it? And is it durable at these levels? Or what should we be contemplating in terms of that trend? Yes. And as we said since we went public that we are focusing on gross margins in the mid-70% to touching 80%. And that there will be periods of time that due to investment, they will tend towards to the middle or lower part of that range and then go up. And in this case, in this period of time, we were able to harvest efficiencies in our cloud costs. And like in other periods of the fluctuation of the gross margin, we've hit 80%.
As we're investing, we may dip below that. But as we said in my prepared remarks, we feel confident that will remain in the mid-to-upper parts of the 70% range. As a reminder, we're shipping a cloud cost management product next year, and we hope to be the first case study for that. Understood, thank you. Our next question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Good morning, thank you for taking my question. Olivier, maybe I'll start with you. You've been very conservative with respect to some of your commentary around the traction you're seeing outside of your core wheelhouse of observability in the realm of CICD and real catering to the developer audience. So maybe just to take a step back with 13 generally available products, what are some of the efforts that are being put in place to package certain modules that are in a similar family or address a similar buyer persona? And sort of where are you on that journey to be able to attract more and more of these different groups within the enterprise organization? And then I have a follow-up for David, if I may. Yes. So, we're actually very happy with those products. So, they're getting to market nicely. So, the CICD product also started charging for fairly recently, and we're very happy with the adoption we see there, similarly to what we said about security. At some point, we'll also comment on the numbers for that. I would say the numbers are still small compared to the rest of the business. But that's small due to the fact that the rest of the business is well north of $1 billion in ARR and growing close to 100% or over 100% of it focused on positive year-over-year.
So, it's going to take more time for it to be meaningful compared to all that. But we do see a lot of potential in those products. We are very happy with the adoption. In terms of the packaging, we always ask ourselves the right way to price and package those products. With big signs of unbundling for – because it does align the very precisely what customers pay with the value they get, and it gives us very strong signal on what works and what doesn't work at the product level.
So, we always start with unbundled. And then over time, we might find that there are something that might need to be packaged differently or customers that want to buy together that's when we start bundling things. But that's we always start with bundle, that's a default motion for us. I appreciate that detail, Olivier. David, for you, I think you were pretty categorical in your prepared remarks vis-à-vis your guidance philosophy. But taking a step back and in the context of the $1 million deal volume that you saw double this year, how are you contemplating the incidence, frequency and maybe volume of larger deals as you do start seeing some more repeatability and patterns in the way customers are moving to the seven, eight figure deal mark? Any help or context as to how you're thinking about those attributing …. Yes. Thank you. It's still the similar motion to what we've been experiencing, which means, for the most part, our $100,000-plus customers were started out lower than the $100,000, and our $1 million customers started lower than $1 million. We're still largely the land-and-expand. So, we see that motion continuing. And in addition to that, I think as we said in our prepared remarks, we're seeing, in some cases, where a client has a significant cloud presence and consolidates or outsources or goes to a system rather than open source, we would land and get to a large amount earlier, which we've talked about in some of our prepared comments. But for the most part, it still is that land and expand and evolve from lower deal sizes to the $100, 000 and $1 million as we've been discussing. Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Olivier, on 2022 cloud migrations, there's been some concern given the consumption that we've seen in the last two years that there could be some slowdown or digestion. It doesn't appear that, that's what you're seeing right now. But curious if you could just share your thoughts on what happens this year? And it seems like there's some really new pockets of movement even in financial services and other subsectors that we haven't seen. What are you expecting?
And David, if I can follow-up with you, just on a quick question about Sean's new role. Historically, we've seen changes in the sales team. In other software companies, we've seen a little bit of an air pocket. It seems like you expect that this to proceed smoothly, and it's more of a tweaking of the go-to-market versus a major change. Can you comment on that as well? Thanks. Sure. Yes. So, in terms of the sort of the trends we've seen, we're forecasting, from what we can tell, there's no – like what we see is continuity. Like what we see in 2021, if you look at it including 2021, it – to us, it looks a lot like 2019, which itself looks a lot like 2018. And what this tells you is we're still early in the transformation and cloud migration. And this is happening – it seems to be happening with a certain rate within enterprises that we take convert workloads and move them to the cloud.
And we've seen that to be more or less throughout the history of the company. So, from where we stand, we don't see any particular acceleration in 2021 that is – it would be a pull-forward of 2022 or anything like that. So, we see continuity. That's what we see. So, we see a strong demand environment. Really, we can't forecast what's going to happen next year. It's possible that we're still in troubled times, and it's possible where things happen. But we're very confident that if that's the case, the setbacks will be temporary and that we're still very early in a very, very broad transformation, the managers of which we know is still difficult to reason about. So that's on your first question. So, we're very confident on the environment and very confident in our place in it.
In terms of the sales team, we actually didn't make a very large synergies to the sales team. We acted with continuity, and we promoted from within for our CRO spot. We promoted Sean, who I think is the best person for the job really. And we don't expect any big changes as part of that. We expect to keep building. We expect to keep scaling. We expect to be a little bit of go-to-market in some areas with the new products to the fold. But mostly, we're here to scale what we have today. Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Rebeck from Stifel. Great. Thanks very much. Olivier, last quarter you talked about some recent product releases that could be easily consumed by non-IT employees; so, I'm just wondering how that's trending? And then as we look forward, should we think about that as a driver to 2022 or more 2023 and beyond? Thanks. Yes. So, we have a few of those products, and we mentioned some of the products that reach more into the business areas of support area, like Session Replay, Analysis, things like that, Cloud Cost Management. There are some that are still not in GA. The others are still very early. We ship them late last year. So, I would say it's definitely too early to share any data about them. 2022, there's still probably going to be too small to have a major impact on the numbers, but that's definitely a big area for growth for us in the future. So, we invest now we to those products and then they make a meaningful contribution in the future. And by the way, that's what we've seen happen with our other products today. I think we mentioned on the call that the ""those smaller products"" that we released since 2019 collectively added more than $100 million in ARR last year, which is very meaningful. And so, we expect the same to happen with the products we released last year. That's great. Thanks very much. Our next question is from Michael Turits with Keybanc. Hey Olivier and everybody, congrats on the quarter. I want to ask the competitive question, particularly important given that you had two public comps that have less impressive results. So very specifically, where are you winning up market? And how are you winning up-market competitively in enterprise and also maybe downmarket where you may be seeing more price competition on ingest? So first of all, we don't actually see the competition all that much. So, I don't wake up every morning asking myself; how are we going to win or whether we are winning. We mostly compete against customers building it themselves or being on the tool and starting in the cloud without idea what's going on. We do see a few big replacements in every quarter. We've mentioned a few on the call. When that's the case, we – I mean the ones we mentioned are typically the ones that are up market. The reason why we're winning those situations is we offer an integrated platforms where others don't. We're cloud native and others aren't. And most importantly, we have a lot more usage and adoption from the teams on the ground around our product. So that's the deploy what we are used by everyone saying that I repeat that every call, that really is what makes us win in the end with customers, and that applies up market, that applies down market, it applies everywhere. And let me just add that, of course, we didn't have the APM and logs. We didn't have the breadth of the platform five years ago. So, as we talked about there, a number of customers where we had landed with infrastructure and as they are consolidating on the platform, they're buying our products, whether it be enhancement, whether it be movement from open source or whether it be replacement of the company's products that you're talking about. And David, on the packaging of different products or different personas, what about from a sales and go-to-market perspective? Any moves to either create specialized or overlay sales forces given the breadth and scope of what you're now offering? Not yet. Right now, we're experimenting with a few things, obviously like we're trying to see if it can makes sense in some areas, the prime candidate being security. But we haven't made any big changes to the way we sell. And we also see some interesting proof points that we can be successful with keeping the way the – keeping our sales team the way it is right now. So, we are key on that. We expect it to be an area of focus at some point during the next year, but so far, no changes and so far, looking good. Great. Thanks. Our next question is from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Great. Hey, thanks guys. Hey, Oli, it was great to see you achieving better at moderate status. Could you remind us about the success you've had thus far on the federal side? And could that drive additional success there in 2022? The goal is really to be able to sell to fully go to market on the federal side. With the FedRAMP low we had before, we were limited in the number of agencies we could target, and we also are limited a number of use cases. We basically could only target in past monitoring use cases. We couldn't send logs, APM, things like that. With certain medium what we can do is we can sell all of our products, and we can pretty much sell to every single civilian agency in the Federal Government as well as a number of other government agencies that are local agencies, but that take the same or use FedRAMP as same guidelines for security and compliance. So, it really opens up the market. We've seen some – already some success to date. We already have, as of last quarter, $1 million-plus customer on the federal side on our FedRAMP on our [indiscernible] offer. So, we're optimistic, but we still have a lot of building to do on the go-to-market there, like it's not necessarily exactly the same go-to-market that we used to. Got it. And then maybe just a quick one on the product side. It was really excited to see a Sensitive Data Scanner launch. It really feels like data governance as a whole is just becoming more important in a post-COVID world. It sounds like it's working today with application logs. Could that product go further? I'm just sort of curious on sort of what the scope of what Datadog provide from a governance – data governance perspective? Yes. So that product is actually a great example of the power of our platform in all the various use cases we can derive from it. We started the Sensitive Data Scanner with log data, which is very straightforward and something customers love because it tells them immediately whether they are manipulating sensitive data or they should not, which is a hard problem for them to sell. But we can extend it to look at all of the data that ends up on the front end of an application to reuse monitoring. We can extend it to look at all of the data that go through the various services in the back end of the application through the APM. We can extend it to look at all of the data to go through the network through network monitoring. So, it's a great example of who we can use the data collection we already have to help our customers solve hard problems that they couldn't solve otherwise. It's also interesting because it's a product that is pretty much halfway between observability and security. And you could make a good case for attaching to one or the other. So, it really shows like the unified future observability and security platform that we're building. Super helpful. Congrats on the results, guys. Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Okay. Thanks, good morning. Olivier, I just wanted to start with a big picture question. You crossed the $1 billion in ARR threshold this year, a very strong year. That tends to be a milestone where software companies can start thinking about updates to either internal infrastructure or team to take them beyond that $1 billion level. So maybe you could just talk conceptually about how you're thinking about what to put in place to scale Datadog to a multibillion-dollar company? Well, that's what we do every week. We ask our sales, how are going to keep scaling the company, what we're missing, what we need to add. So, in general, we are scaling company. We're hiring a lot. We're hiring at all levels. We're bringing outside experience where we don't have it. But I would say, in addition to that we're also very, very, very careful to make sure we can keep delivering and keep innovating. I mean we have worked at much larger companies before. I've seen how hard it can be to get things done in a very large organization. And I want to make sure that we keep our teams extremely productive. We minimized the number of redtape that prevent them for getting any work done while putting – building enough roads and enough controls, so we make sure that nothing will happen. So that's the concern every single week for us at Datadog, and that's pretty much what my job is. Understand. Maybe a more near-term follow-up for David on guidance. This time last year, you were guiding to high 30s year-over-year growth for 2021. You obviously overachieved that, but now we're sitting here guiding to high-40s year-over-year in 2022 on a bigger base number. Just wondering how you thought about the process to putting a target out now versus this time last year in 2021. It seems bold, but you talked about usual conservatism. So maybe take us through that? Thank you. Yes, yes. I think – yes, thanks. I think overall, it's sort of the same ideology, which is to take what we've seen in the usage and numbers and discount it. I will say last year being in COVID, we took and we said this on the call, a bit more of a conservative approach. We had less – we had more uncertainty last year. So, I mean I think we adopted the same approach but applied a little more conservatism last year when we gave our original guidance. That's helpful. Thanks, and congrats again. Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Okay, thank you. My congratulations. Olivier, you released Cloud SIEM about 18 months ago, and it seemed to get off to a slower start than the typical new Datadog product. But as you mentioned, you now have thousands of customers that have deployed your security product. So, what I'm wondering is what's the primary driver of this? Is it a function of having more breadth in security, such as sensitive data scanner, cloud workload protection, et cetera? Is it because your sales force and channel has become more adept at selling security? Or is it something else you would point to? So first of all, actually, it's off to a very strong start. So, we mentioned thousands of customers using it. That's a lot of customers, especially for a product that is an expansion product. That's not something that we lead with typically. So, we're very happy with that. There's still quite a bit of product work happening on it. Like we're growing it so we can support more use cases, so it can be more end-to-end for everything our customers need to do with the cloud so there's quite a bit of investment on that product that remains. So, we're still early in the product development cycle there.
We expect at some point, maybe this year to share some numbers on the revenues by those products, but we're also very happy with the growth there. And those products are growing very, very quickly, obviously from a much smaller base than the rest or products. But we mentioned $100 million of added revenue from the added ARR from the newer product. And the two bigger buckets in there are user experience monitoring and security. So, we see that growing, and we see that being a potential driver of future growth for us. Okay. That's very helpful. And then regarding the new global partnership with AWS or expanded partnership, can you elaborate on how much tighter the product integration may become? And then also how actively are the two companies planning to engage in collaborative go-to-market? Well, so it's very much a continuation of what we're doing with [indiscernible]. I think we've written down a few things that were more implicit before in terms of what we're going to do from an integration perspective. What's exciting to us is that we've written down things that are – that don't just concern observability, but also reach into security use cases. So, we're going to see broader integrations there between the two products. And we've also decided to get a little bit closer on some of on go to market. There's not much more I can say on that. We're still working on a number of those things. But this is, I would say, in line with what we're doing with other partners to really fully go to market with the cloud provider's customers. Very helpful. Thank you. Our next question is from Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. Hey, guys. First, super congrats on a strong quarter. Your growth is accelerating and you're already at a scale that's much larger than our competition. Obviously, you can keep hiring at the current rate to support growth. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in regards to sales productivity improvement? And is it natural for you to just focus on larger deals to just keep driving higher sales productivity gains? So first of all, our growth is not completely predicated on sales productivity because we have a largely frictionless model. So, the – part of our growth is, but part is not, which is why you see the revenue growth outpace the sales and marketing growth or expenses growth by a wide margin. Our focus for the year is more on scaling the team than on increasing productivity because productivity is very, very high. If you look at the cost of sale, like we're probably the best, if not close to the best in the market. So, our goal is to keep scaling the team and keep getting the product set, so we can keep getting more of the same economies of scope that we already see with our customers. Great. And then just a quick question for David. Can you just, at a high level, talk about level of visibility you have and how that has trended over the past year? You mentioned that revenue recognition could lag the actual signing of the deals. As you sign larger deals, are you seeing increasing revenue visibility? Or some of the new deals and expansion deals take a bit longer to ramp as the deployment size gets larger? We have very consistent performance on our cohorts across the different types of customers, the way they adopt the product and ramp. And that applies to larger deals as well as smaller. So, we have pretty good visibility, pretty good time series. There hasn't been a change in that pattern of adoption and we monitor that all the time as we look at increasing our ability to predict the revenue. We also, I think are in some cases looking at developing a functionality in account management to help our clients adopt faster. And that is sort of around the edges, but we have a pretty good idea of how our clients are adopting. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Our next question is from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question here. The first, just coming back to the profitability guidance that we have for Q1 and for fiscal 2022 now; for David, I know that you had discussed, I guess, the expectation that we would see some of these travel and in-person events kind of feather back in. I have to imagine that there's some incremental cost with these acquisitions that you guys have announced. Can you help, I guess, fine-tooth that a little bit for us as far as what what's expected and how that's expected to come into the year? Yes. In our guidance we have assumed a resumption of normal T&E and marketing events. We said previously that sort of in the 3% to 4% range. We estimate we've had cost savings due to lower-than-average T&E and marketing events. So, we've incorporated that in the guidance. We'll have to see how quickly that resumes. As we said, first priority is safety of our employees. But we've incorporated that. We've also, as we said have very aggressive hiring plans and we've incorporated that in. But as we said previously, we think the number is sort of on average around three plus in terms of COVID savings relative to T&E and marketing events as a percentage of revenues. Great. Thank you for that. And then just, I guess, a two-part question here, but more housekeeping. The first, I know in previous quarters, and maybe I missed it on this call here, but you guys have discussed how new logo lands are typically coming in with two-plus products 70% to 75% of the time. So, first question would be, is that still the case?
And then the second question, I know that you're talking about gross retention now improving to the mid- to high-90s range. It had been mid-90s. I think before that, it was mid- to low-90s. So, can you just help us think of what are the investments or what is it you guys are doing to drive those gross retention rates up over time? And congratulations on that effort as well. Thank you. On the first question, yes, the land percentage of more than one product remains similar to what we said previously, in the 70s. No change in that motion. In terms of the gross retention, with the platform expanding and the standardization, one, we see some more stickiness. And as we always have, we're focusing on both account management, technical account management, working with our clients over a long term which we've done and continue to do.
Oli? Yes. And to close on that, I mean, we deliver a great product that's a must have for our customers that has extremely high adoption and usage across our customer base, that delivers great value for them. And we know it delivers great value. We're not surprised by anything because we have this unbundling approach that lets us really quickly understand that what customers pay for is basically part of our platform and will be expected out of it. So that's what makes the gross retention stay up and go up over time. Terrific. Thank you very much guys. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over – back over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. All right. Thank you. Thank you all. In closing, I'll just repeat that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank all Datadogs around the world for their hard work in 2021. I know they're excited for in 2022 and so am I. So, thank you all. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes [indiscernible] thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.","we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022 . the words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended . a variety of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially .",1.0

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Yuka Broderick, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's first quarter 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2022, our gross margins and operating margins including from the impact of R&D, go-to-market, CapEx and increased office activity and marketing, our strategy, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and the closing of acquisitions.
The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and other filings and reports that we may file with the SEC. These filings are available on the Investor Relations section of our website along with a replay of this call.
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll start by saying that we are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continue to drive high revenue growth, along with strong profitability and strong cash generation.
To quickly summarize our Q1 financial performance, revenue was $363 million an increase of 83% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 19,800 customers, up from about 15,200 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,250 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,406 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.
We are seeing strong efficiencies in our business model with free cash flow of $130 million and free cash flow margin of 36%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products.
At a high level, we saw positive business trends in Q1. Usage growth from existing customers was strong and consistent with historical trends as customers continued on their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, and the Datadog platform continued to expand and deliver more value. New logo ARR was very robust and churn remained low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another strong quarter of ARR added. It was, in fact, our second best quarter of ARR added beside from Q4 of 2021.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 35% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 25% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 4% last year.
We saw strong growth across the products in our platform in Q1. For example, infrastructure monitoring continues to grow at a rapid clip and exceeded 3/4 of a billion dollars in ARR in Q1. Our APM suite and log management products had a strong quarter and are in hyper growth mode. As a reminder, our APM suite includes core APM, synthetic studies on monitoring and continues on hire.
We're also very pleased with the growth of our user experience product, which are synthetic and relays our monitoring more specifically. These products together exceeded $100 million in ARR in Q1. And in security, we are seeing very rapid growth. It's still early days, and we're growing off a smaller base, but we continue to see strong adoption with thousands of customers getting security coverage through the Datadog platform.
Now let's move on to products and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. Just 12 months after we acquired Sqreen, we are pleased to announce the general availability of application security monitoring last week. Some applications and APIs are some of the most common sources of data breaching, yet companies typically have no ways to effectively detect attacks, so they could be less than good for days or weeks. Some other approaches to application security aim to find vulnerability before code is production. But these solutions offer and slow down development cycles and overwhelm teams with force positives with no easy way to prioritize these issues.
The Datadog Application Security Monitoring product leverages the full execution context of applications running in production. This allows teams to focus on attacks that actually matter and provides an immediately actionable remediation path. Application security monitoring is the 14th product in the Datadog platform, and this is the fourth product within our Cloud Security platform alongside Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. With this, Datadog now provides security insights across metrics, traces and logs, and we consider these altogether as version 1 of our Cloud Security platform.
Remember that we are still in early stages with our security efforts and have much to do to further build out this product, but we are pleased with our progress so far and the usage we are getting from our customers.
Last month, we also announced that we expanded our Watchdog AI capabilities to include root cause analysis and log anomalies detection. Root cause analysis automatically identifies cause of relationships between different systems across infrastructure and services -- sorry, across infrastructure and services, and pinpoints their root causes. Watchdog also automatically identifies the business impact of any given issue using data from our reuse of monitoring products. This means not only identifying which mobile applications are impacted, but also the exact users that are affected. This new capability often solves in minutes, the problem that would otherwise take hours by a specialist in customers' organizations.
Log Anomaly Detection on the other hand automatically understands and baselines normal patterns in logs and proactively discovers anomalies such as new patterns, meaningful changes in negative patterns and other outliers. By surfacing these unusual log patterns, Log Anomaly Detection have things fine and fix issues faster.
In addition to this Watchdog announcement, our engineers released dozens of features and expanded product capabilities in Q1. To give a couple of examples, in Real User Monitoring, we announced the general availability of iOS crash reports and error tracking, as well as a number of improvements to help customers analyze and understand the users’ performance. In Cloud Security Posture management, we added support for the Azure platform, enabling customers to understand their compliance posture across AWS and Azure in one place.
In Continuous Profiler, we now support all commonly used languages, including C, C++, RUST, PHP and .Net. And across Datadog, numerous addition of rules, data sources and integrations are enabling our customers to solve their problems from end to end without leaving the Datadog platform.
Finally, this morning, we announced that we signed an agreement to Hdiv. Hdiv is an application security product, which provides a highly accurate vulnerability detection at runtime. It offers interactive application security testing capabilities, which tie vulnerabilities to exact file and line numbers in the code. And unlike other solutions in this area, Hdiv’s rate of false positive is very low, enabling customers to focus on vulnerabilities that actually matter. We believe Hdiv’s capabilities and strong team will be an excellent part of our Cloud Security platform, and we're looking forward to integrating the capability into Datadog as soon as this acquisition closes when regulatory requirements are met.
I will switch to our product update this quarter. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. There are so many new features coming up, and I can only highlight a few of them in this call.
Now moving on to sales and marketing, our sales team continued to execute and have delivered a strong quarter. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q1. First, we signed an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen fintech company which was our largest ever deal on an ARR basis. This customer is experiencing explosive growth in demand for its products, and availability and performance of their system is critical to avoid loss of revenue. These customers started with us 3 years ago with just infrastructure monitoring, and its expansion now includes 6 of our products.
Next, we had a high 6-figure upsell with a global shipping company. This customer is expanding with Datadog to help them move forward with their Azure migration. In addition to using 5 Datadog products, they are now working with our new services team to help implement best practices on a number of business initiatives that involve increased Datadog adoption. This customer expects to consolidate 10 disparate monitoring tools as they expand their use of Datadog.
Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a U.S. federal entity. We were able to deepen our relationship with this customer after we achieved FedRAMP Moderate status. Before Datadog, this customer had siloed infrastructures, applications, networks, database and customer experience monitoring, this caused blind spots and long times to resolution. With this expansion, they are replacing both homegrown and commercial observability tools and are enabling DevSecOps cultures with a visibility across the full stack and a single source of truth.
Next, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a leading payment company. Earlier this year, these customer’s open source logging tool went down making them blind, but they were able to regain visibility by getting Datadog Log Management up and running within a few hours of that crash. Not only did this customer regained log visibility very quickly, they were also able to use the Datadog platform to scrub personally identifiable information to meet security and compliance requirements. And as they have expanded with Datadog, they have been able to cut the number of engineers who maintain homegrown and print solutions in-house and reassign engineers to other products of work in the organization. With this renewal, this customer now uses 13 products from Datadog.
Next, we had a 6 figure land with a major U.S. hotel company. This company lost half of its engineering team during COVID and needed to use its staff more efficiently. At the same time, it was embarking on an AWS Migration and its existing tools were not providing the visibility it needed. By consolidating Datadog, this customer expects to future-proof its cloud strategy and move towards unified end-to-end management across their on-prem and AWS environment.
And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a major European car manufacturer. This customer was frustrated with its existing monitoring tools, which left them with limited visibility into incidents sometimes impacting millions of users globally. As they were trialing Datadog, they were able to solve within minutes issue that used to take them days. With Datadog, this customer expects to consolidate multiple commercial and open source tools across AWS and on-prem stacks.
That's it for this quarter's highlights. I want to thank our go-to-market teams for their hard work in delivering a strong start to 2022 after a very busy end of the year. I also want to give a special shout-out to our tech solutions and support teams for making our customers successful and enabling them to expand with our own platform.
Moving on, we feel very good about the demand environment. And as we look over the medium and long term, our outlook hasn't changed. We remain confident that cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term opportunities and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycles. We believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster create competitive differentiation, enable strategic change and serve their customers. And we believe we can help customers manage the complexity as it comes with this transformation. And that Datadog unified platform is more than ever critical to understand, improve and secure their modern stacks in businesses.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Thanks, Olivier, and good morning to everyone. To summarize, we delivered strong financial performance in Q1. Revenue was $363 million, up 83% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers was strong once again in this quarter. And new logo ARR growth was healthy, particularly given the typical slowness that we see in Q1.
Let's go into some more detail. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q1, and our dollar-based net retention remained above 130% for the 19th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong across the Datadog platform and in line with historical trends. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region, and growth was similar across geographies including EMEA. In early Q2, we began shutting off service to customers in Russia and Belarus. We have about 200 customers in these 2 countries and their contributions to revenue is immaterial.
Our go-to-market teams delivered another strong quarter. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year and customers with $100,000 or more of ARR grew 60% year-over-year. In addition, we saw strong growth in million-dollar customers. We are pleased to be serving more customers and believe we are still early -- in the early stages of our opportunity in worldwide customer acquisition.
New logo ARR was very robust, particularly given that our sales teams participate in sales kick-off and other planning processes at the beginning of Q1. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately transfer into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers, with 81% of our customers now using 2 or more products, 35% using 4 or more products, and 12% using 6 or more products at the end of Q1.
Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate continues to be in the mid- to high 90s and was stable quarter-to-quarter. And it's similar across our customer segments and major products.
Billings were $444 million -- $445 million, up 103% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q1 was similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. We closed several large deals in Q1, including the largest deal by ARR that Olivier discussed earlier, which led to billings growth being higher than revenue growth in Q1.
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $858 million, up 85% year-over-year, and contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was in the mid-80s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $292 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% in the last quarter and 77% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.
Operating income was $84 million or a 23% operating margin compared to operating income of $20 million or a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. And in Q1, we had not yet returned fully to in-person meetings, events or -- are fully back in the office.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $147 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $130 million with a free cash flow margin of 36%.
Now for our outlook for the second quarter in the fiscal year 2022. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. We continue to see cloud migration and digital transformation as trends that are still in relatively early stages, and we are investing aggressively and are successfully executing against these long-term opportunities.
With the usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows: For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $376 million to $380 million, which represents 62% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $53 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share on an approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, which represents 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.77 per share on an approximate 349 million weighted average diluted shares.
Now some notes on our guidance. First, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions than historical performance. Second, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for long-term growth. In Q1, we are pleased to have had our best-ever quarter of hiring, and we plan to continue hiring aggressively throughout 2022.
Our North America and EMEA employees returned to the office at the end of Q1, and our APAC employees are returning to office during Q2. In addition, trade shows and other events are picking up in Q2, as is employee travel. In the past, we have framed the benefit of stopping in-person T&E and marketing events during COVID as 300 to 400 basis points of margin impact. We expect our return to office and increased in-person marketing events, as well as our headcount growth to more fully impact margins in Q2 relative to Q1. And even as we embark on these investments and our return from COVID, we remain solidly profitable, as indicated by our guidance.
Next, regarding income tax expenses in Q2, we will have a provision of about $3 million related to the Sqreen acquisition as well as our typical provision, mainly related to our international entities. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we are catching up on office build-outs in 2022 and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q1. We continue to attract more customers to the Datadog platform. We are broadening our platform's capabilities and observability and we launched application security monitoring in Q1. We are working very hard to execute against our opportunities, and I want to conclude by thanking Datadogs worldwide for their efforts.
With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Congrats as well, an amazing first quarter. I wanted to ask a question that I get a lot from investors, Olivier. If you think about your efforts around security, how do you see that playing out in the long run against like the pure-play security players? Is that complementary? Are you kind of moving to same turf? Is it like competition? How do -- how should we think about that? And then second thing is on the ongoing investments into R&D, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about the benefit you're getting from being just a pure cloud provider and hence, your speed of innovation potentially could just move quicker than other players that have to work in on-premise and on the cloud environment? On securities, so first of all, the way we see ourselves in the ecosystem is we don't compete with everyone in the field there, like security is very wide. There's many different categories and subcategories in there where we want to play a major role in securing the production, the applications and production environment and all of the life cycles that relate to that in terms of development operations and iterative changes to these environments. So that's where we're starting. We expect to compete with others there. We come from a different place in that we come from having all of the observability data already being deployed end-to-end on those systems and having active users, the integrality of the development and operations teams in these companies, and we think that's what gives us strength there.
To the other point you brought up around the speed of iteration, we definitely benefit a lot from being cloud-native and from being SaaS only. We actually get a lot of information about what customers do with our product and how they use it, and we see immediately what's being used not and what's working or not. So that helps us iterate very fast.
We also benefit from having a lot of users. I mentioned that in the first part of my answer, but we're being used every single day by every single developer and house person. That's a lot more than what you see on the typical security products. And so that gives you a lot more information about what you can do and what you can do better. It also gives you more leverage when it comes to actually solving the issues at the secure level. And that's part of the value prop we give to our customers. The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on a phenomenal quarter. Maybe I'm curious to get your take on the hyperscalers. And given the broadening product suite that Datadog is undertaking, how are these conversations changing with the hyperscalers? And one for you, David. As the economic environment and the outlook for GDP growth continues to be a little bit wobbly with higher rates, how should we think about the defensibility of the Datadog consumption business? So on the question about hyperscalers. So we work hand-in-hand with hyperscalers more and more. So we cover a lot more of the, I would say, the management surface for our customers who are also their customers. We help their customers be more successful and move to the cloud faster. And so as such, we help generate revenue for the hyperscalers, and that's why this partnership works so well with them.
We keep improving on those partnerships and developing them. I think we've announced this quarter some improvements to our Azure partnership, for example, where we are now part of the -- I would say, the Golden Pass presented by Azure for migrating to the cloud. And we're seeing some great customers onboarding, thanks to that.
David, would you like to take the other question? Sure, thanks, Kash. We believe that digital and cloud projects are still very high priority and are not being deprioritized. We haven't seen that. We think we're still early on. So with the data we have so far, we think there will be continued strong investment. There is always some volatility across our customer base. Our customer base is very well diversified across industries, and we benefited from that over time. So whereas we're not macro forecasters, and there may well be some sensitivity, we believe the long-term trends in digital migration and cloud will still be very strong throughout that cycle. The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. One quick one for you, just as it relates to the deeper strategic and technical penetration within the DevSecOps arena. I mean, it sounds like your thesis is very much because you have the critical massive data and the data gravity as it relates to your observability use cases, you're able to parlay that in a more meaningful way for security. And I'm wondering why not partner with some of your peers in that space versus kind of go at it alone? And then a quick follow-up for David, please. Yes, so that's a good question. So there's 2 things we bring to the table in security. One is we have, as you mentioned, the gravity and we're in the path of data for pretty much everything that relates to our customers infrastructure applications and their own users, which is obviously fantastic.
The other thing we bring is we have -- we're being used all day by everyone in development and in operations. And that's not typically something that the other security products -- or the typical security products are built for. So it's actually hard -- if you wanted to partner, it's hard to find a product that's built for those people. Most security products are purely built for security teams. So that's why we've been building a lot of that.
Of course, we still partner with a lot of the other players in the industry. But we embarked on this journey because we think we have – we come from a different spot, we think we have different take on the problem that in the end, is -- offers us and our customers a lot more leverage in that an actual chance at solving the 6 day issues, not just throwing software and resources at it. So this is where we come from. And David, just with respect to that delta between your reported revenue growth in billings, it's probably one of the bigger delta as we've seen in relation to recent quarters. And given your commentary around invoicing duration having stayed pretty stable, I believe that would be -- that would imply 7 to 8 months. I'm still curious as to why you'd see such a meaningful acceleration in billings head and shoulders above revenue growth. If you could just unpack that for us a little bit and when you expect that divergence to narrow? And I have to -- as I mentioned, there is variability in billing and RPO versus revenue based on when bills go out. We still have, for the most part, in our larger contracts pretty much annual billing. So the sending out of a large annual bill might move the duration a little bit, but not a lot. And the strong performance, the billing was very strong and indicative of the business, it was complemented by the fact that in this quarter, we sent out the bill for some large contracts upfront annual billing and the timing of that causes the variability. Over the average and over the course of the year, that balances out with the timing of the billing, and we believe that billing converges with revenue growth. We remind everybody that revenue growth and implied ARR growth is a better metric of the progress of the business. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Olivier, in your script, you mentioned a Fed ramp. I should have brought on kind of another topic that we were sort of hearing about from your partners, which is penetration observability in some of the underpenetrated industries. From your perspective, if you look at the different industries that Datadog participates in, which of the industries do you see can become greater adopters of observability versus some of the kind of traditional technology e-commerce for the -- Well, look, we've seen pretty much every single industry shows some signs of moving to the cloud already, I think. The order in which this industry has moved really depends on their appetite for being at the leading edge of technology changes and their exposure to interacting with their users online. So what we see -- what we saw first, obviously, was the -- so finance, for example, which is ahead in technology in general, or things like e-commerce, online media, that sort of thing.
Today, we actually see the full range of categories in the industries coming to the cloud. For example, we mentioned an auto manufacturer in our cloud, mentioned in hotel chain. We mentioned in the previous calls, we mentioned plumbing supplies companies, pretty much every single part of the economy is coming there. You're right, though, in your comment that some of those are late to the game than others. And so there's less penetration, I would say, in the more traditional less tech focused -- less tech-focused parts of the industry, but we're confident in everybody is coming to that party.
It's also the case in regulated industries, government, in particular, where not only the moves are a little bit more conservative in terms of technology transitions, but also this part of the industry are also more limited in what they can purchase, which is why it was very important for us to get FedRAMP-certified, which is also why we keep investing in more FedRAMP and more similar certifications, so we can go into more of these categories in more geographies. And then just 1 follow-up on one of the wins that you guys called out, I think it was a European manufacturer who I think was sort of engineering talent sort of constrained and they moved off of their DIY solution. And so if we take out the topic more broadly, because you’d think that the demand for talent is probably going to get worse. And so in terms of the DIY observability market converting more to, more commercial out-of-the-box value like the Datadog provide, how much of an opportunity do you think that could be for the business? Well, I think that's part of our -- it's always been part of opportunity, and that's really what makes the value prop even more attractive in the future. As you correctly pointed out, there's not going to be as many software engineers in general as the market will need. There's not this year, there's not going to be -- I think it's going to be even less the case 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years from now. So what our customers will need is a way for their existing staff to be more productive and a way to direct them to what is actually going to be differentiating for them as opposed to building and differentiated different infrastructure. So we clearly play -- this is a trend that benefits us in the end.
The other thing to bring up is that software in general is deflationary in nature. And that's also the case for us. We help our customers make more with what they have. We have them automate. We have them make people more productive. We help them use their infrastructure better. We help them ship projects that help them interact with their own customers better. So that's where we play. Next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. David, in your guidance, I know you mentioned you're not really seeing the macro issues, but are you assuming a similar close rate on your pipeline? Are you taking a more conservative close as it relates to the back half of what you're guiding to for the year? Like all -- as we've talked about, like all of our guidance, we tend to take more conservative close rates, i.e., new logos and more conservative usage than we've experienced historically. So that principle continues with our guidance and is consistent with what we've done in the past. And Olivier, that $10 million upsell, can you just speak to the pipeline of these larger transactions, what you're seeing as your customers expand? Well, we see many more customers in that range, right? So customers are riding this adoption curve with us, where we solve the bigger and bigger problem for them, they use more and more of our products. They move more and more of the infrastructure in the cloud to start with, and they themselves are scaling. So these are all multiplayers and increasing our footprint with them. So we have a healthy pipeline of those. We mentioned we handpick a few in every one of those calls, but that's definitely not an isolated case. And that customer is actually in the tens of millions and it's a -- I think a -- again, we don't expect that to be an isolated case. And I think we mentioned the strong continued growth of $100,000-plus and mentioned, even though we don't give out the 1 million customers every quarter, mentioned continued strong growth in millions. And that's indicative of that. We have many customers who are graduating from smaller lands to the 100,000, the 500,000 class and the 1 million class and above as our model has been all along. The next question comes from comes from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Congrats on the great quarter. A question on pricing, as your largest customer scale and standardize on Datadog, can you talk about how conversations have changed around pricing? And are there any particular modules where you're seeing relatively higher levels of pushback on cost given the rapid growth in data recently and the pricing changes made by some of your competitors in the last 2 years? Yes, so the -- look, any time you -- somebody is paying you tens of millions of dollar a year there's going to be a conversation about price because this is a line item that shows up. Typically, the -- what's going to be the most negotiated as part of that is the biggest part of the deal, which for some customers is infrastructure, for some other is APM, for many customers is logs because that's the 1 where data can grow in a way that's somewhat decorrelated from the size of the company infrastructure or the value of the company applications.
And our approach there really is to give as much flexibility as possible to customers, so they can align with their pay with the value they get. And we've shipped in the past many, many new features around that to give them more tiers for storing data, more ways of doing just in time sampling, archiving, and bringing back data from archives , give them more controls, more levers, and we expect to do more of that in the future.
But it's a very healthy conversation. We do expect that when customers are at fully at scale with us, we get more and more of a wallet share from them. But at the same time, the revenue we get won't grow linearly with the data volumes they send to us. That's natural. That's healthy. And if I could just follow up on free cash flow, generation has been very strong, 36% margin in the quarter, and I think, 28% for last year. How are you thinking about managing free cash flow margin going forward? Is the strength just a function of better-than-expected growth and maybe a tight labor market? Or do you see high 20s, 30% at a sustainable level? I think we've experienced long-term free cash flow to be slightly higher than EBIT. So correlate it with our EBIT, we have -- it is indicative of the growth of the business. and the efficiency of the business. As we mentioned, we will be returning, we believe, in Q2 to more investments, whether it be marketing events in the office, et cetera. So where we expect it to continue to evidence the efficiency in the business, it would be as it has been correlated to be slightly higher than the EBIT performance. The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Oli, I wanted to go back to security. You've obviously had a lot of success there and you're adding Hdiv this quarter. How do you see your sales force evolving over time? And maybe even the thought of a security overlay team at some point? Yes, so we're open to anything there. We haven't made any drastic changes to that. We're still focused right now on getting in front of our existing customers with these products and getting them to adopt the products and writing the maturity of those products with us to make sure they are as broadly as clickable as possible before we accelerate on the go-to-market for them. And we're very happy with where we are. We're exactly where we want to be.
Actually, we get a lot of paying customers with skin in the game and a lot of eyes on the products and a great amount of veracity in terms of development. We are expecting to test a few things on the go-to-market side in the -- I would say, in the coming few quarters, and then we'll see where this leaves us. We see some successes today already with app mobility, and we think it might actually turn a few different things, might accelerate things a little bit, but it's still early to tell. And then you guys have always had a very services-light model so easy to use. As you continue to scale up in the G2K, are there additional steps you can do to maybe even enable more synergies within a GSI community? Yes, so there's 2 things we're doing. So one is we're investing in our partnerships with SI and with the channel in general. So we're doing more there. And we also started productizing some service offerings. We actually called one out in one of the customers we released in the call. We have a small services team today that has a few packaged offerings that mostly revolve around accelerating adoption of Datadog and making sure we help customers that need that help, transform their businesses around the way things are running with Datadog. So we're investing on both sides. I mean, obviously, whatever we package ourselves with our own team, will then be scaled through third-party partners, GSIs and others. Congrats on the strong Q1. The next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. You're doing more application security and you've announced some things for observability in developer pipeline. Can you talk about how far you will be going in terms of a shift left towards more of the development side of things, including possibly around static code or source code. And as I said, just that shift left towards developers? So that's a great question. We definitely are doing more and more on the shift left and developer side. Obviously, we've talked about security quite a bit, and a big part of that is application security, which is a bit of a known category. So it's there, I think it's a little bit different in how we approach it, a little bit different in the cloud, but the category has been there before.
We're also investing in new categories, and you mentioned the CICD observability. That's a brand-new category. I wasn't there before. And we actually have a product in the market today that we started charging for. And we don't have any numbers to share today, but we are actually very, very pleased with the way this product is being received by customers.
So overall, we think we're going in the right direction there. There will be any more we want to do. I mean you brought up Hdiv, which also brings a bit more around closer to the source code and vulnerability management and things like that. There's more we want to do there, but we don't have anything to announce today. And can I just ask, I think an expansion or take to Matt's question in terms of facilitating your broader product line. Anything in the customer success area that has to be changed or post production engineering or professional services as you have a more broader and more complex offering? Yes. So we're scaling those teams quite a bit, and we're constantly also refining the way those teams are segmented so they can target specific types of customers, and in some situations, not many situations, also setting types of product. So we -- that's part of scaling the teams on the customer success, on the tech solutions, on the support side. So we're investing quite heavily there. I gave those teams a shout out because really, they've been doing a fantastic job at helping our customers scaling about a very broad product portfolio today. And I think there will be more successes to come there. The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Oli, as the sales force and the marketing team return to face-to-face events, any reason to think that we shouldn't see some level of acceleration in upsells to the larger part of the installed base as well as the potential to land even bigger with new deals? It's possible. I mean, look, we definitely have return to investment in some things that we were not doing for the past 2 years that we're doing again in in-person events in particular. I would say it's too early to tell whether it's it gives us an edge again on that side or whether it's just upping the table stakes for everyone for that. But definitely, we're investing with the expectations of returns on that. The next question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG. Congratulations on the strong results. So yes, I mean you've clearly been seeing very good traction moving into larger enterprise and Fortune 500 accounts. How does the competitive environment change there as you move up market? And then do you end up begging off against a different set of vendors? Or just how should we think of that impacting sales cycles? So I'm sorry, I'm going to give you the most boring answer ever, but we see no change. The situation there is very much the same as it was last quarter and even last year. We still focus largely on net new and cloud environments. We land fast and small mostly, and we end up growing quite a lot with those customers at the largest enterprises.
Sometimes, but not all the time, we're going to do a big displacement of usually a suite of tools that makes this homegrown and some of the other players in log or APM or infrastructure or all of the above. And these are -- these tend to be the larger lands because they start -- they start larger as they replace a bunch of existing things. But this is still not the majority of the go-to-market and customer acquisition. I think it shows that the product wins about all sorts of situations, but our focus is still on net new and cloud environment. And then just -- maybe just a quick follow-up on the security side, if it's okay. Is there anything more you can just say on the road map in the security space, or just like talk about the most natural capabilities that could be included as you start to move into Version 2 of the security platform. And I guess more specifically, and this might be a tough one, but -- do you see a scenario where you could more directly address the endpoint security use case? Well, so endpoint, I think, is -- it's not what we have in mind today, right? I mean there's plenty we want to do at the intersection of DevOps production environment applications. Like it's a gigantic problem space and one that's not well handled today. So we definitely are -- have that in our sights today.
In terms of what we can do in the road map, interestingly, there are many things we're doing today that are not branded security that are part of other products that actually play a big role in security. And so one of the questions we have internally, how do we actually draw the line around the security suite versus the rest of the Developed platform in a way that it doesn't confuse everyone.
I mean, for example, we mentioned in the last call, or sensitive data scanner product, which actually is used for security use cases, but it's currently part of our log management product. We have some similar situation with our network monitoring product that also listens to data and uses it for security use cases, but it's not part of our security offering. So there are some branding and packaging and product suite questions that we'll have to answer ourselves there. The next question comes from Steve Koenig with SMBC Nikko. Congrats on the quarter, it's a pleasure to be covering you guys. I wanted to asked about pricing, again, with kind of a little different angle. And thanks for your color on how you help customers manage their costs as they scale out with Datadog. That's very helpful. If I think about it from a different angle, more from the perspective of how you keep your pricing in check with infrastructure costs as the hyperscalers improve their price performance over time on compute and storage, how does -- you have a relatively simple pricing model in the space, which is a good thing. But I'm wondering, does host-based pricing, do those prices need to change over time as hyperscalers ride their cost curves down? And also in log management as well, as your -- you do have some data charges. And do those need to come down over time as hyperscalers become more price performing. Congrats again on the quarter. Thank you. Well, so there's a few things to consider there. So one is like the type of hosts that our customers buy also is changing over time, that they're also getting larger and larger instances from the cloud providers that costs more and more, even though the price for the same CPU on 2 different years is going to maybe get reduced a little bit by the hyperscalers.
The other factor to consider is that overall, even with all the improvements from the cloud providers and the, I would say, the software industry at large, our customers' experience still a dramatic increase in complexity. And overall, what this means is that a lot of the value gets shifted from actually from running the infrastructure itself to understanding it and managing it, which is what we do.
So in the end, we are in a position where we can maintain or even increase prices while still delivering more value for our customers and selling them more money. So that's the general dynamics here.
Now when you look at the things that are tied to very specific units, so for example, the price per gigabit and things like that, like -- of course, price per gigabyte is going to go down over time in some point. Right now, the form it takes is that there are more and more options that we keep giving our customers so they can do different things with different price points. But in the long run, if you fast forward 20 years, of course, you wouldn't expect to pay the same thing for a gigabyte in 20 years than you do today. But at the same time, I would say you also will have many, many, many others who are managing more data at the time. The next question comes from Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Olivier, you spoke a lot about several different potential products in the pipeline as you guys are developing internally. I'm hoping you might give us a little bit more color about the mid- and longer-term plans with regard to maybe areas that you plan to address with new products. Well, we have plenty of new products in the works, but for that, you'll have to show up to our events and conferences. We do expect to show more of that in the quarters to come. The areas we're going after, obviously, we're still doubling down on observability. We're early in observability. There's a lot more we can do -- we want to do a lot more that's going to bring value for our customers, and it's a very large market.
Obviously, we've been very open about the fact that we're investing massively in security and these costs in particular. So you'll see more from us on that. We also are pushing towards the developer workflows as we had mentioned, with CICD and some aspects of security and some other things that we might show. We're also investing in pushing or extending our user experience products in APM Suite to behavioral and user analytics as well as business analytics. So we keep pushing more and more functionality towards that, and you should expect to see more products from us in that area, which takes us into real-time BI. And then finally, we also are investing in ITSM-minded products started with incident response and incident resolution. And you should expect to see more from us in that area in the future as well.
Again, I can't give you any more details. We have a lot of goals in the year right now, a lot of products in flight. We're very bullish about the opportunity. We think -- we see it at a privileged part of the ecosystem where we have such a large surface of contacts, their customers infrastructure, their application, as well as their teams, their developers and their operations teams and other securities that we can solve an increasingly larger problem for them over time while benefiting from frictionless adoption of our platform, which is what year over year gives free cash flow margins that we've talked about today. So again, very bullish, a lot of products and a lot of things we're working on, but nothing more to announce today. The next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Olivier, I just want to start on Hdiv. The acquisition announced today with a vulnerability focus. Could you help us categorize where this competes in the stack? And specifically, are we focused on end point like CrowdStrike with the spotlight product or critical assets like server and data center where VM players like Tenable, Qualys and Rapid7 fit? So where does this fit within the stack and vulnerability and talk about the competitive advantage that they'll bring. It focuses on applications. And these are the applications that our customers build as well as the various libraries and dependencies that are brought into the mix as our customers build these applications. So this is -- this will find its right place on the application side of our cloud security platform. We don't have much more to share on the way this will be combined from a product perspective. But we see it as great technology, great product and also great expertise to add to the team and add to our momentum on the security side. And by the way, it did has [Indiscernible] as is often the case with security companies, there are some regulatory approvals to get disclosed. I know I'm going to be out of time. David, seasonality has just been a constant topic. It seems like since last quarter, I'm sure you're answering a bunch of investor questions intra-quarter about it. And the second half is a little lower as a percent of total than years past based on guidance. Anything for us to consider on seasonality now that you're a $1 billion-plus organization moving forward? No, it's always been -- it's a similar type of thing where -- the fourth quarter tends to be strong on customer acquisition. We have had, like every company a little slower and new customer acquisition in Q3 that didn't hold last year. It was a very, very strong Q3. And as we mentioned, generally, as you start the year in the first quarter, you have a little bit of slowness in getting going. In this quarter, we didn't have that as much. So it's really the same types of seasonality, which is quite minor relative to the previous years. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the conference back over to CEO, Olivier Pomel, for any closing remarks. All right. Thank you all for attending the call. And I want again to thank all Datadogs and there's many more of you out there, I should remind everyone that we've had our most successful hiring quarter in Q1. So thank you all, and we're all excited to be here, and we'll see you next quarter. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q2 as we executed well, and we extended our category leadership.
Let me start off with a review of our Q2 financial performance. In Q2, revenue was $406 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 21,200 customers, up from about 16,400 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,420 customers with ARR of 100,000 or more, up from 1,570 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.
We generated free cash flow of $60 million and a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar based net retention rate continues to be over 130%, as customers increased their usage and adopted more products.
Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. In Q2, while we overall saw strong customer growth dynamics, we have seen some variability in growth among our customers. We saw our larger spending customers continue to grow but at a rate that was lower than historical levels. This effect was more pronounced in certain industries, particularly in consumer discretionary, which includes e-commerce and food and delivery customers and affected more specifically our products with a strong volume based component such as log management and APM suite. Note that we did not see this with our SMB and lower spending customers who continued growing with us as they have in the past.
While these near growth data points and the current micro climate are leading us to be prudent with our short term outlook, we remain very bullish about our opportunities and confident in our execution as we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business.
First, the number of hosts and containers being monitored by our customers is growing steadily, which points to continued momentum of cloud migration and digital transformation projects.
Second, we had strong execution on the new logo side as new logo ARR was robust as we added a record 1,400 new customers in the quarter, including the impact of turning off about 200 customers in Russia and Belarus in Q2. And we closed a number of sizable six to seven figure year-over-year deal during the quarter with diverse customers, including a media conglomerate, a metal ore mining company, a US government agency, the SaaS business and a hyperscaler.
Third, our pipeline of large new logos and new product cross-sells going into the second half of the year is strong. And fourth, churn remains low with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high 90s.
Moving on to our products. We are pleased with the continued adoption and expansion of our products for our customers. The three pillars of Observability, which are infrastructure, APM and log management all grew strongly in Q2. Our APM suite and log management now exceeds three quarter of a billion [ph] of ARR. As a reminder, we define APM suite as including core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler.
In addition to that, infrastructure monitoring continued to grow strongly on par with recent quarters. We're also pleased with the adoption of our newer products. Our newer products, excluding infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and log management, continue to grow ARR more than 100% year-over-year. And we've seen a strong start with our CI Visibility product, which we announced at Dash last year and started charging for just a few months ago. CI Visibility already has more than 1,000 paying customers, including some product specific new logos.
Our platform strategy also continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 79% of customers were using two or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 37% of customers were using four or more products, up from 28% a year ago and 14% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 6% a year ago.
Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. In June, Gartner published a 2022 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability.
Datadog has once again been the leader, and having improved from last year on our scores and ranking in all dimensions. We attribute this to - first to our unified platform experience, covering DevOps, securities, and order to preserve [ph] in one place. But we also see it as a recognition of the continued evolution of Watchdog, our AI engine, which takes over the complexity of monitoring cloud native architectures and provides proactive alerts, carry trouble shooting and fully automate with cloud analysis. We're very pleased that our APM product went from GA to best-of-breed in just five years, and I want again to congratulate our teams for this achievement.
In June, we announced the general availability of Observability Pipelines, the 15th product in Datadog platform. As a reminder, this is based on our 2021 acquisition of Timber, the company behind a very popular open source project named Vector.
As organizations scale their applications, the volume of telemetry data grows exponentially. Engineers must manage large volumes of metrics, traces and logs and wrap them from many sources to better destination [ph] And this complexity leads to vendor lock-in, core data quality, risks of sensitive data leaks and an increase in overall management costs.
By using Datadog Observability Pipelines, customers can control the cost and volume of data, decouple data sources from their destination, standardize and improving data quality and redact sensitive data to have maintained compliance.
Next, we announced the general availability of Audit Trail in June, helping businesses safely adopt Datadog platform, while maintaining compliance, enforcing governance and building greater transparency.
And this week, we announced the general availability of Service Catalog. With cloud architectures, customers are often creating hundreds of thousands of interconnected services, which are owned and developed by globally distributed teams. This large network of services often makes Root Cause Analysis difficult, which can be challenging to understand what to do to remediate issues or who to call for help.
Our Service Catalog inventory services defines team ownerships and displays configurations independencies very similarly to what CMDBs might do or where CMDBs are typically manually populated. Our Service Catalog can identify this information automatically as it was specifically designed for the cloud edge.
Finally, this morning, we announced that we acquired Seekret, which is spelled S-E-E-K-R-E-T. Seekret API Observability Platform gives engineering teams to control their needs to better manage their private, public and third-party sets of APIs. With Seekret, we will accelerate on our path to bring customers visibility into the APIs and overtime, unlock new exciting capabilities for our APM suite on our security platform. That's it for our product update this quarter. And needless to say, we're all very grateful to our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. Now moving on to sales and marketing.
Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a global services and audit company. This customer is going through a large-scale digital transformation, including migrating from on-prem data centers to multiple clouds and in particular, Azure. They are consolidating nine disparate legacy and open source tools to Datadog as their strategic platform and purchase all of our products, as well as our premier support and technical account management services.
Next, we had a seven figure upsell with a managed service provider in Asia that is a top Datadog-authorized partner in the region. This customer transitioned from their legacy monitoring tool to Datadog and adopted the entire Datadog platform. They are experiencing rapid growth as they sell their MSP services to - at the US and CDN customers, and we are expanding the opportunity as well as ours in APAC.
Next, we had a seven figure land with a multinational media company. This customer has aggressive expansion plans for its streaming service, including in international markets. But they found that their current mix of open source and legacy solutions wasn't meeting their needs. They calculated Datadog with before itself simply by accelerating resolution of just one of their major incidents and avoiding loss of revenue. This customer started with infrastructure, APM and log management, with the opportunity to expand and to more usage in products as the company scales.
Next, we had a six figure land with a Fortune 500 logistics company. Three years ago, this customer chose legacy monitoring providers and homegrown solutions over Datadog. Now our platform has come a long way since then. Meanwhile, incumbents were unable to meet these customers' needs, particularly around their communities adoption, leading to dozens of high-profile incidents a year with a high time to resolution. Additionally, these customer expects to save nearly $3 million in developer resources by consolidating multiple products with Datadog.
Finally, we had a six figure land with a gaming division at hyperscaler. Previously, this company was primarily using open source and its own hyperscaler native tooling. But despite deep technical expertise, homegrown solutions were lacking granularity and consumed critical engineering resources. By using Datadog, this customer unlocked a prescriptive way to visualize alert and maintain the cloud gaming services.
In addition to these wins, we also had a number of sizable six and seven figure new logo and expansion wins with companies that have recently experienced business contraction and announced staff reductions. These customers are looking to streamline their operations, save on engineering costs or consolidate multiple vendors on the strategic platform.
We believe that software is a deflationary force and we are confident in our ability to help our customers do more with less, should economic conditions worsen. And these were this quarter's customer highlights, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their efforts and continued execution.
Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment is uncertain as we look into the back half of 2022. But we also see no change to the long-term trends towards cloud-based services and modern DevOps environments, and Observability remains critical to that journey. We continue to drive market leadership and for our customer's value, efficiency and cost savings to solve their complex monitoring problems.
As a result, we continue to feel very confident in our opportunities. We believe cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term growth and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycle. And we believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster, serve their customers better and in times like these become more efficient with their infrastructure and engineering investments. So we plan to continue to invest in our solid priorities to execute on these long-term opportunities.
At the same time, we will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and we'll calibrate further, if necessary, to balance our long-term investments with financial strength. Before I hand it over to David, I wanted to make a couple of announcements.
First, we are holding Dash 2022, our user conference on October 18 and 19 at the Javits Center in New York City. This is an occasion for us to showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show the one that we've been up to. We also will organize an investor meeting at Dash and we'll share more details on it shortly.
And last but not least, we are pleased to welcome Titi Cole to our Board of Directors. Titi is CEO of Legacy Franchises at Citigroup and brings over 25 years of experience in senior global leadership roles in the financial services industry. The perspective and experience will be incredibly valuable as we continue to be on scale.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Thanks, Olivier. We delivered strong financial performance in Q2. Revenue was $406 million, up 74% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter. As Olivier described, we executed strongly with robust new logo ARR growth, continued low churn and continued strong platform traction. But we did see some customers beginning to manage costs in response to macroeconomic concerns, which impacted our usage growth with some of our existing customers.
Looking at our growth with existing customers, our dollar-based net retention was above 130% for the 20th consecutive quarter, remaining strong as we continue to see customers use more existing products and adopt new products on the Datadog platform.
We saw usage growth with some existing customers decelerate in Q2 and that deceleration was concentrated in our larger spending customers as opposed to our lesser spending customers, where growth remained steady year-over-year. Amongst our industries, we saw relative deceleration in consumer discretionary customers, which represents low teens percent of our ARR.
As a reminder, we are highly diversified in industries and segments. And we saw lower expansion rate weighted towards areas of our platform that have volume-based components like certain aspects of log management and APM. Infrastructure monitoring ARR growth was relatively steady year-over-year.
On the other hand, our gross retention remained unchanged and steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe that our gross retention has reached and is sustaining these levels because of the stickiness of our product and the criticality of our platform to our clients. And as Oli mentioned, our new logos, we saw strong continued new logo acquisition and ARR growth, broadly by geography and across industries and company sizes.
Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 79% of our customers now using two or more products, 37% using four or more products, and 14% using six or more products in the Datadog platform as of the end of Q2.
Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $397 million, up 47% year-over-year. As in previous quarters, we had some differences in the timing of billings of a few large customers, which were built in Q2 last year but were billed in Q1 this year. And pro forma for those adjustments, billings growth year-over-year was in the mid-50s. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $881 million, up 51% year-over-year.
Current RPO growth was in the mid-50s year-over-year, and contract duration was slightly lower than the year ago quarter. In addition, we observed that some customers aren't changing their level of usage growth but are being more conservative in their commitments, which impacts billings and RPO growth but not revenue growth.
As we said in previous quarters, billings and RPO growth can fluctuate significantly and vary from revenue growth, whether higher or lower due to the timing of invoicing and duration of customer contracts.
To illustrate this, we note that billings growth for the first half of the year of 2022 was 72% year-over-year. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP, and we have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
Gross profit in the quarter was $328 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of sales this quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the high 70s range.
Given our success in increasing our investments in R&D and go-to-market, our non-GAAP Q2 OpEx grew 65% year-over-year versus 56% year-over-year in Q1. This included our return to in-person office travel and events, which contributed $11 million to the sequential growth of OpEx. Operating income in Q2 was $85 million or 21% operating margin compared to operating income of $31 million or 13% operating margin in the year ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $73 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $60 million with a free cash flow margin of 15%. Our free cash flow margin in the first half of 2022 was 25%.
Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we are using conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of customers. Taking into account the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent variability of the growth among certain customers.
As Olivier mentioned, we see healthy trends in the host and containers monitored and strong execution in our business, but we recognize customers may have less visibility into their own businesses due to the macroeconomic environment. So for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $410 million to $414 million, which represents 52% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $51 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.15 to $0.17 per share range based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For the full year fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.63 billion, which represents 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $275 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.81 per share based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Now as regards to our margin guidance, I wanted to point out. First, gross margins have recently been at the top of our historical range. In operating expense, we have returned to in-office attendance, travel and events. We estimate that this was a 300 basis point sequential margin impact in Q2, and we expect an additional 100 basis point sequential margin impact in Q3.
As Oli mentioned, in Q4, we will hold our Dash user conference and we will participate in the AWS re:Invent, our largest trade show at the end of the year. The cost of these events will be approximately 400 basis points of margin impact. We're back to fully in-person events this year, and we're excited to get in front of customers and showcase our many product innovations.
Next, we have been successful in making R&D and sales and marketing investments, and we believe these will pay off in the future. While we plan to continue to invest, we will remain judicious and disciplined in our cost structure given macro uncertainties.
As indicated by the guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins in the second half of 2022 to be in the low double digits. We are healthily profitable on a non-GAAP basis and our free cash flow generative. And we have built a highly efficient, frictionless business model while driving high ROI on our investments over time.
Our efficiency and financial strength affords us options in times of macro uncertainty that other market participants will not have, and we intend to make the best of this opportunity to drive our long-term growth. But of course, we are mindful of the environment and are closely monitoring our costs carefully, and we will calibrate further, if necessary, to maintain our financial strength.
In conclusion, while we recognize there is greater uncertainty in the macro environment right now, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage.
We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys, and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial strength. I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Yeah, thank you taking the questions and really impressive Q2 results with 74% growth. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the trends you're seeing in the business and particularly with respect to the guide. I guess the first question is, as the quarter progressed, when did you start to see some of these slower usage trends in some of these verticals? If you could give a comment on that?
And then, David, in terms of the guidance in terms of how you were framing it, can you give us a sense of what you're sort of assuming in the back half with respect to Q3 and Q4? Is it some of the trends that you're seeing in July, did that improve or stabilize or worsen? And just give us some sort of context on how you are framing the guidance for the back half, that would be super helpful? Okay. So I'll start maybe with the linearity. And we did see the viability in usage growth that we mentioned. We saw that start really in late April, May and June. So as we got deeper into the quarter. I should say that this is - if you're thinking of what happened in terms COVID, this is not a sharp pullback as we have seen at that time. But we saw it's just, for some customers still growth, but slower growth for certain types of customers and others than what we would have seen historically.
I should say that while we did see that for some of our products, especially the ones that have more of a volume component, net logs and some positive APM, we did see continued healthy growth in host and or I should say, cloud instances and containers, which we're really indicative of the fact that the cloud migration is proceeding as it was before.
To fully answer the question also, I think you - maybe are getting ahead of what David is going to talk about a little bit. But in July, we did see an improvement on those trends, but we still remain conservative in our outlook for the short term because of the noisiness of the data we're seeing there. There's a few more valuations, a bit more noise. And all of that is underpinned by some macro uncertainty. So we want to derisk that a little bit and be a bit it more careful. David, do you want to comment on that? Yeah. On guidance, as you know, we have always been conservative in our guidance by using lower organic growth and other metrics than we've seen historically and continue to maintain that philosophy.
I would note that if you look at the raise here and the percentage of the beat that was passed through into the raise from Q2, it is lower, more conservative than we have done in previous quarters. And the reason for that is the macro uncertainty where we can't be as confident about what happens given the macro uncertainty.
So I would say there, if you want to take that, there were some incremental conservatism put into this. But I'd remind everybody that we've always been quite conservative in using assumptions that are lower than the past when we give guidance. That's super helpful. I appreciate all the context. And one more if I could just sneak in one quick question. Olivier, on the comment on which sort of products may be seeing slightly lower usage. I fully understand like the volume-based products like logs that makes complete sense.
With APM, though, I'm a little confused on why you might see some deceleration there. Because correct me if I'm wrong, I think that's primarily based on host-based pricing. So any comments on like the APM side versus log side in terms of how cost -- some of the trends you're seeing in terms of usage across those two parts of the portfolio? That's a great question. So for APM, there's actually part of APM that looks like logs, which is APM is - part of it is host-based and part of it is traffic-based. If you want to run analytics and have longer retention on certain parts of your APM data, it basically behaves like logs.
And that's the part on which we've seen some slower growth. It's still growing, but both are actually still growing healthily, but I would say, slower than they were in recent quarters for these types of customers.
And you can do the same thing - with this generative data you can show a little bit more, you can reduce retention, these other levers customers have to control the spend there. Makes total sense. I got it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Thank you. The new version of my name, its Meith [ph] Can I stay on that subject, Olivier. So if you think -- is there a different pattern of how people work with you and use you, if you say infrastructure volumes are - or infrastructure is not as much impacted or is not impacted as the log and APM part?
Like are you more important on that side because like if I'm thinking like I need to monitor my applications as much as I need to monitor my infrastructure. So I'm just -- like maybe help us understand a little bit the differences there? And then I have one follow-up. No, it's just that these are - you have more like short-term levers to actually optimize a little bit in logs and APM, anything that's volume-based. What we've seen customers do is - I mean, really, if we were to cater that customer then we would break them into three buckets.
One bucket is the customers that spend a lot with us, have us word to word in their business, now seeing their business slow down. That's what we mentioned in consumer discretionary and for delivery, for example. In those cases, naturally, if customers are themselves are growing 10% to 50%, and they're using several already equivalent to us, they have always been, that's natural. But that's only a small part of our customers.
We're very diversified, and we also have a very small part of our customer that uses, to pay us too at this point. The second bucket I would say is customers they have a series he can spend with us. And don't you see a little bit more uncertainty in the future. So their businesses might not be challenged today, but pretty much every CFO or whoever has a mandate to look more closely at their expenses.
And what we see those do is they're looking for optimization. They're looking for maybe to find some leaky faucets they can close. And you can typically find some of those in logs, for example. And this is not something new. I mean we've just said before, every customer goes through cycles where they optimize a little bit and then they go again and then they optimize again.
What happens in times like that is that you see customers bunched in the same quarter, do we need all at the same time because they're all going through the same macro events. So we're seeing some of that there.
And again, this is not comparable in breadth or in magnitude to what we've seen at the beginning of COVID. But still, we see that in the data, so we wanted to call it out on the call. Then the third bucket of... Sorry. Go ahead... Just to finish it. I had promised three buckets, I'll deliver you the three. The third bucket is customers that are lesser spend, which in this case, we mean less than $500,000 a year on us. They are basically growing as they were before. They're actually growing more slowly than the larger ones. The larger ones have slowed down a little bit while the smaller ones haven't. Just want to clarify, when - if you look after the call on our website, you'll see that in APM it's host-based pricing, but there's other parts that are like logs, as Oli mentioned, that are data related that are related to ingestion and indexing.
And so what we're saying is that the infrastructure part, both with the infrastructure and the APM didn't experience as much variability, but the ability to tweak the use of the data through both ingestion and indexing which is more of a part of logs, but also a part of APM was where we saw that variability. Okay. Perfect. And then the follow-up is if you think about, and I'm sure you have thought about it as you thought about the implications for the second half. Consumer discretionary sounds like the first thing that in the kind of downturn gets impacted.
You also mentioned food delivery a little bit, which is kind of seems more like the newer tech companies. Is that something that you kind of anticipate to go through the supply chain? So BPG comes next, fashion retail comes next. How do you think about it or how do you think about that when you were buffering for the second half? Thank you. Yeah. So we're very diversified. So no particular part of the industry actually covers the large part of our revenue. And also, I would say, we - in terms of those of our customers, they are very following in the cloud migration or that cloud native to start with, we actually probably have more of them in consumer discretionary than in other verticals that we have. So that all that came into consideration when we looked at our guidance. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yeah. I can pronounce Raimo’s name perfectly well. So, thank you. Thanks for giving me chance to ask question here. So I'm curious when you look at AWS and Azure, I mean, much larger business. They had good bookings, I think backlog growth, whatever you want to call it.
But if you can help us reconcile your CRPO growth. I'm sure there are company specific things that pertain to how you see of your growth on a year-over-year basis, sequential growth basis. How do we look at that in the context of what's happening with the hyperscalers. And they did put up even during an uncertain time, tremendous backlog growth, whatnot.
So is there something specific to Datadog? Maybe it's the 18% or so, high teens percentage exposure to consumer discretionary. Maybe if you parse that out, there is a different way to look at the rest of the business. And if you could quantify how the rest of the business did relative to how the hyperscalers were able to put up that kind of backlog. So I'm trying to just bridge the performance of Datadog versus the public cloud at an aggregate level, if you don't mind. Thank you so much. Yes. So I'll start on the rapid trends with the hyperscalers and then maybe David can give you more color on the bookings part. So in Q2, we did a lot better than the hyperscalers. So we're growing a lot faster than all of them combined. And they've decelerated actually more than we've done in relative basis. So we actually feel good about the ratio there. Like we are commanding a larger portion of the cloud revenue than we were last quarter. In terms of the go forward, I don't think the hyperscalers have to guide specifically for that.
But we - in terms of business trends, we see that all of the leading indicators of success are looking good for us. So I've mentioned it on the call but we're seeing great action with new logos. We're seeing great success with new product attaches. The pipeline's going into the second half of the year are very good. We've also done very well with the capacity we've added and the hiring and everything that's a putting to our future.
So all of that is looking good. What we don't have necessarily in terms of the gap for the future is we have a little bit of more noise in the data in terms of growth, which leads us to be a little more conservative. David, do you want to give more color on the booking part of it? Definitely. So remind everybody that with our land and expand where we start getting used by clients, they scale up the growth and when they get to a certain point through, this has been going on for the whole business model. They go to an increased commit. Because of that, there's variability in the billings and RPO that net-net, over time, on average, go towards the ARR growth. Again, remember, we mentioned that the ARR growth is the best metric. And the way to look at that is that you look at the revenues.
You take - you use the linearity, which is 34%, 35% of that and multiply that times 12, and that is pure because it doesn't get altered by when a bill goes out either in timing or whether the bill is a previous commitment plus an on-demand or a new commitment. So it's always going to be noisy with us. We understand that investors and analysts look at it.
So we try to give some color on that, but remind everybody that, that is very variable and only over time gets -- it comes back to the revenue growth, so just to remind everybody. And I think we said we basically put in there that in the first half of the year, the growth of this was in the 70s, pretty close to revenues. Why?
Because there were timing of billing in the first quarter relative to the second quarter that moved the first quarter up and the second quarter down, but it really doesn't have much effect on the drivers of our business. And just to be very clear about this, like theoretically, we don't actually manage the business to billings. And that's because it aligns us with our customers. So we manage it to usage, which it turns into revenue pretty directly for us.
What this means is we're very heavily - land and expanded. When we land, we typically land small. So that has typically a small impact on billings. And when we expand whether we actually do the expansion this quarter, next quarter that doesn't really matter because it doesn't really change to usage of customers. It doesn't really change their growth profile. It doesn't really change the revenue that we're going to see from them. And so we see some noise there, and we don't manage the business to it. Thank you, Oli and David. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Oli, one for you and one for David as well, please. Oli, you talked about some wins vis-à-vis, DIY and open source displacements in your prepared remarks. But I suppose in a more challenged or uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the free or - if it aren’t broke, don't fix it type model is potentially more attractive.
So I'm curious if you can give us some color commentary on how you expect to sort of effectively compete with ""free open source"" alternatives, especially for some of your volume-based solutions? And then I'll follow up for it separately. Yes. So free is actually the most expensive typically because you have to build it yourself. And it turns out people tend to be the most expensive thing for our customers. We mentioned in the script earlier that we actually had a number of sizable wins with customers that had announced layoffs shortly before they actually bought from us for the first time or have big expansions with us.
And that's because we have been more efficient. We have been concentrate their efforts where it actually adds to their business as opposed to reinventing - there were more expensive and efficient way themself. I appreciate that. And David, just for you, I think historically, you've characterized that roughly three quarters of the business is tied to committed and rate card committed type contracts. And I think you were very categorical in mentioning that RPO levels are moderating as some of your customers moderate their commitment level.
So I was curious to get your perspective on sort of the next 6 to 12 month impact on increased conservatism around the commit levels as well as how that translates into the quarter of your business that is very much usage and average-oriented. If you could just frame that for us in more of a 6 to kind of 12 month frame from here? And that's it for me. Yes, we haven't seen - yes, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any change in those numbers. We still have the land, commit, use, grow, we get into on-demand, recommit, but we did say that in the level of conservatism that was introduced to some clients that they may have stayed more into their previous commit plus on demand. Because of that, that doesn't for that situation affect the revenues because they're still consuming the same, but they may want to retain more optionality.
This is really sort of in looking at financial management with level of uncertainty. You generally would pay a higher price if you stayed that way, but you'd be trading off the higher unit price, the marginally higher unit price for the more optionality.
And we did see some of that. We don't know what's going to happen next, but we would think that if we continue to have macro uncertainty, there will be some customers that will opt for that type of pattern relative to the commitments. And we're fine with that, by the way. We designed the business that way. We don't offer large discounts for very large time commitments. And that, again, that's by design, like we actually want to align or success with the -- usually of our customers, and we're happy to keep it that way. In times like that, it always play down. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe David, a follow-up, I think really to Raimo's question earlier, in your guidance philosophy, did you assume other verticals beyond consumer discretionary slow their usage? And maybe what are the assumptions from smaller customers? It sounded like they actually were fairly strong this quarter. Yes, to take the second part, I think we saw that in our smaller customers, we had very consistent net and gross retention. We always do that. So our guidance always takes the drivers, which would be the organic or usage growth and the new logos, it always takes it down.
So we do that in every quarter. I think you know that from following us. And in this quarter, I mentioned that by passing through less of the beat we inject an incremental level of conservatism. But overall, the philosophy of basically taking all of those things down and it remains at the core of our philosophy of providing guidance. Got it. Okay. And then was there a geographic element to any of the kind of the slowdown in consumption? Was there a European element? Or was it sort of just broad-based geographic? There was not. We did not see that. It was not geographic. As we mentioned, it tended to be more either large spend or industry based, but we did not see that geographically. Got it. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kamil [Mielczarek ] from William Blair. Your line is now open. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. One for Olivier, maybe. First of all, congrats on the acquisition of Seekret. Dave has always historically done a great job of rapidly integrating these products and launching them as new solutions. I think at Dash, you mentioned that the typical turnaround is one year for these products to become a stand-alone Datadog solutions.
However, given the upward trend in cash generation and your cash and equivalents are now approaching $2 billion, have your thoughts changed around potentially making a more transformative acquisition, especially given the decline in market valuations today? It's possible. Everything is open. We've looked at some of those in the past. We see the value is higher for larger businesses like that. But we're really looking at valuations coming down and some more opportunities presenting themselves to us there. So everything is possible. But in general, we're very active on the M&A side. I think we'll only be more active as markets temporarily are right now. But there's not much more I can say. Great. And just as a follow-up. Earlier this year, we saw Datadog building out its recruiting engine, and I see you accelerated investments into sales and marketing again this quarter. I think even after adjusting for T&E. Can you update us on where these incremental investments are focused?
And given the macro environment, how do you think about the balance between preserving margin versus continuing to hire maybe more aggressively and coming out stronger on the other end. Thank you. So right now, we're aggressively recruiting. We're building capacity. We're successful at it. And I really see it as a predictor of future success. We're in an interesting situation because -- as a company, we are very efficient. We've been very disciplined from the funding of the company. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, we burned less than $30 million on our way to IPO, and we've generated a lot more cash than that since then.
So discipline is getting into the DNA of the company. We also built the business around model that is frictionless and extremely efficient. And we've shown this efficiency, I would say, over the past two quarters by growing very fast while being fairly profitable.
So we - there's no doubt in our minds about the long-term profitability profile of the company. So what this does is that it affords us opportunities to invest in times like this, that the rest of the market will not have. Last year, everybody could invest, everybody could spend money, it really didn't matter. This year, I think it's a little bit different. So we really see that as an opportunity to break from the back even further and innovate, build self capacity and all those things. Now obviously, as I said earlier, discipline is in the DNA of the company. So we're always looking at what our margins are or the macro environment is. And we have all the levers we need to adjust so we can maintain profitability in the future. David, do you want to comment some more? Yes. I just want to add that what we said all along was, we try to maintain a steady investment profile, which is focused on R&D and sales and marketing investments. And it's banded by what we can execute, what we feel we can hire, integrate, et cetera. And in periods where there are -- is an acceleration, we said this many times on the top line, we can't invest as fast as that when the top line went up to 80%.
So you're going to have margin expansion. That was exaggerated because there were some costs that didn't happen in COVID that are part of our normal business operations. So we try to maintain a steady profile of investment and the variability is with this acceleration of the top line, you might see that because it flows through at such a high marginal rate. And then if you see a deceleration, you might see less of that margin expansion. So that's our philosophy, but it's always to invest and take advantage of the long-term opportunity. Yes. The last thing I'd say we feel great about the opportunity in general. We feel great about the -- as I mentioned earlier, the leading indicators of success whether it's new logos, product attaches, or product pipeline, our ability to ship it as well as the pipeline we see of customers that are in sales processes with us for new products or just brand new deployments.
So we feel great about all that. And this makes us very confident into our investments. What's possible though is that the demand environment is a bit more challenged. There will be a bit of a longer time for us to show around these investments, but we are fine with that. That’s very helpful, color. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Good morning. David, I think everyone is still a little confused. You're seeing an inversion with what's happening with SMB and large enterprise. Many companies are kind of weakness in SMB not at large. Can you explain why you think you're seeing this inversion? And are you embedding a more conservative view in the back half? Yes, not an inversion. I think what we said was -- we did not see what you're saying, which is SMB and smaller customers did not act differently than they had. What we said was whether it's an enterprise mid-market or SMB, what happened was in certain segments, consumer, et cetera, we had a more conservative or a more of a cost mentality.
And two, regardless of where it was -- remember SMB for us is 1,000 employees or less, mid-market 1,000 to 5,000, enterprise 5,000 and up. That in the larger areas where there had been substantial expansion, we saw a look at that costs. So those were the determinations. And for us it wasn't Europe, it wasn't that SMB fell out. It was those things.
And in terms of the second half of the year, we don't know. But in what we guide always, we assume lower organic growth in all the sectors than we have historically and that we might expect. So I think inversion is the wrong thing because what this -- what happened was the driver of the cost look was not whether it was an SMB mid-market or enterprise, but what the level of spend and the industry. One way to see, it is - we're critical to our customers. We're critically important, we deliver value. We have them to be more efficient. So in general, and whether -- whatever the size of the customer is, we're not on the chopping block. But the more customers spend on us, they're going to look for savings where they're spending money, and they're going to see that at a larger levels of spend with us. And as we mentioned earlier, there's always a little bit you can optimize, especially with some of the volume-based product. And by the way, gross retention stayed the same at all the different levels, SMB, mid-market and enterprise. So when you're talking about, do you have the solution, are you continuing to do solution, we saw no change in the gross retention across all of our customer sizes. Thanks for clarifying. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Okay, thank you for taking the questions. Oli, you're frequently speaking to a lot of Datadog customers, and totally speaking, are they raising more questions about your pricing levels in this environment? Any commentary on that would be helpful. So we - were actually very optimistic from our conversion with customers because there's more and more of them. They want to buy more product. They want to use more of our products. They want to -- so it'd be a problem for them. Everybody wants a better deal, but I think that's always been true, and that's always going to be true. And it's even truer in situations like this where the CFOs have a mandate to be more conservative. So -- but anecdotally, from what we see with customers, we're very bullish. Okay. Got it. And then you touched on some interesting examples in your script, but if you were to look back over the past six months or so, I'm wondering whether or not there has been any change to the trajectory of customer consolidation or standardization on Datadog? So we keep seeing more and more of it. It's still not the majority of what we do. But we think, again, if the -- there is prolonged macro issues in the market, like we might see more consolidation and customers now want to really try to save on their legacy software by consolidating on us.
So we definitely see that as a possibility. Again, that's not the majority of what we do today. That's not what we base any of our projections on, but that's something that we think might happen. Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking the questions here, guys. I did just want to come back for that other point previously, regarding the SMB versus enterprise. And really, is it fair to characterize some of the, I guess, movements you're seeing with these larger deals?
Is it may be less of an impact to you at the SMB level, either because you're license [ph] has been a wallet share when they're looking to pay out their vendors? Or is it possible that those SMB organizations just have less exposure to your more usage-based products. They have the same exposure but simply the difference is, what's your time to say, $5,000. Probably not. If you're a much larger customer, it's worth your time to sell $500,000. And that's what we see with those optimizations. Understood. And then the follow-up I had for you is if I look at the trends for multiproduct adoption from your customers, I think this is the first time we've seen your two plus product module adoption actually declined sequentially from 81% to 79%. Is the implication there that your customers are starting smaller now or deciding to pay -- will take another product from you at a later date? And again, if you could help me parse out that metric, that would be helpful. It's just mechanicals because we - I think we said 75% of our new logos are landing with two more products, and we have more new logos. And so this pushes the number down a little bit. There's nothing, you know, 81%, 79% these are all just - there's nothing, no change in trend. Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. I'm interested in the customers that are doing some cost rationalization. And trying to unpack, is that something that's targeted directly at Datadog? Or is it actually as part of a broader cloud rationalization that you see going on. It just happens to be that Datadog gets pulled into that and may even just see splash on effect as customers are managing their overall cloud topology and with the pricing that pulls down Datadog. Help me unpack those two things, whether or not it's Datadog focused or more of a broader cloud focus. It's just focused on their cost structure. So they line up their expenses by decreasing in decreasing order and they heat up everyone at least and they see what they can do to optimize. And again, a number -- you've seen a number of customers that had layoffs. So they're going after their cost structure.
Their hard core cost structures that are there -- their workforce and we're part of that. I think that it's a good thing because those customers -- and a lot of us were very critical, one of their top vendors. That means, for those of them who use us both will, like we are, to a certain extent, tied to their own trajectory. Okay. So you're saying that this is very focused on Datadog as a line item and not just a splash on effect necessarily of... No, I'm saying let's focusing what they're spending money on. And for some of those, they're spending a lot of money. They're spending more money on cloud in there. I guarantee you, they're also trying to save money on that. And we know that the cloud providers are also working with these customers helping with their spend. I think everybody is aligning trying to make their customers successful there.
And we actually have been involved in efforts where we work with the cloud providers and these customers to help them make the most of what they have. And again, in times like this, we want to be on the side of our customers. We want to help them. We want to have them get the most of what they spend on us. so we can have a long-term successful relationship with them. Now given the stickiness and what we did - just monitoring of real-time application for their clients, we feel that and our experience has been that it is less focused on other things than Datadog, but when you're looking at your cost structure, there are opportunities, as you said, to rationalize across.
But generally, if you look at the gross retention, you look at how important Datadog is to the businesses. And you read the newspapers, you see that it's focused on other things more. Yes. Yes. No, no, that makes sense. And one other last question, if you may. I think you alluded to some timings of some contracts over quarters and this type of thing. In that there may have even been some improvements in July and some of the momentum of closing contracts. Can you comment on some of those improvements and how you see them kind of juxtaposed with some of the other caution that you're talking about and have to. I think the improvements in July were not about closing contracts. The one I mentioned were about the usage trends, which is fairly quite a selling force from the closings and the contracts and everything else. We also -- again, a great pipeline, and we're very happy with what we've seen sell side in July, but this is where -- which we commented about the usage. Yes, like they're always -- I think it's been on calls over time. Every call, if there is some timing differences to the positive, billing was in this quarter. We try to point it out because when the bill goes out or when the commitment is not -- is not as correlated to the revenues as ARR is.
So we - I think we said that on every - almost every earnings call, and we just remind everybody all the time that because of the land-expand model that you're going to have variability plus and minus. And when it's plus, we want to remind everybody not to read anything into it. And when it's less, we want to remind everybody that that's not the major metric that drives top line growth of the company. Sure. But I mean, if you've got utilization, it should turn into additional revenue in future periods, and I think you're mentioning kind of a positive trajectory, do you see... Usage actually is revenue in the same period. Like it's two others are one and the same. There's no delay between those two. But there's a delay - we were - now there was billings. Yes, and I guess what I'm getting at is, if you see that positive trajectory in July, it will turn into revenue in the period. How are you seeing that going forward... Yes. But we're making marginal, yes, we're telling you that we're telling - saying that unlike in COVID there was -- that we had strong usage growth. We had usage growth in a lot of places and on average, in the second quarter. What we're saying is that in July, we saw pockets where there was a little better usage growth, but we're not calling the market here. We're basically reporting what we see and what we hope is the most helpful in a formative way. So yes... Okay. Thank you. Thank you. This has concluded the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Olivier Pomel, for closing comments. All right. Thank you. I want to thank everyone for spending time with us on the call. And again, I want to thank all of Datadog employees for a great quarter and for continuing build a fantastic company and so proud of our customers. So thank you all, and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Please go ahead. Thank you, Lauren. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Datadog’s third quarter 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog’s Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog’s CFO.

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q3 as we continued to execute on our platform vision. Let me start with a review of our financial performance. In Q3, revenue was $437 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range.
We had about 22,200 customers, up from about 17,500 in the year-ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,600 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 1,800 in the year-ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.
We generated free cash flow of $67 million, with a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products.
Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 80% of customers were using two or more products, up from 77% a year ago. 40% of customers were using four or more products, up from 31% a year-ago and 16% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 8% a year ago.
We continued to be pleased with this continued adoption of multiple products in our platform, which indicates the additional value we are bringing to our customers. We continue to see strong ARR growth with our newer offerings and our products introduced since 2019, which excludes infrastructure monitoring, core ATM and wealth management remain in hyper growth mode.
I also want to highlight a couple of our newer products, Database Monitoring and CI Visibility. We started charging for these products three and two quarters ago, respectively, and each has already exceeded in ARR and more than 1,000 customers. And as we are further developing them, we are confident these products will lead to a broader set of use cases for a larger set of customers over time.
Now moving on to this core business drivers. At a high level, Q3 was overall very similar to Q2 with strong performance in new logos and new product attach activities tempered by growth of user from existing customers that further healthy was below our long-term historical average. This added up to sequential net ARR added that was slow to Q2.
To give you a bit more color, first on the usage trend. As we said, user growth was overall solid, but consistent with Q2 trends. From a product perspective, Nostra [ph] was more homogeneous among our major products than it had been in Q2. Looking at industry verticals, similar to last quarter, we continue to see a more pronounced effect in consumer discretionary and in particular with our customers that are cognitive and fully scaled into public cloud. Note that the consumer discretionary vertical represents low-teens percent of ARR and increase e-commerce, as well as food and delivery.
All that said, we are pleased with our Q3 strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. With all of our products meaningfully outperforming the growth of the large cloud providers. While the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain a headwind in the near-term, we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business and remain bullish about the long-term opportunities and aggressive with our investment plan.
First, we continue to see strong growth in new logo ARR, including some large wins in traditional industries. We'll talk about some of those in a bit.
Second, our sales pipeline is strong heading into Q4 for both new logos and new products. And we're seeing great opportunities across customer prices, geography and industry. Along side our strength in new logo ARR, which gives us confidence that visual transformation and cloud migration remain a top priority. It’s perhaps even more critical in difficult times when businesses need to be more agile and do more with less. Remember that with our usage specifically models, new logos wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but they are very important to us as new customers expand their usage in subsequent new quarters and subsequent years.
Third, we are seeing continued expansion on our platform as indicated by customers adopting more of our products.
And finally, churn remains low and hasn't changed with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high 90s. We believe this high gross revenue retention is indicative of the business criticality to have Datadog for our customers.
Now let's move on to product and R&D. Few weeks ago, we had our Dash user conference, which was an occasion to showcase the expansion of our products and the results of our R&D investments.
Let me go through some of these starting with visibility before moving on to security, developer experience; and finally, the ability to take action within Datadog. First, we are doubling down on our investments in the visibility, starting with two new products, Data Stream Monitoring and Cloud Cost Management, both addressing growing needs and strong demand from our customers. We also extended our APN [ph] fleet to offer mobile app testing, map and dynamic experimentation.
On the network side, we added traps and monitoring products. On the learning side, we announced low-forward, which coupled with live archives and the visibility pipeline retested at the center of our customers better management.
Responding to customer demand. We also expanded our sensitive data scanner beyond logs to identify sensitive data across APM and RAM. And across the platform, we've announced expanded support for open telemetry, PCI compliance where we have on log, as well as EPA compliance across most of Datadog.
Second, we are extending our security platform. We announced cloud security management, which brings together cloud security, cloud security posture management and resource catalog as a frictionless reach and context aware, cloud native application correction platform or CNAP.
Beyond [indiscernible] protection for application security management to enable blocking attacks in real time directly with the [indiscernible] platform and we now provide renewability monitoring to give our users a high-fidelity picture of all applications production as well as the dependencies, renewability and the attach rate base.
Third, we follow through with our recent entry in developer experience. We announced continuous testing to facilitate end-to-end testing as soon as the cloud is develop, which increases quality and velocity at the same time. And we showcase intelligent test run using our rich APM and propylene data to automatically keep united tests and drastically reduce soon money spent on CICD.
Fourth and last but not least, we announced new product areas that take our platform for observing to allowing our users with action and response all within Datadog. We announced our asset management products to allow users to correlate and summarize alerts, events and issues, movies in order to resolve problems directly from the Datadog area of concern.
We also announced that the workflow, which allows customers to develop and run
ultimately develop or security remediation using no code editor and already more than 200 integrations to furbishing.
We announced lease availability for hosting the collaboration meeting tool that we acquired last year, RUM's real-time screen sharing installation point in Datadog. And finally, we kept on expanding the scope of our watchdog AIM energy. Further automating the detection and guiding the resolution of application in the cost problems. As for dominance from NASH. And as you can tell, the team has been hard at work, and I'm extremely proud of our innovation velocity and focus on our customers.
And lastly on products. As we announced in the press release issued this morning, we acquired Cloud Craft, a planning design tool used by tens of thousands of cloud optics to create [indiscernible] , including real-time health, configuration and cost data and we are very excited for their team to bring to Datadog.
Now moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure land with approaching 100 grocery chain. This company was mitigating to Azure, but was held back by their open source solution. And because this grocery chain has fanatic better controls around personally investing fair information. Our extensive data center and our HIPPA compliance filled that gap amd were differentiators for Datadog giving this opportunity.
Next – we signed a 7-figure land with a major multinational restaurant chain, this company had a legacy availability solution that wasn't able to scale with their vision of subunits and severe environment. They also needed an end-to-end view of their customer journey, and we will now use their paradox products, including Synthetics and RUM to drive customer experience improvement.
Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a social networking app. This company was previously a Datadog customer but had moved several years ago to a competitor as maybe certain languages where APM product is going to go well at the time. Today, our APM not only magical abilities of the solution, but presented significant advantages in terms of either deployment, alerting and [indiscernible] detection. And we also plan to take advantage of our new service catalog, taking Datadog at the center of the operation.
Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a large Asia-based technology conglomerate. This company is many business units include consumer electronics and IoT. And the use of Datadog has grown rapidly with the number of devices we are managing.
We had a number of benefits from using Datadog including lowering the amount of buckets by 25% and a high time to resolution by 50%. We have also seen a significant sensing in incident response activity by encode engineers from 20 hours, 22 hours per week. With this new, this customer has now adopted 14 Datadog products.
Next, we had an eight-figure multiyear upsell with a large e-commerce company. This customer had been using primarily infrastructure monitoring and APM with Datadog and he was also operating an open source of input. Using Datadog led to significant efficiency including certain customer impacting incidents by close to two-thirds and reducing the number of employees required to address each incident by one-third.
With this renewal, they are adopting Datadog Log Management and ROM and consolidating multiple home growth and cloud-mated tools as well as a commercial competitor.
That's it for this quarter's customer highlights, and I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for the award and for delivering another strong quarter. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment remains uncertain. We continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration.
And we remain confident that we can help our customers with their efforts to sell on costs, drive credit engineering efficiency and take advantage of the benefits of cloud and other next-gen technologies. So we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to capture our long-term opportunity. We remain laser focused on bringing value to our customers as we manage through more challenging economic environment.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Thanks, Olivier. In Q3, we continued to execute well and support our customers.
Revenue was $437 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter.
To dive into some of the drivers. First, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and continued low churn again this quarter. We saw existing customer usage growth remain at levels similar to Q2 as customers continue to be more cost-conscious as they manage their businesses.
As Olivier noted, we saw a roughly similar sequential growth in ARR dollars added in Q2 as -- in Q3 as in Q2. And we saw a relatively homogenous usage growth amongst our major products during Q3. As with Q2, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food and delivery. And we saw similar growth across geographies. As a reminder, we bill all of our revenue in
US dollars, and we do not price in local currencies.
Our dollar-based net retention remained at strong levels above 130% for the 20th consecutive -- 21st consecutive quarter. Our land and expand model, aggressive product innovation and our customers' motion to the cloud continue to drive expansion opportunities with our existing customer base.
Overall, the customer usage growth we're seeing remains higher than the trough growth we experienced at the beginning of COVID in 2020, and we're pleased with our 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth this quarter. Meanwhile, gross revenue retention was unchanged and steady in the mid to high 90s.
Regardless of the macroeconomic environment, our customers still need to serve their clients and moving to the cloud enables better service and cost savings against people intensive or on-prem technology based offerings. We believe our high and steady gross retention indicates that Datadog is critical to our customer’s ability to deliver services to their clients digitally.
And as Oli mentioned, on new logos, we saw continued strong new logo ARR growth across geographies, industries and company sizes, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in Q4.
Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 80% of our customers using two or more products, 40% using four or more products and 16% using six or more products as of the end of Q3.
Moving on to our financial statements, billings were $467 million, up 51% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO was $941 million, up 31% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-40s year-over-year.
As a reminder, we signed several large multiyear renewals in Q3 2021, which may make current RPO, a more useful indicator with -- as it excludes the multiyear duration impact. We also had a challenging comparables of that metric as Q3 of last year, current RPO growth was about 100%. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoices and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
First, gross profit in the quarter was $348 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 81% last quarter and 78% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the medium to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.
Our Q3 non-GAAP OpEx grew 65% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q3 operating income was $75 million or a 17% operating margin compared to an operating income of $44 million or a 16% operating margin in the year ago quarter.
Then turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $84 million in the quarter after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $67 million for a free cash flow margin of 15%.
Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers. And as usual, we are basing our guidance on current economic conditions, which includes slower than historical growth in usage among existing customers as we have seen in Q2 and Q3.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $449 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.18 to $0.20 per share range based on an approximate 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.654 billion, which represents 61% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $304 million with non-GAAP net income per share expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.92 per share, again, based on an approximate 346 million weighted average annual diluted shares.
Now some notes on guidance. As we discussed last quarter, Q4 includes some large input person events, including our Dash user conference, which was held 2 weeks ago, and AWS Reinvent, our largest trade show event of the year. The cost of those events will result in an approximate 300 to 400 basis points effect on margins. As it relates to our capital expenditures, we are adding more office space around the world as we continue to return to office. We expect CapEx of about $15 million in Q4.
In conclusion, while we recognize macroeconomic uncertainty continued into Q3, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial stress. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their participation in these efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo, your line is live. Thank you. Congrats on a great Q3. Olivier, like a quick question for me. The first one is on, if you compare the current situation and the current environment and what you saw in the pandemic. Back then, the hyperscalers kind of talked about cost optimization and customers calling back a little bit. It does seem it's slightly different now. Could you maybe talk a bit about some of the factors that you're seeing out there? And then I have 1 follow-up for David. Yes, the situation is fairly different now from what we saw in Q3 [ph]. First of all we got was very good, very broad, everyone was planning to serve money as quickly as possible, which is not what we see that we're seeing today, few of things actually. First of all, everything that is related to direct transactions with customers, whether it's new logos or new products, all of that is actually working great, but the demand we can see there is as strong as we've seen it.
When you look at the usage and where you might see cost optimization, I think there are two different stories there. There's these customers that are largely cloud native and normally pretty scale in the pub environment, so then have cloud end-to-end on public cloud that are definitely planning to save money. And these are companies that, in general, also tend to have their own growth rates affected or probably affected in the future by the macro trends. So that's why they're doing that.
But when you look at the other customers, the ones that are earlier in their cloud migration, they are actually not slowing down, and we see the same urgency and eagerness for them to keep scaling and keep moving into the cloud. And that's also where the bulk of our opportunities.
When you compare us to the hyperscalers, the -- we are seeing some expenses they see when -- and by the way, I should say, it's always hard to do -- to draw a direct comparison between the numbers of hyperscalers and ours. There the numbers include a bunch of a lot of things beyond infrastructure.
And we're also not just in public cloud, but also might quite a bit of a private environment as well. But we're seeing some of what they're seeing to optimization. We're a little bit less sensitive to it because we tend to -- because of what we do, we tend to skew towards more critical environment than everything that might in the hyperscaler. And overall, all of our products meaningfully outperformed the growth of the hyperscalers. Okay. Perfect. And then David, in these kind of uncertain times, a lot of the time you have negotiations or a vendor has negotiated with customers around billing, billings terms, et cetera. Have you seen anything that is impacting you or that you can note? Thank you. No, we really haven't seen any difference in billing terms or DSOs for that matter. So on that side, given the mission-critical nature of the product, we haven't seen any material changes in that. And again, that is different from COVID times, that really a cash [indiscernible] that was a little bit about. And so they are trying to prevent money from going out of the door right way. Like in this case is more preparing for an environment where they might want to watch a profitability a bit more. And customers, when they negotiate on these difficult ones that are fully scaled, the one thing they look for is more cautionary in terms of how long they can be for and how much it can follow period of time when they're -- especially when they be unsure of their own growth rates. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Congrats. Thank you. Our next question comes from Fred Lee with Credit Suisse. Fred, your line is now open. Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on your traction in security. What segments you're seeing the most traction? And also bigger picture, what you're seeing in the wake of the silos breaking down between second DevOps overall? Yes. So bigger picture we -- I mean, fairly well, everybody is talking about it. I could imagine they are the only ones speak about, they need to bring security to get an app, and have given up their -- a lot of responsibility in that. So -- and we're confident that this is -- we see that developing in a way that's very similar to what we see with DevOp about a decade ago. So this gives us that confidence.
In terms of our traction, we're happy with where we are. We see -- we have -- we mentioned earlier, thousands of customers will not give the products, the customer business is growing fast, the revenue is growing fast, but it's not like growth for grow in the end, typically this product is very fast. And what we see is a lot of market pull of attraction with. There's a lot of customers who want us to be there, and there's a lot of product investments we seen here today. Some of that in a Dash and there's a lot more coming. So it's working as planned that we'd say at this point. Thank you. Great quarter. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, your line is open. Yes. Thank you very much, and I will add my congratulations on a nice performance. So Olivier, many customers had said that your Cloud Cost Management Solution is extremely well timed. And they're saying that because they're seeing interest in cost optimizations that didn't exist about six months ago. I'm wondering if that aligns with your view, and does that feel like a product to you that can get off to a pretty fast start in this environment? And then I have a quick follow-up. I mean, you're right that cost won’t see that -- a lot of people's minds right now. But I would say that it was a really big case six months ago and even a year ago. I think any company that is fully scaled into the cloud cares about their efficiency and they seem that have quite a bit of leverage in terms of cost improvement if they get it the right way with the right tool.
So we think it's a product that, yes, it's well timed, but we think it's a product that's going to be -- that has the potential of being very adaptive and very useful for a very long time even after we come out of this challenging macro environment. Okay, understood. And then, David, just as a quick follow-up. Looking at the sequential growth in Q3 is around 7%, and the way it appears in guidance for Q4, just thinking about your cadence, that would seem to compound at a year-over-year growth rate around 30%, thinking forward is that type of cadence a fairway to try to conceptualize the glide path into next year, just figuring somewhere around 30%. If we want to derisk the models, or do you think that Q3 and Q4 are maybe not so representative of where the puck is going to be heading here? Yeah. As a reminder, we provide guidance in a consistent way. We essentially look at the environment, the performance and given the usage model, we put conservative assumptions on top of that. We employed that for the guidance we gave here in Q4. For next year, we'll provide guidance when we report Q4 and plan to update everybody at that time. Thank you. Keep in mind that different aspects that the -- part of it is driven by the new logos where we're getting from customers. Part of it is driven by the growth of existing customers. And the one we actually get also is -- it's tougher to grow customers very fast when they're growing with us a lot over the past few years when customers have grown in the 80% year-over-year, 30% year-over-year through all these years, they may go away before after that. But in turn, it might give us an easier compare for the future. Thank you, Olivier. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit, your line is now open. Sanjit, we can't hear you. Can you please get near to your mic? Sorry about that. Appreciate guys taking the question. My question is really around competitive displacements and potentially observability consolidation within your customer base? To what extent are you seeing customers either consolidate open source or other commercial tools and standardize on Datadog, not just to benefit from the innovation that you're seeing from the Datadog's platform, but also to lower their overall observability monitoring spend as they go into next year? Well, we do see a little bit of both. I think it's interesting what we've seen in the past. There's no other new trend there, but we see that happening across our customers. We think also in the future, this is going to only become more compelling when customers also bring to us more of their security use cases, more of their user analytics use cases. So these so far have required different copies of the data to different to different vendors, and this tends to be the most expensive part of the other one, the part of the cost structure that scales in the [indiscernible] vendors. So we think we make a very compelling long-term proposition with these customers. That makes a lot of sense. And then I think, Olivier, in your script, you called out a customer that's using 14 different products, which is pretty incredible to think about. For customers that's adopting that many different product capabilities, how is that contract structured? And how does that adoption happen? Is it through some broader, flexible credit system, or are they being -- are these products being sold or priced individually? Can you just give us a sense for a customer that gets up to that level of adoption, how does the contracting work for that type of customer? Yeah. So the majority of those contracts for large customer view of products are made on what we call the drawdown, which is basically setting committed amount of credit that customers can use. In relation to that, they get a red card for all the values queue [ph] that are going to consume. And those red clients can also be negotiated. Some customers use very large amounts of certain products, they can get a better rate of those specific products as well as to negotiate that. I think that's where it gets a little bit taller to that specific use cases in the business. And not to add, that's what we've been talking about the frictionless adoption where the client is using the platform. And given this drawdown with a rate card, they can use the products in a frictionless way as they expand their use of the Datadog platform. The benefit for them is just -- they usually don't know how much of each of the products they are going to consume ahead of time. But overall, with the shape up there or the size of the environment is going to be, but also don't know within this environment how much APM traces that would need versus logs versus metric versus really use our monitoring, is there anything else that we produce. So it gives them the flexibility there. And again, that's another reason to bring in more tooling of platform because they don't have to pre-commit everything in separate buckets basically. Best of luck, and thank you for the color. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with BofA Securities. Koji, your line is open. Hey, Olivier. Hey, David. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in here on the consumer discretionary, and I appreciate all the comments you had in the prepared remarks. But was really wondering how much of that vertical is international? Just thinking about FX and the potential effects of FX there if the USD strength persists in the future? Thanks guys. Yes. So on FX, sorry, David, if I'm stealing your thoughts out. The -- we charge in dollars everywhere. So we don't have any formal FX risk. We don't provide any adjusted numbers for FX, any of that. We do, however, our customers buy our products from Europe and from Japan, their budgets are still in Japanese yen or in euros. And so we do think that the strong dollar is a headwind for us. We don't see very dramatically different growth rates between Europe, Americas and APAC.
So we think we might see higher growth in APAC and Europe, which are smaller parts of our revenues and less mature if the dollar was weaker. It is conjecture. We can't actually quantify that because we're charging dollars everywhere, but that's something that we are aware of. But in that -- just to add, in that sector, we commented on the predominant effect would be what's happening in their business, in their sector rather than geographical location of the company and its customers. Got it. Great guys. Thanks so much for that.. And just one follow-up, if I may, here on the Cloudcraft acquisition. Just any color on how big this company is? The press release, it says, hundreds of thousands of engineers. So how does that equate to maybe customer overlap? And does Cloudcraft open the door to maybe new personas to sell into within organizations? Thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Yes. So Cloudcraft is very interesting, because it's a very great product. There are lots of opportunities in terms of integrating product with ours. There are opportunities also with some part of this product many stand-alone. It's a product that works very well for planning and for cloud architects in general to start their planning their document in cloud migration.
It's also interesting for us from a distribution perspective because it has a lot of different users today, it has a very broad reach. It's also very easy to embed on third-party sites. So there are a number of opportunities we're excited about with Cloudcraft. You'll see more as we integrate and as we pursue these opportunities. But we're very excited with the opportunity that we have been tracking for a while. Just to make sure it's clear, it's a small company. It's an acqui-hire like we've done, meaning we are bringing on board the engineers, it does come with a customer base. It's an immaterial amount of revenues relative to our total. And as Oli mentioned, provides an extension of the platform, as well as potentially some leads and some lead generation in the customers and personas. Thanks Oli. Thanks David. Thanks so much. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Matt, your line is now open. Great. Thanks guys. David, for you. Last quarter, you talked about a stronger July versus June. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on how the linearity of the quarter played out, and then maybe also how is -- how did October trend relative to September? Yeah. So we -- for linearity, it was very similar linearity to what we've had. There was no difference. And so we saw -- unlike last quarter a bit, we saw pretty much of a pro rata type of quarter. And we normally have a strong October in terms of the flow of our customers and what they're doing in the platform before pro freezes. We're pleased with what we have seen so far, but still recognize that October is usually strong for us. And it's only the beginning of the quarter.
Oli, anything else you want to add that? No, I think the one thing you're trying to get through the over time during the quarter, we exited the quarter pretty much at where we entered it. There's no change there. And again, as David said, we're happy with what we see there, and we're also usually happy with our product.
We -- Q4 has a bit more seasonality in other quarters, in particular, December tends to be a little bit weaker as a lot of our customers take time off and sit down their development environment and things in that. It's also been a little bit harder to forecast in recent years with the pandemic and the behavior that -- the vacation behavior that change after the pandemic. So we are little bit careful with that, and that's all incorporated in our guidance. Yeah. And remind everybody what we said in the script was that the Q3 performance was very similar in its drivers to Q2. So that's further evidence of, as Oli said, that's the conditions that we ended Q2 will continue throughout the Q3. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is now open. David, a question on investment philosophy. Going into the pandemic, you didn't really pull the throttle back. You had at 11% -- going into these times, are you thinking differently about your investment philosophy in this cycle? And can you talk about quota-carrying reps in terms of -- are you at -- on pace to hire what you thought at the beginning of the year, are you pulling back a little bit given some of the current macro jitters. Yeah. I think as we remind everybody, we've always lived within our means and been limited more by our ability to integrate in a responsible way of quota-carrying reps or R&D for that matter into our company. And we really have not made changes. We had a prudent plan and continued as a reminder to everybody, we think there's a very long-term opportunity, and we're investing behind that. We are cognizant that there's more volatility in microeconomic conditions, and we're looking at everything, but we didn't get out over our skis up to begin with in our plan. So it allows us given our model and the way we run the company to continue that investment in a systematic way. Just to restate that, we did make changes, we're investing from an R&D perspective, this was so early, there's so much we want to do, and we have great tractions on the products, and we keep investing there.
From a go-to-market perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we actually have a very strong pipeline and the conversion with customers are going right in terms of new logos and new products. And so there is value in growing the CRC and there is short-term and long-term value there. So we keep doing that.
And the last thing I'd say is we -- remember, I keep putting, but we bought only $30 [ph] million from inception to the new company public, we generated a lot more cash since then. We have efficiency that's one of the core parts of our culture. That's how we run the business, where we built it. And as for the model, we've built in terms of fiction-less expansion and other – some of our products. So we trust that we have the levers and the way we hope to use them to make sure we have the right profitability as well. And just a quick follow-up on the CRP. I know David, you mentioned, stay focus on that. It is continuing to decelerate, I guess, is that just a function of the large comps? Are you seeing larger enterprise customers? You've seen a slower cadence of large deals come in. Can you give us your take on that? Yeah, I think we had -- the comps are very significant in this quarter. In Q3 of last year, and I think we said this at the time, we had some large multiyear deals. As a reminder, we don't try to target multiyear deal we had from the client side. So that's why the current probably is more over time correlated. It is also moves. So if you look at the average of this, it tends over the longer time to correlate with revenues, but there's a lot of noise in this number. So we steer everyone back to revenues and then the computation we've given everybody how to convert revenues into ARR. One big change again -- one big driver for this is -- our early customers we knew because they try to get ahead of the growth and secure better economics. And in times of uncertainty like this one, customers tend to wait and see more. And sometimes, we have slightly work economics a little bit, but there have been many optionality. And so this is why those numbers moved quite a bit. And again, the best predictor of what's going to happen next year, the revenue ramp on which we are. Everything else is a little bit more historic. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Kamil with William Blair. Kamil, your line is open. Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter. It sounds like international demand has remained relatively unchanged from June. Was that consistent across regions? And what do you think is unique about Datadog that is major sales in Europe, more resilient than some of your peers? I mean, look, we see them everywhere. We're growing our teams everywhere. We're going to see on the right relative basis faster in Europe and in APAC than we are in the US. We're also doing the teams in Latin America, which is doing very well for us. So we -- from where we see, we see them in everywhere. We see Europe and Asia are a little bit behind the Americas in terms of maturity of the cloud migration. But they are scaling and it's happening there, the same way it happened in the past.
From a competitive perspective, the situation is about the same everywhere, and it hasn't changed in any notable way over the past year, I would say. So there's nothing shocked to say there. That's helpful. And if I could just follow-up. You called out some vendor displays in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe comment on how much of your new customer wins are coming from competitive displacements versus greenfield opportunities? And between the two, are you seeing any difference in the macro impact that are companies that are using competitors, maybe revisiting alternative solutions to optimize pricing, or is the mix shift predictable? It's still a small minority of the deals. It tends to be the only one that are very large because our customers already had something. They already have a large footprint, and we need to migrate over. So these are deals that are large and the one, which is not a matter of the deal. The last matter [indiscernible] are small and grow from there.
These are the ones we tend to mention because these are the ones that are most interesting to look at from day one, but this is still a low minority, but we do. We also don't particularly seek those deals. We train our sales team to land as many new logos and new products as possible. And it's better for them to do 10 smaller ones than one larger one. And those 10 smaller ones will each be as big as the one large one in the end. So that's instead of dollar we make for dollar sale activity we spend that's most productive. That's helpful. Thanks again. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima, your line is now open. Hey good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Oli, I've got one for you and one for you, David. Oli, to your commentary on the usage moderation persisting in the consumer discretionary vertical. I know this is a hard question, but what are some of the signs or signals from that vertical that would lead you to suggest or lead you to conclude that maybe there's more moderation to come. And I'm thinking about this in the context of big tech in the realm of digital advertising and all of the larger companies just beyond and outside of the CDP Vertical. So just any signals or signs that would lead you to conclude one way or the other is the worst of the moderation on the platform expansion is behind us? And then a quick follow-up for David, please. Well, I think the question is -- I mean, it's mostly what we see the most case in the customers that are fully in the cloud, fully scaled in the cloud. And there, basically, we should expect their cloud bank to grow at the same rate of their top line in the end. And so when their top line part is slowing down a bit, or what is certainly slowing a bit -- they try and slow the expenses as well, which is what we've seen.
I think what we can tell you is whether the top line will slowdown and start narrow a little bit or it's getting compressed, I think it all depends on how big of an economic downturn we face, if any. We're not really the business of predicting that. But what we see is for much of those customers, we got a pretty good idea of where they stand because we see what their projected spend growth is when it relates to the relative growth of the business. Thank you. David, last quarter, you sort of mentioned to us that a lot of customers and prospects are thinking about reduced commitment levels out the gate. So I'm curious about how that's trending this quarter and what your expectations are with what you're seeing with new customers in terms of commitment levels out the gate. And within this quarter, how much of that austerity, if you will, around commitment levels? How much of that austerity contributed to maybe usage upside beyond the commitment levels this quarter, just given the strength in the quarter? Thank you. Just to clarify, so that's not exactly correct what you said. So it is -- so essentially, most of our customers are essentially land and expand and then commit and then grow their usage over time. And that has been going on in the whole model of the company. What we said last time was -- this is not related to they're cutting their commitment. This is related to when there are an overt on demand whether they decide to do a new commitment or stay on demand longer and to be able to get greater visibility.
The comment from last quarter was really more about billing and those metrics then about customer usage. We said that customer usage has been lower than historical trends, but not as low as it was in COVID. So that's another effect. And what we talked about last quarter was more about the billing effect. So we continue to say that customers are, as we talked about, cautious, but that really only has a marginal effect in the billing. And actually, when a client decides that and stays on demand, it has a positive effect on the revenue side in that micro decision. And I'll just add one thing to your first question. In terms of -- some part of the question is how do we know things are going to get better or worse in the future? I remind you that we have a usage technology [ph] for revenue, and we don't have to wait until the mix renewal to give the new some customers on whether this is better or worse. But the news is good or bad, we get it early. And an example of that is that while the -- broadly in the world, we see Q3 being worse at a macro level than Q2.
As far as our business is concerned, Q3 is very, very much in line with Q2 and whatever step function there was in terms of changing the growth rates, so some customers happened in Q2 already and didn't change in Q3. So we are fairly confident that whatever happens with CPC this year. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer and Co. Ittai, your line is open. Thank you. Congrats guys, great quarter. David, I just want to have one question for you on the net dollar expansion rate, great to see it well above 130. But I was hoping if you could give a little bit more color on that, specifically directionally, did it go down quarter-over-quarter? And perhaps, is there a way for you to break down the mix of existing solution expansion in that mix versus new solution adoption. I'm just wondering maybe not in absolute terms, but perhaps on a relative basis how that mix has changed over the last two, three quarters? Sure. So we don't give more pointed net retention, but it is a fact that if the organic rate -- expanding rate of customers is lower than it was in previous periods, and we said that the rate is lower than it was at the peak but not as low as it was at the low and COVID in the middle that, that would indicate that net retention would be going down mathematically. But we don't give more information than that.
As far as the -- and I think we said a little bit about this in the past, as far as the mix between expansion of existing solutions and new as clients adopt more of the solution in their land, which we said is happening. What happens again, mathematically is that the percentage of the net retention from existing products goes up despite the fact that, as we said, we have very strong adoption of additional products. But we also have very strong momentum in client landing with more products, which affects that number directionally, if that makes sense. That's helpful. And then maybe, Oli, for you, on the database monitoring. It seems like you're off for a good start there. Just from a persona standpoint, does this expand the personas that you're touching, I mean, do you need to be engaged more with this admins in order to sell this product or I'm just trying to think from a go-to-market standpoint, what is needed to keep driving progress here? In terms of from a go-to-market perspective, it was similarly as the rest of what we deliver, it expands nicely on top of the rest of the platform. You're right though that we're reaching to some of the more specialized function around like DDAs and people like that. But we also have -- who are not trained as DDAs, solve the issues and role as DDA security there. So we run it, there's a little bit of a difference there.
I think today, because of the better business we just reported today, it's not as pronounced as it might be in the future when we start supporting that this is like [Indiscernible], for example, where the position of the DDA is more formalized, I would say. Very good. Thanks. Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Michael, your line is live. Hey, so two quick questions. I think you talked about the growth rates of a number of hosts monitored last quarter is an indication that you really weren't seeing any slowing in the underlying capacity of what needed to be monitoring. Is that growth rate still the same? It's -- if you look at the growth by product this time, it's not only closer than it needs to be, there's some variations quarter-to-quarter, a lot is about the same in growth rate. APM is a little bit better and I’m not sure if it’s down, but there's nothing really meaningful there. I think some of the effects you might expect from what you have from the hyperscale, we see maybe some of that in the infrastructure, but it's not extremely pronounced. So that's why we can't comment on this. Okay. And then David, just on the CapEx that you called out that was having to do with headquarters, $15 million extra, I believe you said in this quarter. So I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but is that a one-quarter phenomenon, a multiquarter phenomenon, how big an impact longer term on CapEx? Yeah. Just clarify that wasn't extra. That's just the total amount, not the delta between the quarters. We haven't provided that type of guidance. We are expanding and building out offices. And again, when we provide guidance for next year, we'll endeavor to provide some guidance that will help in the modeling. Thanks. Okay. Great guys. Thank you very much. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Olivier Pomel for any further comments. Thank you. Thank you all for listening. I also want to thank, obviously, all Datadogs around the world for working so hard this quarter and that we have been another great quarter. And I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and joining us at Dash also for the great event. So thank you all, and we'll speak again in Q4. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.","Q3 2022 datadog Earnings conference call will be held on thursday . all participants are in a listen-only mode, followed by a question-and-answer session . we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2022 .",0.0

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Datadog Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2023 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our strategy, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.
The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a solid Q4 to end a strong fiscal year 2022. We delivered significant new innovations for our customers, we saw increasing adoption of our products and we attracted thousands of new customers to our platform. Meanwhile, we delivered strong revenue growth, margins, non-GAAP operating profit, and we generated more than $350 million in free cash flow.
Let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. In Q4, revenue was $469 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 23,200 customers, up from about 18,800 last year.
We ended the quarter with about 2,780 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,010 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we had 317 customers with ARR of $1 million or more compared to the 216 we had at the end of last year.
We generated free cash flow of $96 million with a free cash flow margin of 21%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products.
Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 81% of customers were using two or more products, up from 78% a year ago. 42% of customers were using four or more products, up from 33% a year ago. And 18% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 10% last year.
Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we observed slower usage growth with existing customers while continuing to scale our new logo acquisition and new product cross-sells. Starting with usage. Usage growth of existing customers in Q4 was overall slightly lower than what we observed in Q2 and Q3, which we attribute first to a continuation of cloud cost optimization by our larger spending customers; and second, to a seasonal annual slowdown in the second half of December that was more pronounced than in previous years.
As in Q2 and Q3, we continue to see more optimization from customers as a larger cloud footprint, while our smaller spending customers are exhibiting higher growth.
From a product perspective, we didn't see meaningful differences among our major products as they all experienced solid growth, albeit decelerating on a year-over-year basis. In contrast to this deceleration in usage growth for existing customers, we continue to execute on new logo lands and multiproduct adoption, and we also continue to see stable, very strong growth retention trends.
First, we had our strongest new logo quarter to date with a record level of new logo ARR bookings. Second, our sales pipeline remains healthy as our pattern of new logo and cross-sell is scaling above the levels of the past years, and we see demand growing along with our investments in go to market.
I'd also like to point out that although we have made steady progress, we still see significant opportunities to grow our penetration in total spend amounts with larger customers. As a data point, as of January 2023, 37% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 30% last year.
For these customers, the median Datadog ARR is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This leaves a very large opportunity for us to go with these customers as they continue to move towards the cloud and more of them develop.
We are also pleased with the initial take-up of some of our newest products, including Cloud Cost Management, for which we already added a mid-6-figure commitment last month from a global fast-food chain. And finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high retention number is indicative of the business criticality of Datadog for our customers.
Now let's move on to R&D. During the quarter, we released our latest product to general availability, Universal Service Monitoring, which detects all micro services across an organization environment and provide instant visibility into their health and dependencies, or's without changes.
Universal Service Monitoring bridges our existing monitoring and application performance monitoring capabilities and it involves end-to-end obviability with minimal deployment friction.
Now let's take a moment to review the R&D team's accomplishments in 2022. We ended the year with 17 generally available products, up from 13 at the end of 2021, and we greatly expanded the capabilities of our existing products.
Overall, in 2022, we have meaningfully broadened our observability capabilities and pushed forward in making each product best of breed. Meanwhile, we have made meaningful progress but remain in early days in the new areas of cloud security and developer experience. In observability, we continue to expand our end-to-end unified platform.
We now have more than 600 integrations, including all the latest products on AWS, GCP and Azure. We launched new AI capabilities, such as Watchdog logs and detection to help customers separate signal from noise in data and Watchdog good cause analysis to identify the root cause of issues and quantify their impact in customers.
We launched Cloud Cost Management to have customers take control of their infrastructure costs. We announced service satalog to manage service ownership at scale. We made Observability Pipelines generally available, enabling customers to collect and transform data from any source to any destination or at petabyte scale.
We launched Audit Trail to help customers achieve their compliance and governance goals. We extended Sensitive Data Scanner beyond logs to inspect APM and RAM data flows, and we now collect data from SNMP traps to provide greater visibility into physical network equipment.
In cloud security, we kept building out our platform. We launched a Cloud Security Management, our rich context-aware CNAP platform. We launched Application Security Management, building on our acquisition of Sqreen in 2021, and we announced the beta of native protection to block malicious sectors directly within the data platform.
In developer experience, we are expanding on our CI Visibility product. We introduced continuous testing to bring efficient and reliable testing within CI/CD pipelines, and we launched a beta of intelligence Test Runners, which significantly reduces the time and cost of running tests.
And last but not least, we delivered a number of platform-wide initiatives. We achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization and have since landed a number of government agencies as customers. Our customers today can also use Sqreen for collaboration, incident response per programming and debugging less than a year after the acquisition, and we continue to expand on the HIPAA and PCI compliance of our products. As you can tell, we've been busy, and I want to thank the R&D team for a very productive year.
Looking ahead to 2023, our teams are continuing to push forward as beta products from 2022 include data streams monitoring, workflow automation, even correlation, heat maps, dynamic instrumentation, workload security profiling, resource catalog and native protection, among others. We also continue to integrate our 2022 acquisitions, Sqreen, HD, Secret and Cloud Craft into the Datadog platform, and we are excited for their potential.
In summary, we're looking forward to delivering many more capabilities to help our customers in 2023.
Now let's move on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to execute very well into the end of 2022, in particular on new logo lands. So, let's go over a few of our wins this quarter. First, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 industrial group. This company was using multiple open source and built-in cloud monitoring tools, which led to release delays and consumer-facing outages. In addition to our metric traction log, this company will rely on our ability to integrate open telemetry data sources to deliver immediate value. This customer's initial deal includes 13 products across our observability, security and developer experience categories.
Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer is moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to the cloud and multiple legacy tools were creating gaps in visibility and post-PCI compliance problems. This customer today is looking at savings of roughly $1 million in the first year of using Datadog and a meaningful reduction in mean time to resolution. This deal will start with infrastructure monitoring and replace three different tools with plans to expand to other Datadog products in the future.
Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a major federal government agency. This agency was looking to reduce tools sprawl and aimed at a rapid rollout to hundreds of different programs while saving money on engineering and issue resolution. This agency is among a number of new government customers in 2022, following our FedRAMP moderate authorization. And this deal is expected to displace at least eight commercial legacy monitoring tools.
Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a leading Japanese system integrator. This company has been a very successful hardware system integrator and is looking to grow its digital and cloud transformation business. This customer plans to add up 15 Datadog products in order to support its ambitious growth plan.
And last for today, we signed a multimillion-dollar expansion with one of the world's leading insurance companies. Prior to using Datadog, this company was using more than 30 tools across nine business units. By consolidating onto Datadog, the customer estimates it's achieved roughly 115% ROI all within a year while reducing average mean time to resolution for 1.5 hours to 15 minutes. With this renewal, this company is adding database monitoring, cloud security management and application security management and is now using 12 Datadog products.
That is for this quarter's customer highlights. And again, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their great execution in Q4 and throughout 2022.
Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook and my thoughts on 2023. Although we are seeing customers be more cautious with their cloud usage expansion in the near term. we see no change to the long-term trends towards digital transformation and cloud migration.
We think it's healthy for customers to optimize, and we believe that the ability to correct course and continually align the nature and scale of their applications with their business needs is one of the key benefits of cloud transformation.
At Datadog, we have always organized our products and our business around helping customers gain agility and reduce costs, and we do it by enabling stronger business performance and efficient use of their engineering and infrastructure spend. Regardless of near-term macro pressure, we believe it is still early days, and we expect that companies worldwide will continue to grow their next footprint to deliver value to their customers.
Given the large opportunities we see in front of us, we plan to keep building and innovating. We have already made progress in observability, but we still have much to do to deliver more value and solve more problems for our customers. And we are excited about our opportunities in cloud security, developer experience as well as our early efforts in areas around ITSM and real-time business intelligence.
As we have since we founded Datadog, we are also balancing long-term investments against maintaining the discipline to ensure our continual financial performance. We recognize that the macro environment remains uncertain. So, while we continue to focus on scaling and investing, we are growing those investments in a disciplined fashion in 2023, and David will discuss this in more detail. We remain confident in our long-term opportunities, and we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to catch up them.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Thanks, Olivier. In Q4, we continued to execute well and delivered value to our customers. Revenue was $469 million, up 44% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q4 performance, first, we saw existing customer usage growth in October and November at a similar level to what we saw in Q2 and Q3.
In the month of December, we saw a slower growth dynamic as the typical slowdown we see at the end of December was more pronounced than in previous years. As a result, the growth rate in usage by existing customers was lower in Q4 than in Q2 and Q3.
Next, similar to Q2 and Q3, we saw larger-spending customers grow slower than smaller spending customers. As with Q2 and Q3, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw solid and relatively similar growth across all regions.
As Olivier discussed, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and low churn again in this quarter. We had a record level of new logo bookings in the quarter across customer sizes. Our dollar net base net retention remained at strong levels, above 130% for the 22nd consecutive quarter. And gross revenue retention has remained unchanged over the last several quarters and remained steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high and steady gross retention points to the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings in the quarter were $536 million, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.06 billion, up 30% year-over-year. And RPO duration declined on a year-over-year basis, and we note that current RPO growth was in the high 30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $378 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and also 80% in the year ago quarter.
We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold in this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.
Our Q4 non-GAAP OpEx grew 54% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q4 operating income was $83 million or an 18% operating margin compared to an operating income of $71 million or a 22% operating margin in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the year ago operating margin benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $114 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $96 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%.
Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. We are incorporating an expectation for seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to the subdued growth in the month of December that creates a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter. While our customers are continuing to expand with us, we are assuming in our guidance that cloud optimization continues to affect our expansion rate in 2023.
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $466 million to $470 million, which represents a 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $68 million to $72 million or an operating margin of 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.09 billion, which represents a 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for a margin of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.09 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Now some additional notes on the guidance. First, regarding our fiscal year 2023 investments, we continue to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities. Our non-GAAP operating income guidance reflects this discipline. We will continue to grow our R&D and go-to-market teams as we broaden our platform in service of our customer needs, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.
As a result, we are planning to grow our operating expenses, including COGS, in the fiscal year 2023 in the low 30s percent range year-over-year. We plan to grow our headcount in fiscal year 2023 in the mid-20s percent range year-over-year. This compares to fiscal 2022 headcount growth of approximately 50% year-over-year.
Next, as interest rates have risen, our interest income has increased and become more meaningful. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. We expect tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be $11 million to $13 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.
To reiterate Olivier's comments, we see no change to our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We remain strongly positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with these journeys.
I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2022, and I'm excited about our plans for the next year.
With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Thank you, very much. Olivier, I was wondering if you can comment on the AWS infrastructure monitoring portion of the business specifically. Do you see that trending above or below the 25% rate of the total business this year? And I'm wondering if you perhaps see some of the other hyperscale’s, Azure, Google, et cetera, gaining any share of that mix during this year? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. So, look, we -- obviously, we see -- we get data from our customers using those cloud providers. We also listen to the commentary that cloud providers provide on their -- in terms of their own growth. There's not a one-to-one mapping between what happens on the revenue side for the cloud providers and what we see on the infrastructure side on our end. But we are seeing some of the same trends where their growth slowed down throughout Q4. And we've been listening to their comments when they give guidance for what that growth might look like in the near future, which also inform our own guidance.
In terms of the mix shift, we don't see anything that differs from the trends we saw throughout the last year. I think the story there is they're also seeing optimization from some of the customers, that means the largest customers. And on our end, we expect that optimization to continue throughout the year. That's what we built into our guidance. Okay. Understood. And then, David, I believe you mentioned record new logo ARR bookings in the quarter. Great to hear. I think we're wondering what you attribute that to just given the environment is so challenging. And there was mention of several of these companies landing with eight or 10 or 15 Datadog products and replacing legacy tools or replacing open source.
Do you see an increase in those kinds of consolidation opportunities and maybe just a broadening where this landscape is viewing Datadog as the converged observability leader and wanting to consolidate in that direction? Yes. In Q4, and I think going forward, we continue to see greenfield and new projects, new workloads being the majority of the driver, but have seen over the quarters, and we talked about some of them in our prepared remarks, consolidation opportunities, when a client is already in their cloud journey and has workloads and is looking to get a platform, create efficiencies, et cetera. They have increasingly been consolidating on Datadog and we see continued opportunities for that.
Yes. And I'll add to that. We see demand scaling basically. Like we're still early in cloud migration and diesel transformation, and we see no slowdown from companies going from legacy IT to this new world. That's why we get more and more renewals and more volume there. The part of the business we see going slower is the larger customers that are further along in this cloud transformation that have large workloads trying to optimize because that's where they can meaningfully set cost. Thank you, very much. We have a question from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about product innovation. And in some sense, you guys have had a pretty impeccable track record of leasing a lot of product that sort of benefited your customers over the last couple of years. But given sort of the environment that exists today, do you feel that in some sense, Datadog gets viewed by customers as sort of a Lamborghini type observability solution, meaning that are you -- in terms of customers may not need all of the bells and whistles that a 17-product portfolio can provide? Any thoughts there on whether Datadog may be potentially overengineered for in terms of customers' willingness to spend in the current environment? Yes. So, I definitely don't think we position ourselves as the Lamborghini. We are not -- the Lamborghini have a glove box and needs to go to the shop every two weeks. That's definitely not us. Would -- we have been investing heavily in product innovation. We have a lot of products today that, thanks to this acceleration of product and innovation over the past few years, are early in their life cycle.
What we see in the current environment is that it is actually helping us get to these consolidation deals that were mentioned a little bit earlier because we can cover more of what our customers need to do and drive more efficiencies. Again, it's still early in that because many of those products are early in their life cycle. So, they might not be applicable to every single type of customer and every single type of situation.
But I think this is validating our destination there. And it shows we need to do more of that. not less. At a time where larger customers are very, very careful about their spend, it might be more difficult for some of those products to gain a lot of adoption with any particular customer at a very high level of spend. So, we're focusing today on getting a maximum number of those customers to adopt those products and plant the seeds of future growth as they further consolidate and move to the cloud. Understood. And just a follow-up on those larger customers who are seeing their usage trends slow more than smaller customers. Relative to the commitment, how are you guys sort of handling that? Are you in a situation where you're rolling over credits? Or are you sort of enforcing sort of the take-or-pay aspect of the contract? Any color there on how you're working with those larger customers in terms of where they stand relative to their commitment? Yes. We are -- so we always want to partner with customers and build a long-term relationship with them. We've had some customers that have run into very significant business headwinds, where their own businesses have contracted quite a bit. And in those situations, we always work with them to structure the contracts and make sure we get to a better outcome.
We've done that with one of our major customers over the past quarter. And we've had similar conditions with some other customers as well. So that's part of with customers also part of the guidance we're giving for the year. And I just want to add that because we tend, as you know, to go land and expand and our customers tend to undercommit relative to what they eventually get to, we haven't seen across the customer base, a very meaningful increase of sort of unused commitments. And so that's something about our go-to-market that creates flexibility with clients to commit as they see usage. Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Great. Thank you very much. Just one real quick one, David. I know billings isn't necessarily the best metric to sort of focus on, but 1Q is a really monstrous comp. So maybe any color you can provide as we should think about billings, especially with changes in duration in calendar '23 and maybe lower commits upfront from customers on renewal? Yes. I think -- again, I think it is really driven by the ARR and linearity of that. So, I don't think we plan for billings, et cetera. We essentially have had billings, as you know, go above and below the revenue based on the billings in that period. And so, we don't see really any change in that type of pattern. But again, bring everyone back to ARR and revenues as the major economic driver. That's great. And then, Oli, real quickly, if you look back at your business historically, there's been a fairly tight linkage between your growth rate and the hyperscale’s with a multiple on it. As we sort of look forward, what types of things need to happen to expand that multiplier? Thanks. Well, I mean, look, we're covering more and more of the -- we're solving a bigger and bigger problem for our customers, which means we're expanding our APM [ph] and so, we can have a larger and larger multiplier over time. That's why we're investing in new categories, that's why we keep building up observability and that's why we're doing all these investments.
So that's where we're going. I think you're right, though, that the underlying wave that is -- has been a tailwind throughout the of the company was cloud migration and digital transformation. I think that we might be a bit more of a headwind over the next few quarters. But we strongly believe that it will become a tailwind again in the future.
We just can't tell you when exactly. We've listened to the calls of the hyperscale’s, they can't tell you when either. We're in the same boat there. So, what we're doing today is we're focusing on the drivers of future success, which are covering more of the customer landscape sort of getting into more new logos, more geographies, more segments and also developing our products and getting those products adopted by more of these customers, which is how we're going to have accelerating growth in the future. Perfect. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Fred Lee with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious about product expansion and what will help Datadog gain share as a percent of hyperscaler spend, a little bit related to Brad's question -- second question minute ago. I was wondering if we could get an update on which products you're gaining the most traction and have the greatest potential in 2023. Well, so we have a lot of products that are early in their life cycle. Some of them are large categories where we are seeing larger and larger revenue and we have very ambitious plans, such as security. Some others are newer but might be a bit more topical in 2023, such as Cloud Cost Management.
So, I think it's really going to be a mix. We see some interesting early signs of Cloud Cost Management, which is still only billed to a handful of customers at this point but already seeing very large commitments from some of these customers. We called that out on the call.
So, we think it might be -- if you think of anything that might have more of an impact in the short-term term that might be one of those. But really, the way we think about all those products is how do we turn them all into major products two, three, four years out, how do we win these additional categories, and how do we become the platform of choice for consolidation in the long term? That's what we're driving towards. And just a quick follow-up on the security portion. So, with regard to the uptake of your security solutions, how would that compare -- how does that compare to the adoption patterns of infra and APM? Well, it's a bit difficult to compare to infra because it was the very first thing we did in the company. We -- it's actually pretty comparable to what we've seen with APM, where it's a domain with a lot of investment required. We also have a very ambitious and very differentiated approach to it, which requires quite a bit of a build-out and quite a few things to figure out with customers. But we're also seeing continuous adoption and growth, thousands of customers using the platform.
We see it being adopted at a very large scale by very large customers, which -- some of which we also mentioned on the call today. So, we're not completely there yet. There's still a lot of work to do, but we think it's tracking well to -- with respect to what we can expect in our plan. Great. Thank you, very much. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Great. Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the usage patterns of large customers versus small customers. I know you said you're -- the smaller customers were not seeing as much of a slowdown in usage. But what gives you confidence that those smaller customers just haven't reached or reacted to the slowing macro yet? And we may see maybe a slowdown in that segment going forward. Well, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future, right? So, we don't really have a crystal ball there. What we see, though, is that customers save money where it matters, which tends to be the very large line items, which for customers that are fairly far along into the cloud, is going to be, first, their cloud provider deals that are, again, one or two others are larger than their observability bills.
And then we're going to be affected by that and maybe with some optimization more specific to observability as well. So that's what we see there. That's why we see most of the large customers do that. On the smaller side, I'll point out that many of our smaller customers are actually very large companies that just are fairly new into the cloud and are still growing to the cloud. So, they are seeing exactly the same thing as their peers who are spending a lot more on us. It's just the part of their business that is where the spend is growing as opposed to where the spend is today and needs to be controlled.
The last thing I will say is on the very low end of our customer base, we do see impact of the macro environment. We have a little bit more churn at the very, very low end, which is what you see our customer count not going up as much despite us having very strong notable quarters. That's more focused at the very, very low end of the customer base, and it's not moving the numbers at all in terms of gross retention, which remains very high. Okay. That's great. I was also wondering; your gross margin was surprisingly strong in the quarter. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do on pricing given these large customers focus on cost optimization. Well, we work with the large customers, obviously, to make sure that they get what they need. We're optimizing gross margin, obviously, we’re doing quite a bit on our end to -- on the engineering side to do that. At all levels, 1% of gross margin is making a very large difference for their business, and we can reinvest that in future growth. Changing prices by 1% based on that doesn't make a big difference for customers.
I think when they -- the real way to address their concerns as they keep scaling and generating much more data and sending more observability data to us is to give them more options to process that data so that they can align with what they pay to us with the value they get. And we've been also building that on the product side. So, it's not really a pricing question. It's more of a product and structure question.
And I just wonder now that we're on cost, I just want to add a little clarification. I think we talked about the trends of gross margin and what we expect for the future. And we gave some guidance as to operating expenses in 2023. I believe I might have misspoken. The operating expense guidance in 2023 in the low 30s range excludes COGS. We gave the COGS guide separately as far as our comments on that, just to clarify. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Our next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Your line is open. Great. Hi, Olivier. Hi, Devid. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a question on the guidance and maybe a compare and contrast here. So, I was wondering if you could talk about maybe how to think about the levels of conservatism embedded in the full year 2023 ready guide today versus when you first gave guidance last year for 2022. Yes. I think we've continued to use the same approach, which is to look at the history and discount the major assumptions, which are the organic growth or the expansion of existing customers and new logos. I think the difference in the actual results were the periods of times where we saw more than pro rata or more than historical adoption and growth of existing customers, the ratio between that discount and where it ends is up actuals ended up larger. But the intent and the strategy of providing this guidance on conservative assumptions relative to that has not changed. Got it. And just one quick follow-up there. To be clear, our guidance doesn't assume that the optimization stops. What we've seen over the past few quarters, basically in the second half of 2022, we assume it's going to continue. We know it's going to end at some point but we don't know when exactly, so we're not building that into our guidance. Got it, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And just one follow-up here, a question on sales capacity. Just thinking about hiring plans there. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, overall headcount to grow in the mid-20s but continuing to go-to-market teams at a slower pace. So just is that mid-20s is the right way to think about sales capacity hiring this year, too? Yes, yes. I think that's right. We are growing our investments in go-to-market and sales capacity approximately plus or minus at the guidance we gave in headcount growth. In the end, the reason for that is we still have ground to cover. We still have segment and geographies to cover. And also, as we mentioned earlier, we're having actually great success when it comes to landing new logos and new products with customers. So, our sales interactions are productive.
Our return on investment is there. So, we need to keep doing that. Again, these are the seeds of future success we are planting, and we don't intend to stop. I would clarify that because of the ramping nature of salespeople, the growth rate that we had, which was in excess of that 25% in 2022 means that the coming online of that ramp capacity is at a rate higher than that in 2023 as we begin to harvest the investment from that. Got it. Thank guys. thanks for taking my question. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is open. Great. Thanks guys. Olivier, for you. Any data points around product splits? I know in the past, you've talked about APM and logs. I think it's been a couple of quarters since we had an update on the size of those businesses. But any sort of like rough magnitude of those? And are they still in hyper growth? No. I mean, we see a fairly -- like when you think of the products that are a major scale today, which are APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring, those are seeing about the same trend in terms of growth in Q4. And I think that's partly because some of the optimization we see from customers happens across this -- because it happens upstream from us at the provider level.
And that's why we'll see slightly slower growth of host monitored on the cap providers or APM and also a little bit less log. Some of it happens more directly at the observability level, logs in particular or some aspects of APM that are transaction-based where we see customers optimizing there and making sure they get the best value and cut the noise.
But as a result, we see fairly similar trends across the products. So that's why we didn't call out anything specific in there. We -- in the future, I'm sure we'll share more about their relative sizes. But again, the growth rates are not that different in Q4. So, it's -- there was nothing to call out. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just, David, on the guide, obviously with kind of a mid-20s revenue guide. You talked in the prepared remarks about having an NRR above 130% for almost two years. Presumably that dips below 130%. Any sort of commentary on how that might progress through the year? Yes. I think you're right. Implicit in that guide is below 130%. We'll report to everybody as we have that. We've seen it relate to a decel, I would say, on that, that given the change in the organic growth rate that we've been talking about starting in the middle of Q2 last year, it would be -- it's getting past that to the extent that it changes -- that changes that net retention plus or minus, given the net retention is comparison against the year-on-year customers.
So, you do have headwinds in the compare through the time that we had the change of the organic, which we had said was in the middle of Q2 of last year. Got it. Thanks. Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Your line is open. Thank you. I wanted to ask, with respect to the slowdowns and that you've been seeing within certain customers, have you seen anything to suggest that these could be related to layoffs in tech, either because, say, that seats have been directly impacted which is because of general disruption to DevOps and engineering teams? No. We say it's mostly because they can save money on their cloud bills. The -- again, one of the great things about the cloud is that the -- it's an ongoing expense. You can adjust it over time, you can restructure the way you're running applications. So, there are some norms you can use to optimize, which you can't if you're running everything on-prem, as all the costs are sunk already and confined to the future.
So, we mostly see that -- I mean, there's a little bit more noise than -- and predictability with some customers because they're having checkups, and so you need to talk to different people and they need to reorganize a little bit. So, it can add a little bit of noise on the conversations. But really, the dominant motion is the optimizing their cloud infrastructure, their cloud bill and their -- that's especially the case if they're spending a lot there.
The vast majority of our products are infrastructure usage or data volumes not per seat. So, we're not directly impacted by layoffs. And then just a quick follow-up would be actually in the prepared remarks, thank you for the context on Cloud Cost Management. Can you perhaps more generally talk about your customers' interest in FinOps and how Datadog is positioned to be able to just help customers better understand both where they're spending, how they're spending and what sort of ROI they're seeing? Yes. Our customers are definitely interested in FinOps, the larger they are, the more they are interested, and that directly relates to the work they do in cloud optimization. It's a very nascent category today. It's a nascent practice for most of our customers. And we also have a lot of experience internally running ourselves a very large cloud operation across all of the large cost cloud providers.
So that's why we believe we can build something that is fairly differentiated there. Our product there is having a great reception from customers, even though it's still early. I mentioned earlier, we signed a six-year deal, annual deal with a large restaurant chain. And we see more of that coming our way. So, we think it's one way in which we can also help our customers as they need to optimize and be more efficient in the short and midterm. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kamil with William & Blair. Your line is open. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to clarify one of David comments that you're incorporating seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to subdued growth in the month of December. Can you expand on how demand and customer conversations have trended in the first few weeks of '23 and whether that's changed since '22 year-end? Yes. I think you have two different avenues. I think we said in new logos, we have a strong quarter. We continue, as we mentioned, to have a strong pipeline, meaning that for new projects, new workloads, we continue to see a solid demand environment. In terms of the organic, when you have -- and this happens in most years, when you have people going on vacation and sort of reducing the amount of logs or work they're doing, you tend to see a rebound of that in January.
We did see a bit of that. But given the volatility in the market, we want to be cautious in reading too much into that. And we'll let everybody know how that plays out. Mathematically, we -- the Q4 was more front loaded than back loaded in terms of whole recognized revenue. So, we entered at a lower level than -- so that's why we also have the sequential is a little bit lower there. In terms of the trends, I'll just second what David said, we -- when that seasonality was higher than we had seen in previous years, and we can explain that in different ways.
And basically, if customers are trying to save money, they're a lot more careful about turning off the lights when they leave for vacation basically. But what we see in early 2023 so far is consistent with what we see in in Q4 or in the second half of 2022 in general. So, it's too early really to pass judgment, but it really factors into our guidance, which is that we don't believe that the optimization has stopped. We assume it's going to continue. We don't know yet when going to stop. We know it's going to happen at some point, but we're not planning it for this year in our guidance. Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. It's nice to see the large wins on the federal side. I realize it's still early, but can you update us on how big of a contribution that could be in '23? And how important are additional authorizations for expanding into that market? Or does FedRAMP moderate likely to address most of these TAM? So, I mean, I can't give you specific numbers there. I know we're seeing wins low seeing engagements from the government agencies and the committees that serve them. So, all that is very good. We still have some building to do on the go-to-market teams for that.
And we also still have some things to build on the product side. Like there's more levels of certification we want to get to reach more of those customers. So, we still What I'd say is we're getting the proof points that we're fit and that customers can use us in those environments and that there is a real market for us there. Our next question next question comes from Sterling Auty with SVB. Your line is open. Thanks. Hi, guys. Oli, I'm curious if you have any sense working and talking with customers as to when they started an optimization project, how long it actually takes them to get to that new level. Obviously, it can change if the economy gets worse, but is this something where they started and it takes them a month, a quarter to quarters? Any sense would be helpful. Yes. So, it's a little bit hard to give an answer that fits all types of customers because they're also all going to -- they organize a little bit differently. There are different scales in there and they're going through different phases with their businesses in the economy. We've seen customers having multiple rounds of layoffs, for example, or having to adjust multiple times what they're doing with their business.
But what we see in general is that the fastest thing they can do to have an impact on the abilities to adjust some of the data they send in logs or in APM. And after that, you'll see them do a little bit more at the cloud provider level, which is higher impact in terms of their own savings, but also takes a little bit more time because we need to reorganize some of their workloads and invest more engineering time in doing that.
So, we've seen that happen with some of our customers. For a number of our customers, we saw it happen. We think they've done, and that's -- and we see them start growing again. But it's too early to call it for the rest of the customer base as again, they're all going through a fairly different things and different scale. Understood. Thank you. And we have a question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Oli, if you think about the trends that you saw in the second half of last year and what you're seeing year-to-date when you think about optimizations versus time line to spin up new workloads and the effect that, that has on the NRR as it progresses, when you look at the time line that you think that takes and the anniversarying of these headwinds particularly with the larger customers, how does that look from a linearity perspective over the course of the year? So right now, in the guidance, we're assuming that we're seeing the same trends of growth of rising customer throughout the year. Like we're not estimating any inflection. We're assuming a continuation of that with some level of contribution compared to the actual we saw last year. That's what we are building in.
The -- again, we believe that there's going to be some reacceleration at some point as the optimization has on its course. But given the level of macro uncertainty, I think it's too difficult to -- we can't actually tell you when. Again, we've listened to the call of the cloud providers, they also can't tell you when. And so, we're being prudent with the guidance there. Perfect. And then, David, maybe just one for you around cash and cash conversion, free cash flow. As we look at the year, just curious if there's any kind of different flexibility in payment terms or even just the assumption for the cash conversion from operating income to cash flow for the full guidance for fiscal '23. We've always said that our free cash flow has been around slightly higher than our EBIT margin. If you look back, you'll see that it's, in some quarters, a little above, in some quarters a little below. We have not seen any changes of -- any material changes in payment terms or the flows of cash. So, there's nothing we've seen so far that would cause us to change our views about cash flow conversion for the company. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. Thank you all. So, I just want to take a minute to first thank our customers for trusting us with their business and partnering with us. I know some of them are going through difficult times last year and also early this year. And so, we're working with them. Potentially we all come out of it stronger. I also want to thank our employees, Datadogs everywhere around the world, for actually delivering a fantastic year in 2022, from all of the metrics we control ourselves.
We saw some slowdown in consumption with some customers, but we also delivered a lot of value for customers. We scaled our go-to-market teams. We did great in terms of landing new logos, attaching new products, shape new products that solve more problems for our customers. And we think that this bodes very well for the future. So, I'm very optimistic. I'm looking forward to a fantastic year in 2023 with everyone. And on this, I'll close the call. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q1. We continued broadening our platform, delivering new use cases for existing users, as well as signing up more customers, all on a backdrop of continued macro uncertainty and optimization of cloud workloads.
Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. In Q1, revenue was $482 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Note that this number factors in the impact of a service outage we experienced in March and which reduced our revenue for the quarter by about $5 million.
We ended with about 25,500 customers, up from about 19,800 last year. Also note that we are now including customers who joined following our acquisition of Cloudcraft, representing about 1,400 net new customers to Datadog this quarter.
We ended the quarter with about 2,910 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,250 last year. The customers generated about 85% of our ARR.
And we generated free cash flow of $116 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%.
Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As at the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using two or more products, in line with last year. 43% of customers were using four or more products, up from 35% a year ago, and 19% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 12% last year.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we experienced business conditions that were similar to the previous several quarters. Q1 usage growth from existing customers came in roughly as expected. We saw existing customer usage growth in Q1 improve from the levels we saw in Q4, but remain a bit lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3. And as in recent quarters, we continue to see customers optimize their cloud spend, particularly those further along in their cloud migration and hosting a larger portion of their infrastructure in the cloud.
Additionally, our new logo acquisition and bookings in Q1 were solid for what is a seasonally slower quarter. New logo bookings reached a new record for Q1 and were up slightly from last year as we continue to add many promising new logos, which I'll discuss in a bit. With our land and expand model, we expect many of these new logos will turn into much larger customers as they adopt more of our products over time.
Despite the more cost conscious demand environment, we have continued to land new customers and expand existing ones. And we are very proud to achieve several key milestones in Q1.
So first, our total ARR exceeded $2 billion for the first time, a true achievement for all of us at Datadog even though we all know we're only getting started.
Second, our APM suite and log management products together exceeded $1 billion in ARR. This demonstrates the expansion of our business well beyond our first infrastructure monitoring product and our successful execution on the broad observability platform. Remember that our APM suite includes four Datadog products, core APM, synthetics, real user monitoring, continuous profiler.
Third, we continue to make steady progress with our cloud security products, with continued growth in ARR and in customers, and I'm very pleased to announce that we now have more than 5,000 customers using our cloud security products.
Now let's move on to R&D. We introduced a number of new security capabilities last month. We announced the general availability of Application Vulnerability Management, which provides visibility into the attack surface of production environments by automatically surfacing vulnerabilities. And instead of submerging users with thousands upon thousands of vulnerabilities, this new functionality uses observability data to prioritize risks based on the estimated impact to the business and closes the loop between security, operations and development teams.
We also introduced a number of new capabilities to our cloud security management product. Workload security profiles allow customers to flag anomalous activity and improve overall accuracy or threat detection directly within their workload. And we now offer a vulnerability detection for containers, automatically scanning live container images for known vulnerabilities.
Now moving on from security to observability. We also announced the general availability of Data Streams Monitoring. This product specifically targets queuing, streaming and event driven pipelines, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. These systems often span many different teams and technologies and are notoriously difficult to manage and troubleshoot. And for this, even standard APM and log management solutions are not specialized enough. Data Streams Monitoring automatically identifies the topology, interdependencies and key metrics of complex streaming data pipelines, allowing customers to maintain availability, correctness and latency for what is now a critical part of their business.
Lastly, we were thrilled to unveil our newest data center in Japan last month. We see a large opportunity to serve our customers in the Asia Pacific region, which has seen significant growth over time, and now represents high-single digits as a percent of revenue.
I also want to take a moment and share our excitement for the latest wave of AI innovation. And I'm going to use AI indiscriminately here to refer to the recent advances in deep learning, large language models, and generative AI.
First, from a market perspective, over the long term, we believe AI will significantly expand our opportunity in observability and beyond. We think massive improvements in developer productivity will allow individuals to write more applications and to do so faster than ever before. And as we surpass productivity increases, we think this will further shift value from writing code to observing, managing, fixing and securing live applications.
In the short to medium term, we believe the rise of AI will increase the demand for compute and storage to train and run models, but it will also increase the value of proprietary data and further drive digital transformation and cloud migration as these are all prerequisites for adoption. We also do expect quite a bit of noise in the market, as the technology stack is progressing and changing very quickly.
Now, from a product perspective, we believe that we at Datadog are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our customers in this new world. First, we built Datadog from day one as a pure SaaS business precisely to be able to put all that to work at full scale and to train models to solve our customers' problems.
Second, our large surface of contact with our customers gives us the insertion points to make AI relevant. This is where we see the value of having a very broad customer base and being designed to be used every day by every single engineer.
And third, we serve today some of the largest builders and consumers of AI services and are quickly adapting to their needs in a rapidly changing field.
So, in other words, we are really excited by the potential of AI, for us and for the observability and security markets. And I'm sure we'll discuss this topic further in the future.
Okay, let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, our go-to-market teams had another productive quarter. So, let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an expansion into eight figures ARR with a leading AI company. This customer saw an order of magnitude increase in user demand and a surge in new customers following enormous innovation and interest in generative AI. As a result, this customer now uses six Datadog products and relies on our platform to track and correlate key business metrics ranging from uptime data to new user subscriptions and revenue.
Next, we signed a high seven figures expansion to another eight figure ARR deal with one of the world's largest fintech companies. This customer has expanded meaningfully over time, and today sees Datadog platform used by thousands of users across dozens of business units. With this expansion, this customer now uses 14 Datadog product and is consolidating multiple open source, homegrown and commercial tools across observability and security into the Datadog platform.
Next, we signed a seven figure expansion with a Fortune 500 healthcare company. Before using Datadog, major incidents will mobilize up to 150 employees for an average of three to four hours. With Datadog, they only need 20 employees for about 30 minutes with an opportunity to further reduce these numbers.
I will note that we're also replacing a commercial observability competitor whose new pricing model was causing an increase in cost with lower value. This customer now expects to save more than $0.5 million every year by moving to Datadog across several business units.
Next, we signed a six figure land with a multinational clothing company. This company was previously heavily siloed with each team using different monitoring tools. And as is often the case, this caused issues, impacting revenue and customer experience. This customer is starting with five Datadog product and expect to consolidate and replace a total of 13 commercial and open source tools with Datadog.
And last, but not least, we signed a seven figure multi-year land with a leading university in Australia. The customer had historically relied on open source solutions. They evaluated a few commercial competitors and Datadog won as their requirements involved both cloud and on-premise across logs, user experience and network device monitoring. This customer plans over time to migrate from more than 10 tools to the Datadog platform.
And that's it for this quarter's highlight. I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams again for their continued execution in Q1.
Now switching gears, let me speak to our longer term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multi-year trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We do continue to see customers optimizing their cloud usage, and visibility remains limited as to when this optimization cycle will end. But we firmly believe it will.
As before, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver value to more customers in their digital transformation and cloud migration journeys. And it is increasingly clear with each wave of technical innovation that every company in every industry in every geographic region has to take advantage of the cloud, micro services, container and generative AI and more.
By relentlessly broadening the Datadog platform, we will continue to help our customers save on costs, execute with greater engineering efficiency, drive competitive differentiation and deliver value to their own customers.
So, our long term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to capture our long term opportunities. And as David will discuss in a moment, the strength of our business model allows us to balance that with delivering financial performance.
With that, we'll turn it over to our CFO. David? Thanks, Olivier. In Q1, we continued to execute well and deliver value to our customers. Revenue was $482 million, up 33% year-over-year, and up 3% quarter-to-quarter.
To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance. First, we had an unusual outage in March, and we estimate that the impact to our revenues from that outage to be about $5 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we saw subdued usage growth in the month of December, which created a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter and drove seasonally weaker sequential growth in the first quarter.
During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that is typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than that in January and February. Overall, we saw existing customer usage growth in Q1 improve from the levels we saw in Q4, though it was slightly lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3 last year.
Next, we continued to see larger spending customers go slower than smaller spending customers. From an industry perspective, we continue to see the slowest growth in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in ecommerce and food delivery.
Geographically, we saw faster year-over-year growth in international than in North America.
Our trailing 12-month dollar based net retention rate or NRR continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. Based on our current growth trajectory, however, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to be below 130% in Q2. While our net retention rate is expected to go below 130%, we continue to execute strongly on our platform innovation and our land and expand business model, as evidenced by our latest product announcements, our expanding cross sell of products, and the examples of the strong Q1 renewals that Olivier discussed.
Our dollar based gross retention rate remained stable in the mid to high 90s, an indication of the mission critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $511 million, up 15% year-over-year. We had a large upfront bill for a client in Q1 2022 that did not recur at the same level or timing in Q1 2023. Pro forma for this client, billings growth was in the low 30s percent year-over-year.
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.14 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the high 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
Gross profit in the quarter was $388 million, representing a gross margin of 80.5%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.6% last quarter and 80.4% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter.
In the mid to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s percent range.
Our Q1 non-GAAP OpEx grew 45% year-over-year. This is a decline from 54% year over year growth in the previous quarter. We continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market, but at a more moderate pace than last year.
Q1 operating income was $86 million or an 18% operating margin, flat sequentially to Q4 2022 margin, also of 18%. In the year ago quarter, operating margins was 23%, and it benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $134 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $116 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%.
Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2023. Informing our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers.
While existing customers are still expanding with us, we continue to assume in our guidance that cloud optimization is affecting their expansion rate for the rest of 2023. For the second quarter, as a result, we expect revenue to be in the range of $498 million to $502 million, which represents 23% to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $82 million to $86 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.27 to $0.29 per share range based on approximately 349 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.10 billion, which represents 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.20 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Some additional notes in our guidance. First, we have continued to balance near term financial strength with investment in our large long term opportunities. And we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. We expect to continue moderation of headcount growth and the lapping of the COVID affected historical expenses to result in continued slowing of OpEx growth during the remainder of 2023.
We now plan to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses excluding COGS in fiscal year 2023 by approximately 30% year-over-year with an exit rate in Q4 in the low 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. And we expect our tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be in the range of $14 million to $16 million.
Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.
Now finally, to reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We are continuing to invest to further expand the ways we reach our customers and help them along these journeys. I want to thank our Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in this quarter.
With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Could you speak to the optimization, Olivier, a little bit more in detail. Obviously, it's a journey for customers. And there's like initial steps and then there's follow-on steps. If you think about the customer behavior in terms of what they do in optimization, are you still seeing the same steps that are getting taken? Or are we going to kind of round two, round three, etc. So I just tried to understand a little bit where we are on that optimization journey, if you have more color on that. And then, I have one follow-up, please. The short of it is we don't know exactly yet. I'm going to give an answer that's going to be very similar to the answer I gave last quarter. But we see customers taking another bite at their own workforce, like we saw a number of companies this morning, actually even. So I don't think customers themselves know where they're done. So, we're very prudent in terms of assuming an end to it in the near future.
So when we look at our data, when we look at what we hear from the hyperscalers also, we also listen carefully to their commentary on what they foresee in the near future, we don't see anything that gives us confidence that we can call an end to optimization in the next quarter or the quarter after that. So as far as our guidance goes and our plan for the year, we assume that this is going to continue at a similar level for the rest of the year.
Now, obviously, when we look at our customer base, we see some customers that obviously seem to be done with it and others that haven't done anything, so we try to keep an eye on them and model it, but we're not including any of that in our guidance. David, on the on the cost side, thanks for giving us the OpEx rate for the year and the exit rate. If you think about the – there's always that situation of investing for the future. And at some point, you need to come out versus like surviving, like living in the current environment. How do you think about that investment philosophy of balancing today versus getting ready for tomorrow? I would say that we've made substantial and consistent investments both in our go-to-market and in R&D over the last few years. And this year, we're balancing – continuing to do that with two things, with prioritization as well as injecting some optimization or efficiency into the investments we had made. We're seeing the opportunity to get returns from the previous investments and to think through a little more the prioritization of those. Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. I had a question, Olivier, on AI. It seems like we're on the cusp of another sort of compute cycle driven by AI. The last compute cycle, you guys were all over in terms of being ahead of the curve in terms of the shift from monoliths to micro services. And so, with this new sort of compute cycle that we're about to embark on, what do you see – how are sort of applications in the sort of the application stack, how is that going to change? And what are the implications for Datadog as a monitoring vendor? What are potentially the puts and takes in terms of how applications are going to be built going forward? First, I'd say it's – we can all agree that it's a fascinating time to be alive to see all these rapid innovation in the world of AI. The first thing I'd say is that it's still fairly early in terms of what the market is going to look like in the AI world. Right now, there's one particular thing that's been – that used to be very hard, which was in building conventional models and chatbots and things like that, which almost overnight became almost a commodity, basically. Anybody can incorporate in any application. It's an API call away. And there's even a number of different options, commercial open source you can use today. So that just happened. That plan has massive traction. You see it everywhere. But it also is opening the gate to many, many more – I would say more customized, deeper applications on AI that may be built by a few vendors or may be built by a large number of companies instead. It's not quite clear yet.
We see, on our end, is that it's going to drive more compute, it's going to drive more value in the data that is being gathered by companies, it's going to drive digital transformation, it's going to drive cloud migration because, again, you can't actually adopt AI unless you have the data. You can't actually adopt it without having a modern architecture and an application you can scale up and down and infrastructure you can quickly provision and deprovision. You need to capture all of your – to capture your data, you need to be digitally transformed. So you have data of all your customer interactions and everything that is proper to your business. So in the meantime, we see that as a very clear accelerant to our business. Maybe with a little bit of noise that I mentioned on the on the script earlier in terms of what technology end up being the winning ones and what technologies end up being fizzling after a few years. Because it's so early and there's so much innovation that, out of 200 new things, there's probably only 10 or 20 that will matter to us all now. But it's hard to know which ones is out today.
So short answer is midterm, a lot more of the current workload – types of workloads we see maybe with different types of technologies. Longer term, I think we can all glimpse at a future where productivity for everybody, including software engineers, increases dramatically. And the way we see that as a business is – our job is to help our customers absorb the complexity of the applications they've built, so they can understand them, modify them, run them, secure them. And we think that the more productivity there is, the more people can write in any amount of time. The less they understand the software they produce and the more data, the more valued it sends our way. So this is what makes us very confident in the long term. As a follow-up and getting back to sort of the topic of cloud optimization, what did you sort of see in April versus March? And typically, sort of baseline what April typically looks like for the company? And are there any customers that have begun optimization that maybe didn't start in 2022? Are you seeing incremental new customer cohorts get on board the cloud optimization train? I would say April is broadly consistent with what we've seen in Q4 and Q1. I think there's no major difference to call out there. And it's too early also for us to call the quarter obviously. So there's nothing we're really shocked to point out about April.
On the customer optimization, look, we have a large number of customers that are early in their cloud migration, earlier in the Datadog adoption that are growing very fast. We haven't seen any optimization from those customers. It's possible we see optimization from some of those, which is why we remain very careful in our guidance. We don't assume basically that the optimization will stop at the customer that already have done it and that the rest of the customer base is going to be fine after that. The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. David, looking at the math on this large upfront bill that did not recur, it seems to be about $65 million, if I'm running that correctly. Can you possibly shed a little more light? For instance, will you recapture that or some of that in Q2 and what type of customer dynamic is operating at that level? Then I have a quick follow-up. That is a customer of ours, what we said was the billing frequency change and the size. So that customer's bill will, one, be spread out more over time. That was a crypto company and continues to be a customer of ours. But that was an early optimizer. We had always talked about some of the industries that were most affected optimized. And that is – so we will get that bill at a smaller size than was billed last year in a more of a chunked up billing way. This is one of those situations where this customer was in an industry that got pretty much decimated over the past year. And their own business was cut in three or four in terms of the revenue. And when that's the case, that we really work with customers to restructure their contracts with us. We want to be part of the solution for them, not part of the problem. And that's what we need to hear. We restructure their contract, so we keep them as a happy customer for many more years and do a deal that works for everyone with their business profile. Since we've been public, we've pointed out when we have an unusual bill, so we don't have multiple of these types of situations. And what we've done, if you look back through our commentaries, when we've had one of those, a change of timing or a change of the duration of a bill or a size of a bill, we've tried to pro forma it in order to give everyone a sense of what the rest of the business is doing. As a follow up, Olivier, congrats on passing $2 billion in ARR, one of the fastest software companies ever to do that. Pretty amazing. I did want to ask you as well on the optimizations at the moment. Microsoft seems more optimistic that the optimization activity would start to normalize in the next couple or few quarters than Amazon does. And when we tear it apart, Azure has less exposure to tech companies which are doing layoffs. They have more exposure to generative AI, which is booming relative to AWS. So I'm wondering if that part lines up with your telemetry and your forecasting that perhaps your Azure monitoring business is going to start to turn the corner sooner and then perhaps AWS would follow after that. It's too early to tell. And by the way, it's a bit hard to just project our numbers from the – just as a reminder, hard to predict our numbers from the numbers of the cloud providers because it's not a one to one in terms of what they report and what concerns the infrastructure and the applications directly. Different cloud providers have different things in there.
And also, these vendors have, in addition to the volumes that drive consumption on our end, they also have their own pricing dynamics. And typically, in those situations, the vendors with the largest bills are the ones that get pushed the most. So, in this case, that would be AWS.
In terms of what we see in our data, there is nothing to suggest that any particular cloud is recovering from optimization just yet. We also tried to read the hyperscalar comments and – depending on what you've read before and after, they look more or less positive. So I'm not quite sure I would project as much enthusiasm in the Microsoft comments. But what we know is that, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter for us. We're equally well positioned to capture workloads on Azure as we are on AWS and GCP.
The only thought I would say of the Microsoft stack that we don't cover as well is everything that is lift and shift of purely Microsoft technology, including Microsoft technology office [indiscernible] because that can typically be done very well with the built in Microsoft tooling. But when you think of any market share gain that might happen from now on from Microsoft and the others, if you can imagine that, that would be more cloudy workloads, next gen workloads, workloads that have to gather data and call into AI models. And these are things that we were very well positioned to capture. The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. I was curious, Olivier, that with generative AI, is it merely the fact of just waiting for these workloads to come on? And since you have such a strong presence in infrastructure monitoring, it's workloads that just run on these big clouds and you will optimize them? Or do you have to do something specific on the product side to tool Datadog to better handle these generative As I said? I think, clearly, there's going to be more productivity. The way this has played out in the past, typically, is you just end up generating more stuff and more mess. So, basically, if one person can produce 10 times more, you end up with 10 times more stuff, and that person will still not understand everything they've produced.
So the way we imagine the future is companies are going to deliver a lot more functionality to their users a lot faster, they're going to solve a lot more problems in software, but there won't be as tight an understanding from the engineering team as to what it is they build and how they built it and what might break and what might be the corner cases that don't work and things like that. And that's consistent with what we can see people building with a Copilot today and things like that. These are very, very good for solving a small problem, but they don't help you build consistent [indiscernible] or they don't help you build software platforms like that. That stuff is still out of reach. Again, the way we see the future is we'll feel customers do a lot more and they will still need help to catch up with everything they're doing and we'll be the ones to do that for them. Also, Microsoft talked about the anniversary effect of optimization that the headwinds should be less going forward, whereas AWS called out decelerations in the month of April. But it looks like your business is to study in the month of April. So it's fair to say that you're sort of decoupling away from the AWS deceleration and maintaining that steady pace as far as consumption trends are concerned. Look, for the rest of the year, we're not assuming any change in trajectory. So, now in terms of where we are compared to the other cloud providers, one thing you can do is you can look at the sequential growth numbers quarter to quarter, and you'll see that if you look at the three major cloud providers, they've decelerated to about 1% quarter-to-quarter growth for the last quarter. We're still significantly higher than that. And when you look at our ARR, considering the fact that we exited slower in 2022 and we exited higher at the end of Q1, because the quarters are shaped differently around the holidays, we actually maintained an ARR that was going to be high also than the – ARR growth that was higher than the – sequentially than the cloud providers. So we already decoupled from the growth of the hyperscalar to a certain extent. The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. This is Joel [ph] on for Fatima. Just to check on another vertical here, given the continued uncertainty in the financial services vertical, just wondering if you could speak to your exposure here and perhaps any related behavior you're seeing with your customers, if at all? I don't think we have numbers to share on the exact exposure to financial services. Obviously, it's been a growing vertical for us as the financial services are early adopters of software. I would say it's not necessarily earliest adopters of the cloud, but definitely an adopter at scale today of cloud technology. We haven't seen any changes in customer behavior on that side. And that includes when there were all this trouble – we saw all this trouble with SVB and other banks failing. We were still seeing great uptake from our products from financial services, new logos as well as expansion deals. So nothing to report on our end. You mentioned the expansion deal with a large fintech which displaced open source software in addition to other tools, so just wondering if you could speak to the competitive dynamic versus open source, especially in this cost sensitive environment and why Datadog still wins and perhaps works as a consolidation destination. The situation is very similar to what it's always been. We win because we deliver more value. At the end of the day, it works better and cheaper with what we do and what we provide than trying to do it yourself and mobilizing your own team and trying to stitch together different parts of open source.
For some customers, they will still want part of that, they will still want to bill somebody, that's more of a cultural thing. But for the vast majority of customers, it's not a rational thing to do. And that's why we win in the end.
The dynamic there is remarkably unchanged from – I could have said the exact same thing 10 years ago. Obviously, the open source projects were different, our footprint [indiscernible] was different, but the dynamics when we sold to customer was very similar. The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Olivier, earlier you mentioned sort of the opportunity or your sort of focus on the Azure ecosystem. What types of things on a go-to-market perspective can you do to increase your penetration there as you've sort of historically been much larger inside of AWS? There's a lot of things we're doing, whether it's working directly with other cloud providers, in addition to our very strong relationship with AWS, whether that's building more integration specifically into the ecosystem, technology integrations. And if you look at our announcements, product announcements, you'll see that we've done quite a bit in partnership with Azure and Microsoft, for example.
Part of it is also expanding our sales force in territories that tend to be – to lean more towards Microsoft in terms of their tech stack. So, when you look at the early customers we had, which tended to be a lot of software companies, companies that used to be based on the West Coast in the US, that these typically didn't lean hard Microsoft, but when we look at the more recent enterprise teams which started in the past few years, for example, in the US central areas, like these tend to be way heavier on the Microsoft stack. So it's a combination of all of the above basically. Like, there's not just one single thing we do. It's a lot of different things at many levels to make sure that we have the right product to show in front of the [indiscernible] right customer and have the right sales force to enable that. The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Thanks for the APM and log management data point, over $1 billion in ARR. I'm wondering, can you provide a frame of reference for maybe the growth of these two businesses versus core infrastructure and maybe between the two, APM and logging? Are they about equal in size or is one sort of relatively larger than the other? [indiscernible] same. We're not going to give specific numbers there. And the growth rates, of course, generally speaking, the smaller products grow faster than the products that are bigger than them. That's pretty much true about the whole set of products.
The growth of all the other products have come down a little bit, especially the ones that have a large volume component, like, for example, logs where when you think of optimization, there is optimization that happens at the cloud provider level and there's some that can happen at the observability level too. Overwhelmingly, at the observability level, but log and everything that – for which customers have a different knob to turn. For everything else, the optimization corresponds to what the cloud providers see. On the outage that you referenced, the $5 million, I'm curious, what did you guys learn from that to prevent maybe this in the future? Outside of the $5 million hit that David talked about, are there any other repercussions from a customer perspective? We've made a lifetime of learning in a day. So that's the positive part of having an incident like that. I want to say – I was personally very impressed by the response from our team. We shared some information post mortem, what happened. I encourage everyone to read it because it's a fascinating document. But because of the very wide nature of this issue, we ended up having three shifts of 500 to 600 engineers working on this outage. And that part worked beautifully.
Obviously, we've learned about a number of things beyond the root cause of the outage that is almost anecdotal, like it's one of those small things that can have a big impact. But I don't worry so much about it happening again.
What we've learned is more about the various things we can do better to recover faster for our systems and to provide a better way for our customers to mitigate an issue when that happens. So these are the most of the learnings and most of the new sources of work that we have internally to follow up on that, make sure we reduce the chance of it happening again. And when it does, we recover faster and better for customers. Overall, a very humbling experience. And I want to make sure that we do right by our customers in the future there.
We don't see any long term impact. The way we've handled it is by being very transparent with our customers about what was happening and addressing any possible consequences with them after that. And we think in those situations when you do things right and when you don't repeat these mistakes too often, the effect is actually to strengthen the relationship with the customer. And I hope we succeed in doing that. The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. David, just on the large customer adds. You were at 130 versus an average of 170 to 240 over the last four quarters. Any color there? And can you just talk to, is this just more customers stalling because of the economy? Or is this execution related? How would you characterize the large enterprise traction? A couple of factors. One, first quarter is our seasonally lowest amount of new logo ARR. The first quarter of this year was very similar. I think we said slightly higher than the year before and similar to our other quarters. That's one factor.
Secondly, as we've talked about, most of our customers who are in that larger customer group aren't born there, but expand into that. And when the organic growth rate goes down, you will naturally have a slower evolution or graduation of customers into that larger customer classification. So both of those factors have caused that slowdown in the accumulation of customers over $100,000. Olivier, just a quick follow up on the cloud optimization solution. Can you give us a sense of the traction what you're seeing in terms of adoption there? Adoption for what? Sorry, I missed the beginning of your question. [indiscernible] build a cloud optimization solution to help your customers identify where there's potential opportunities. Are you seeing an uptake in that product? We're seeing extremely strong demand for that and this is – so this is definitely a product that customers – just customers want. And our 10-year roadmap for it is very clear. So there's no doubt about it. The next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America Securities. Just one from me here in the interest of time. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud security management platform, and specifically the sales motion for it. So, how is that shaping up this year? And how should we be thinking about the investments and strategy for that segment this year? And as you attack that opportunity, how has the competitive environment been shaping up as you head into deal bake offs? Is it coming in as expected? There's no dramatic change from what we've seen before. Our focus is really on getting the product in as many hands as possible. And as we mentioned in the call, it's working. We have more than 5,000 customers on those products. And this is really what gives us the – it closes the loop, so that we can keep building those products and bring them all to maturity.
The one thing I'll say is, our strategy, our approach for security is ambitious. And we don't have a – we specifically are not trying to build a point solution. We're building [Technical Difficulty] which means we're moving in many different direction at the same time for this. And everything we do in terms of go-to-market and driving customer adoption for that is in service of this product development, so we can build up that platform.
So with that in mind, the go-to-market hasn't changed from what we've done before. And we tend to land heavily on crossing over from DevOps teams into security. And that's working well to get a lot more customer adoption.
On the community side, there's no big changes there. We see the same usual suspects as before. Their dynamics are a little bit different because they typically have narrower solution and more defined sale motions around those. But we're very pleased with the customer adoption so far. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Olivier, you laid out a pretty compelling case for why generative AI will have a positive impact on Datadog and presumably the observability market at large both over the near to medium term as well as long term. But do you see any offsets, any partial offsets from organizations having greater intelligence and automation at their fingertips? Are there certain workloads that may no longer need to be monitored by an observability platform? In the long term future, everything is possible. But I don't think – today, I don't think that's not what we hear or see. Again, the workloads are getting more complex as the intelligence of management is getting better. And we see basically a continuation of that.
In terms of what customers do today, it's hard to project the current adoption of AI into what it might look back into the future because, right now, AI is mostly used as an API call for most companies, but we don't think it's necessarily going to be the case one to five years from now. Just for David on the outage. Are the credits, et cetera, is that now fully behind you? Or is there any lingering financial impact in the Q2 that you're embedding in the guide? We provide for what we know at the time in our calls. So we believe that we've provided for that through the revenue impact in Q1. The last question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham. I guess a question for Oli. The first question is really around the ARR discussion. I appreciate the color you guys provided around that APM and log management. Can you highlight, is Datadog winning new customers on pure APM and logging at this point? Or is infrastructure still the heavy lean as far as where those new logos are being predominantly won?
And then secondarily, can you talk to maybe some of the newer products in the portfolio which are seeing the strongest uptake today, just given we had – I think it's 17 plus modules in the portfolio more broadly. Just where should we be focusing when thinking about growth going forward from here? Look, our motion is still to land with infrastructure, perhaps APM or [indiscernible] when we start. I would say it's getting increasingly difficult to separate all of those because [indiscernible] market in general is converging into, I think, all three under one roof. So, whether customers start the conversation about APM or logs, whether they start it from infrastructure, it doesn't matter a ton when we land new customers.
I would say, though, that we definitely have best of breed products also in APM and logs. Those products win on their own. And sometimes when we enter a new customer, already have solutions for the things, we can start by displacing a vendor on the APM side or the log side [indiscernible]. That's definitely something that we do on a regular basis.
On the question of the products that are growing the fastest, all the newer products are actually getting pretty good uptake. So it's hard to pick one. I mentioned earlier, so cloud cost optimization is actually a very popular product right now. Still very early in its lifetime, but it's a very popular product. And we also see a lot of interest, actually, for some of the new products we announced at DASH last year and some of which are still not generally available.
So there's a number of things we're doing in terms of automating response to issues, to any workflows and sorting through issues and managing issues with your lifecycle that are getting a lot of attention from customers to that too. So, we were excited about what's coming next.
Obviously, the expectation for some of those products are changing over time too. You know that everyone can see what can be done with AI. We really expect to see a lot more of that. So, I guess we'll share more on that in the near future. I would now like to turn the call over to Olivier for closing remarks. Thank you. I want to thank again everyone at Datadog for crossing this really important milestone. Obviously, we're already focused on the next ones. But I want to thank everyone for their hard work shipping product, getting in front of customers. I also want to thank our teams for responding to that system outage we had and our customers for very kindly working with us through that.
And on this, I will speak to you again after Q2. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's second quarter 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations.
These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our team continued to execute well in Q2 as we welcome thousands of attendees at our Dashes conference last week. We continue to deliver a large number of new product innovations and we recorded strong new logo bookings throughout the quarter.
Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $509 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,100 customers, up from about 21,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,990 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,420 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR, and we generated free cash flow of $142 million, with a free cash flow margin of 28%.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. At a high level, first, we saw Q2 usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. Second, we do see signs that cloud optimization may start to subside. And third, we continue scaling our sales with strong new logo bookings in Q2. Going one-level deeper. In Q2, we saw usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters.
We continue to see customers, particularly some larger spending customers, scrutinize costs and optimize their cloud and observability usage during Q2. We are reflecting this lower growth in our updated guidance for 2023, and David will provide more commentary regarding our guidance geography.
On the other hand, we are seeing signs that the cloud optimization across our customer base may start to subside. The cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago appear to have stabilized the users growth at the end of Q2, as indicated by the recent activity and the related commitments with us. And we saw usage growth in aggregates rebound in July to levels that are more similar to what we see in Q1.
While it is too early to call an end to cloud optimization and a significant level of macro uncertainty remains, these new trends, along with the tenor of our customer interactions are encouraging. Lastly, our bookings were strong in Q2. Our new logo and new product bookings and deal cycles haven't been impacted by the period of cloud optimization and we continue to see healthy growth on the sales side.
From a new logo bookings perspective, we had our largest Q2 and second largest quarter ever, only behind the seasonally larger Q4 2022. We also closed a record number of new business deals larger than $100,000 in annual commitment. And with our land extend model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud, and add up more of our product. So as a conclusion, while we do apply conservatism to our guidance, recent usage trends as well as strong new logo activity and customer ramp-ups are positive signs for our future growth.
Now turning to platform adoption. Q2 metrics show that our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 79% a year ago. 45% of customers were using four or more products, up from 37% a year ago, and 21% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 14% a year ago.
The strong multiproduct adoption include expansion into our new newest products. About 30% of our customers have already adopted at least one of our products launched since 2021, including CI visibility database monitoring, cloud security management, sensitive data scanner, cloud craft and others. We expect more opportunities to expand adoption of these products as we continue to broaden their capabilities over time.
In Securities, we mentioned last quarter that over 5,000 customers have adopted security products. While many of these 5,000 are just getting started with Datadog Security, we are seeing opportunities to help customers secure their cloud at scale. As of Q2, 79 of our customers spent more than $100,000 on Datadog Security and a handful are now spending more than $1 million.
Now let's move on to R&D. Last week, we had our DASH User Conference and introduced a number of exciting new products and features for our users. To kick off our keynote, we launched our first innovation for generative AI and large language model. We showcased our LLM observability product, enabling ML engineers to safely deploy and manage the models in production. This includes the model catalog centralized place to view and manage every model in every state of our customer development pipeline; analysis and insight on model performance, which allows all engineers to identify and address performance and quality issue with the model themselves; and help identify model drift, the performance degradation that happens over time as model interact with real-world data.
We also introduced Bits AI. Bits understands natural language and provide insights from across the Datadog platform as well as from our customers' collaboration and documentation tools. Among its many features, Bits AI can act as an incident management copilot identifying and suggesting success, generating synthetic tests and triggering workflows to automatically remediate critical issue. And we announced 15 new integrations across the next-generation AI stack from GPU infrastructure providers to Vector databases, module vendors and AR orchestration frameworks.
As we said last quarter, we are excited about these new AI technologies, and we believe Datadog is uniquely positioned to both help our customers make the best of them as well as to incorporate them into our product alongside our data and workloads. And although, it's early days for everyone in this space, we are getting traction with AI customers. And in Q2, our next-gen AI customers contributed about 2% of ARR.
Moving on from AI. We showcased a number of new capabilities in the observability space. We introduced Flex logs for log management, allowing customers to flexibly choose retention periods and required performance separately to make new high-volume million use cases cost-effective. We are simplifying APM onboarding for large organizations, so engineers can enable APM across all applications without any core changes. With APM trade squaring, our customers can now understand the complete impact of any localized issue. We introduced our Error Tracking Assistant, which manages AI capabilities with live observability data to automatically explain, solve and test for production errors.
In digital experience, we're also applying next-gen AI technologies to help customers automatically generate synthetic tests from their live traffic data. And we have expanded our mobile monitoring features bringing a first-class experience for mobile developer teams with mobile session replay and mobile application testing. We also announced several innovations in cloud security. Our new security inbox surfaces the most pressing security issues, correlating thousands of technical insights and reducing them to a smaller number of actionable tasks.
We can now expect more infrastructure vulnerabilities, whether they are in applications, container images as our hosts. With custom code venerability detection, we extended our detection capabilities beyond auto [indiscernible] and into customers on code identifying the exact vulnerable code mixed feedback with the majority in detail. And with Cloud Sim investigator, our customers can visually map an attacker's behavior going back more than a year, leading to faster investigation and remediation.
Shifting left, we're delivering more solutions to developers with static analysis. Customers can scan code for quality issues directly within Datadog and we are introducing quality gates for engineers can set rules and prevent e-secure, buggy or slow code from deploying production. Finally, we announced new capabilities to help customers spend on property to receive more efficiently.
Our container resource utilization functionality makes it clear which applications are under or over provisioned. And with cloud cost recommendations, we're adding to our cloud cost management product to automatically discover saving opportunities and act on them. Those were just some of the many announcements we made at DASH. Our Investor Relations website includes a link to the DASH keynote, and I encourage you to watch it to learn more.
Before I step away from more innovation, I'm also pleased to note that for the third year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. We believe this validates our approach to deliver unified platform, which breaks on silos across teams and to focus intensely on product innovation.
Now let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, we recorded strong new logo bookings, and we continue to see significant expansion opportunities with existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an eight-figure deal over three years with a major American video games company. These customers' previous SaaS observability vendor was not delivering on critical capabilities such as quality alerting and collaborative incident management and a recent pricing change motivated to get some rich consider other vendors. By moving to Datadog, this customer expects to get higher value out of their monitoring, produce [indiscernible] and eliminate silos among users. And as we achieve better results, they expect to save over $1 million annually by shifting to Datadog from their previous vendor.
Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a major broadcaster. This customer is moving to AWS and serverless and its fragmented legacy in open-source tools meet longer incident resolution times and confusion among teams. This customer is developing seven Datadog products, consolidating five tools and has already ramped Datadog to over 500 users.
Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a leading Japanese toys and media company. This company has been using a competitive observability vendor alongside smaller tools and home-grown capabilities. With the adoption of five Datadog products, they have full visibility into their applications. They can save time on the busy work and focus on delivering great experiences for their customers.
Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with one of the world's largest tech companies. This customer is seeing massive adoption of its new generative AI product and needs to scale their GPU fleet to meet increasing demand for AI workload. Using their home-grown tools were slowing them down and put at risk critical product launches. With Datadog, this team is able to programmatically manage new environments as they come online, track and alert on their service level objectives and provide real-time visibility for [indiscernible].
Last but not least, we signed an expansion with one of the world's largest financial institutions, taking this customer to eight-figure ARR. This customer operates at massive scale, supporting thousands of applications run by tens of thousands of developers and we have a strategic initiative to move aggressively to the public cloud this year. They chose Datadog as their preferred observability platform for cloud application. And as their business units modernize, they are expanding to 10 Datadog products and replacing a number of legacy commercial tools and that is for this quarter's highlights.
I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for their execution in Q2 and for helping our customers make the most out of Dash last week. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Despite the recent trends of product optimization and continued macro uncertainty, our posture remains the same. We are confident in our long-term growth opportunities, driven by the secular trends of cloud migration and digital transformation as well as our rapid pace of innovation to set customers in observability and beyond.
And we think our strong new logo and product adoption trends this quarter are indicative of the continued large and growing opportunity for Datadog. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to serve our customers as they move to the cloud, AI and other modern technologies.
With that, let me turn it over to our CFO. David? Thanks, Olivier. Q2 revenues was $509 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. In Q2, we continued to execute solidly and we also continue to see pressure on the usage growth of existing customers. To dive into some of the drivers of Q2 performance. First, as to usage growth of existing customers, we saw positive usage growth this quarter to lower than in recent quarters, with broadly similar trends across our product lines.
While too early to draw broad conclusions, existing customer usage growth improved in July and was more similar to Q1 than that of Q2. We saw more pressure on cloud native businesses than traditional enterprise customers, similar to previous quarters. Regarding customers by spending size, the more moderate growth trends were consistent across the customer base with relatively more pressure on usage growth rates with larger customers.
As Olivier discussed, the cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, appear to have stabilized their usage growth with Datadog, though, we recognize that the growth rates of these optimizing customers may remain muted and other customers could optimize. Regarding total customers. Our customer count increased to 26,100 from 25,500 last quarter. This quarter's total paying customer count includes a one-time cleanup of about 200 financially immaterial customers at the very low end, who are moved to our free tier.
Our gross customer additions have remained strong, especially with larger customers. Meanwhile, we are seeing some churn of smaller customers who have limited impact on our revenues. As a result, our gross revenue retention rate remains unchanged in the mid to high 90s, indicating the stickiness of our product and the importance of our product to our customers' operations. We are executing on strong new logo bookings and new customers contributing meaningfully to our growth as they ramp up.
As Olivier mentioned, we had our second largest new logo bookings quarter and a record for Q2. We expect these customers to become more meaningful as they expand with us. In Q2, about 40% of our year-over-year revenue growth or 10 points of growth was attributable to growth from these new customers that were acquired in the past year. Finally, we continue to see consolidation opportunities, particularly in larger deals. Consolidation allows our customers to improve functionality by getting all of their data into one platform, while saving money at the same time.
Moving on to our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR. NRR was over 120% in Q2 as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. As we expected and as we discussed on last quarter's call, our trailing 12-month NRR decline but was above 120 in Q2 as existing customers continue to scrutinize their tech stack costs and make efficiency improvements. If our growth trajectory continues at current levels, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to decline to below 120 in Q3.
Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $520 million in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO was $1.25 billion, up 42% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about up 30% year-over-year. We signed some larger multiyear deals in the quarter, which drove an increase in the duration year-over-year. As we've mentioned before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $414 million, representing a gross margin of 81.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.5% last quarter and 80.8% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. As a result, we are experiencing a gross margin, which is in excess of our target in the high 70s.
Our Q2 OpEx grew 26% year-over-year, and this was a decline from 45% year-over-year growth last quarter. We moderated our hiring pace and executed on controlling costs, given the macro uncertainties. Q2 operating income was $106 million, or a 21% operating margin, up from 18% last quarter and flat to 21% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with our execution on cost control and disciplined investment in this quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash from operations was $153 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $142 million for a free cash flow margin of 28%.
Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the usage growth of our existing customers. As a reminder, our guidance philosophy is to carry forward trends observed in recent quarters, discounted with additional conservative. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $521 million to $525 million, which represents a 19% to 20% year-over-year growth.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $98 million to $102 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 354 weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $0.34 per share and based on approximately 351 million average sales diluted shares outstanding.
Now finally, for some additional notes on the guidance. We have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. Next, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $85 million and we expect our tax expense for the full year to be $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be about 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.
To reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term growth opportunities and we're continuing to execute against those opportunities. I want to thank our Datadog worldwide for our efforts in this quarter.
And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Hey. Thank you. Olivier, on the -- if you think about the niche, can you discuss a little bit in the nature (ph) of the optimizations that you see when you compare a little bit what you saw at the early parts of the -- after recession or the cycle late last year versus what you see now. Does the nature has changed there in terms of what you're seeing there? And then I have one follow-up, David. No, we don't see a big change in the nature of the optimization, it's a mix of a optimization of the cloud workloads themselves and little bit also on the observability side for the new (ph) products that have volume that can be separate from the cloud workloads, such as log from metrics and things like that. I would say, so this quarter we did see a little bit lower growth as we said in the comments across the board from existing customers. We suggest that the customers have started optimizing earlier, we're not done yet and some others have started later and they all across many are (ph) there.
We did see, however, that some of the customers in the course of customers and but you're going to stay optimizing a year ago and that we're on the larger side and on the primary side has stabilized their growth. And we feel a lot more confident now that they've done at least as far as they know. As we've seen some of these customers start committing long-term forward again with us and at levels that are at or above their current levels of usage, which suggest that you have a good idea of what is going next, which is all inspired -- part of what you for your comments about the -- fact that we think we might we see some signs that the this period by end. Still too early to call it, but we see some -- we seem to be on more solid ground there. Yes. Okay. And then just linking that up with the guidance because that's where I get a lot of the questions, you think about your Q3 and then Q4 implied guidance, even given that you had a full year there's obviously still headwinds on growth that are kind of coming there. Like how much of that Q3, Q4 is kind of a lagging effect of what we've seen before versus kind of maybe other factors like conservatism, et cetera.? Thank you. Yeah, it's both. Because our growth was a little lower than in Q2 than it had been in the previous quarters. We have that effect moving forward given our recurring revenue model. And then on top of that, we -- in our guidance philosophy, we discount the most recent performance, particularly around usage growth, but also in new logos. So it’s a combination of both of that, those flowing through in our financial results for the year. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Thanks, guys for taking the question. I think I understand the comments around slower usage growth trends, particularly compared to Q1. I just wanted to dig into sort of issues around competition. David, you mentioned sort of higher churn at low end. We see total customer count growth slow down this quarter. So we think of about either [indiscernible] competition, competition with open source or DIY or maybe even customers rather than getting to hyperscale or needed solutions. Has it seen any sort of pick up there? And is that a potential as part of the mix of why we're seeing slower usage trends this quarter? Sanjit, you're breaking up a little bit. So I hope I answered your question appropriately, but the -- we do see a slightly higher return at the very, very low end. This is more related to the health of what happens to tiny, tiny businesses that use us for small amounts and that themselves might disappear go out of business or start having needle together. We did have a onetime cleanup also this quarter as we -- on an ongoing basis, we don't create some customers if they are not super active in the platform or if they are deals are out -- are not paid up today.
We changed some of the criteria around that, which ended up with a onetime cleanup of 200 customers, which changed a number there. But beyond that, we do see a little bit higher churn at the very, very low end. The numbers there are small in terms of revenue. They're actually completely material and the overall gross retention remains unchanged and in the mid to high 90s in aggregate. We said that -- I think on the other side of it, we said that in dollars, we had a strong new logo bookings and also cross-sell. And a lot of that, as I said in my comments, or a portion of that tends to be consolidation onto the platform, which has been going on a long time. Yeah. And beyond that, I think it's a good point, David, we do see -- we're actually very happy with what we see on the new product and new logos out of the business. We're lending record numbers of new customers of scale and we're also seeing more and more consolidation on to us. If nothing else, the committee dynamics seems to turn more into our favor as time goes by there, independently from what we see in terms of churn or go to very end (ph). I appreciate the color. And then David and Olivier, you made some sort of, I guess, preliminary comments of potentially seeing some green shoots on the optimization headwinds that we've seen over the last several quarters. In terms of the percentage of the base that hasn't optimized, any sort of color how large that is? What percentage of the customer base hasn't yet optimized but potentially could going forward? We can't really give you a percentage there. But the cohort we mentioned on the call was the one we were looking at for getting a sense of stabilization in the optimization was the cohort that started optimizing the first that was typically large in volume, very cloud-native in nature and that we consider to be the highest risk one. So the one that weighed on our growth numbers, the most over the past few quarters and that's the one we based on a lot of comment on. In addition to the other trends that David mentioned earlier, on the fact that in aggregate, we saw our growth of existing customers pick up first late in Q2 and then in July. I appreciate the color, Olivier. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Yes. Thank you very much. Once the larger customers have compressor spending, and obviously, there's a limit to how much they can compress that. Then they're going to need to grow that spending again. And at some point, you're going to have growth ramping pretty materially in security. It sounds like that has started and all of the LLM observability. And then you're going to have easier comparisons as we head into 2024. Is it reasonable to think that optimizations could be further subsiding as you're entering 2024 based on your comments.
And then for all these reasons, should we be optimistic on growth picking up just relative to how it's going to exit in Q4 of this year, which I think is around -- which I think is around the mid-teens. And I know it's hard to answer because you haven't guided on that yet or would you be imagining, David, that we might kind of just drag across that 15% into 2024 as a starting point. And if you can't answer it numerically, maybe you could just kind of speak to some of these time frames qualitatively. Thank you. Yeah. I think we haven't provided guidance for next year. We cited that given the amount of our revenue growth that embedded in our existing customer base. The timing of the lapsing of optimization is critical to that. We said we see green shoots has been said, but it's too early to call that. So that's the biggest factor. In addition, we said that our new logo performance in terms of assigning new customers who then ramped is another green shoot that could do that, but it's -- we haven't provided guidance on specific numbers for next year, so I really can't go further. Well, look, I mean, we are -- obviously, we're optimistic that we're still very early in a big tech transition. Short-term, we don't really control the growth of existing customers and how much to optimize their cloud environment and things like that. But for everything that we control and we secure on, which is new products, the quality of the products and the new customers and the attach of these new products with customers. Everything we see seems to be working and we see great results from that. And these are obviously great trends for the future.
The one thing I would add is that in our conversation with our customers at a conference just last week. Most of the conversations were around who we're going to get our customers to implement new use cases, add up new products, scale up, consolidate onto our platform. There was still a little bit of customers thinking about cost control, optimization and things like that, but we also see less a bit of a time. So when that kicks in, in terms of the overall growth in aggregate, as David said, it's too early to tell and we want to be careful there because we know sometimes our customers will know everything themselves. They might face more difficulties as they go. But we're very optimistic about the mid, long term, obviously. And Olivier, thank you for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned strong new logo bookings and I think we don't see that in the new customer count, but you rattled off a handful of seven and eight figure wins, which I believe each and every one of this sounded like a consolidation play onto other vendor -- off of other vendors and displacing those on to Datadog. Am I interpreting it accurately to think that maybe you're seeing a pretty big shift there, where maybe in terms of just win rates, competitive displacements kind of seeing this vision of the consolidated platform really putting a dent in the competitive landscape to Datadog's advantage? Yeah. Well, in general, we see it and we see -- by nature, this consolidation deals tend to be the ones that have the biggest headline number when we close them as opposed to just a continuation of their existing run rate we have with those customers. So that's what causes the step functions there, and that's why we call them out on the earnings call. But in general, we have a record number of new business deals across -- above $100,000. So what you don't see in the overall number of customers is the spread between smaller, medium and larger.
There's quite a bit of noise at the low end of that customer count, which makes the number ebb and flow a little bit. But for the part that we target with our sales force, which are the middle and the high end of it, where we actually see those numbers go nicely and commensurately with all sales force. So we're very happy about that. Just to clarify the customer count. So on gross additions, a number -- very consistent with what we've seen in previous quarters. But as Olivier mentioned, more larger deals resulted in a higher average land. That's what produced the record Q2. And the net -- the weight on the net is, we mentioned the cleanup, but on the very low end customers that are on the border between very, very slight usage and free trial. So the gross addition activities were consistent and strong. And in fact, I think as you mentioned and as you get to the larger deals, you have more consolidation impetus within those wins. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Hey. This is Anisha (ph) on for Kash. Two quick questions. One may be on usage growth slowdown. Is that coming from particular end markets or segments or verticals that you can highlight? And second, maybe on hiring, while you're seeing green shoots in new logo growth and we had a great number of announcements from the DASH conference, what would give you conviction to ramp up hiring or since you've moderated your go-to-market motion right now? Thank you. Yeah. On the -- so first on the growth slowdown. This is, I would say, across the board with the optimization, but it is a lot more pronounced with cloud-native businesses than with traditional enterprises. And the reasons for that are that cloud native businesses have a lot more they're spending on the cloud and a lot more of an emphasis on saving there than the larger enterprises that are a lot earlier in the cloud migration and that still have most of their system or a majority of their IT spend that is outside of cloud. So this is where we've seen the most optimization. It's still where we see the most optimization, though, as we said in the call, we saw that the earlier cohorts of cloud-native customers that started optimizing a year ago are showing some stabilization and some higher commitments with us in the past couple of months.
In terms of hiring, I think we're still growing the company, and we're still investing. What we've done is we have moderate to that of growth to align on the -- on what we've seen in the market. But we still consider we are very, very early in terms of the -- or put our journey. We still have a lot to build in observability. We have a lot to build in security. We have a lot to build and develop our workforce and developer experience. We have a lot to be in ITSM. There's many, many new use cases we're going after, including AI. And so we're not going to stop hiring and we're not going to stop innovating there.
The last thing I'll mention is that we've also been growing our go-to-market teams. And the reason for that is those investments in go-to-market are yielding incremental growth on the new logo and new product side. As we said in the call, that part of the business has been working very well, and we’re very satisfied with the output there. So we’ll keep growing the team while being mindful of the margins we need to protect. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Roberge from William Blair. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, AI is something that a lot of customers are excited about, but we're hearing that it may be delaying purchasing decisions in other parts of that tech stack until customers kind of figure out how they want to incorporate AI into their broader organization and just how much that will cost? Do you feel like that dynamic impacted Q2 at all with just maybe a near-term low in IT spending until broader AI plans are finalized? Or is the updated guide mainly just driven by the optimizations you've been calling out? We don't really see that trends play. I would say -- the one thing I would say is or AI customer is fully into two accounts right now. They are the ones that have been working on it for the past two, three years, that our providers of AI themselves or business that are completely built on AI and we see those business reaching scale, in some cases, very large scale right now. And -- but it's a relatively small number of customers. There's a much larger number of customers that are standing to embrace AI. But those are still early, and it's probably going to take a number of quarters even yours in some cases for those use cases and those customers to reach full scale. So again, a much larger number of customers, but quite early. So we have those two trends at play when you look at our AI penetration and the AI adoption. Okay. Helpful. And then you called out the strong new logo bookings quite a few times there. Are there any commonalities between those customers from just a size or maybe an industry perspective? And I'm curious if you've started to see any of the newer generative AI-focused companies that are creating these LLMs start to actually layer into your model from a customer perspective? Right. And is part of your question -- can you read it? You were – your volume was a little bit low. Yeah. The first part was just around the strong new logo bookings and just if there was any commonalities between those customers from a size or an industry perspective? The new logo bookings are in terms of value like their [indiscernible] at mid-market and enterprise. So on the larger side and on the more traditional side. We have a number of companies or customers that are also the providers of AI, but some of those have been customers for some time already. And in some situations, we have new business units of existing customers that were with us for a while, but also started new business units around AI that start adapting more product. More recently, we have one of those also in the call comments from a very large customer. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. On sales and marketing in Q2, you've never been down sequentially. Are you holding back on quota-carrying rep hiring to get the reps productive? Are you going to be adding on that side? And a quick follow-up. The biggest factor there was the sales kickoff that would be in the first quarter and not in the second quarter. So the change has more to do with the timing of events. Be that as it may, as Olivier (ph) mentioned, we're continuing to invest in sales quota-capacity, but we are growing that at a lower rate than we did last year. But the major factor in the sequential was a seasonal thing around events. Okay. And real quick, just some of the large customer adds in 80, your cadence was pushing 130 to 170. So is something competitively going on there or is it just you're equally seeing the SMB and Enterprise act the same way in terms of their conservatism? I didn't understand -- what -- I didn't understand the question. Brian, you're talking about the net adds of $100,000 plus customers? Correct. It was 80 versus 130 to 170 in the last four quarters. Yes. I would say that we said that the number of customers has been relatively steady, although, it's decelled (ph). And we have gotten, I would say, in that range in land, the average land has been larger. So of those that are landing smaller. And when net retention goes down because the major source of customers going into that would be from customers below $100,000. And bigger factor would be that it takes longer for those customers to evolve into a 100,000, and that's the biggest factor in that. Yes. And just to reiterate what we're saying, we're very happy with the addition of customers on the medium and large size. These numbers are going up across the board in terms of new customers and new products and -- so we feel very good about that. And if nothing else, the things are improving there. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Hey, guys. Two questions. First, can you finish on [Technical Difficulty] Can you just talk about how usage traded month by month, April, May, June? And if you can go there any logic around that? And then my second question is just, Olivier, you had said there was the difference between those [Technical Difficulty]. I didn't hear your second question. You're breaking up a little bit. So the first question -- and for the first question to start, maybe was on the ERT during the quarter, I guess. Yes. So ERT was not completely out of the ordinary for us. So I will say we see -- we had a low in May. I would say in late April and May, we started having a low. And then things improved in June and improved some more in July, which is after the end of the quarter. That being said, as we -- for more guidance for the rest of the year, we based that on what we saw throughout the quarter and we discount it. And we're trying to avoid looking too much at what we saw the partial quarters we go after that. That's been offset as you through that, and we'll stick to that today. Thanks. And then the second question was the optimization that was particular to absorbability. Is there any difference across your major product categories, let's say, APM versus logs versus infrastructure? So the ones that are the most sensitive to that are logs, some part of infrastructure, which is custom metrics and some part of APM, which is additional large volume transactions that customers might tradition to what they get included with every single cost to deploy APM on. And we've seen some optimization on that, that's been specific to observability. I would say it does go hand in hand with the overall co-optimization our customers are doing. So the timing might always be exactly the same, which is also why we're careful about the trends that we're forecasting based on the sort of the improvement we've seen recently. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I want to start with a clarification. Did you actually lower your discount rate that you apply to your organic growth relative to your annual outlook or when you put that together this quarter? Yes, we would essentially discount the most recent assumption. So if the most recent assumptions were lower, we said they were lower in Q2 then we would be lowering that in the guidance assumptions going forward. Right. So it wasn't just the organic growth rate being lower, your actual discount rate was lower, too? I don't know -- sorry, I don't understand your question. We do our guidance based on taking the assumptions and then discounting. I don't know -- you'd have to clarify what you mean by the discount rate. We don't have a discount rate card for guidance. But we do discount the historical, as we give guidance for the future. Okay. Fair enough. And then I just had a question on that large deal, the eight-figure deal. Is that large enough that we should normalize it when we think about our estimates for next year pr do you have enough of those eight-figure deals in the pipeline that it will blend out? I don't think you need to normalize for it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi from Wedbush. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the new logo bookings that you mentioned. What is the average duration of new bookings or new logo bookings? And how has that trended so far? We haven't discussed the duration of new bookings versus existing bookings, our durations in terms of contract it tended to be just under a year, nine months to 10 months, but we haven't given information on the difference between new bookings, I would say the larger -- if you're getting to the because most of the revenues are existing customers, if it's -- if you're talking about renewals or new contracts on existing customers that would have the larger effect on contract duration. As we said, there was a trend towards longer-term deals, which extended the duration in terms of our existing customers. And just to clarify, the duration for new customers was consistent with the prior quarter or was it higher? The duration increased. So we said that the RPO total was higher than the current RPO and that the reason was that duration had gone up slightly from previous periods. Duration increased in contracts. Yeah. Very helpful. Just one follow-up. That 40% of the new, I guess, revenue growth came from new customers. So 10 points of the revenue growth came from new customers who signed up in the last, I guess, year. Is that a consistent metric or was that higher or lower than what you usually see? Yeah. We report that in our Qs. That's -- the 40% has is higher than it had been. That's mathematically true when net retention goes down with more consistency of new, you would have a higher percent. The 10 points, so the 10 points of growth or of our growth would be something that would be more consistent and not as dependent on the net retention. Got it. Thanks very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America Securities. Hey, Olivier and David. Just 1 from me here in the interest of time. Olivier, in your prepared remarks, you called out 2% of ARR being generated from next-gen AI customers. I wanted to dig into that a little bit more. How should we be thinking about how you define what a next-gen AI customer is that an existing customer with very specific AI initiatives or is that a next-gen AI-specific customers, say, like an LLM vendor? And then what was that contribution during 1Q? Thanks, guys. So it's -- you can see it as the customers that are either selling AI themselves. So that would be LM vendors and the like. Our customers whose whole business is so is built on differentiated AI technology. And we've been fairly selective in terms of who we put in a category because companies everywhere are very eager to said that they differentiate we are today. So this is an illustration basically of the new kinds of businesses we've seen emerge, I would say, in the past year, 1.5 years, two years. In some cases, it might be divisions of existing larger companies, but in most situations, these are fairly recent and newer companies. We didn’t give a comparable for the numbers. This is the first time we disclose this. And we probably won’t disclose it on a regular basis just to give more color to what we see in the market today. Got it. That’s super helpful. Thank you very much for taking the question. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Great. Thank you. I'd love to hear what you thought about the attendance at Datadog Dash in San Francisco versus your expectations? And then more broadly about the -- or your thoughts around the return to in-person events like this? So overall, we're actually very happily surprised. So we have decided to go to put Dash in San Francisco this year. So we switch things up a little bit and maybe see different customers than the ones we see when we do it on the East Coast. We're a little bit worried to be honest because we did it in the summer in San Francisco, and we had heard our stories about or get people into price to show up. And we've been very, very happily surprised. We got great attendance actually higher than we had modeled, which forced us to scramble the first day to add some shares in the keynote roads. And so overall, the time was very good. The conference was very productive. That was very, very good.
In terms of the return to in-person events across the board, we see them happen whether that’s our own conference or the other industry or an conferences that we exhibit at, we see a lot of success with those again. And since customers are very eager to connect and come to these events. So definitely something that’s happening this year that was maybe not happening as much the years before. Okay. Thanks, Olivier. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Thank you for taking the question. First for Olivier and then I had a follow-up. So given the slight improvement in usage trends that you cited in the first quarter, it was a bit surprising to hear that Q2 usage growth for existing customers was a little lower than prior quarters because we haven't really been hearing this from other consumption business models that have recently reported. And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts as to why the usage growth for existing customers may have downtick this quarter? Anything come across? Well, I think it's -- look, at the end of the day, we have a slightly different customer mix than some of the other folks. There are some optimizations that are with others that are special to cloud that maybe it's also specific to different clouds of which we have a different mix than the rest of the industry. So when you combine all of that, you might see some different timing effects in terms of how various optimization might heat us versus others. So I wouldn't read too much into that.
I think the trends are broadly the same as what you see anywhere in the industry. And the other participants are also quite careful about not calling an IBM (ph) to all of the optimization. So are we, even though from the behavior we see from our -- who we think of other customers, who are the most at risk of optimization. We feel better about the path we see them tech and the usage trends we see of late. Okay. Thanks, Oli. And then I wanted to ask on the security side because you mentioned 79 customers now over $100,000, including a handful spending more than $1 million. So for those largest customers in particular, can you give us a flavor for which Datadog security products they're most frequently using? Also, how much of this, again, to those largest wins, how much of this is greenfield as opposed to displacement? Thanks. The largest customers there tend to use almost all of our security products today. Sometimes there are some exceptions. And these are customers that tend to be on the tech forward mid-market higher-end of the market side that deployers world-to-world in their organizations. Typically, the customers that have us in a six- figures are above tend to be -- can be enterprise or mid-market, but the ones that are mid and above tend to be mid-market and more tech forward.
And I would say overall, the adoption tracks the -- the adoption in the industry of a unified DevSecOps as a practice. And again to zoom out a little bit, we believe that this is where the whole industry is going. And we're building a product with completely ready and we have a fully mature end-to-end solution that is relevant to every single possible customer. So that by the time this becomes with general practicing in industry where we no-brainer choice for all of those customers and so-far we're pleased with what we're doing there. Very helpful. Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Olivier Pomel, CEO of Datadog, for closing remarks. Thank you. So first of all, thank you all for attending the call today. I also want to thank all of our employees, all the Datadog's around the world for a Q2 that was very well-executed. And I want to thank all of our customers for making DASH last week such a vibrant conference and making some products here in terms of conversations we've had with them. And with these good words, thank you all. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023 . the words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended . this information is available on the Investor Relations section of our website .",0.0

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, [ Gigi ]. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's third quarter 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2023 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q3. We delivered another quarter of profitable growth and robust notable bookings and we continue to broaden our platform to have customers become and grow digital businesses.
Let me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $548 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,800 customers, up from about 22,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,130 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,600 last year. And these customers generated about 86% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $138 million with a free cash flow margin of 25%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 80% a year ago. 46% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 40% a year ago and 21% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 16% last year.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q3, we saw usage growth we've seen customers improve compared to Q2. Overall growth in Q3 was relatively consistent throughout the quarter and comparable to levels we've seen in Q1. We are seeing signs that the cloud optimization activity from some of our customers may be moderating. As a reminder, last quarter, we discussed a cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago and we said that they appear to stabilize their users growth at the end of Q2. That trend has held for the past several months with that cohorts usage remaining stable throughout Q3.
Overall, we continue to see impact from optimization in our business. But we believe that the intensity and breadth of optimization we've experienced in recent quarters is moderating. Meanwhile, our new logo activity has remained robust. New logo bookings continue to scale and grow year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we closed a record number of new deals with more than $100,000 in annual commitment.
With our Land and Expand model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud and add up more and more products. Finally, regarding customer growth, we are pleased with the new logos, new workloads and new product attaches we added this quarter. We added a number of exciting new customized in Q3, and I'll discuss a couple of examples later.
Note that our total customer count is largely driven by our long tail of very small customers, while our sales motions are more targeted to the middle and high end of our prospects. And as a reflection of our team's strong execution, our net adds of customers over $100,000, saw an increase in Q3 compared to Q2.
Despite a more cost-conscious demand environment over the past year, our business has continued to grow across product lines and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones. First, our infrastructure monitoring ARR exceeded $1 billion. Today, our infrastructure products cover monitoring the performance of hosts, networks, containers, Kubernetes deployments, saves functions and other aspects of infrastructure in the cloud as well as a full set of AI and machine learning tools to help our customers separate signal for noise.
Second, our APM suite, which includes core APM, Synthetics, Real User Monitoring and Continuous profiler, exceeded $500 million in ARR, and we continue to expand our capabilities in APM, most recently with single-step instrumentation, which allows a single engineer to enable APM across all applications without core changes and we ship advances in mobile app monitoring, including mobile application testing and mobilization replay.
Third, our log management product exceeded $500 million in AR. We also continue to expand our capabilities in load management. And with Flex logs, customers can easily scale storage and compute separately, allowing for new very high-volume logging use cases in a cost-effective manner.
From the very beginning, my cofounder Alexis and I had a vision to create a unified platform that serves end-to-end use cases across datasets, products and SIM boundaries. We believe that these ARR milestones and their balance across the 3 pillars of observability demonstrate that Datadog is unique within the industry in establishing true platform value for customers. And of course, even though these products have become significant in size, we are only just getting started. We will continue to innovate to deliver more solutions for our customers across observability and beyond.
I will add that we have empathy for our customers in their pain points, in part because we are ourselves users of cloud and next-gen technologies at a meaningful scale and we extensively deploy a user on solution, which is appropriately known as dog footing. As an example, we have extensively relied on our cloud cost management product as we expanded its capabilities this past year.
And the use of our product has played a large role in delivering cost performance and efficiency improvements, optimizing our own cloud usage and ultimately resulting in expansion of our gross margins in recent quarters.
We also continued to innovate in the depth take-up space. Our recent expansions in cloud security include cloud SIEM investigator, where customers can visualize logs over a long period of time to conduct security investigations. And within our cloud security management product, we have introduced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, or CIEM, to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues.
For a few years now, the industry has been talking about the idea of DevSecOps, the breaking down of silos among development, operations and security teams. And we entered the security space on the premise that DevOps and security teams should share the same data in the same platform.
So starting this month, we are making the practice of DevSecOps easy to adopt for all customers by bringing together all the components needed to fully monitor and secure their entire stack with 2 simple packages. First, with infrastructure DevSecOps, our customers can observe and secure their entire cloud environment in one package. With a simple purpose price and a single agent deployed, customers get end-to-end visibility into performance, availability and security issues in one place. And from that one place, teams can also quickly remediate problems using built-in workflows and without any code or contribution changes.
Second, with APM DevSecOps, we take this one step further. Customers can instrument cloud applications for both performance and generality issues in one single package enabled with the same unified agent used for infrastructure DevSecOps. APM DevSecOps complements infrastructure DevSecOps by surfacing open source and code level security viabilities alongside performance issue.
Finally, we continue to be excited about the opportunity in generative AI and Large Language Models. First, we believe adopting NextGen AI will require the use of cloud and other modern technologies and drive additional growth in cloud workloads. So we are continuing to invest by integrating with more components at every layer of the new AI stack and by developing our own LLM observability products.
And while we see signs of AI adoption across large parts of our customer base, in the near term, we continue to see AI-related usage manifest itself most accurately with next-gen AI native customers who contributed about 2.5% of our ARR this quarter.
In the mid- to long term, we expect customers of all industries and sizes to keep adding value to their products using AI and to get their early explore -- to get from early exploration to development into production, thus driving larger cloud and observability usage across our customer base.
Besides observing the AI stack, we also expect to keep adding value to our own platform using AI. Datadog's unified platform and purely SaaS model, combined with strong multiproduct adoption by our customers generates a large amount of deep and precise observability data. We believe combining AI capabilities with this broad data set will allow us to deliver differentiated value to customers.
And we are working to product that is differentiated value through recently announced capabilities such as our bid Bits AI assistant, AI generated synthetic test and AI-led air analysis and resolution, and we expect to deliver many more related innovation to customers over time.
Let's move on to sales and marketing, where we continue to execute on both new logos and existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we founded 7-figure land over 5 years with a leading provider of dental care. This company's legacy monitoring just didn't cut and it contributed to delay with their migration to Azure. What's concerning to them was that customers notice poor application performance and were complaining publicly on social media. By adopting 6 Datadog products, they expect to find and fix the vast majority of incidents internally before their customers are affected. And in signing a 5-year deal, this customer showed its confidence in Datadog as a long-term partner in their migration.
Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a South American fintech company. By moving from basic built-in cloud monitoring, legacy tooling and open source tools to Datadog, this customer expects to significantly reduce costs by spending less on tooling, reducing time to resolution and giving time back to engineers to innovate on their own products.
Next, we signed an 8-figure renewal over 3 years with a major American chain of convenience stores. With this expansion, Datadog will bring all aspects of these customers' tech systems into one platform, including their applications, hybrid cloud, network, in-store IoT technology, point-of-sale systems, self-serve kiosks, fuel pumps and corporate infrastructure.
This will free up employee time to focus on customer service with expectations to save millions of dollars annually. This customer plans to use 6 Datadog products replacing 3 commercial observability tools. Next, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a major U.S. federal agency.
When we first started working with this customer a year ago, Datadog was approved for a limited subset of programs. But as we have demonstrated value and gain eternal adoption, this customer is now deploying Datadog across the entire agency. They have a added 6 Datadog products, and by doing so, consolidated out of 7 tools.
Next, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 industrial company. Customer was concerned with out-of-control costs with its legacy log management products and was using a dozen different tools. And when they began using Datadog, they noticed far fewer support tickets submitted to their reliability team. By growing set with Datadog and expanding to 7 products, this customer expects to deliver better service while saving time and reducing cost.
And last, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a software business that is part of a tech hyperscaler. This long-term customer has used Datadog for infrastruction metrics and will now expand to adopt 7 Datadog products. Datadog will be replacing its commercial APM tool, which was well adopted by its engineers and led to inefficient troubleshooting outages and revenue impact.
Our support of open telemetry, in particular, was key to their decision to expand with Datadog, that it makes it possible for APM tracing to be democratized and use across their entire DevOps team. And that's it for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their strong execution in Q3.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me reiterate our longer-term outlook. As we have said throughout this period of cloud optimization and macro uncertainty, our long-term plans have remained unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage.
So we continue to invest aggressively to better our platform, and we aim to be our customers' mission-critical partners as they move to cloud and to modern DevSecOps With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David. Thanks, Olivier. Q3 revenue was $548 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q3 performance, first, regarding usage growth. We saw an improvement in usage growth in Q3 versus Q2. The Q3 usage growth was more similar to Q1 and relatively steady throughout the quarter.
We had a very healthy start to Q4 in October. While it is too early in the quarter to know for sure, it will happen in the next couple of months, the trends we see in early Q4 are stronger than they've been for the past year. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we continue to see larger spending customer growth at a slower rate than smaller spending customers, but usage growth improved for all customer sizes in Q3 relative to Q2.
And as Olivier discussed, we believe there are signs that the optimization activity we've been seeing is moderating. Last quarter, we discussed the cohort of customers who started optimizing about a year ago. This cohort's usage has been stable -- was stable throughout Q3. As we look at our overall customer activity, we continue to see customers optimizing but with less impact than we experienced in Q2, contributing to our usage growth with existing customers improving in Q3 relative to Q2.
While we expect cost management to continue, we believe we are seeing moderation that is still present but -- a moderation is still present, but is less intense and less widespread than we experienced in recent quarters. Geographically, we experienced similar sequential revenue growth in North America and in our international markets. And finally, as regard to retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in line with our expectations and came in slightly below 120% in Q3. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s, a sign of the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $607 million, up 30% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.45 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about 30% year-over-year.
Over the past couple of quarters, we have seen an increasing preference from our customers to sign multiyear deals, and our weighted average booking duration was up sequentially and year-over-year. We see continued interest in multiyear duration deals in our pipeline as customers seek longer-term strategic partnerships with us.
We continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenues based on the timing of invoice and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $451 million, representing a gross margin of 82.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.3% last quarter and 79.7% in the year ago quarter.
As Olivier mentioned, we continued to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects. Our Q3 OpEx grew 17% year-over-year. This is a decline from 26% year-over-year growth last quarter. We continued to execute on controlling costs given the uncertain environment. And Q3 operating income was $131 million for a 24% operating margin, up from 21% last quarter and above the 17% in the year ago quarter.
Our margins were higher than we expected in Q3 as our organic growth was higher than in Q2, while our internal optimization and cost management efforts were successful. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash flow from operations was $153 million in the quarter.
After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $138 million for a free cash flow margin of 25%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2023. A reminder, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. We based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $564 million to $568 million, which represents about 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $129 million to $133 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share based on approximately 355 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.103 billion to $2.107 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $453 million to $457 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Some additional notes for our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and net interest and other income for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $95 million. We expect tax expense in the fiscal year to be $12 million to $14 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal 2023.
And now regarding 2024. It is too early for us to speak to 2024 revenue growth. We will digest the information we see over the next couple of months and give you our 2024 revenue guidance next quarter. As it relates to non-GAAP profitability, our operating income and margins were a little higher in Q3 than we targeted as usage growth improved from Q2 levels, and we were successful with our cost efficiencies.
We expect continued strong execution on profitability in Q4. At the same time, we continue to be excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities and we have no shortage of investments to make and are confident in our ability to execute to strong ROI on those investments.
As a result, while we are not providing 2024 margin guidance at this point, as always, we will balance our investments in long-term growth with margin discipline. And we will update you on that in more detail next quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Congratulations on a very strong performance. Olivier, I'm interested in your mention of 2.5% of ARR being driven by the native AI providers. Should we think of that mostly consisting of open AI, LAMA, anthropic, Cohere, et cetera? Or are you meaning that as a slightly different reference? And can you just help us understand, is that up from close to 0 a year ago? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. So it's a number of companies that, without naming anyone, so they tend to be model providers, but not just on the language side, like a providers on the language, image side, like there's a number of different -- or video side, there's a different types of communities there given some good pilot-type companies. These customers all had revenue 1 year ago, but they've been growing a little bit faster than the rest of the customer base recently. And the reason we did that in the crisis -- we -- today, we see the usage growth related directly to AI coming mostly for these customers that provide models to others. Whereas we see broad usage of AI functionality across the customer base, but at low volumes, and it corresponds to the fact that for most customers or most enterprises really, they're still in the early stages of developing and shipping applications. So for now, the usage is concentrated among the model providers. Okay. Yes. That make sense. And Olivier, as a quick follow-up, you mentioned the log management has cost $500 million in ARR. It's quite a milestone. You also mentioned the replacement of some legacy products. I'm curious if you see the acquisition of Splunk or any other acquisition activity in that market as a beneficial development. I'm just wondering if small customers or other companies that have been provided, that have been acquired, excuse me, might be looking for any alternatives out there that are more modern and a more converged platform and if you're seeing that in the pipeline. I mean, we've seen that for a while now that customers were looking for more integrated platforms, more model offerings, things that were more cloud first. And that's been one of the reasons of our success in landing largely in brand-new applications, brand new environment, brand new cloud initiatives and then over time, consolidating our customers away from whatever they were using in the legacy. We don't think that it is going to change with the various acquisitions and tech privates that we've seen over the past quarter. So we think we will just see more of that over time.
One exciting bit on your first question, interesting bit, if you -- as I know many of you are trying to understand what the AI landscape is made of. Interestingly enough, the -- when we look at our cohort of customers that are that we consider to be AI native and built largely on AI in all AI providers, they tend to be on different clouds. What we see is that the majority of those companies actually have a lot of their usage on AWS. Today, the larger part of the usage or the larger of these customers are on Azure. So we see really several different adoption trends there that I think are interesting to the broader market. And our next question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Olivier, the company has been innovating throughout this downturn quite aggressively across core observability, security as well as AI. As we look into 2024, and we think about a potential new product cycle for Datadog, what parts of the portfolio do you think could be contributors either in 2024 -- later in '24 and 2025, what are the things that you face to customers will be most respective to? Just wanted to get a sense of where you think where the sort of the timing of some of these new products that you've been delivering over the past couple of years. Well, the -- mathematically, the products that will contribute the most to the growth next year are going to be the products that have been here the longest in the core observability products. We mentioned $1 billion in infrastructure, $0.5 billion in APM, $0.5 billion in logs. This is great, but still a small fraction of these products can be at scale, and we are primarily going after that. There's a number of other things we've been investing in and growing and we're fairly happy with the way things are going in security, as I mentioned on the call, we saw new packaging, we've also rolled out. And some of the new initiatives that stand, I would say, a little bit left or right of what we've been doing in observability.
This year, as you mentioned, was a year of innovation for us. I think it was also a year of cost optimization for customers. It's not necessarily the best year to get products to very quick -- extremely quick revenue growth, but we've planted a lot of seeds that we think are going to deliver in the next couple of years. That's great. And then I had a sort of a follow-up question on the sort of new packaging for the DevSecOps, the new package. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color around why you sort of what was the packaging approach and what you're trying to solve for? Is it sort of trying to adopt the capabilities in a single integrated capability? Or is it also about sort of consolidated pricing being potentially 1 SKU, 1 SKU price or to consume all these capabilities. So I just love some detail around -- on the motivation for these new packaging. Yes. A couple of things. So the first one is we security products have reached a certain level of maturity. And so we think they can be brought into the conversation with a larger set of our customers as opposed to being something that our customers sell select to which is how we started and how we start with most products really. But also we're trying to bring those products in the same conversation as the initial adoption of DevOps basically as opposed to having to branch that conversation into, oh, hey, you're doing operations and applications and can I interest you in some security with that, which would be a different conversation. So we -- so far, the signs for this are encouraging. And again, we think it goes with the broader market trends, the adoption of DevSecOps and what customers actually want to do, and we think is going to help them deliver better outcomes in security. But obviously, it's still -- we just rolled that out. So it's still too early to tell whether we got it right or whether we still need to tweak it a little bit. And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, like we're almost a year into this kind of current situation and you saw Q2, obviously, saw the digital natives that you commented, just kind of having extra savings, but we're now back to kind of Q1 usage pattern. What do you see in terms of changing behavior on customers, not thinking into market. More like how do you think about observability and how that potentially would change the world as we think about '24, '25 coming out of this in terms of kind of vendor consolidation, how to kind of build observability, et cetera? And then I have one follow-up for David. So we think the trends of vendor consolidation will continue. So basically, customers are getting more of it -- more mature in their needs, they're getting further into the cloud. And they're -- as part of that, they will want to add lesser integrators. And if they can use one platform instead of 12 different products, that's something that they all react very positively to and we see that again and again as we expand into our customers.
In terms of the broader trends, I think we -- it's too early to tell exactly what the next couple of quarters are going to be made of. We said -- it looks like we've hit an inflection point. It looks like there's a lot less overhang now in terms of what needs to be optimized or could be optimized by customers. It looks like also optimization is more -- is less intense and less widespread across the customer base. So all that is positive. Now there's still quite a bit of uncertainty in the macro environment. So I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves either and declare that it's the end of it for the foreseeable future. So we feel positive about things. But it's still hard to know exactly what's going to happen in a couple of quarters from now.
From a buying behavior perspective, we've never seen customers really slow down in their intent to move to the cloud and direct adoption of new platforms, new products from us. We've done well, we scaled the New Logo acquisition with scale, the new product Hitachi. So that has been a constant throughout this optimization phase. In terms of the user growth and customers scaling new workloads, I don't think we're back to the exibirant times of 2021. But maybe we are reverting back to the mean of what was happening before that. Okay. And if I can squeeze one quick one and David, we talked about OpEx and OpEx growth and this quarter was lower than others. Should I read your comments about next year. And clearly, there is a big investment opportunity that OpEx growth like maybe wasn't quite where you wanted it to be? Just any comment there? And I know you just can't guide. Yes. I think as we talked about the movement of the top line because of consumption moves more quickly than we can adjust resources. So we've taken more of an optimization and cost prioritization this year. But we offset that, we do think there's a very large opportunity. So we are expecting to increase the level of investment. But as we say that, we've always been looking at the balance between maximizing the top line growth with producing profit and are going to continue to operate on that taking advantage of the long-term opportunities. And our next question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Maybe David, I'll direct this to. I was intrigued by your comment that the fourth quarter, the month of October was off to a healthy start understanding that that's just a month. But just curious if you could unpack that a little bit, largely because investors on this call, we are picking up signals from other tech firms that would suggest a still very tough macro environment or maybe even slightly tougher. So I'm just curious where you might be seeing pockets of strength, if you could add a little more color. Yes. I think it's just essentially what we try to do in the last couple of quarters is to cushion everybody that we still expect that there will be optimization and cost management, but give everyone a flavor for the direction. And what we're seeing, as I think Olivier and I mentioned, we're seeing the continuation of that but at a more moderated level and that was across the customer base. So we're seeing essentially clients leaning a little more into growth, again, early in the quarter, too early to call it, but the trends seem to be a moderation of the previous cost management and optimization, although it's still continuing. Yes, those color on the -- so yes, we had a healthy start to Q4. We we see trends that are as strong as they've been for the past year in terms of what happened early in the quarter. That being said, Q4 is a tough quarter to call because it has fairly high seasonality. There's a typically a drop of usage in the -- at the very end of the quarter with the holidays. And that drop in different years has been -- can be more or less pronounced. Last year, in particular, it was very pronounced. So we're -- we've given guidance with all that in mind, basically. Let me just add because this question has been talked about. Like last quarter, we didn't take the strength of October account, we took the exact same guidance approach, which was to take the weighted average historical trends and discount apply conservatism. So like last quarter, we had said that the first quarter looked a little more stable. We didn't take that into consideration on our guidance. And we have stuck to the exact same guidance methodology, which is to act with that conservatism. One last thing to -- just to comment on that. Because I know a lot of you are trying to understand how we fit with respect to the Large cap providers and core trends correspond to theirs. Remember that we are -- while our trends are similar in the long run, we, in the short term, there can be differences of timing in terms of when we're going to see certain effects where they're going to see them. We also have a different mix where the mix of cap provider is not exactly the same as the border market and a different mix of customers and geographies than the individual cloud providers as well. So things are not exactly one to one there. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC. And I'll offer my congrats as well. Oli, I wanted to double-click on some of the improved usage trends. Can you provide us with an overview on how some of your large sort of strategic customers think about optimization is really part of an ongoing IT spending strategy, coupled with what's driving some of these increased uses. I guess I'm wondering have IT executives from your perspective changed their view on the level of monitoring needed with new levels of workload? No. So they didn't change if you on the level of monitoring needed. I think they try to save money wherever they could save it. By far, the biggest area they can save in their cloud infrastructure is their cloud deal itself. As a reminder, when customers pay $1 to us, they pay $10 or $20 to their cloud provider. So there's a lot more sales to be had there. But these savings flow down to us. We charge commercial rate to the size of our customers infrastructure. They also tried to save what they could in observability specifically. And usually, there's always a bit of that you can cut. It can always sample certain things a bit more, you can retain your loss a bit less. You can remove some of the debug logging like things like that, that can drive your cost up, but don't necessarily generate a ton of value. And that's the behavior by the way, that we see all the time. Like we see it for most customers, once a year, maybe twice a year, sometimes usually before contract renegotiations and things like that, why they try to understand what they're going to need for the next 2 or 3 years. The big difference over the past year has been that everybody has been doing that at once and multiple times. It was really an environment where everyone was feeling very uncertain about the economy and needed to save money very quickly. So we expect optimization to continue as part of this macro trend in the near future. And in perpetuity after that, we'll have that continuous cycle of customers optimizing reducing what they can reduce and then growing workloads and maybe creating a little bit more mass over time as well. And then optimizing again on a regular basis, not everyone at the same time. And our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of Citi. One for Oli and one for Dave, if I may. Olivier, the packaging and pricing motions that you discussed for the DevSecOps solution set. I wanted to zoom out generally a little bit in knowing what you know about how buying behavior and procurement behavior for a lot of your customers has changed over the course of this past year. I was wondering if you can kind of shed light on how you're thinking about an ELA or EAA-type selling motion. I know it's something that historically you've been averse to, but I'm curious how you're thinking about it in sort of the current day and age, if you will, in terms of how your customers have changed the way they're buying and deploying. And then for David, just wanted to get a sense of what expectations on net retention rates are built into your guidance? And in other words, should this be the quarter that we see a trough in extension rates or net retention rates as you're thinking about it in the guidance? Yes. So on the ELAs, so in general, look, we're always very open to new approaches in packaging. We try to see core things are consumed from the customer side and what makes the most sense to them. Now ELAs and things that are very difficult or very inappropriate for a business like ours. One because we are fully SaaS-based and there's a very, very large volume dimension to absolutely everything we do for our customers. So it's very, very hard to provide one price it all -- for them. We also philosophically, we like to have -- to get signal from what customers are willing are not willing to pay for. And that drives a lot of our product innovation. We had a lot of good news this way because customers want to buy products and they scale them a lot. We'll also get bad news. We get customers who don't find there is enough value in a given product or think it should be doing more or I think you should be doing things differently or seems that the packaging doesn't make sense. And we like to have that. The reason why we simplified the pricing there, and we created those new SKUs is really to try and change the motion a little bit and integrate further the observability in the security side and make it easier to bring security into the conversation for these customers. So far, we have some early evidence that it's it seems to reason it, but it's way where we're too weary to call it. We'll need 2, 3 quarters of that to understand the implications of the new packaging. Yes. And as it relates to net retention, we do not provide guidance, but just the way that we think about it and some of the drivers, we don't provide guidance, sorry, on net retention per se. But essentially, what we said was that Q3 organic growth was similar to what it was in Q1. And we have said previously that in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we had lower than before but higher than the Q1 -- Q4, Q1 and now Q3. So it really is a matter of lapping those comps. The comps have gotten increasingly easy to lap. And we will let everybody know if we do produce an organic growth that's higher this Q4 than it was in Q4 last year, we will have, in this period, trough in net retention and it will begin to head up. So that's sort of how we think about it. In terms of our guidance, that's a different story. As we said, we provide conservatism. So what's implicit in the guidance is something worse than we're experiencing, which would apply a lower organic growth. But in terms of the business trends themselves, it's really a matter of do we lap the Q4 and produce a higher organic growth in this -- in the Q4 coming up than we had in the Q4 last year. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. David, I was curious if you could focus on the enterprise traction and what you're seeing and maybe for Olivier. David, I guess, on the customer add, you're 700 and that's lower than your normal accruals out of 1,000-plus per quarter. Can you just talk about is that number being misled because the enterprise traction is higher and that number is, therefore, going to be lower? Could you just drive into that a little bit? Yes. As a reminder, we have a broad range of customers in the long tail. And similar to what we discussed last quarter, the gross number of ads, so the accumulation and in the enterprise, it was quite strong, was very similar to what we've experienced. And we have a very small tail that has a larger attrition rate doesn't have a lot of dollars attached to it. So the trends continue, which is very strong, as Olivier mentioned, new logo accumulation both in terms of number of new logos and ARR, and that was true when Olivier talk about the enterprise side of it. offset by this tail that has very little dollars associated with it. Yes. And just to comment on that, remember, the bottom half of our customer represents around 1% of our revenue. and the lower increase in customer number comes from the very, very low end, which is customers that pay us in the tens of dollars a month. And those customers we're getting a little bit less of those to start with. I think that's part of the economical environment. and the churn is a little bit higher than it used to be there, too. So that's why these numbers are bit depressed right now. That being said, we had a record number of new logos over $100,000. We're doing very well in the enterprise. We're doing very well in the new market also. We're also doing very well at the high end of the SMB. So we are very happy with all of the segments we're targeting with our sales and marketing motions today. On the enterprise side, we actually mentioned a few of those very exciting contracts on the core. We get really, really excited when we see very traditional enterprises moving to the cloud and adopting us and consolidate in world to all. David, is -- we consider in the room, David's smiling because he's excited when he sees the dental care company is excited when you see the network of convenience stores where we even instrument the fuel pumps. So these are great developments for us, and we're leaning hard into that. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. I'm sure that you're all smiling at your results. Two things. One is -- with respect to LLM monitoring, which was demo the DASH conference, which was I thought absolutely fascinating. I know you quantified, Oli, 2.5 percentage points of growth coming from general AI workloads. How do we think about the revenue opportunity for LL monitoring that it's at an early stage? And I also have a second question, slightly more controversial that when and if we run it to customers that think they're spending their bills for Datadog are getting to be a little bit on the larger side, that is a sign of success. But how do you ensure that, that success does not work against the company that it opens up the door for price competition from others? Yes. So on the DevSecOps side, I think it's too early to tell how much the revenue opportunity there is in the tooling specific lab there. When you think of the whole spectrum of tools, the closer you get to the developer side to how are is to monetize and the further you get towards operations and infrastructure, the easier it is to monetize. You can ship things that are very useful and very accretive to our platform because they get you a lot of users, a lot of attention and a lot of stickiness that are harder to monetize. So we'll see where on the spectrum that is. What we know, though, is that broader Generative AI up and down the stack from the components themselves, the GPUs all the way up to the models and the various things that are used to orchestrate them and store the data and move the data around all of that is going to generate a lot of opportunity for us. We said right now, it's conciliated among the AI native largely model providers. But we see that it's going to broaden and concern a lot more of our customers down the road. And your second question was, so when we grow a lot, we are very successful with some customers, how do we not create a long-term issue where they spend a lot of money and that [indiscernible]. Look, it's a great situation to be in to have customers spend a lot of money on you and have to justify that value over time. I think it's very healthy. I think that, again, that would drive innovation and great product development. And our role there is to make sure we have a healthy partnership with customers every single step of the way. And we charge them an order of money to less than what they spend for their cloud infrastructure. Maybe two others are many to less than would spend on their R&D. And so we think we should be in a position of leverage where if we do our jobs right, we show a lot of value for our customers. We send them a lot of money. We make them a lot faster, and we have them generate a lot more revenue. So that's how we see things and we hold ourselves to. And our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just two quick ones for me. Olivier, you mentioned the federal opportunity or you mentioned the federal activity in the quarter with a deal that was pretty interesting. That's something that we picked up is an area of excitement for you guys. Can you maybe just talk about what the opportunity there is over the next 12 months and beyond, maybe stack-ranked as a priority for you guys. And then I've got a quick follow-up. So I missed the domain you're talking about, sorry. Feds. So that's definitely an area of investment for us. It's -- to look, we're happy with 2 things happening with the fact that we're moving further and further into the various level of certifications needed. We're happy with the early success with some agencies where we are spreading and in those government agencies and getting to go some of those world to all. But we are only scratching the surface of what we can do inside and there's a level we need to do. Some of it on the certification side, on the product side, and some of it on the go-to-market side and making sure we have all the parts of the motion working. So we -- I expect that to be one of the main areas of investment on the go-to-market side. Next year in terms of new markets we're going after. Perfect. And then maybe on the -- back on the AI question. I guess maybe just we drill a little bit deeper within those AI native companies, the criticality of their database users, meaning are you seeing something different where -- in a world where these applications become more prevalent, there's the opportunity to kind of expand wallet share of observability becomes even more important. And how should we think about the growth opportunities from those types of workloads in either 2024 or 2025? Yes. So in general, the more complexity there is, the more useful observability, the more you see his value from writing code to actually understanding it and observing it. So to caricature if you -- if you spend a whole year writing 5 lines of code that are really very deep, you actually know those 5 lines pretty well, maybe you don't observe because you'll see you understand exactly how they work and what's going on with them. On the other hand, if thanks to all the major advances of technology and all of the very super source AI and you can just very quickly generate thousands of lines of code, ship them and start operating them, you actually have no idea hwo these work what they do. And you need a lot of tooling observability to actually understand that and keep driving that and secure it and do everything you need to do with it over time. So we think that overall, this increases in productivity are going to favor observability.. In terms of the future growth of AI, look, I think like everyone, we're trying to guess how transformative it's going to be. It looks like it's going to be pretty is, if you judge from just internally, how much of that technology we are adopting a how much is the productivity impact, it seems to be having. So again, today, we only see a tiny bit of it, which is early adoption by model providers and a lot of companies that are trying to scale up and experiment and figure out who it applies to their businesses and what they can ship to use the technology. But we think it's going to drive a lot of growth in the years to come. And our next question comes from Jake Roberge of William Blair. Congrats on the great results. Olivier, you called out the 2.5 points from AI native customers a few times, but you've also said that the broader customer base should start adding AI workloads to our platform over time. When do you think that actually takes place and the broader customer base starts to impact that AI growth in more earnest? We don't know. And I think it's too early to tell. For one part, there's some uncertainty in terms of -- these customers are being to figure out what it is they are going to ship to their own customers. I think everybody is trying to learn that right now and experiment it. And -- but the other part is also that right now, the innovation is largely concentrated among the model providers. And so it's rational right now for most customers to rely on those instead of they're deploying their own infrastructure. Again, we think it's slightly going to change. We see a lot of demand in interest in other ways to host models and run models and customers and all those things like that. But today, that's the -- these are the trends of the market today basically. Okay. Helpful. And then just a follow-up on the optimization front. It sounds like the early optimizers took about a year to complete those initiatives. But what type of time lines are you seeing from kind of the second or third layer of customers that started their optimizations later in the game. Have those also started to stabilize given they weren't as large as the early optimizers? Just trying to kind of parse out the customer base there. Yes. So we don't really know for sure. That's also why we are careful not to call an end to it forever. I would say that for customers that are not part of this initial cohort, there's less of an overhang. So the customers that were the early optimizers and that had the most acute optimization tended to be cloud native, so all in on the cloud, very heavy on IT spend in general and the -- substantially all of their IT being in the cloud. They tended to be also companies that were slightly high growth but low profitability that needed to pivot their financials over a fairly short amount of time. I think if you look at the rest of the customer base, they are mostly not in that situation. So we expect the behavior to be different. Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to CEO, Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for attending the call today. I also want to take the opportunity to thank our customers for their trust. We know these are trying times with all the macro uncertainty and we thank them for their trust. I also want to thank our employees, all the Datadogs for a quarter of hard work and great successes. And on these good words, we'll all get back to work and get busy for the end of the year. So thank you very much. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.","the third quarter 2023 datadog Earnings conference call is being recorded . we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2023 . the words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will .",1.0

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Yuka Broderick. Thank you, Carmen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's fourth quarter 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.
We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a good Q4 to end what has been a very productive year to 2023. Throughout the year, we kept innovating at a fast pace, going broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers. We also continue to add new customers and expand with existing ones, driving both usage growth and adoption of new products. But most of all, I'm very pleased that we mobilize as a company to help our customers get through a -- environment.
We help our customers make more -- use of their cloud and observability leaving them in a better position at the end of the year from which they can focus again on growing their businesses and migrating to the cloud.
Now let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $590 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 27,300 customers up from about 23,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,190 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,780 last year. These customers generated about 86% of our ARR. We had 396 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more compared to the $317 million we had at the end of last year. And we generated free cash flow of $201 million, with a free cash flow margin of 34%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using four or more products, up from 42% a year ago. 22% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 18% a year ago. And as a sign of continued penetration of our platform, 9% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 6% a year ago. And our success with cross product adoption isn't limited to core observability as our newer products continue to gain traction. Note for example, that the ARR for products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and log management grew by more than 75% year-over-year. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, synthetics, RAM and continuous profiler.
During 2023, we continue to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2023, 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 37% last year. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in their journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million, which leaves a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business levers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was similar to Q3. Our usage growth during the quarter paid out roughly as expected, including a strong start in October and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We also note that the greater intensity of optimization we've seen over the past 6 quarters appears to have dissipated. For the last couple of quarters, we have discussed with you a cohort of customers who are optimizing. In Q4, this core usage grew at a faster pace than the broader customer is. We take this as a positive sign.
To be clear, we see optimization activity with our customers every quarter. We expect them to continuously make sure they are using their cloud efficiently, and we'll keep helping them do that. And we do still see attention to costs in certain parts of our customer base. But overall, we see less headwinds than we did a few quarters ago.
Meanwhile, we had a strong book quarter in Q4. Our go-to-market teams delivered our largest annualized bookings since Q1 of '22. And our enterprise team, in particular, executed on a record amount of annualized bookings in Q4. We are also seeing more customers enter into multiyear deals with us, which speaks to a deepening relationships with them as well as customers planning for growth and for the longer term after a period of optimization and uncertainty. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth, but it is an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing as well, and they are growing with us over time.
Finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Moving on to R&D. We released over 400 new features and capabilities during 2023. Of course, that's too much for us to our cover today. But let me speak to a few. In observability, we now have more than 700 integrations allowing our customers to benefit from the latest AWS, Azure and GCP abilities as well as from the newly emerging AI stack. We continue to see increasing engagement there with the use of our next-gen AI integrations growing 75% sequentially in Q4.
In the generative AI and -- space, we continue to add capability to beef AI or natural language incident management copilot. And we are advancing AI mobility to help customers investigate where they can safely deploy and manage their models in production. Today, about 3% of our ARR comes from next-gen AI native customers, but we believe the opportunity is far larger in the future as customers of every industry and every size start doing AI functionality in production.
In the APM space, we launched data streams monitoring to monitor queuing, streaming and event-driven pipelines, which is a technically challenging type of workloads APM products have historically struggled to cover. We also rolled out single-step APM onboarding, allowing a single engineer to enable APM across complex applications in minutes. And with dynamic instrumentation, engineers can add logs, metrics and traces to the application on the fly without co-changes or redeployments.
In the digital experience area, we've added heat maps and scroll maps to our reuser monitoring product to show developer and product owners what their users are actually seeing. And our customers can now create synthetic test directly from session replay for which we have received very positive feedback.
And in log management, we continue to expand our capabilities. Starting with Flex Logs, customers can have a very cost-effective way to retain their logs at a very large scale. With air tracking for logs, customers can quickly cut down millions of airlines into a handful of actionable summaries. And our log pipeline scanner allows customers to inspect log events in near real time, building greater visibility into data quality and data governance.
In cloud service management, we made workflow automation generally available enabling customers to easily automate and orchestrate processes across operations and security. And today, we are announcing the general availability of case management to provide engineers with a single view for investigations, ticketing to do items, tasks and follow-ups across the -- platform.
Moving on to cloud security. We kept executing against an ambitious road map and are pleased to now count over 6,000 customers using one or more Datadog security products. This month, we launched software composition analysis to enable our customers to proactively detect and remediate vulnerability before the code gets to production. We announced cloud infrastructure entitlement management to have customers prevent identity and access management security issues.
We shipped cloud SIEM investigator, so customers can conduct deep security investigation using logs over long periods of time. We simplified security operations with our security inbox to allow customers to -- security issues into one single list to investigate media, and we also expanded our data security capabilities. Sensitive data scanner now finding secrets and sensitive data in traces and relevance in relation to logs.
In software delivery, we launched Intelligent Test Runner, which dramatically accelerates the testing process in CICD. And we ship code-quality and security gate to enforce best practices, catch security vulnerabilities and prevent -- tests.
And last, but not least, we delivered on a number of platform-wide initiatives. We launched our latest data center in Japan to have customers comply with local data private laws. We opened up cost create throughout our platform for collaboration in response -- programming and data login. We extended cloud cost management, which is now GA for Azure and will soon be for to GCP to offer a comprehensive view of costs across our customers' cloud footprint. And we announced our intent to achieve -- high and Impact Level 5 authorizations.
So I'd like to thank our product and engineering team for a very productive 2023. And I'm super excited we will have planned for 2024.
Let's go on to sales and marketing. First of all, I'd like to welcome [ Sara Varni ] to the team as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Sara brings more than 15 years of marketing experience centered around developers and enterprise software. And we really look forward to her leadership in this pivotal role.
As I said earlier, we had a very strong close to 2023 with record levels of bookings and some very exciting new logos and expansions. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a 3-year expansion and offers ever [ nine-figure ] TCV deal with a major global fintech company. This expansion brings us into a major new business unit that we were not deployed in before. And this time, the customer focused on bringing end-to-end observability to their mobile applications, and they focus, in particular, on being in front of any user impacting issues to the use of our release monitoring product. With this renewal, this customer expects to use 15 Datadog products, and we'll consolidate what used to be 10 separate tools, including the replacement of 3 commercial products across infrastructure monitoring, APM and RAM.
Next, we signed a seven figure expansion with one of the world's largest restaurant chains. These customer is using AWS Azure, GCP and Oracle Cloud, and they believe Datadog is the only platform that can deliver a consistent experience across all four clouds. With this expansion, the customer plans to deploy Datadog for cloud service management use cases and will expand to a total of 10 Datadog products.
Next, we signed an eight-figure multiyear expansion with a leading European financial services company. This customer is undergoing a large-scale migration to Azure and will expand its use of Datadog across on-prem, private and public cloud. Today, Datadog is used by 3,000 users a month in over 400 teams to monitor 13,000 hosts. With the migration, the Datadog platform usage will expand to more than 1,000 teams and 50,000 hosts. This customer plans to use 14 Datadog products and consolidate more than 10 legacy open source and -- tools.
Next, we signed a seven-figure -- with one of the world's largest food and consumer goods company. This customer wants to be more proactive with risk mitigation and system resilience as they migrate to Azure. They also want to reduce the thousands of hours of engineering time they spent every year in -- This customer brought in Datadog to be the observative foundation of the AOP strategy, in particular, using Watch Dog or incident management capabilities. This new land includes 17 Datadog products. And the customer expects to consolidate at least six commercial observability tools.
Finally, we signed a six-figure land deal with one of the largest U.S. utilities. This customer is rearchitecturing its customer-facing website and replatforming its customer support experience. They identified Datadog as the only platform that could still integrate end-to-end with their existing sales, customer experience and workflows. Expect to start with six Datadog products, and they will displace two commercial observability tools in the process.
And that's it for this quarter's highlights. Thanks again, to our go-to-market team for their great work in 2023, an excellent close of the year and ambitious plans for 2024.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, a few words on our longer-term outlook. During 2023, we continue to execute on our product innovation plans, and we solve more problems and delivered more value to customers. As we enter 2024, it appears that the worst of cloud optimization may be behind us.
We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motion for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. We see AI adoption as an additional driver of investment and accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration. And more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to achieve our goals and help customers of every size in every industry to transform, innovate and drive value to technology adoption.
With that, I will turn it over to David. Thanks, Olivier. Q4 revenue was $590 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q4 performance, first, regarding usage growth. Overall, we saw usage growth from existing customers in Q4 that was similar to what we saw in Q3. Last quarter, we mentioned that the larger and more intense optimizers had begun to show signs of stabilization. In Q4, we saw those trends continue and the large optimizers begin to grow again.
While we may still be in a cost-conscious environment overall, we believe that the higher intensity of optimization has dissipated and clients are continuing to invest in new digital applications.
For the first time in 6 quarters, our sequential ARR adds in Q4 were higher than in the year-ago quarter. As we look at early data for Q1, January usage growth was solid. The rebound we're seeing from the slower end of December is better than what we experienced last January. We -- always that it's too early to know how the quarter will play out, and we would caution investors from extrapolating too much but we're encouraged by the near-term trend.
Regarding usage growth by customer size, we experienced our highest growth in our largest and smaller spending customers in this quarter. This includes a record increase in sequential ARR added from customers who spend $1 million or more annually with us and an expansion of 1 million plus customers from 317 to 396 over 2023.
In terms of new logos, our customer additions on a gross and net basis, as well as on a new dollar -- a new logo dollar basis were similar to that of Q3. As before, our net adds included slightly elevated churn in our very long tail of small customers, many of whom are self-service.
Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets in North America. Our international markets represented 31% of our revenue in Q4 2023, up from 28% in Q4 of last year.
Finally, for our retention metrics. Our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-110s in Q4. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s. And our dollar churn is low and declined sequentially.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $723 million, up 35% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.84 billion, up 74% year-over-year. Current RPR growth was in the mid-40s percent year-over-year.
We are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. We welcome the opportunity to have these longer-term strategic partnerships with our clients. And we see that once customers are farther along in their optimizations, they feel comfortable committing over longer periods of time in the future.
As we said before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some of our key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
First, gross profit in the quarter was $492 million, representing a gross margin of 83.4%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.3% last quarter and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency products -- projects.
Our Q4 OpEx grew 10% year-over-year, a decline from 17% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, while making meaningful investments in 2023, we were more cautious than in previous years given the macro condition and focused more on efficiency and optimization. We believe this will put us in a good position to accelerate investment in 2024 while maintaining margin discipline.
Q4 operating income was $167 million, or a 28% operating margin, up from 24% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter. As with last quarter, our margins ended up being higher than we expected in Q4 as we executed well on our internal optimization and cost management efforts.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter at $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $201 million with a free cash flow margin of 34%.
Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $591 million, which represents a 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $128 million to $132 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 35 -- 357 million of average diluted shares outstanding.
For fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.555 billion to $2.575 billion, which represents 21% -- 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $535 million to $555 million, which implies an operating margin of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.44 per share based on 361 million average shares diluted outstanding.
Some additional notes on guidance as it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring. As I mentioned earlier, we took a more cautious attitude towards hiring during 2023. And our headcount ended fiscal 2023 at about 5,200 people growing in the high single digits year-over-year. We remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. And as a result, our operating profit guidance reflects our intent to invest for future growth in 2024.
We intend to accelerate hiring in R&D to execute on our long-term growth opportunities and in sales and marketing to reach customers worldwide. Because of that, our operating profit guidance implies operating expense growth in the mid-20% range year-over-year, with operating expense year-over-year growth ramping throughout 2024 as we execute on our hiring plans. Meanwhile, we will continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial discipline as we have executed in the past.
Now turning to other areas of the P&L. First, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Regarding taxes, while we expect to continue to be a modest cash payer in 2024, estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, we are establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal year 2024 and going forward. And this is reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance.
We have recasted our fiscal 2022 and '23 non-GAAP net income to reflect this non-GAAP tax rate, and that is available in the tables in our earnings release as well as the financial supplemental. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal year 2024.
Now to summarize. We are pleased with our execution in 2023. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And we plan to innovate further and expand the set of problems we solve for our customers in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2023, and I'm excited about our plans in 2024.
Finally, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Investor Day this Thursday in New York City. Please go to the Datadog IR website for the live stream or contact the IR team at ir@datadoghq.com to attend in person.
And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Congrats on the great bookings results to end the year. Oli, as we sort of come out of this sort of down cycle, reflecting the optimization cycle that we've seen for the last several quarters, I was wondering how you think about where the sources of growth are going to come from in terms of your various customer reports. I'm thinking about the digital natives, which drove a lot of growth in 2019, 2020 and '21 versus your enterprise opportunity and your mid-market customers. As we come out -- go into sort of the next cycle, where does that dollar growth do you think comes from for Datadog? Well, it's a good question. I would say, pretty much all of the above. I think the -- it's always a little bit hard to time the cycles for specific subsets of the customer base as various macro conditions rip off with the economy that the asset various -- different parts of our customer base. We suddenly saw a big slowdown from the digital native over the past year. On the other hand, they might be the first ones to fully leverage AI and deploy it in production. So you might see some reacceleration earlier from some of them at least.
If you zoom at a little bit our focus over the past few years has been on really going to market aggressively on the enterprise, the mid-market, the more traditional side of the world that still has to largely gas -- carry to the cloud. We've planted a lot of seeds there with a number of large companies that still have relatively small deployments in the cloud. And our focus over the next couple of years is going to be to grow them and obviously landed ones we still don't have.
We mentioned on the call about 42% of the Fortune 500 other native customers, and they're still largely small, like a few hundred thousand dollars a year spent on us. So that's what we direct our efforts. And I appreciate that thought. And one quick follow-up. When you get customers adopting almost 10% of the base, eight or more products and the number of customers you highlighted in your script had over 10-plus products, how are those deals being structured? Meaning that are they buying sort of individual SKUs at a time and sort of adding them on over time? Or are they being folded into a sort of like a rate card agreement or an enterprise licensing? Just how that pricing and packaging works for customers that get up to that level of adoption. So in general, what we do is when we do these larger multiproduct or consolidation deals, we have a specific rate card and customers -- and total fund commitment and customers can allocate the funds in real time to the products they need when they them, which, by the way, gives them a lot of flexibility they don't have when they have to manage like five different vendors for different parts of that coverage.
There are some exceptions. There are some customers that have such a specific and large volume requirement for one product in particular. Typically, this would be things like logs or maybe metrics and things like that, where they get specific commitments in place around specific products. But in general, most customers have a lot of flexibility when they take this comments with us.
And we'll see -- we'll show some examples also at the Investor Day. I have -- the mix of spend can change over time with customers while we expand and cover more and more of the environment. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. David, the billings growth accelerated 5 points. It was also seasonally stronger than a year ago. And just eyeballing the CRPO figure, it's a pretty massive number. Is that strong bookings performance more tied to a small number of mega deals coming from your cloud data? Or did you feel that it was kind of a broader phenomenon across the multiple verticals? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. There's a couple of aspects. First of all, given the sort of renewal cycle, Q4 tends to have more recommitments. So I think if you look back, you'll see that we tend to have nice billings growth. But in terms of where, it really was correlated with larger customers who as Oli mentioned, are buying a more complete suite of Datadogs. It wasn't cloud native or not cloud native. It was our customers who have standardized on Datadog, have a good sense of their volumes and have committed longer resulting in a longer average billing and contract duration in Q4 than we have had previously. And really we should emphasize that this is really a change of stance of the customer base compared to last year. So last year, customers where in optimization mode. They didn't know what their consumption should look like. They didn't know economically what they were shooting for as business is.
After a year of optimization, a year of examining everything -- I mean, we see customers recommit for much longer periods of time than they did before as they focus on growing and investing. So it's a -- we like the set up a lot more than we did last year from that perspective. And you see that in the billings numbers. Yes, that's very encouraging. And just as a follow-up, if you think about the very long term, would you think attach rates of observability will end up being higher or lower for these AI workloads versus traditional workloads? Because on the surface, with AI, it's bringing the risk of [ who is nations ] and bias, your products help to control that. It's also more computationally intensive and there's more value to unlock if the LLM runs reliably and creates that kind of great user experiences. So I'm just wondering how you might think about that attach rate 3 to 5 years down the road. Yes, we see the attach rate going up. The reason for that is our framework -- for that is actually in terms of complexity. AI just adds more complexity. You create more things faster without understanding what they do. Meaning you need, you shift a lot of the value from building to running, managing and understanding, securing all the other things that need to keep happening after that.
So the shape of some of the products might change a little bit because the shape of the software that runs it changed a little bit, which is not different from what happened over the past 10, 15 years. But we think it's going to drive more need for observability, more need for security products around that. And congrats. [Operator Instructions] And it's from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Congrats from me as well. I have two quick questions. First for Olivier and then one for David. Olivier, if I think about some of your customers have some very, very large contracts. But then you talked earlier about like if you look at the average kind of large customer is still relatively small in terms of their spending with you. Can you speak a little bit about difference between one and the other? And then what you can do to kind of change that for those that are not spending as much with you? And then also maybe as part of that, like is the competitive landscape changing with all the consolidation in the space of some of your larger competitors actually kind of being in a new home now?
And then for David, any little more yardstick in terms of like how the timing of the investments play out this year? I know you mentioned a comment that like -- is there more sales and marketing earlier in the year to get the [ sealed guys ] ramped in the latter part of the year. But -- so how should we think about that modeling? So I'll start with the large companies that are still small customers. That's completely due to them being small in the cloud today. And so typically, they have maybe 1 of their business units, 2 of their business units in the cloud with some fraction of the applications there. The goal is to have them consolidate on us as they move more into the cloud. So go end-to-end in a specific business unit and then expand to the whole enterprise at the end.
The difference between a customer that, like the ones we mentioned today that signs a nine-figure deal with us and the customer that's still a low hundreds of thousands of dollars, is that the one that has the fact that large deal has us pretty much wall-to-wall in a significant part of their business and has consolidated a large part of their observability. I should say, the customer that pays us nine figures still hasn't consolidated everything on us with there still more upside to be had, more parts of their businesses, more parts of their coverage we can get.
The good news is that all of that business is coming to us as these customers move into the cloud. The bad news is that we don't drive the move to the cloud, right? So in periods where it goes a little bit more slowly than we've seen over the past year, that growth can be a little bit lower. But we are very confident into the fact that this is going to happen. AI is going to accelerate. It's quite executive and more relevant. And that's the trend that's going to stay with us for the next few years.
On the competition side, there's no real change. I think I would say very boring from a competitive perspective in that the situation is pretty much the same as it was last quarter and the quarter before. There's definitely opportunity with a number of companies, including one -- has been sold. I'm sure everybody has seen. Because we're not competitors, we were seeing very often on the cloud side of the world already. I think these commuters have retreated a bit more to the traditional on-prem bread and butter but we think it is going to open more opportunity in the midterm, definitely. So that's something we are aware of. Yes. And on your second question, much of this growth is related to hiring, which takes time to do. We are trying to invest both in quota capacity, in terms of sales as well as in R&D capacity. Our intent is to open the heads earlier in the year in order to try to get return in the near term. But I think you can assume that, that investment will ramp throughout the year because it takes time to get the headcount in. And we gave the guidance for Q1 indicating what we think to happen in Q1. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Ray McDonough with Guggenheim. . Maybe first for Oli -- or maybe, David. As you think about the investments you're making to the sales force and your hiring capacities, are there any changes you're making to your go-to-market motion are you adding incremental overlay sales forces for security or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of changes to the go-to-market motion? There's no change at scale that we done worth noting on this call. We made a lot of adjustments in the way we say all the time. We make adjustments in the we package our products. For example, we package some of our security products directly into our infrastructure and APM products. We have a new tier called DevSecOps for both APM and infrastructure, and these are great ways for us to actually bring those products into the conversation, make them easier for customers -- cover and also make them easier for the sales force to bring up and to sell. And we see we're actually starting to see great succes with that. So still very early, obviously, because we've all that up last quarter, but we like what we see with those SKUs.
More broadly, we're investing in the sales force. We're increasing capacities. We've increased capacity last year, even though it was a slowdown year in the economy and we have plans to increase the capacity in this year. And we think there's plenty more markets for us to be had, both in terms of the -- inside the segments in which we're already very present, but also in a number of new categories -- sorry, new segments of the market, new geographies that we don't cover very well yet. Maybe just as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit more about your pipeline construction. Specifically, how are larger opportunities weighted in your pipeline at this point? You talked a lot about more multiyear deals. You talked about kind of the construction of billings and CRPO. But maybe alongside that, can you talk about how long it takes typically to close an opportunity like the nine-figure deal you mentioned? Obviously, your go-to-market motion is more of land and expand motion, but I'm just wondering if as you see larger opportunities in your pipeline, deals may be taking a little longer to close still than typically. Yes. Because of the way we do business, where we try to land fast and small, we expand after that on an ongoing basis. We don't really -- we haven't seen -- even in last year, what's been a tougher year for most sales organizations, we haven't seen an elongation of sales cycles. It remained very, very stable.
In general, we always felt at our sales pipelines were very solid -- As a CEO, when I start the quarter, I can trust what I see in the pipeline in the forecast is going to materialize at the end of the quarter. It typically grows during the quarter, it doesn't go down. So it speaks, I think, to the quality of the work the CF team is doing and the path of the motion we have put in place.
When you talk about this specific customer, like a -- that pays us 8 or 9 figures, these deals are growth deals. They are expansion deals. And so we get those deals by making those customers successful over the last period of time and then engaging with their teams as we ship new products, making sure they get their hands on these products. And by the time we get to have a sales conversation, typically, the usage is there. The customers have tried the product. They understand them. They've spoken to our product teams about them or support teams about them. And then it's more a matter of understanding how we package that commercially and how we make a good case for it with the customer including understanding what other products they might retire as part of that.
When you think of sales times for brand-new customers, the time it takes is highly dependent on the size of the land. Most of our lands are small and can go very fast, which is for a large enterprise, it could be a quarter or 2, which is very short for an enterprise deal; could be longer for some larger deals. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. And Oli, I wanted to dig into your comments on security. I think you mentioned that you have 6,000 customers that are now using one or more security product. Can you give us a little bit more color. First of all, who is the buyer usually do you see for these solutions initially?
And then second, maybe you can kind of parse out a little bit more color on ranking order kind of the more popular versus least popular security products right now? Would love to get more color on that. Yes. So the buyers, it depends. For infrastructure security and application security, this tends to be the DevOps teams that start buying with some involvement on the security teams on their end. For our cloud SIEM product, the buyer tends to be the security team. So we have a little bit of both. And it turns out we're successful in both ends. So those types of products are growing in a similar way.
The focus has been over the past year on developing the products, getting them to maturity, getting them into the hands of as many customers as possible and also getting as much usage of those products as possible. So the metrics we look at internally with our security products are even more than the revenue which can buy with usage and things like that. We look at the activity. How many of those customers are actually using the product, how many issues are being tracked are being solved for the products. And these are the North Stars we use internally as we develop those products. Got it. And then as a follow-up, maybe just to dig into this a little more. When customers buy these, I mean, how often is it, there's a vacuum there. There's no solution versus a displacement? Or how often do you kind of sit -- solutions to do the same thing like in the same way the companies had multiple monitoring solutions? Will they just have same security solutions from other vendors? Or this is a complete replacement or greenfield? Would love to get more color on that. Yes. In most situations, we started by side with other things because customers are going to have other security solutions, and they typically have a patchwork of a lot of different things, which is not very different from the situation when we started selling our infrastructure and APM products, I would say, 7, 8, 10 years ago. So very similar.
The customers that spend more with us, so we have a number of customers that spend more than $1 million a year with us on security because a large number of customers has spent more than $100,000 a year with us in security. Those tend to use less other products and consolidate more into what we do. And obviously, the playbook here is the same for us as it has been for observability.
By the way, you did ask me to stack rank the security products. Didn't forget about that. It's easy in order of introduction. Like the cloud team has the most usage and was introduced first and then the other products are still below that. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham. I guess first, a question for David. Again, just coming back to the guidance here. Wanted to get some more color, if we could, on December into January. So it's great to hear that January this year seems to be trending better than the seasonal drop that we saw in January of last year. Just wanted to get a better sense. The holidays seemed to play out the way that you guys expected but can you provide some more color or parameters on that December holiday slowdown and then how that is playing out in January versus where we stand today in mid-February? Yes. As you said, we've seen, and we've tried to flag at the second half of December, we have a slowdown of usage, particularly in our sort of our more use oriented products like logs. It played out very similarly to what we expected. And I think we caution everybody, it's too narrow of a data point. But the bounce back from that and the growth in January was stronger than the bounce back last year, and we'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out. And in general, I think we -- throughout the rest of the company, we've seen a slowdown in December, I mean for good reasons, like this also environments get turned out of developers some companies close shop altogether for 1 week at the end of the year. So we -- it's become more pronounced signing last year, I think, because companies put -- wanted to see some cost control and maybe they automate some processes to downscale or -- things done at the end of the year. And this year was consistent with last year.
It's hard to compare year-to-year exactly because some of that, for example, depends on which of the week the holidays are or in terms of how much the impact of usage. But overall, what we saw was very -- with what we had last year. Understood. I do appreciate the additional color. And just for a quick follow-up here. I know that you guys are citing the expanded penetration of the Fortune 500, and it's great to hear the five points of pickup when you think about the 42% of Fortune 500 customers using it today. Wanted to get a better sense. I know you guys are saying that, I guess, those customers on average are still spending less than $500,000 with you. So I know it's a bit of a point in time here, but two-parter. First, can you help us think about if you had 37% of the Fortune 500 last year and 42% this year, like how has that average spend per customer within the Fortune 500 increased over the last year?
And then the second part of that question is, if the 42% of Fortune 500 customers with you are on average under $500,000 at this point, where does Datadog ultimately sees that opportunity going to -- just given -- I know you guys are talking about the 400 new features and capabilities launched in the last year, but where does that spend increase to over time? Just to give you -- we're not sort of giving specific data on the expansion of that group. We have -- if you look at our larger customers and you just look at the trend over time, you can see that in the land and expand model, we have had an increase of average customer size with us in the group over $100,000. And we said previously that we have customers in the tens of millions. We have those customers within the Fortune statistic as well as outside. And so we said in the past that we see buying patterns in the tens of millions. We think that in many of the larger, more traditional enterprises, they're just getting started, and there's a lot of upside is what we're trying to communicate. Yes. And definitely, actually, customer on the Fortune 500, that's in the hundred of thousands should be in the millions to tens of millions with us in the end. There's no question about that. . [Operator Instructions] And it's from the line of Frederick Havemeyer with Macquarie Capital. I wanted to ask a bit more of a forward-looking technological question here, perhaps to Oli. There's been quite a lot of, at this point, let's say, testing development, but a lot of interesting development with like autonomous agents for DevOps-related task. So I'm curious, as you're considering the opportunity and potentially some of the risks also around generative AI and perhaps like -- usage of large language models, how are you thinking that Datadog is positioned strategically, both from a and perhaps pricing perspective around this technology. We think we're ideally positioned for that. It's actually going to say, if you attend our Investor Day, like we'll share some of our thinking on the topic. But we -- so we've been actively building on our Bits AI assistant. We've been interacting with customers based on that. There's a number of ways for us to build on that and to do more to automate work for our customers, and that's something we're working on. And we also see a lot of demand and expectations on the customer side for incorporating generative AI in the product.
So I think from a positioning perspective, we feel great about that. We don't have much more to share today, but we are just definitely top of mind. Sorry, I don't mean to ask about the Investor Day too early here. So look forward to that this week. Just quickly then also, I understand the perspective on complexity driving more usage of observability and DevOps tooling. But I think last quarter, we got an update on where GenAI-related operations were contributing to the business. Would you have into Q4, any data or as you could share about how much generative AI use cases are contributing? Yes, we said -- so we said 3% of our ARR comes from the AI native companies. And look, it's hard for us to wrap our arms exactly around what you generate, what is not among our customer base and their workload. So the way we chose to do it is we looked at a smaller number of companies that we know are substantially all based on AI so these occupants like the modal providers and things like that. So the 3% of ARR, which is up from what we had disclosed last time.
I know one number that everyone has been thinking about is one cloud, in particular, Microsoft disclosed that 6% of their growth was attributable to AI. And we definitely see the benefits of that on -- too. If I look at our Azure business in particular, there is substantially more than 6% that is attributable to AI native as part of our Azure business. So we see completely the -- this trend is very true for us as well. It's harder to tell with the other cloud providers because they're done very good numbers up. And congrats on a good quarter. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. I would like to actually double-click on this kind of from ARR from kind of AI native companies. I mean my question is, like, are the product SKUs, these kind of GenAI companies are adopting? Are they similar? Or are they different to the kind of other customer cohorts?
And then I guess when I think about GenAI, I think we can all agree that these are pretty -- typically pretty computerly intensive workloads. So how does GenAI -- how do these companies kind of impact the financial model in -- versus traditional kind of your other customer cohorts? Is there any kind of differences to call out? Yes. There's not many differences today. I think -- and today, this is largely the same SKUs as everybody else. These are infrastructure, APM logs profiling these kind of things that they're -- or release are monitoring these kind of things that these customers are using.
It's worth noting that they're in a bit of a separate world because they're largely the builders of the models. So all the tooling required to understand the models and -- that's less applicable to them. That's more applicable to their own customers, which is also the rest of our customer base. And we see also where we see the bulk of the opportunity in the longer term, not in the handful of model providers that anybody is going to use.
In terms of the economics, look, we -- so there's two parts to the AI workloads today. There's training and there's inference. The vast majority of the players are training. There's only a few that are scaling with inference. The ones that are scaling with -- are the ones that are driving our ARR because we are -- we don't -- we're not really present on the training side, but we're very present on the inference side.
And I think that also lines up with what you might see from some of the cloud providers, where a lot of the players or some of the players that are scaling the most are on Azure today on the inference side, whereas a lot of the other players still largely trading on some of the other clouds. Okay. Very helpful. I guess the other question I want to touch on is, for me, the standout comments from your prepared remarks that were just fascinating were about the kind of intensity of optimization having dissipated. I think you also called out the headwinds over the last few quarters have slowed materially, which is really great to hear.
I guess with that in mind, looking at the guidance, the guidance for 4Q was 22%. The guidance for 1Q is the same. And for the fiscal year is 21% growth. So I guess, just help us understand the puts and takes between the commentary about kind of optimization having dissipated and guidance and what kind of the levers you pulled thinking about that guidance? Yes. We stick to our guidance for guidance, which is our practice is we look at the trends for the past 2 quarters, we discount them and we carry that forward. This is where we build guidance.
The beauty of our model is that it is usage driven and we benefit from the move to the cloud of our customers and the way they care. The only problem with that is that we do not drive that, and it is hard to time it. It's hard to understand if the customers have the intent to scale and they want open the application, it's hard to time it to understand whether it's going to be next quarter or 2 quarters from now. So that's why we look at the past trends, and we try not to think too hard about what we hope might happen in the near term. Obviously, we're in a much stronger set than we were last year, though. Yes. I think if you repeat in a little bit different words, what Oli said. I think if you look at our history, we always take the most recent performance trends and discount that. So even if we are seeing improvement what we do in our guidance in conservatism, again, because of the consumption model, is we do discount that. So that would be consistent with what we've done throughout our history as a public company. Yes. And just to give you a better example, like we had a number of customers signed large long-term commitments with us that are well above their current level of consumption. But we do not know when those commitments are going to turn into revenue. We trust that they will, customers -- will. They spend a lot of time with the past thinking about optimizing and what they actually needed and where they were going in the future, where I think they are less prone to overcommitting that they might have been a couple of years ago. But again, we do not -- we cannot call that to the revenue yet. Our last question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO. Congratulations on a solid set of results for the quarter. I'll ask my question jointly. And could you talk about, first, how you see the net retention rate unfolding for the year. And I realize that's a backward-looking metric. But I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that as we progress through the year even directionally.
And the second broader question is about diversification. One of the interesting stats you gave was growth of outside of your core APM and infra growing 75%. Just is there any metrics you can give on what percent of that is your base? Or how we should be thinking about the diversification of the portfolio? In my opinion, Datadog has certainly the broadest portfolio in the category. I'm just wondering how that diversity is contributing to your growth as we look out? Again, if I'm pulling from the Investor Day, then I apologize. Yes. So we do not provide guidance on net retention. I think we said that for the first time in Q4, we had more ARR add than we had in the year-ago quarter, and that would indicate the stabilization of net retention, but do not provide guidance. It's all incorporated revenue guidance.
As far as platform, yes, totally we've given a number of metrics about this. Remember, last quarter, we talked about the three pillars, and we said that we had essentially the $1 billion, $500 million and that's been a huge driver.
In terms of this metric, this is in addition to that, a metric that the expansion, as you said, of the platform is further than those three pillars and is an additional product and is a significant driver of our growth. I will say though, having the growth portfolio of product was really helped with this consolidation deals in particular. Sometimes -- maybe a couple of products are only going to get us $100,000 each as part of a $5 million deal. But having those two products help to customer rationalize what they have on the other hand -- million dollars and have made the case for the other $4.8 million of the deal. So it's really -- the platform as a whole really has a strong impact beyond the revenue of some of the individual products. And with that, we conclude the Q&A session for now. I will turn it back to Olivier Pomel for final comments. Thank you. Again, I want to thank you, everyone for everyone at Datadog for a great year, all of our customers for going through a -- I know it was a tougher time for them as well. Actually very exciting what was coming in 2024. I think we have a great setup from a customer perspective, a great lineup on the product side and we expect to build. So thank you all. And thank you all for joining our call today.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Marvin. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's First Quarter 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.
We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution at the start of 2024. First, we have continued to broaden our platform across observability, cloud security, software delivery as well as closing the loop with cloud service management. We also kept supporting our customers' adoption of new technologies including next-gen AI and large language models. And we have continued to add new customers and to see existing customers increase their usage growth and product adoption.
Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. Revenue was $611 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,000 customers, up from about 25,500 last year. We had about 3,340 customers, with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,910 last year. These customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $187 million, with a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 43% a year ago. 23% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 19% a year ago. And 10% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 7% last year.
We continue to see robust growth in our 3 pillars of observability: Infrastructure monitoring, APM and log management. But we also have many younger products that are becoming more meaningful contributors to our business over time. For example, our products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and Log Management exceeded $200 million in ARR in Q1. And as a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler. And as we look at the 12 products that we launched between 2020 and 2022, those now contribute about 11% to our ARR.
Of those 12 products, 8 are over $10 million in ARR, which is a nice milestone for these relatively new additions. And we are seeing some products grow faster than we initially expected. For example, Database Monitoring is already 1% of our revenue with strong and growing product penetration across our customer base. So we are very pleased with the progress of our newer products, even though we know we have much further to go with them.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q1, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than in Q4. And this usage growth in Q1 was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. As a reminder, that was a period when we started to see a normalization of usage following the accelerated growth we had experienced in 2021. Overall, we saw healthy growth across our product lines. And as usual, our newer products grew at a faster rate from a smaller base.
While some of our customers are continuing to be cost conscious, we are seeing optimization activity reduce in intensity. As an illustration, the optimizing cohort we identified several quarters ago did grow sequentially again this quarter. We also see that customers are adopting more products and increasing usage with us. We think this shows that they are moving forward with their cloud migration and digital transformation plans, and that we are executing on opportunities to consolidate point solutions into our platform.
And finally, churn continues to be low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Moving on to R&D. We had another very productive quarter. In the next-gen AI space, we announced general availability of Bits AI for incident management. By using Bits AI for incident management, incident responders get auto-generated incident summaries to quickly understand the context and scope of a complex incident. And users can also query Bits AI to ask about relative incidents and perform tasks on the fly from incident creation to resolution.
We're also continuing to see more interest in AI from our customers. As a data point, ARR for our next-gen AI customers was about 3.5% of our total, a strong sign of the growing ecosystem of companies in this area.
To help customers understand AI technologies and bring them into production applications, our AI integrations allow customers to put their AI data into the Datadog platform. And today, about 2,000 of our customers are using 1 or more of these AI integrations. And we've continued to keep up with the rapid innovation in this space. For example, adding a new integration in Q1 with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.
In the cloud service management area, we released Event Management in general availability. Our customers face increasing complexity at scale, causing the volume of alerts and events to explode, which makes it difficult for teams to identify, prioritize, summarize and route issue to the right responders. Event Management addresses this challenge by automatically reducing a massive volume of events and alerts into actionable insights. These are then used to generate tickets, call an incident or trigger an automated remediation.
And by combining Event Management with Watchdog, Bits AI and Workflow Automations, Datadog now provides a full AIOps solution that helps teams automate remediation, proactively prevent outages and reduce the impact of incidents.
In the observability space, our Log Management product continues to expand in capability. In March, we made error tracking for logs generally available. Error tracking intelligently combines millions of errors from logs into a manageable number of issues for customers. And beyond error tracking, we are delivering new features to allow our customers to do more with their logs within the Datadog platform, starting with new core capabilities such as enhanced full-text search and support for advanced subqueries, both highly desired by our customers.
We also continue to make progress with Flex Logs. As a reminder, Flex Logs allow customers to easily scale storage and compute separately which in turn allows for new, very high-volume use cases in a cost-effective manner. While Flex Logs remains in limited availability, we are seeing a high level of interest from customers, many of whom want to retain logs for long-term purposes such as audit, security and compliance. And we're pleased to see that with only a limited set of customers so far, Flex Logs already exceed $10 million in ARR today.
In the digital experience area, we launched mobile app testing in general availability, giving access to fast, no code, reliable testing on real mobile devices, which was a big challenge for customers given the wide range of devices and operating systems in use by consumers. And in Cloud Cost Management, we've added full support for Google Cloud, so FinOps and DevOps teams can optimize their cloud spend across their AWS, Azure and GCP footprint. Cloud Cost Management is another of our newer products that exceeds the $10 million ARR milestone, and we believe there's significantly more opportunity for us to have our customers there.
As usual, I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for the quarter, and I'm looking forward to the many announcements we'll make at our DASH user conference in late June, here in New York.
Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We've been pleased to once again add some exciting new customers and expand with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we signed a 3-year, 7-figure expansion with a leading online grocery business. This customer has used Datadog as their platform of choice for several years now. And as they migrate to Azure, they are looking to ensure reliability and security as they deploy at scale. With this renewal, they are adding Cloud Security Management, Application Security Management and Cloud SIEM to enable a shift to a DevSecOps culture in the organization. And this customer expects to add 7 products for a total of 14 across the Datadog platform.
Next, in 2 deals over the past 6 months, we had a 7-figure expansion with a medical device company. This customer was primarily using our infrastructure monitoring and APM suite, but its legacy logging solution was becoming cost prohibitive, while the lack of correlation across siloed teams was causing frustration and higher times to resolution. With this expansion, the customer plans to add up 9 products and consolidate its log management tool as well as 4 other commercial and cloud-native tools into Datadog.
Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with an athletic apparel company. This company had a dozen disparate monitoring tools, which wasted time and was impacting operations, revenue and customer experience. With this expansion, the company plans to consolidate out of 4 commercial and open-source point solutions. They also expect to save millions of dollars over the next several years, while providing a great consumer experience.
Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with a European division of 1 of the world's largest car makers. This customer has chosen Datadog as its observability vendor in many business units globally. And in Europe, they currently monitor about 1/4 of their applications with us and are migrating hundreds of applications to fully move to Datadog in the next 2 years. With this expansion, this customer is using [ Edge ] products in the Datadog platform.
Next, we signed a 6-figure land with a division of a Fortune 500 industrial company. The company is moving its e-commerce application to Google Cloud. They felt that using on-prem monitoring tools would not transition well to the cloud and are starting with 3 of our products as they are confident in Datadog's ability to keep innovating in modern cloud and serverless environments.
Finally, we signed a 6-figure land with 1 of the world's largest communication infrastructure companies. This company started cloud migration a couple of years ago and found itself limited by fragmented tooling and lack of data correlation. In contrast, the Datadog service catalog gives them a single view for performance, ownership, security, SLOs and KPIs, which customer believes is a unique capability among the vendors it considered, and which aligns with their goal of delivering centralized observability across the business. And this customer is adopting 7 Datadog products initially and consolidating out of 4 tools.
And that's it for another productive quarter for [ mobile ] to market teams.
Let me now say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change in the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing improved usage growth with less impact from optimization than we had seen in the last few quarters. For those customers who are remaining cost focused, we are very happy to help them get value from their observability solutions and consolidate into the Datadog platform to achieve time and cost savings.
Meanwhile, we are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including a growing adoption of AI, which we believe will be an accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration over time. And we're working every day to innovate and help our customers adopt new technologies with confidence and become better businesses in the process.
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? Thanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $611 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, regarding usage growth, in Q1, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers that was higher than the usage growth in Q4. Q1's usage growth was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. And given this steep growth and off a larger base, our sequential ARR dollars added was the highest since Q4 2021. During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that was very typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than January and February.
Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q1, we saw usage growth accelerate across our larger customers, those with $100,000 of annual spend or higher. And we saw particularly strong usage growth with our largest customers who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets than in North America. And finally, for our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-100s in Q1 -- sorry, in the mid-110s in Q1, similar to last quarter. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $618 million, up 21% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Sequential billings growth was seasonally lower as it was in Q1 2023. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.73 billion, up 52% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 40% growth year-over-year. RPO duration increased year-over-year but was down quarter-over-quarter as we saw fewer multiyear deals relative to last quarter.
In general, we are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. As a reminder, our RPO has been and continues to be lumpy, an effect that may be amplified as our customers move towards multiyear deals.
We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
First, gross profit in the quarter was $509 million, representing a gross margin of 83.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.4% last quarter and 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects.
Our Q1 OpEx grew 14% year-over-year and increased from 10% year-over-year growth last quarter. As discussed last quarter, we intend to invest in headcount in 2024, and we have accelerated hiring in sales and marketing and R&D to execute on our growth plans. Q1 operating income was $164 million, or a 27% operating margin compared to 28% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter.
And now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $212 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $187 million for a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million, which represents a 22% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $134 million to $138 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. In Q2, we will be holding our DASH user conference, which we estimate to cost about $11 million. Our operating income guidance reflects this event.
Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $585 million to $605 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.57 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Now for some additional notes on our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and other income together for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $110 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 3% to 4% of revenues in fiscal 2024.
To summarize, we are pleased with how we started 2024. And I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. It was encouraging to see that usage trends continue to improve, at least sequentially Q1 over Q4. I wanted to see if you could put like the usage trends you're seeing in your business in context of like the broader cloud landscape. And we're seeing some really nice results out of the hyperscalers. Obviously, there's -- those are much larger businesses and in different -- can be in different product areas. But when we think about the tailwinds of like cloud migrations and also AI workloads starting to come on board, how does that -- how is that playing out in Datadog's business versus what we may be seeing from like the hyperscales who are -- who seem to be accelerating to a higher degree? Yes. Sanjit, this is Olivier. So I think, in general, it's hard to be -- to do a precise quarter-by-quarter one-to-one mapping between the revenue and the cloud providers and our revenue. I think you pointed out, there are things in their products that don't relate to us directly or things in their internal revenue that don't relate to us directly. We have products that don't tie one-to-one with infrastructure on their end. But in general, over the longer term, we are very exposed to the growth trend you will see with the cloud providers, and the correlation you've seen in the past between our businesses, we expect will remain in some form in the future.
We also are very exposed to the same tailwinds, obviously, cloud migration, but also AI adoption. I will say also on AI adoption that some of the revenue jumps you might see from the cloud providers might relate to supply of GPUs coming online and a lot of training clusters being provisioned. And those typically won't generate a lot of new usage for us. We tend to be more correlative with the live applications, production applications and inference workloads that tend to follow after that, and that are more tied to all of these applications going into production. So these are the things to factor. But overall, same trends, just not a one-to-one timing. That makes complete sense. And I was wondering if you had any comments on how usage trends coming out of March would seem to be stronger than in the beginning of Q1, how that sort of played out in April? Sure. Sanjit, it's David here. As we always say, we try to look into the next month, but that's a small-time set. In this case, the April trends continue to exhibit higher sequential growth rates than the year-ago quarter. But we caution everybody that 1 month does not a quarter make, and we'll continue to update that next quarter as we report. And the seasonality in Q1 was very usual. Every year, there's a drop around the holidays in Q1 and January starts slowly, and then it accelerates into March, and we've seen that pretty much every year so far and we're seeing it this year as well. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Congratulations on the revenue acceleration during the quarter. Olivier, I'm wondering how commonly are customers in your gen AI cohort using Datadog to monitor for bias and hallucinations within their AI models as opposed to just keeping the systems running? And also, do you see more concentration of customers within that cohort? Or is there actually more diversity as more of the models move beyond the training stage and into the inferencing stage? Yes. So we have products for monitoring, not just the infrastructure, but what the LLMs are doing. Those products are still not in GA, so we're working with a smaller number of design partners for that. As I think not only these products are maturing, but also the industry around us is maturing and more of these applications are getting into production. You should expect to hear more from us on that topic in the near future.
The customers we have that are the most scaled on AI workloads are the model providers themselves, and they tend to have their own infrastructure for monitoring the quality of the models. But we think there are good/bad weather in terms of what the adoption of AI is going to be from all the other companies, and we definitely see a trend where customers start with an API-driven or API-accessible model, build applications and then offload some of that application to other models that typically come from the open source and they might train, fine-tune themselves to get to a lower cost and lower time to respond. I understand. Okay. And then, David, you had mentioned, I think, last quarter that the cloud-native spending had rebounded. It was outpacing the broader business. And just to clarify, are you saying that the traditional large enterprise business during Q1 you picked up in terms of the cloud migration activity as the hyperscalers might have suggested, was that -- I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment and whether there was something really noticeable, intangible there among the large enterprise, more traditional businesses? Yes, we saw -- as said, we saw growth accelerate in our larger customers including the larger cloud natives and enterprise. So we did see more normal activity, including new workloads in both of those cohorts. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of GS. Congratulations to the team on very good results here. Olivier, I was wondering if you could talk about the consolidation trend that you're talking about. It looks like the pace of consolidation and also, the intensity of lands and expense seems to be a bit more remarkable at the starting point of this [indiscernible]. So if you could expand on that a little bit.
And one for you, David, our cRPO has been accelerating. I think at low 20s to 30s to 40s over the last few quarters. but revenue expectations have not edged up pretty significantly. So can you just talk about the lead lag effect, granted that you always try to tell us that revenue is best indicator but none the less it's hard to dismiss the cRPO acceleration we've seen off of -- in the last few quarters. Yes. So I'll let David speak about the cRPO dynamics, but the -- so look, we've seen over the couple of years really, but really the past few quarters, more consolidation than we've seen in the past, in part driven by customers wanting to -- being cost conscious, wanting to save money, but in part also by customers getting a little bit further into their cloud migration and rationalizing what they're using as they do that. So we keep seeing that. We've mentioned a number of those deals in the examples we've given. That's a large part of what our enterprise business is doing in particular. There's no particular change in Q1 compared to what we've seen in Q4 before. Q1 is -- we typically do a lot of larger deals in Q1 -- in Q4 compared to Q1, seasonally in general.
To the point you made earlier, we do see typically a bit of a lag between these big consolidation deals and the moment where we see our revenue recognized. Typically, when we consolidate products, what we'll see is, we'll assume the ramp time for moving usage from other products to our platform over what can be a number of quarters or even years sometimes. And it might take some time for those deals to or those numbers to materialize in the revenue.
On the flip side, we also have a number of deals where customers are growing very quickly into their usage, and we capture new commitments with them. That might lag a little bit their consumption and the revenue we recognize, so we see a little bit of both.
David, do you want to speak a little bit more? Sure. Similar to what we said last time, we are seeing our customers, particularly our larger customers commit longer to us. That can be multiyear deals or even out towards -- the weighted average towards annual deals as opposed to shorter-term deals. So basically, it is a positive in that it does connote that clients are committing to Datadog more as their core platform. It is a trend that we're seeing, particularly in larger customers. But we repeat what we said that really how we contract, and bill is not necessarily one-to-one correlated with our revenues. Our revenues are correlated with our usage. So it's a positive, but I think that we want to keep everybody grounded on our revenues as the most important metric, and then secondarily, our ARR as predicting future revenue growth. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Going back to the workload migration that seems to be kicking back in again from listening to the hyperscalers and you talked about the timing difference there. I wanted to kind of ask on a different aspect here and that's kind of your sales capacity and the ramp in sales capacity that we should think about it. Like can you speak about like where you are at the moment in terms of capacity? And then as the market reaccelerates, like what sort of investments should we think about there? So we're growing sales capacity. We've been growing it for the past few years. We grew it a little bit slower -- more slowly last year as we were careful about profitability and not getting too far ahead of ourselves in what looked like a tough market, but we're definitely growing sales capacity. And there's a ramp model that is associated with that. So the capacity typically lags a little bit the growth in terms of headcount. It takes time for people to get productive. But we're investing. We're growing and... Long-term sales capacity is very much calibrated to revenue and UAR growth. As Oli mentioned, there are periods where it will move higher than that as we make investments, and there's periods where we might optimize. I think last year was a period where we digested previous investments, optimized a bit. And we said, this year, we're leaning into expansion of our sales capacity and investment. But long term, it correlates with revenue. And we look at that. We look at do we have enough sales capacity relative to what we see as the demand in the market, the territories and the expected ARR growth. To give you just a -- kind of a bit more color, like one of the big areas of focus inside the company is ramping up recruiting again. So we're recruiting a lot faster, a lot more than we were last year. And so we had to rev up that recruiting engine again. I won't -- I think they're listening to us, I want to congratulate our business recruiting team there for doing a fantastic job, really bringing that engine back up. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC. Oli, you mentioned newer products continue to do really, really well. You gave some interesting data on Database Monitoring, for instance. I'm wondering, are these newer products resonating up and down your customer base? Or are these -- some of these cross-sell statistics stronger with some of your bigger customers? Yes. So it really depends on the product. Some products are extremely broad based in terms of their appeal. And some others are really more directed to that -- certain types of customers. For example, all products that have to do with monitoring physical networks, they tend to be more appealing to larger, older enterprises because they are the ones with large physical footprint, whereas products like Cloud Cost Management, for example, or even Database Monitoring have very, very broad appeal because every single customer cares about their cloud cost. And every single customer is using databases that are at the center of their applications, and that are absolutely critical to understand.
And we mentioned those products because really like we see that as our efforts paying off in terms of broadening the offering and investing in R&D. And these are green shoots that we expect to grow into the future. Some of those products, we have extremely high expectations for because they correspond to very large categories, which we can think can be very meaningful to the business in the long run. Some others are surprising us a little bit. That's why we mentioned Database Monitoring. We were not sure if it was going to be a huge category in cloud environment, but it turns out, not only is there a very big problem our customers need us to solve there, but also this product hit that problem on the head from day 1 really, and we expect -- now we expect a lot more from it. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. David, you explicitly mentioned that the international book of business and activity was stronger than domestic. So I wanted to better understand some of the more intrinsic and maybe extrinsic dynamics that are driving that divergence in terms of [ geographically ] your performance? And if you could sort of help us understand if it's an end market, a product based or a budgetary based set of distinctions that would be very helpful. Yes. It's very similar to what we've been saying over time. The international markets have been more immature as to their cloud migrations and their deployment of digital applications than the North American markets, and we've been more immature in terms of our footprint. So we've talked about some examples in Investor Day and otherwise of places like Brazil and Korea to name just a couple, where we are seeing an increase of activity as well as an increase of our deployment of our capacity, which has resulted in an uptick of the international demand over time. Yes. For us to be successful, there are two factors that are needed. So the first one is cloud adoption needs to happen because we can't outrun it really. And the second one is we need to deploy sales capacity and grow sales capacity, and that's really combination of the two. In most markets today, cloud adoption is happening. There still may be a few holdouts that are a little bit slower. And -- but we're not yet deploying enough sales capacity everywhere, and that's one of our big areas of focus, as I mentioned earlier. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. David, good margins, 27%, but you're guiding full year to 23%. I know you mentioned you're stepping on the sales investments, but anything else that's coming into the investment mix this year that is different than we've seen in the past years to drive that margin lower throughout the year? Sales and R&D investment, we are -- we have both the sales capacity and the whole ecosystem that we've been talking about. And as Oli often says, we have more high-return product projects than we always have capacity and are attempting to make the appropriate investments. So it's really that we are layering in. We said all along that this can't be changed, headcount can't be changed as quickly as revenues. So we have periods where we're investing more than revenue growth or less. And this year is the one where we're coming from a more conservative posture of last year into more investment in both R&D and sales and marketing. There's nothing onetime or special. It relates to both sales capacity and R&D projects. Oli, anything else? Yes. Again, I mean, I -- bringing it back to what I was saying earlier, a big focus internally is recruiting and making sure that we go fast enough there. I would say one more thing. Last year, when the market was slowing down, most of our peers have laid off their recruiting teams, and we didn't do that because we knew we need to -- our success will depend on revving the recruiting engine back up and growing the engineering and the sales team fast enough for us to go after the gen AI market opportunity we have. So we are very happy we haven't done that, but we still have a lot of work to do to recruit enough of the right people fast enough. I'd add as we always have said that we have a very efficient, scalable business, and we control the pace of our investments. And we -- at the same time, that we're investing, we've been investing in efficiency projects, like we talked about in the cloud to balance those things to deliver a strong profitability posture with strong investment. David, can I just ask a quick clarification on commitment overage and usage. I think you had a roughly 75%, 25% split across commit coverage and usage. Is that still in the same ballpark? Yes. I think we said it's been in the range of sort of upper teens to mid-20s over time. But that type of posture of clients under-committing and evolving into their usage hasn't changed over time. So that is still in the range that we've talked about since we went public. Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge of William Blair. Great to hear that AI-native customers represented 3.5% of ARR. I'm curious on what you're seeing on the demand front for your own AI products like AIOps and cloud service management? And then you mentioned that the model providers have built their own tools to monitor the training of their models. As you start to roll out your own LLM observability solutions, do you see that trend changing? And is that something that customers have been asking you to build? So on the first question, so we -- so look, we see a lot of interest in the new products. These are new products so we just announced in GA, the Event Management product, which is the main missing building block we had for AIOps platform. And we also just released into GA, Bits for incident management. So there's a lot of demand for it. The products are actually, I will say it, for Bits for incident management is a joy to use. So that's great. But you should also expect to hear more from us on that topic in the next 12 months. So this is all very exciting.
On the tooling, I would say there's a handful of players that have been building that tooling for a few years for -- in a way that's very specialized to what they do internally. They are not necessarily the representative of the bulk of the market. So in those situations, we're always careful about overfitting products to a group that might not be the right target customer group in the end in the same way that building infrastructure monitoring for the cloud providers to use internally might not be an exact fit for what the rest of the world needs.
That being said, I mean, look, we work a lot with those companies, and they have a number of needs that some of them they can meet internally and some of them, they don't. And if I go back to the example of hyperscalers, we actually have teams at the hyperscalers that use us for application or infrastructure or logs internally, even though they've built a lot of that tooling themselves. So I think everything is possible in the long run. But our focus is really on the vast majority of the customer base that's going to either use those API-based products or tune and run their own models. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Great. Maybe to Olivier. Could you give a little context to the President stepping down into the Board, he's obviously been there a long time and has been a big part of the Datadog story.
And then for David, you've done a great job over the years dissuading us from over-indexing on DR and billings. But as you actually pointed out, the sequential decline in DR and billings was quite a bit larger than normal. I'm just curious if there's a story there? So I'll start with Amit, our President. So Amit wanted to stop working as a full-time operator but wants to stay close to the company and we want to stay close to him, too. I mean, he's been, as you pointed out, a big part of the Datadog story, and we definitely want to keep him involved in the company and keep working with him.
So the plan is for him to join the Board. You should expect him to maybe reappear at some point as a VC investor, something that's less operational than what he's doing today. And we expect him to be a part of the company for the future as well. I've always said, I will miss him every day in the office.
David, do you want to comment on the... Yes. Now to the more mundane topic of billings. So yes, I think that we did see a decel. We had a very strong Q4 in terms of commitments to us, which manifests itself in billings. We talked about the larger customers committing to multiyear deals and committing to us. We do have a sequential factor, not in our revenues, which are based on usage as must, but basically in our billings and operations like that, usually in Q1 as clients sort of commit. So in some ways, we don't have the seasonality to speak of in the revenues, but like we talked about in billings and RPO, we do have variations in billings.
We're not reading that much into it. In that -- overall weighted, it's going to vary, and we point everyone back towards ARR and revenues, but acknowledge that, that seasonality may have been a little more pronounced in this cycle than in the previous one. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Oli, one of the fastest ways to recruit quickly is via larger acquisitions. So maybe you can give us your thoughts on potentially going a little bigger here given that you're generating close to $1 billion of OCF a year right now? Yes. So look, everything is on the table for us. Like we're very busy on the M&A side. We have a team that is, at any point in time, reviewing multiple deals. And everything is possible. I would say the larger the acquisition, the less likely it is to happen because we're extremely selective in terms of, not only the economics of any deal, but also the fit and whether we think it's truly going to accelerate us in the mid- to long term. But everything is possible.
We are very fortunate to have a very efficient business. As we pointed, they're generating quite a bit of cash now, and that opens a number of doors for us, and we fully intend to use that if we have the right opportunity. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda of Bank of America Securities. I wanted to ask a question on AI. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about 3.5% of ARR, last quarter about 3%. So it looks like the trend is about plus 50 basis points a quarter right now. So really great to see the ongoing expansion there. So from a big-picture perspective, in your view, what needs to happen for this metric to start expanding, say, 1, 2, 3 points a quarter? I mean, look, it's -- so first of all, I'm not sure this is a metric we'll keep bringing up. It was interesting for us to look at this small group of early AI-native companies to get a sense of what might come next in the world of AI. But I think as we -- as time goes by and as AI adoption broadens, I think it becomes less and less relevant.
But the one thing I will say is, we -- so we try to compare our exposure to AI to what we see from the hyperscalers because they are upstream from us in that respect. The hyperscaler that is the most open by is -- or transparent by in terms of numbers is Microsoft as they disclose how much of their growth comes from AI more specifically. And I will say that if you compare our business to theirs, the Azure part of our business is growing faster than Azure itself. And the AI-driven part of our Azure business itself is also growing faster than what you see on the on the overall Azure number. So we think we have similar exposure, and we track to the same trends broadly.
The other cloud providers are not as forthcoming with metrics so it's harder to do a direct comparison. But in the longer term, we expect the same trends to apply. Our next question comes from the line of Peter M. Weed of Bernstein. One of the things that jumped out at me is you saw some improvement in net new customer adds quarter-over-quarter kind of for the first time maybe over the last year or so, which is pretty exciting. Obviously, I know there's a long tail effect with this. But as you look at that, do you see that as kind of a reflection of momentum in kind of the larger enterprise or a rebound in kind of the digital native venture-backed community, perhaps from that broadened AI. And if you think about pipeline going forward, should we anticipate kind of this bottoming and strength to continue and maybe accelerate? So I mean, yes, the number of customers going up faster than it was the past few quarters. I would say it's hard to read too much into it because we have a large number of smaller customers. And there's more variability into the number of those smaller customers we get, and we lose at any point in time and without really having a very large impact on the business. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I will say that the trends are -- all in customer acquisitions and retention are good.
Another number we reported on, which I think is worth mentioning is we saw also a higher number of customers above $100,000, cross that mark, basically cross that mark of $100,000 in revenue. And that's a return to the mean of what we had seen before, I think last quarter that number was a little bit lower. And it really shows what we were saying last quarter, which is that customers are growing on that revenue curve. And sometimes, there are little peaks and valleys in that, in the distribution of customers across the revenue curve for us. But overall, the motion is still the same. Customers are landing with us small and they're growing and they're getting bigger. And as a result, we're getting a larger and larger number of customers above $100,000 and above $1 million and are driving the major ratio of our revenue. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Oli, in your prepared remarks, I don't think you talked too much on security and just given we're out here at RSA this week. I was curious if you could talk about traction you're seeing there. And then maybe any feedback on adoption trends following the new packaging you rolled out a couple of quarters ago? Yes. So the -- so far, the news are pretty good on the -- these new packages. Again, we want to wait to have seen them in the market for a few quarters before we comment too much on those, but the uptake is good. They seem to resonate well with customers, response to the right need, and they're fairly easy to insert into the sales process. So all that are good news so far.
I realize we didn't put too much in the script on security. We actually have a few things coming out. As there's RSA this week in San Francisco and our team is there to meet with customers. One of the new piece of functionality we've announced last week was the agentless scanning for cloud security products, which we think is going to help a lot of customers deploy our product much more broadly, much more quickly. So we're very excited about that. It's in beta right now.
And yes, overall, the same trends we commented on last quarter are still true, thousands of customers [ building ] on security, revenue growth, growth on a number of different pillars at the same time, which is very exciting and really speaks to our platform approach for security as well. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. I had a question on guidance for Q2. You had strong net new ARR in Q1. And you said you're seeing improved usage growth and less optimization. But based on your Q2 revenue guidance, it looks like you're assuming net new ARR in Q2 declines pretty significantly. I guess did you have some deals that pulled into Q1? And if not, why would net new ARR in Q2 be down year-over-year? No. I mean, we -- it's the same thing that we've said in every quarter that our guidance is taking the trends both in terms of usage growth and new business accumulation and it discounts them. And that's exactly the same as we said since we've been a public company. So that's what we do in providing the guidance and continue to do that in this quarter. All right, and I'm wondering if you're seeing any sort of uptick in consolidation in the log management and SIEM markets given the M&A activity in that space? Yes, there are definitely opportunities there. And so we spoke on the, I think, in the script on the -- about some of the advanced query functionalities, we're adding to logs. We spoke about Flex Logs. So those are all geared towards going after this opportunity. And we think also there's more specifically an opportunity around SIEM workloads, which is why we are investing heavily in our Cloud SIEM product. And so we think there's definitely a lot of opportunities there, and the teams are very focused on that.
I don't expect these opportunities to make a big dent in our numbers in the next couple of quarters. But in the next year or so, definitely, we expect to see more. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham. Just one topic, a bit of a 2-parter here, but I think in the prepared remarks, management incited improving trends for the number of or the cohort of customers who are moving past optimization sequentially. So I guess the question is really, can you help us think about the rate or pace of customers that are moving into this cohort, is the first piece of the question.
And then the second piece, what kind of assumptions do you have for sustained improvement or additional customers entering that cohort as we think about the guidance that we have here today. I'm wondering how much needs to happen on that front for you guys to get more comfortable with the guidance? Or are you guys assuming steady state here and anything else is kind of really just upside? Yes. No, we said that we don't provide guidance on the percentage of customers that are in this cohort. We just are commenting that the trends that we mentioned last quarter of the abatement of optimization in this cohort manifested itself again, and they continue to grow. Like always, our guidance takes conservative assumptions and looks across the trends in the business and assumes that there would be more conservative drivers of the business than we've had in the last quarters. So we continue with that methodology. And look, we mentioned that cohort because we thought it was a bad weather, right? We thought they were the first to really optimize and they felt they exhibited all the highest need, I would say, for a quick turnaround on their own financial profile, but there are other pockets of optimization in the business. There are other customers that are going through that later. There are customers that are still going through it. It's an ongoing -- it's going to be an ongoing phenomenon. It's been throughout the history of the company. So as we get further and further from the macro situation last year -- from last year, I think this cohort will lose in relevance in terms of its -- what we can read into it for the rest of the business. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to CEO, Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. All right. Thank you. So again, I want to thank the whole team for what was a great quarter. And I know many of our customers and users are listening to the earnings call. So I want to make sure everybody knows we're having our DASH Conference in June in New York. You can go to dashcon.io, and we really look forward to seeing you there. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a very productive second quarter. First, we welcomed thousands of Datadog users to our DASH conference in June where we announced a broad range of exciting new products and new features for customers to observe, secure and act in their cloud environment. And we continue to add new customers and help existing ones as they grow in the cloud.
Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $645 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,700 customers, up from about 26,100 a year ago. We had about 3,390 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,990 last year, and these customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $144 million with a cash flow margin of 22%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 49% of customers were using four or more products, up from 45% a year ago. 25% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago. And 11% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 7% a year ago.
We continue to expand the capabilities of all of our products over time, enabling our customers to solve more of their critical challenges. This includes our efforts in digital experience monitoring, an area of observability, which includes synthetics and real user monitoring or RUM. And both synthetics and RUM are seeing growing adoption and each product today represents more than $100 million in ARR, becoming our fourth and fifth products to achieve that milestone.
We have also been innovating rapidly in this area with recent capabilities, including mobile app testing, future flag testing, user journey visualization and retention analysis. And with our recent announcement of product analytics at DASH, we are excited to go further and allow our customers to consolidate more of their usage and business insights into Datadog.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog was roughly unchanged from last quarter. Our customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost conscious. In Q2, we saw existing customer usage growth that was broadly in line with our expectation and consistent with the overall improved trend that we have experienced over the past several quarters. Our usage growth with existing customers was higher than in the year-ago quarter. And we saw continued healthy growth across our product lines with newer products growing faster from a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low and gross revenue retention was stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Moving on to R&D. We had our DASHes of conference in late June, and we are excited to announce many new products and features for our users. We have too much for us to cover in detail, but let me review just some of the announcements we made in the past 3 months.
In the next-gen AI space, we announced the general availability of LLM Observability, which application developers and machine learning engineers to efficiently monitor, troubleshoot and secure LLM applications. With LLM Observability, companies can accelerate the deployment of AI applications into production environments and reliably operate and scale them.
We also expanded Bits AI with new capabilities. As a reminder, Bits AI is a Datadog built-in AI copilot. In addition to being able to summarize incidents and answer questions, we previewed at DASH, the ability for Bits AI to operate as an agent and perform autonomous investigations. With this capability, this AI proactively surfaces key information and performs complex tasks such as investigating alerts and coordinating -- response.
Taking a step back and looking at our customer base, we continue to see a lot of excitement around AI technologies. All customers are telling us that they are leveling up on AI and ramping experimentations with the goal of delivering additional business value with AI. And we can see them doing this. Today, about 2,500 customers use one or more of our AI integrations to get visibility into their increasing use of AI. We also continue to grow our business with -- customers. which increased to over 4% of our ARR in June. We see this as a sign of the continued expansion of this ecosystem and of the value of using Datadog to monitor the product environment. I will note that over time, we think this metric will become less relevant as AI usage and production broadens beyond this group of customers.
Last, but not least, we announced [ TOTO ], our first foundational model for time -- forecasting, which delivered state-of-the-art performance on all 11 benchmarks. In addition to the technical innovations devised by our research team, TOTO derives its record performance from the quality of our training dataset and points to our unique ability to train, build and incorporate AI models into a platform that will meaningfully improve operations for our customers.
Moving on from AI. We have a lot more to show in observability. We announced the general availability of Flex Logs, which extends our logging with limited approach and allows our customers to scale storage and compute separately for cost efficiency. And our customers can today use our new Log Workspaces for log analysis. Log Workspaces is an advanced analytics feature that allows users to connect datasets, build and realize complex queries and create usable composable views and reports. It is particularly relevant to customers who previously built sophisticated analysis and workflows in legacy log management tools.
We announced the general availability of Data Jobs Monitoring, which allows data engineers to detect and fix issues with our Spark and Databricks workloads and to optimize the cost and performance of their data jobs.
Moving and transforming large amounts of data has grown in importance and become a mission-critical capability for many businesses, a trend that we believe will continue with the adoption of AI. With this, our data observability set of products is expanding. Data Jobs Monitoring works alongside our Data Streams Monitoring product, which helps customers understand the -- pipelines involving components such as [indiscernible]. And we're increasingly providing visibility for data lakes and data warehouses, such as Snowflake, to deliver end-to-end data observability across customers better resources.
Moving on from data observability. We introduced capability [ photo scaling ] to allow customers to optimize for cost and performance by automatically rightsizing company resources.
For our customers using OpenTelemetry, the Datadog Agent will embed a fully configurable OpenTelemetry Collector, giving hotel customers access to Datadog products such as container network and universal service monitoring and offering our customers what we believe will be the best fully managed OpenTelemetry experience in the market.
In shifting left, our new Live Debugger, enables developers to step through code directly in production environments and find the exact root code of production errors.
As I mentioned earlier, we are building up on our success in digital experience monitoring, and we announced Product Analytics, providing in-depth product and user insights for product managers and business owners.
In the cloud security space, we launched a new application security capability called Code Security, which allows our customers to detect and prioritize code-level vulnerability in their products and applications. We also announced Data Security, which allows our customers to automatically pinpoint sensitive data, starting in AWS today and expanding to other environments in the future. And for instances where customers can't or don't want to deploy agents, our new agentless scanning capability provides visibility into risks and vulnerabilities within host, containers and several functions without requiring agents to be installed.
Finally, in the cloud service management space, we're going further to allow our customers to take action directly within Datadog platform. We announced the general availability of App Builder, which lets teams rapidly create self-service local applications and integrate them securely into their monitoring staff. And we introduced Datadog On-Call, a modern on-call experience with paging and incident management workflows pre-integrated with observability.
So let's move on now to sales and marketing. We again saw strong execution from our go-to-market teams this quarter, and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more. So I'll go through a few examples.
First, we landed our largest ever new logo win, a multiyear deal with total contract value in the tens of millions of dollars with one of the largest banks in South America. This customer was using a commercial observability product as well as open source tools, but didn't have full stack visibility. With Datadog, they will enable end-to-end observability. And they expect to transition to modern infrastructure, sorry, with confidence. They also anticipate better management and predictability of their observability costs, thanks to products such as Flex Logs.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized land deal with one of the world's largest travel management companies. This company was using a commercial lot management tool, but find it expensive and complex to support. They're also worried about stability as the tool with crash and [ cause fires ] across the organization. By moving to Datadog and replacing this tool, they expect to drive significant savings with log management and will benefit from our unified platform across infrastructure monitoring and APM.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized land with a security software company. This customer felt their overspending on their commercial volume tool and lack of visibility led to issues catching incidents with users notifying them first about this. This customer has now obtained the Datadog unified platform across all three dealers and displacing one commercial and two open source -- in the process. This customer also expects net savings of $0.5 million every year by switching to Datadog.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annual extension with the leading central bank in Europe. This institution became a Datadog customer 3 years ago, to enable its ambitious plan to move half of its applications to the cloud over a couple of years. And they have been increasing the usage of Datadog as they move into the cloud, displacing two commercial observability tools, which they use in their on-premise environment. They have now added a total of 17 Datadog products.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a large American insurance company. The customer had been using Datadog for full stack of observability at one business unit. With this [ intention ], they have chosen Datadog as enterprise-wide observability provider. In comparing us to the performance of other tools, this customer measured stronger developer adoption and fewer incidents with Datadog. And in displacing its legacy APM and log management, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool costs alone.
Finally, we signed a high seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online gambling and entertainment platform. This long-time customer uses Datadog as its strategic observability partner, enabling full visibility across infrastructure, applications, logs, network and their public -- them with users spanning from hands-on keyboard engineers all the way to their sea level -- This renewal support its customers' expansion into new use cases to have security embedded into the operations by using all of our cloud security products, to build a culture of cost accountability with cloud management, and to take action -- management and workflow automation. And this customer to date has adopted 19 products in the Datadog platform. And that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-market teams.
Now let me say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including next-gen AI, and we believe this is just one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and next-gen infrastructure.
As indicated by our many announcements at our [ DASH conference ], we are delivering rapid innovation at scale. And we are helping our customers every day to deploy and scale the model environment with confidence across observability, digital experience, cloud security, cloud service management, software delivery and product analytics.
Finally, I'd like to welcome two new leaders to our team Yanbing Li is joining us as our Chief Product Officer. Yanbing has more than 25 years of product, technology and engineering experience, spanning enterprise software, -- structure and AI at companies such as VMware, Google and Aurora. She will lead our product team's efforts to expand and adopt platform.
And David Galloreese is joining us as our Chief People Officer. David has more than 20 years of HR experience at tech companies and large-scale high-visibility enterprises, such as Sigma, Wells Fargo or Walmart. He will help us drive the next sector of growth and scale at Datadog.
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? Thanks, Olivier, and good morning to all. Q2 revenues was -- were $645 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q2 revenue growth, first, regarding usage growth from existing customers. The overall trend we saw was consistent with our expectations.
In Q2, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look across the first half of 2024, our usage growth was higher than the first half of 2023. And we are seeing solid growth across our products. Our three pillar products continue to increase in customer penetration and usage and our newer products across observability, cloud security and cloud service management are ramping.
Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q2, we saw strong performance amongst our largest customers who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually, as they continue to return to growth and strike a balance between new deployment and focus on optimization. As we look at usage growth by segment, we saw the strongest growth with our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Over the same period, we have seen more steady year-over-year growth trends amongst our SMB and mid-market customers. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees.
Regarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid-110s in Q2, similar to the past couple of quarters. But remember, this is a trailing 12-month measure, and we've seen an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remained stable in the mid- to high 90s.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $667 million, up 28% year-over-year and similar to the trailing 12 months [indiscernible] year-over-year growth. Billings duration was roughly flat versus a year ago. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, was $1.79 billion, up 43% year-over-year. As we said before, contract duration has generally been increasing as customers choose more multiyear deals and contract duration increased modestly in the year-over-year period relative to a year ago.
Current RPO growth was in the [ mid-30s ] percent year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
Gross profit in the quarter was $530 million, representing a gross margin of 82.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.3% in the last quarter and 81.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 OpEx grew 21% year-over-year and increased from 14% year-over-year growth last quarter. Oli mentioned last quarter, Q2 OpEx included $11 million in expenses related to our DASH user conference. And as we've discussed, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the growth in OpEx reflects our execution on hiring in sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q2 operating income was $158 million, or a 24% operating margin compared to 27% last quarter and 21% in the year-ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $164 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $144 million for a free cash flow margin of 22%.
Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2024. First, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $660 million to $664 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $150 million, which implies an operating margin of 22% to 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.38 to $0.40 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
For the fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.63 billion, which represents 23% to 24% year-over growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $630 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Some additional notes to our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $125 million. Next, we expect to pay cash taxes in the range of $20 million to $25 million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenues range in fiscal 2024.
And now to conclude. As Oli mentioned, we are pleased with our execution in the first half of 2024, and plan to continue to help our customers observe, secure and act in their modern cloud environments.
I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts in this. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. And congrats on Q2. I wanted to get your assessment of the sort of demand environment, spend environment and your description of like how the usage trends played out by end market, mid-market versus enterprise was super helpful. Microsoft had noted that they saw some weaker usage trends in June. I just want to get a sense of if you look across your geographies or even across some of your key verticals, anything that stood out sort of positive or negative in June going into July in terms of the usage trends? Yes. Thanks, Sanjit and hello. Again, I think you've noted, we said that we experienced strength in our enterprise segment and stability in our SMB segment. And that continued throughout the quarter.
As far as the more recent trends for what we're seeing towards the end of the quarter and also in July, very similar trends to what we saw in Q2 and for the first half of the year. So a continuation of higher usage growth than we saw in the comparable period in the previous year. Understood. And Oli, maybe for you. I know at the Investor Day, you sort of outlined the sort of thoughts and strategy on M&A and sort of identify the criteria. It sounds like your [ corp desk ] team sees a lot of opportunities, but the bar was pretty high was the message from the investor a couple of months ago. I wanted just to sort of double check your latest thinking on the M&A strategy with respect to potentially being looking at more strategic or transformational larger sized deal. Has anything sort of changed in the way you view M&A as part of the Datadog growth strategy? So no, there's no change to the way we see things. Because we have this platform strategy where we're building a consolidator, and we're bringing together many different use cases into one shared platform, we had very broad interest and a very ambitious road map in many different directions. So as a result, we cast a very wide net when it comes to M&A. There's many possible potential fit for us.
So historically, we've been very successful with doing a lot of small and medium-sized deals. At any point in time, we're going to look at a lot of deals that might be small or big. We expect the bigger deal to be fewer and far between and the bar is very high for those. And today, we're also not looking into anything that would be very material to the business. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Has there been any impact or what are you seeing in terms of as a reaction from customers around the Crowdstrike outage because that's obviously an event that impacted the whole industry? You guys, I'm sure, kind of saw some of the -- mitigations there. Just talk a little bit about how that impacted you in the quarter, but also what it means to customer conversations? Yes. So I mean, obviously, this is something that was very much in the news, was very visible. It was particularly visible because it affected devices that airport kiosks, basically and point of sale, that are industrial in front of consumers and it was pretty much everyone. So very visible incident.
That being said, in the great scheme of observability, like it's very unremarkable. So the Crowdstrike event is very visible to everyone everywhere. But every single day, there's 100 or 1,000 companies that are having their Crowdstrike moment because they've updated software, either third-party software offers to soft that they've built, and they cause large business disruptions like -- issues. And that's what we deal with pretty much all the time.
So what you see in public eye is really a reflection of the value we provide every single day to our customers when it comes to preventive and whenever this should happen to remediate them extremely quickly.
So of course, we had all of the interactions you can imagine with the customers around it in terms of how they use our product to come back online, debug and everything. Even though the fix in that case was very, very manual. There was really no good way to automate it. But again, we see that every single day. That's what we do. Okay. Perfect. And then the -- maybe it was just me, but it did feel like you mentioned logs quite a bit on this earnings call. Do you see any change? Like your product is getting more mature and the innovation that is coming through. It's obviously kind of very visible. But do you see a change in the market with kind of recent movements in terms of areas that, that kind of opens up a little bit more from your perspective? And congrats from me as well. Yes. We definitely think there's going to be more opportunity in the future, which is why we're investing heavily both in terms of making logs economical to scale, Flex Logs, in particular. And also going further in terms of the sophistication of the functionality we can offer to customers so they can build very complex processes around those. So we talked about Log Workspaces also in the call. .
Log Workspaces is particularly interesting for customers who have used other platforms and have built pipelines basically that -- process a lot of logs data and so we build that for them. And that's been very well received so far. So all of that is in service of going after these opportunities. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. And I'll add my congrats. Olivier, it's great to see the announcement of LLM Observability reaching GA. There -- I think we're all looking at this tremendous wave of hyperscaler commitments they're going to be ramping in the second half of this year. And it's all for training of these next-gen AI models. And since you're more exposed to the -- excuse me, since you're less exposed to that training and you're more driven by the inferencing, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand how the spending pattern or activity changes as the AI models go live and reach the infant stage? Basically, looking for any way to assess how much spending is ultimately going to develop into the inferencing where you have an opportunity? Yes. I mean, look, the -- in general, it's still early. We do see customers that are going increasingly into production, and we have a few of those. I mean we named a couple as early customers of LLM Observability. I think the two win name were -- the fitness plan and the app folio. And we see many more that are lining up and they're not going to do that. But in the grand scheme of things, looking at the whole market, it's still very early.
I would say the best proxy you can get from the future demand there is the growth of the model providers, the AI native, because they tend to be the ones that currently are being used to provide AI functionality into other applications and largely in production environment. And so I would say they are the [ hubbing year ] of goods to come. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, maybe for David, a couple of the consumption model, software company had recently commented that in June and July, they were seeing more cloud cost control or optimization, specifically among the digital natives. And so your results are solid. I don't think you mentioned that, but could you comment on how the optimization activity is kind of trending out between the digital natives and the enterprises heading into the back half? Yes. As you know, we've said that. So when you look at the time series, the peak of the optimization was in Q2, Q3 last year, and we've had a time series of higher usage growth for our clients month-to-month since then. And that's continued through the first half of the year and into July.
It's -- the usage growth, as we talked about, is stronger in the enterprise and in the larger users, but it has been fairly stable in the SMB. So we're seeing some more -- if you look at the chart in the line, enterprise being usage growth being higher than it had been and SMB being stable. And for us, I would add that the digital natives are largely SMB and mid-market. They're not enterprise. And even when you look at the digital native, there's two stories depending on whether you talk about the AI natives or the others. The AI natives are inflecting in a way that the others are not at this point. So today, we see this higher growth from AI natives and from traditional enterprises and stable growth, but not accelerating from the rest of the pack. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Oli, you've mentioned, I think, between -- on the call, there's been repeated in terms of enterprise growing faster than SMB. I'm curious, why is that the case? And is this -- is it something of a change in the trend? Have you seen SMB is actually showing better usage trends in the past? And what could cause the SMBs to start to pick up consumption? What are the things that are holding back that consumption? And what could be the unlocks from there because the enterprises are doing well. So obviously, the product portfolio is being well received. So what's topping the SMBs? Yes. I don't know that there's that much of a trend just yet to look at or there's too much to say at this point. This is just the way the numbers came up in the -- over the past quarter or so.
I would say, look, there's many reasons why the SMBs could be more careful in terms of the macro environment, the fact that there are less -- maybe less -- there's less runway -- immediate runway with consolidation, like things like that compared to the larger enterprises and some of them maybe are further along also in their cloud journey. So the growth there is more tied to their overall growth as opposed to the speed of transition into next-gen Ai and cloud environment. So these are all potential factors.
But look, there's no -- at this point, I wouldn't call it like a major, super important difference. I think we'll see what this looks like in a few quarters. Got it. And one for David, if I could. How strong is the delta between enterprise consumption growth versus SMB? Are we talking orders of magnitude or meaningful percentage or a big percentage? No, no. We're just talking about a few points but different trends. That's it. We're just basically commenting on the line. As we said, they have been round each others. And we're really commenting more on, as Oli mentioned, enterprise, things like they may have been more careful in the increase of spending, consolidation continues to be a factor in going to a common platform.
But as Oli mentioned, these are sort of comments on the way things are evolving, but we still have pretty similar metrics in all the different segments. We know the issue, something that we noted because we -- a little bit counterintuitive in that when you look at the overall market, the enterprise is where we have the most mature competition, the most scaled competition. And we're doing better. That party is getting faster than I would call it the less competitive side of the market. But again, not too much to read into it just yet. We're just informing you of the trends. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI. I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Olivier, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the LLM Observability product that Mark referenced. When people are thinking about bringing on LLMs into their organization, do they want the observability product in place already? Or are they testing out LLMs and then bringing you on after the fact? I'm just wondering sort of a chicken and egg question, wondering if you're someone they want to talk to you before they start running things into production or it's after they get something going, they bring you in after the fact? Yes, I think so -- so the first thing I'd say is we expect this market to change a lot over time because it is far from being mature. And so a lot of the things that might happen today in a certain way might happen 2 years in a very, very different form.
That being said, the way it works typically is customers build applications using developer tools, and there's a whole industry that has emerged around developer tools for -- and playgrounds and things like that for LLM. And so they use not one, but 100 different things to do that, which is fairly similar to what you might find on the ID side or code data side for the more traditional development, which is not a different very fragmented environment on that side.
When they start connecting the LLM to the rest of the application, then they start to need like visibility that includes the other components because the LLM doesn't work in the vacuum. It's plugged into a front end. It works with authentication and security. It works with -- connects to other systems that is based in the services to get the data. And at that point, they needed to be integrated with the rest of the observability.
For the customers that use our LLM Observability product, they use us for the rest -- all the rest of their stack, and you would make absolutely no sense for them to operate the LLM in isolation pretty separately and not have the observability of all applications. So it's fair. At that point, it's a no-brainer that they did everything to be integrated in production. That's helpful. And then David, we can kind of infer your sort of implied guidance for 4Q. I was just wondering, some of the elections in Europe have come up in a couple of other calls in terms of anything that have been distractions. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how you think the U.S. election might impact usage, if at all? Or if you have any thoughts on that? I realize you guys were a lot smaller last time, w had a presidential election. Yes. I mean we're -- no, we are not forecasters like that. As you know, usage growth has many factors. The effect of the election on the operation of modern cloud applications is not something that has been a very significant change in usage patterns, for instance, in the European elections that we wouldn't anticipate here as well. No, no impact. The only impact on us of the U.S. election is we're trying not to schedule our earnings calls on the same day. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Oli, I wanted to start with you. You and David both talked about improving usage trends. But I wanted to take a step back and ask you, have you seen the quality of the usage improve by virtue of or by extension of your introduction of the cloud cost management SKUs? You talked about the Kubernetes with the Autoscaling and then the original sort of cloud cost management SKU. So I'm wondering if maybe a spurious correlation now that customers have that much more visibility into the mechanics of what they're spending with you, they're actually more inclined to drive usage because it's higher fidelity. Just any commentary on that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up for David, please. Yes. I mean, look, in general, customers have invested a lot in understanding their spend, whether that's on us or on their cloud providers. And as a result, you can say that there's less, call it, overhang of saying customers are setting they don't understand, which is always bad in the long term. So I think customers understand much better the value of what they're getting in the cloud in general this year than they did 2 years ago before this whole optimization movements started.
And they want more in terms of visibility into what the spend would actually create value for them and where they can optimize in the future. So we -- that's definitely a virtual cycle that we embark on with our customers in terms of being the right products for them. I appreciate that. And David, as you all kind of rolled out more, what I would call, resource intensive or compute-intensive SKUs like log, Flex Log, Log Workspaces. I'm wondering if you can shed a little bit of light on how some of the gross margin characteristics differ by product pillar? I'm just looking at kind of some of the sequential compression in gross margins. So I just kind of wanted to get a better understanding of what are some of the more resource-intensive products that you're anticipating scaling that could keep a lid on gross margins in the next couple of quarters? Yes. We have -- I'll just go on the numbers first and then Oli, on the engineering side of it. But essentially, what we said consistently is that gross margins have operated in a range. They've operated towards the top of the range. But there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as we launch functionality, often having to do with rolling out functionality and then optimizing it. And so the movement -- slight movements that we've seen quarter-to-quarter have been the result of that, and then turn it over to Oli for more on the sort of engineering. Yes. There's definitely nothing to read into the small movements in the gross margin from a product mix perspective. A lot of what happened is we build new features, maybe some of these new features will have more computing impact and more storage impact or something else. Maybe also they won't be fantastically optimized in their one from efficiency perspective or maybe sometimes we'll focus more on building more things as opposed to optimizing them because they are the same people, same resources and that welcome both.
And so what you should expect to see some ebbs and flows on that number as we keep shipping you feature and then we keep optimizing. In general, we see good about the gross margins we're not constrained in terms of what we can build by the margin profile we have. And also, should we need them, we have many levers to improve these margins as well. So we wouldn't read too much into the small changes and expect some of those more changes in the future. And -- we feel good about that. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC. Oli, in your prepared remarks, you talked a lot about security and noted data security as a new sort of growth engine from a product perspective. I'm curious, can you talk about how customers might leverage that offering versus maybe other traditional data security offerings maybe like DLP, for instance? Yes. So it's interesting because the -- so in many ways, we've been doing data security for a while now. So we -- on top of our logging product, we started building sensitive data scanning, which is very successful with customers. We extended that to cover Datadog flows inside APM -- that flows between the front end and the back end in real monitoring. And we basically had our customers ask for more. Basically, they wanted to not just see data in transit, but also see where data was exposed at best. And so that's how we extend it to the rest of data security.
So you can see customers coming to that from decent side on our end. One is customers opting on security suite and data security is little by well becoming part of CNAPP and infrastructure security in general. But we also see customers coming to reach from the log and APM side, basically where they start from the applications and they want to track where the date. So it serves both sides basically. And it plays to the strategy we have of integrating both observability and security into one platform. Got it. Super helpful. And then as we get into 3Q and kind of the U.S. Fed spending quarter, what are your thoughts on how federal spending just in general, might play out in Q3 relative to kind of your assumptions? Well, we're building up the capacity for it. So we have built up to do on civil side. I mean we have the go-to-market capacity to build. We also are still pursuing more government certifications and government-specific deployments to open up some more of the market there, but that's definitely an area investment for us. . [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Just wanted to follow up on the enterprise strength that you saw in the quarter. Are you starting to see enterprises reengage with their cloud migration efforts, which is helping you drive that growth? Or is it -- is the strength more related to just general platform usage and expansion? They never stopped their enterprise migrations. I think maybe some of the users was not growing as quickly for some time. There'll be some short-term optimization efforts were ongoing. But the direction was always the same, like they -- and also they never stop growing with us in the cloud. So we definitely saw that throughout the past couple of years.
Some of the strengths we see today has to do with the fact that to serve their -- in part to -- the emergence of AI has reaffirmed for them the need to go to the cloud sooner rather than later. So they can build the right kind of applications, they have the right kind of data available to those applications. But also, we have more to offer. Like we have -- we can do more and consolidate more of what they were using before and that gives us more avenues to grow these customers in the short term. I think we said over the quarters that one enterprise is very early in their journey. And there's a lot of white space too that we said a couple of quarters ago, the enterprise had started to resume more normal activity of deploying of modern cloud applications. And as Oli mentioned, there's opportunities also for consolidation in the platform -- cloud platform that we've talked about many times.. I'd point you to the numbers we shared, I think, 2 quarters ago in terms of our enterprise penetration and the average size of our contracts with enterprises, which are still fairly small. Like there's a lot of runway there. And the growth of those accounts is not predicated on the growth of the enterprise themselves. They're still early in their transformation. . Okay. Very helpful. And then you've talked a decent amount about the demand you're seeing from AI native customers. But how are you thinking about driving growth with your own AI solutions like Bits AI and LLM Observability? And when do you think those start to layer more meaningfully into the model? Yes. I mean right now, the first area of direct application of Bits AI is incident management and incident resolution. So that is tied more to the SKUs we're selling there in terms of incident management. And -- but Bits AI is not the only ingredient of that product. So part of it is the -- what we have already because of the mechanics of incident management. Part of it is also the new Encore product we announced. And part of it is going to be the smart in bits. And we're integrating all that to have a fantastic end-to-end experience for our customers that almost make them want to have incidents. No, actually, they still don't want it sees, but the point here is it should really help them . [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with BofA. Just one for me. I wanted to ask on the usage growth trends. In the prepared remarks, you said a lot about friends exiting this quarter versus 2Q of last quarter and the first half of this year being better than the first half of last year. But the question here is, how did Q2 this year compared to Q1 this year? Yes, we have -- so we have normal seasonality related to the number of days in the quarter and customer behavior as they launch new applications. So we saw -- we really look at it because of the seasonality over quarter. So the usage growth exhibited the same patterns of improvement over last year's similar period looking at the days as it did in the first quarter. Got it, David. One quick follow-up if I may here. Then the follow-up would be, I know in the Q, you gave a net new revenue growth split between existing and new. I was wondering if you could get that mix now or maybe at least some color in that mix? Last quarter was 70% coming from net new from existing. Was it higher or lower this quarter from that 70%? It's going to be 75-25. 25% from new, 75%, which would be what we said all along is that as net retention recovers and usage growth is higher than the previous comparable period. As -- if you go back through our history, you will see that the amount from existing customers relative to new logos has generally increased. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Yi Fu Lee with Cantor Fitzgerald. Congrats on the quarter. In terms of like the new products that were launched at DASH, a lot of stuff going on LLM, AIOps, et cetera. Like Olivier and David, like which one are you most bullish near term and then longer term? Well, it's always hard to have a favorite child in all of the amazing things that we're shipping. Look, I think the short term is the ones that are going to have the most impact are the ones that relates to the products that they already have scale. So anything we do that facilitate the deployment of API -- scale has a large impact. Everything we do that makes that changes the economics of logs, opens up new market within the legacy, lowering user base has a huge impact. What we're doing with OpenTelemetry has a large impact because it's a big trend in the industry and taking we're making bold moves there.
So longer term, look, we think there's a very opportunity for us to do a lot of automation we have of our customers. And you see that, whether that's on the observability side or on the security side, with all of the various ways in which we are taking action into the product, we are fixing things for customers. We're driving them to take the next step. We are organizing the tracking of the workflows they're running from end to end. So this is a longer deal. But I think in the long way, very large difference in terms of value we can provide to our customers. Excellent. And just a quick follow-up for David is like NRR is like at the mid-110 level. What needs to happen in order for Datadog to go back to the above 120 level? I mean it sounds like trends are very, very healthy month-to-month, quarter-over-quarter. So just some commentary around the [indiscernible]. Yes. I mean, we don't give that forecast. I mean, the components are the use of existing products and the cross-sell. And so as you mentioned, both of those have been stronger in the first half of this year than they were last year. And we'll see what happens, but we don't give guidance or forecast on net retention. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Olivier and David, I mean one of the things you talked about in the past is kind of competitive dynamics in observability. There have been a lot of corporate transactions in the space over the past year. So I guess how are you seeing competition versus your open source peers, kind of platform peers that are now private versus a couple of quarters ago? So in general, the commission is very much unchanged. There's nothing super specific to say about that. I think the -- we have some of the scaled players that are disappearing to a certain extent as a result of the transactions you've mentioned though we expect that to play out more in the midterm than in the very short term in the marketplace.
We do have scaled competition still in terms of public companies that are competing with us on observability. And there's no change in the posture there, and we like the way we're performing. And a number of the large deals we mentioned where displacement or wins against this folks. We feel very good about that.
And then on the low end, there's been pretty much a rotating caps of subscale companies that are going after that market. And that's what also unchanged. That's been the same from the -- throughout the life of the company pretty much. So nothing to report there.
I think largely, when we build products, we build it with customers. We don't build it with competition in mind. The few exceptions being when we see large scale opportunities in the market because of the big changes in big transactions that you mentioned earlier. Okay. Very helpful. And I guess, David, looking at the 3Q revenue guidance, it looks like the kind of buoyant trends you saw this quarter will continue. Can you just put a fine pin possible on the trends we saw through July and thus far in August. Yes. No, though, I think what we've seen since the quarter, as we mentioned, is a continuation of better usage trends relative to the comparable period last year. So more of -- And in our guidance philosophy, it hasn't changed. We take those trends as much information as we have and applied discount and conservatism given that we don't control the consumption of our clients, we observe it.
So it's a very similar methodology to what we've used in previous quarters and attenuation of the trends we've seen in the first half of the year. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. I have a question for David on your security growth this quarter. So I tried to reconcile the comments you made about the usage growth in this quarter being better than last year. But if you look at the revenue growth sequentially, that's slowed down. I think it's the lowest Q2 sequential growth in the longest time.
And one more question was if you look at the sequential growth for the last 3, 4 quarters, it's been accelerating since your optimization trends ended. Did that trend kind of, I guess -- this quarter because the Q-o-Q growth in Q2 was lower than what you had last year? So just like to reconcile the commentary about usage growth being strong, but then the revenue growth sequentially looks a little bit lighter than last year. Yes. A lot of that has to do with what we saw we said, which is that in the second half of December, clients are not at their desk and new deployments have been frozen. So we generally find that the usage or revenue run rate growth then goes down or is the same. And then we find a recovery as people get back to their desks in Q1. And then we find in Q2, a similar linearity pattern that we see in all Q2s, which is how it's sort of people work. And so we didn't see anything out of the ordinary in terms of the time series of Q4 to Q1 to Q2. Got it. And then one -- just one follow-up. And David, you mentioned that revenue is the best metric for your business. You shouldn't be looking at billings and RPO bookings. But I'm just wondering, any color you can provide in the first half of bookings growth this year? It's been flat year-over-year with duration increasing it. That's, I think, the lowest bookings growth again in any first half of your year. Any more commentary beyond what you already acquired, is the renewal base lighter in the first half? Should we expect an acceleration in the second half? Any more color on the bookings momentum? No. If you look at the latest 12 months of all these trends, they all eventually converge around revenues. It has to do with, as we mentioned in every earnings call, when bills go out, whether the deals are multiyear or single year, et cetera. So no, all of that is essentially balances out back to the metrics that we direct you to, which is revenue and then ARR. So no, nothing in it. . And I would now like to hand the conference back over to Olivier Pomel for any further remarks. Thank you. And just to close the call, I want to thank again everybody who was involved in DASH here.
