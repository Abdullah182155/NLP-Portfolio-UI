And while the first quarter was a transition quarter for us, we overachieved our targets and grew our revenue by 56% year-over-year.
In our Pillar 1 of revenue, where we power devices such as cars, TVs and IoTs, we have added several new brands, including a transformational Turkish automotive manufacturer of electrical vehicles. We have also expanded our global reach by adding two brands associated with the Stellantis Group and now have 10 brands with them in total. Additionally, we signed a new revolutionary television manufacturer, which is expected to launch later this year. We also closed a new deal with the multinational electronics company and one of the world's largest manufacturers of printers.
In Q1, the number of cars shipping with SoundHound's technology more than doubled year-over-year, and we expect the growth to accelerate as more brands sign up and existing customers' experience.
In our Pillar 2 of revenues, where we power customer service applications, we have signed up hundreds of new brands. It's important to note that our AI customer service solutions are fully autonomous, which is different from the human-assisted AI solution that other vendors are offering in this particular field. This key differentiator, in addition to giving us much better margins also enables us to attract brands of all sizes from a single location to thousands of locations.
Our newly launched SoundHound Chat AI platform is already positively packing both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 revenues.
In Pillar 1, we are seeing demand from existing customers and new brands. We expect faster adoption, better user experience, more frequent usage and ultimately, more revenue per device from our Pillar 1 customers. In Pillar 2, we are expanding our AI customer service solutions from restaurants to other businesses. We have always envisioned that restaurants are to SoundHound what books were to Amazon. They started by selling books, then over time, expanded to other categories, eventually everything from A to Z.
Now thanks to SoundHound Chat AI, we are able to accelerate our vision and expand from restaurants to nearly all business types within this year. We expect this to increase our near-term AutoStore market by more than 10x. We are doing this by expanding our Smart Ordering solution for restaurants with a new service called Smart Answering. While Smart Ordering currently allows a restaurant to automatically upload its menu and enable customers to place orders with a voice assistant over the phone, we have simple integration with one of our POS partners. Smart Answering will allow any business to field nearly any inbound queries or questions for opening hours, parking, location, typical wait times, products and services, appointments and reservations and more using an automated assistant over the phone.
By automatically incorporating data from the business website, we can significantly accelerate the onboarding, allow the customers to test it within minutes and be live on the same day. We are augmenting Smart Answering with Generative AI capabilities so that any voice assistant built on our platform can respond to more open-ended questions with answers that are tailored to a specific business. We address the risk of AI hallucinations using our proprietary SoundHound Chat AI platform.
AI hallucination is one of the major weaknesses of Generative AI models when these models produce incorrect, misleading and at times harmful responses that are deceptively convincing. On a large benchmark of real usage data, we have reduced the undesired AI hallucinations by over 90% to a negligible amount compared to a prominent off-the-shelf model. Smart Answering help businesses ranging from hair salons to auto shops, manage inbound inquiries in a much more tailored and accurate manner. Onboarding for Smart Answering and Smart Ordering has been streamlined such that we expect adoption to accelerate. We are helping businesses create efficiencies with many -- when many are tackling rising costs, staffing shortages, supply chain issues and other headwinds.
No longer will the customer service professional need to break away from serving their clients to answer the phone, book appointments or address basic questions. SoundHound Smart Answering is designed to help businesses optimize human labor, while leaving employees of the sudden -- of the burden of answering calls so that they can focus on more business-critical tasks. This service also helps businesses cater to the evolving expectation of consumers who increasingly prefer customer service to be automated across channels. We believe SoundHound Smart Answering is the first-of-its-kind in the industry. Until now, only businesses with large capital resources could afford AI-enabled customer service. And even though the quality of such solutions have been historically worse than humans, they still took large upfront investments and long development cycles. Our SoundHound Smart Answering solution can be live within minutes with high quality and is for any business, large or small, with affordable pricing.
Now on to our strategic partnerships. One of the key to success in winning deals with a large number of businesses is the ability to integrate with a variety of point-of-sale systems that act as the brain center of the businesses. Along with our original point-of-sale integration with Square, this quarter, we went live with our Toast restaurant point-of-sale integration, and we have been working closely with our sales organization on our joint go-to-market.
In addition, our voice AI is now available on Oracle MICROS Simphony POS that can seamlessly help any restaurant accept voice orders over the phone via menu kiosks or at the drive-thrus on their platform. Oracle has been a great partner, and we sincerely value their collaboration.
We are also now live with Olo, a leading open SaaS platform for restaurants and are already working with several well-known brands in their customer base. These strategic channel partnerships expand our reach to hundreds of thousands of new locations. Other strategic partnerships include our collaborations with Qualcomm, HARMAN and LG.
On technology innovation, which is the core part of the -- our DNA, we continue to push the boundaries with SoundHound Chat AI and Dynamic Interaction. While SoundHound Chat AI is our innovative integration of Generative AI and large language models with our software engineering modules that solves for AI hallucinations and deliver real-time content from our knowledge domains, Dynamic Interaction is a first-of-its-kind multi-model full duplex interface with real-time, continuous audio, visual and touch feedback loop with no wake words, awkward pauses or turn-taking. It ignores off-topic speech, makes proactive suggestions to the user and intelligently decides when to use audio or visual output. Dynamic Interaction is a category-defining breakthrough for human-computer interaction and still unmatched by any other technology out there today. We initially launched Dynamic Interaction in a drive-thru ordering experience, then early this year, we combined Dynamic Interaction with our existing Generative AI technology that we've been working on since 2019. And as we did last year with Dynamic Interaction for restaurants, we brought ourselves one step closer to our ultimate vision of making computers better than humans in language understanding and more human in the way they interact and respond.
There is a lot of enthusiasm around AI, and it's important to distinguish the companies that have the technologies to back it up. SoundHound is one of those companies. My Co-Founders and I nearly two decades ago at a Stanford University dorm room predicted that within our lifetime, computers would become better than humans in language understanding, and we created SoundHound to pursue that vision and make the world a better place. Over the years of constant innovation, we have seen and benefited from real disruptions such as the mobile ecosystem transformation. We have also been able to avoid distractions from short-lasting hype, such as the messenger box and smart speeches skills that did not result in mass adoption. But now we absolutely believe the impact of Generative AI and large language models is indeed a disruption. We expect this impact to be larger than the mobile ecosystem transformation.
We believe nearly every business can be transformed, new user experiences will be unveiled rapidly and users are ready and eager to adopt these new experiences. We are clearly at the intersection of demand and technology readiness for conversational AI, and we view the market impact of the resulting momentum in our field to be transformative.
The real opportunity is for nimble companies with the right experience and also the tenacity to move fast. It's for companies that have the experience and foundation to understand and utilize the strength of the new AI models while being aware of the weaknesses and solving them using their experience and their own core technologies. SoundHound is one of those companies.
This part of new way of innovation has occurred, and there is a lot more to come. We are enabling more tasks to be automated, whether driving in a car and using a smart device or through customer service. We see AI not just becoming more efficient and more effective than humans, but also more consistent and reliable to the extent that consumers will ultimately prefer to interact with an agent powered by conversational AI when transactions with the business. The predictability of the AI technology can ultimately -- can eliminate many of the variables that leads to an unsatisfactory user and customer experience. We believe our products are creating more opportunities for interaction and consequently, the increased usage translates to more relevancy for product creators and service-oriented businesses looking to drive further adoption for their customers and ultimately more demand for SoundHound's products and services.
SoundHound is in a unique position to take advantage of this rare moment, thanks to our advanced and comprehensive technologies, mature products and existing customer base. In our view, SoundHound's conversational AI -- in our view, conversational AI can't be done as a side project. It can't be achieved by simply integrating a few external APIs. Creating the necessary technologies to win in conversational AI takes time. By owning all the core pieces of the engine that we have built from the ground up over the many years, we have a distinct competitive advantage.
To all the investors and stakeholders that have stood by us from the beginning and the many new ones that continue to show interest in our vision, our technology and what it can do to create tremendous value for businesses and consumers alike, we thank you for your continued support and look forward to further engagement. I also wanted to take the time to acknowledge all our employees. I am proud to collaborate with such an amazing team and wanted to thank them for their tireless efforts to get us to where we are today and paving the path to where we will be tomorrow.
In closing, we have grown our revenues by over 56%, reduced our expenses by over 40%, significantly improved our balance sheet and are seeing strong demand for our products and solutions. We are innovating faster than ever and are in a position of strength to not only maintain our leadership in core voice-enabled AI technology but further gain traction as enterprises are increasingly realizing that they have a time-sensitive need for SoundHound technology. We are confident we have the right strategy and see that our technology is recognizing every day. We remain agile and focused and are right where we need to be to reach our goals for 2023.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance for the quarter. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to report another strong quarter with 56% year-over-year top-line growth while demonstrating steady progress in driving efficiencies and improving cash flow. In the start of the year, we set out to significantly strengthen our liquidity position, and we have now done that. We initially raised enough capital to see us through to profitability, and just last month, we closed our new debt refinancing that will fund us well beyond that.
Despite a choppy funding market, we were able to successfully execute these financings on the foundations of our technology and deep patent portfolio, along with significant customer adoption in attractive end markets. We also stay focused on the business and the opportunity in front of us. Artificial intelligence is rightly getting a lot of attention these days and our opportunity has only expanded. At SoundHound, we make conversations with technology more natural and seamless, and the demand for that has only become stronger.
Large language models, Generative AI and the pervasiveness of chatbots are unearthing entirely new use cases every day. The opportunity set and adoption curves will accelerate rapidly, and we are at the forefront of this next major inflection in technology.
We continue to expand our voice-enabled ecosystem and had strong growth, even with Q1 typically our seasonally smallest quarter of the year from a revenue standpoint. This could have only been possible with our strong customer engagement and streamlined execution that we expect will only further improve from here.
Our business model is grounded in the three Pillar revenue framework. Pillar 1 represents voice-enabled products where we receive royalties. Pillar 2 represents voice-enabled services, generally under monthly subscription contracts, and then we bring Pillar 1 and 2 together into Pillar 3, monetization, driving meaningful and relevant advertising and transactional interactions. As we have discussed previously, the bulk of our current business and backlog is in Pillar 1. And in Q1, our cumulative bookings backlog was $336 million, up 46% year-over-year.
That level expanded with more than $10 million of new gross bookings in the quarter with deals across auto, devices and other IoT manufacturers. In this pillar, we continue to extend our offering across new units, while adding more features to existing ones to expand revenue per unit. We can scale with existing customers, and we are constantly adding new ones. In automotive, for example, we saw over 2x growth in units and also realized unit price expansion in Q1. And there are some really exciting new brands in our pipeline.
Growing our Pillar 2 voice-enabled services is a key focus area, starting with AI-enabled customer services for restaurants. The demand is real and one advantage here is the pace at which we can scale because of the much shorter sales cycle and activation timeline. I mentioned last quarter how our advanced pipeline of stores was well into the thousands, and we continue to expand that meaningfully in Q1. Through the end of last year, our pipeline largely consisted of small chains and regional brands, generally with less than 50 locations per brand.
Since January, we rapidly extended that progress into mid-market and enterprise, who typically have more than 100 locations each. Although these enterprise deals take slightly longer to close, once we onboard one location, it can be nearly immediate for us to scale across the full fleet. And as Keyvan noted, we are also scaling and expanding into more enterprise-focused point-of-sale systems. Already live with Square and Toast, these systems like Olo and Oracle MICROS Simphony extend our offering into hundreds of thousands of new locations.
We mentioned expansion into other areas of customer service with new solutions for Smart Answering and Smart Ordering that are vertical-agnostic and can be deployed by any business that is looking to gain an edge on their competition and significantly improve their customer experience. To quantify that further, we are basically expanding the immediate addressable opportunity from roughly 1 million restaurants to tens of millions of customer service opportunities in the U.S. alone. We expect monthly recurring revenue in the several hundred dollars per location, if not more, so you can see how the math can quickly compound and why this is expected to become a very meaningful revenue driver.
Let us now get specific on our -- let me now get specific on our financial results for the first quarter. In Q1, we generated $6.7 million in revenue, up 56% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our product royalties and strength in automotive. Our product royalty revenue increased primarily due to strong customer momentum and expansion with key global brands. Our long-term commitments demonstrate the continued strong partnerships we've developed and the continued share gains we are experiencing. In Q1, our gross margin improved to 71%, up from 59% in the prior year quarter, which was largely driven by the expanding scale of our business, migration of cloud services and increased data center efficiency.
Cost of revenue for the quarter was $2 million, up 11% from the prior year Q1. The majority of our cost of revenue includes data center costs supporting our customer production environments. We also continue to migrate some on-premise activities to the cloud, helping us drive further gross margin expansion as we scale the business.
Operating expenses saw a step function reduction in Q1 compared to the previous quarter as we executed our announced corporate restructuring program. Restructuring expenses in Q1 were $3.6 million. The full benefit of our cost reductions are expected to be realized as we move into Q2 and beyond, while expected restructuring expenses should be minimal in future quarters.
R&D expenses were $14.2 million in Q1, a decrease of 15% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, largely due to the restructuring actions.
We delivered this by successfully completing our ambitious language development plans while bringing to market key innovation in both Dynamic Interaction and SoundHound Chat AI in Q1. Notably, our investment in key areas has not slowed as we continue to build out our voice AI platform and leverage our deep patent portfolio. We intend to remain at the forefront of innovation in the rapidly evolving ecosystems of artificial intelligence and machine learning while also helping to develop and scale our cloud offerings and other products and services.
In sales and marketing, we also saw a sequential expense reduction. Although year-over-year, we saw an increase from prior Q1 when we hadn't fully yet begun building out this organization. We continue to streamline our focus on digital marketing, lead generation and customer acquisition, both direct and through channel partners. In Q1, sales and marketing expenses were $4.9 million, up 89% year-over-year and down 28% sequentially. With our organizational shifts in 2023, we expect this expense item to benefit from greater focus.
G&A expenses were $7.1 million in Q1, down sequentially, though up 78% year-over-year. In the prior year Q1, we were not yet a public company and this year-over-year increase largely reflects investments across the global support functions of finance, legal, facilities and human resources necessary for a public company.
Across all operating expenses, noncash employee stock compensation was $6 million in Q1, excluding the expenses associated with restructuring.
Our operating loss was $25 million, an improvement of approximately $3.7 million from the prior quarter. Net loss was $26.4 million in Q1, an improvement of approximately $4.3 million from the prior quarter. This led to a net loss per share in Q1 of $0.13, an improvement of $0.02 from the prior quarter. Without the one-time impact of restructuring in Q1, all these metrics would have been improved even more.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash charges of stock compensation and depreciation and amortization as well as other non-operating activities, including restructuring, was a loss of $14.8 million, which was 21% better than the loss of $18.6 million last quarter and an improvement of 13% year-over-year.
Operating cash flow in Q1 was $14.5 million use of cash, improving roughly 30% sequentially and also improved versus the prior year Q1.
Now on to the capital structure, where we've made great progress in strengthening our balance sheet. Our cash position at quarter end was $46.3 million. In January, we successfully raised $25 million in preferred equity. Our previously announced committed equity line of credit also became effective, giving us additional access to capital upon which we raised approximately $29 million in Q1. In addition, after quarter end, we raised $100 million of debt financing, which we partially use to pay off our existing debt of approximately $30 million and eliminate the associated principal amortization payments.
All-in, our balance sheet has strengthened meaningfully, and we have a fully funded business plan to drive growth and differentiation and provide cushion regardless of how the macroeconomic landscape evolves from here. Our capital position is now a source of strength that we will leverage to drive our business aggressively forward while staying streamlined and delivering on our profitability targets.\
With that, I'll move to guidance. This year we took actions to set the stage for sustained long-term profitable growth. We are pleased with the momentum we have seen to start the year and are encouraged with the momentum we continue to see from customers. Accordingly, we reaffirm our 2023 guidance and continue to expect that revenue will be in the range of $43 million to $50 million. As we noted last quarter, we expect this revenue will build through the year due to seasonality of Pillar 1 and the scaling of Pillar 2 with restaurants and customer services more broadly. We also continue to expect to become adjusted EBITDA positive in Q4 of this year.
Before moving to Q&A, I would also like to comment on expectations for other income and expenses in Q2 and impacts from the recent debt refinancing. Given the various transaction-related fees and other charges, we expect roughly $6 million to $6.5 million of expense in the quarter associated with one-time transaction fees, expected ongoing amortization impacts and quarterly interest costs. This is different from the historical level, so I wanted to highlight this expectation.
To summarize, we have taken the important steps to set us up for long-term success. We are driving significant market differentiation, delivering on customer demand and catalyzing disruptive innovation with a high velocity. Each quarter on our journey brings its own unique dynamics, yet we are steadily stitching together the foundations for sustainable long-term growth and profitability.
Thank you. And we will now move to Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
Our first question will come from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on all the progress this quarter. I guess just two basic technology questions. Can you elaborate a little bit more on why SoundHound can prevent these Generative AI hallucinations, just a little bit more detail on why you're differentiated in that regard? Yes. So we -- there are actually multiple problems that we are able to fix with our Chat AI platform. One is hallucination, where Generative AI language models produce incorrect results, but they sound amazing. So it's very -- makes them more dangerous. The other problem they have is their scale. They don't have access to real-time information and some of the answer that provides used to be correct, but are no longer correct.
And the way we saw this is we have -- we even have this Yin-Yang diagram that -- we have two models, one is called CaiLAN, one is called CaiNET. CaiLAN is conversational AI language, CaiNET is conversational AI network. The first one is the software engineering approach. The second one is machine learning approach. And the way we combine them, we are able to get the best of both. We get the strength of machine learning models that can scale really well. We also get the benefit of software engineering approach that doesn't suffer from these unpredictable and undesired consequences.
So it's a lot of magic that goes into how we integrate these, but the result is we can reduce the hallucination. We can detect when machine learning is providing an answer that's not correct. We also can detect when we need to go to external APIs or get real-time information from other sources. And also we have domains that don't do well with Generative AI models, things like navigation to addresses and business search that you need these large data structures. So by combining the two, we really get the best of both. And that's a huge value that Chat AI has created. And we have an asset, it's live that people can test. There's a lot more behind that. It's a platform that we are offering to our Pillar 1 customers, the car makers, IoT makers, and we are using the same techniques with our customer service applications. Got it. Great. That's helpful. With regard to the cost controls, where should we model kind of OpEx broadening? Once it's all into the model, like what would be the absolute amount of OpEx you would have in the quarter? Well, I guess I'll go back a little bit to what I said, Mike, last time, I had indicated that on an annualized basis, we expected through the corporate restructuring actions that we would see about a $60 million reduction in OpEx. And so if you take kind of last year, it was -- I think it was close to $136 million and kind of chop off $60 million from that. And then this quarter was a little bit of we were -- we executed the action, so there was a sort of partial quarter impact. So I think in Q2, you'll see largely, there's still some international and some other pieces, but by and large, we're through it. And so you'll probably see kind of the full extent of it in Q2 and onwards.
And then I don't know if part of your question was where will you see like it is really spread across the line item. So we had impacts across R&D, sales and marketing, G&A, and it was relatively balanced across all of them. So, does that answer your question? Yes, yes, definitely great. And I guess just last one on the Smart Ordering and Smart Answering. You talked about, obviously, the restaurant vertical. A couple of the incremental verticals you mentioned were kind of more retail like auto shops, I think. Like how broadly is that applicable on customer service? Like I mean can you get into, I don't know insurance and health care as well, which may be a little bit more complicated or is it more kind of that retail focus? Yes, good question. It's meant to be very broad. The initial rollout will be for targeting smaller businesses. So less on the insurance companies that they -- we can serve those two, but they will require engagement and collaboration. Smart Answering is meant to be completely self-service. So it could be a 1% business or a business with 75 employees and multiple locations, you can discover the service and sign-up on your own and be live on the same day. And we do utilize your website if you have one. If you don't have one that's okay, but if you have a website, you are able to pre-populate a lot of the information from your website. And all you have to do is just examine the information to be extracted and validated. It really could be live -- you could go live on the same day as you discover the feature. Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Brett Knoblauch with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first is on the bookings backlog. It kind of increased by the slowest amount or a much slower pace than it has over the most recent quarters. Is this kind of like what you expected going into the quarter? How should we think about it? Yes, I'll start, Brett. So I think I'll start with, yes, we know that Q1 tends to -- so seasonally, it tends to be a little softer just generally for the business. Part of that is still in the heavy kind of rhythm of the influence of the auto business in our overall business. And so the deals tend to be lumpy, and we had some acceleration of stuff prior year. We know things will happen and some things are still in motion that haven't necessarily closed at the end of Q1. So by and large, in the zone of what we expected.
To your highlight, one other thing that we've been highlighting now, I certainly talked about last quarter, as our business shifts and we emphasize the Pillar 2 opportunity, particularly take restaurants as an example, we aren't necessarily reflecting those in bookings. And so we -- as we talked about, as we scale that and we move into Pillar 2, Pillar 3, you'll be hearing more about other type -- recurring type metrics AR and so forth. So there's a little bit of composition of the deals we're focused on. There's a little bit of just normal seasonality and these things can be lumpy.
So quite honestly, there's probably a metric better considered on an annualized basis versus even quarterly check-ins. But obviously want to give a milestone as how things are moving. So I'd say overall, kind of in-line, and I'd say this quarter when I look at it, when I look at the top-line perspective, when I look at where we are in movement towards profitability goals that we put out there, I generally would characterize this as an in-line quarter across most of the metrics. Obviously, you can't dial it to the T on anything, but that's how I kind of characterize the whole quarter in general. Perfect. And I guess just on the full-year outlook, right, it implies quite significant acceleration over the last three quarters. Can you maybe help us out from a modeling perspective and give us some weights that we should expect in terms of when we should expect revenue to fall throughout the remainder of the year? Yes, I'll go back to something we said last quarter, at least. With revenue, we said similar to 2022 that we expected about one-third of the revenue in the first half, two-thirds in the second half. So I'd say we're kind of marching on that path. In terms of the pathway on profitability, similar to what I answered to Mike's question is we were going through the adjustments on our cost structure in Q1, those have largely been completed. So now entering Q2, by and large, we're sort of at the right level from an operating standpoint.
We expect to be able to scale meaningfully with this sort of cost footprint. So as you get into the ramping of revenue, and we also said like we expect revenue to build every quarter, meaning Q2 will be higher than Q3, Q3 will be higher than Q2, Q4 will be higher than Q3. We model that as getting to adjusted EBITDA in Q4 positive. Got it. And then maybe just some comments on the competitive landscape, right? I think the news kind of this week was Wendy's is using a Google AI to power their drive-thru ordering system. Obviously, this is a space that you guys have been trying to break into and have been quite positive on over the last several quarters. So I guess how are you competing with Google on this front? Do you -- are you -- do you see them when competing for new deals? Do you expect to see them? Should we view this as a U-verse SKU [ph] roll type of market? Just any comments there. Yes, mostly it's validation of the space because in the last couple of weeks, we've seen a whole bunch of announcements and our visibility is that these were POCs that the restaurant customers saw a benefit in announcing it to show they are innovating in the space that is very important. So net positive and very much validating, in terms of -- our view is that some of the big tech players, they have cloud deals and they -- to win the cloud deals, they bundle voice AI, and it's not really the core part of their offering, but they do lead to some POCs, in terms of the technology competitiveness, the Dynamic Interaction that we really highlight in our drive-thru is very much unmatched like when we presented to our customers, nothing comes close to it. So it's just a matter of education and presenting it to -- putting in front of the brands.
And it's rapidly becoming from something that is novel and you have to convince customers that they should pay attention to it to something that they are realizing they needed and is time-sensitive. So it's very much a validation and a positive update in the last few weeks. Maybe I'll just build on that. There's a couple of points. One is, always got to respect competition, then you got to fight aggressively against it. And we think we should highlight more broadly, and we've talked a little bit about this, just to double click on Keyvan's comments in his prepared remarks and even in response to earlier question, like we have been in this for a while. We have the core technology. We have deep patent portfolio. Generative AI brings a lot to the table here, and we can uniquely sort of bring the best of all the world to improve the technology.
And a real key differentiator when you look more broadly at the players that are trying to enter the space in a particularly quick-service restaurant, it's sort of supplemented with humans in the background. So people will claim a order completion rate as a success metric in the high percentages, as you know, 85-plus-percent. The reality is when you look underneath it, they have very low gross margins. We can tell you that they have a lot of humans operating in the background, and it's not apples-to-apples versus ours is fully automated, and we can get that level exceeding human performance with some of the restaurants we've been working with for a long time now really fully automated.
And that is good for the restaurant, good for the customer, good for our margin profile. And so there's real differences out there. I think as Keyvan started with, it's very validating of the massive opportunity, the time is now, and we are aggressively going after it. And I will say, just like a lot of things you'll see probably in the broader AI space, there is not a winner-take-all dynamic going on here. There's going to be a lot of players. And if we just took, again, the customer service opportunity, millions of establishments that are going to be looking for these types of services, and we certainly think we've got a great start and are going to aggressively try to keep scaling.

In Q2, we started our second year as a public company. With our first full year coming to an end, we are happy to have reported over 80% revenue growth on a trailing 12-month basis. We ramped up our innovation cycle and at the same time, gained efficiencies across the Company as seen in the 50% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement in Q2.
Over the years, we've demonstrated our track record as a leading innovator in AI. This is one of the main reasons we've been able to attract strategic investors like NVIDIA, Samsung, Tencent, Hyundai, Naver, HTC, VIZIO, Foxconn, Oracle and others. While some organizations have spent billions of dollars trying to build voice and conversational AI technologies in-house, we were able to do that with a fraction of that investment with our creative innovation and focused dedication.
As a result, our voice AI-powered millions of cars, TVs, apps and IoT devices, generating billions of successful user interactions each year. Because of our root in deep science, over the years, we've created groundbreaking advancements in voice AI from Speech-to-Meaning, Deep Meaning Understanding, Collective AI, Dynamic Interaction and our CaiLANCaiNET framework and globalize them in dozens of languages.
As an example of another recent innovation, we introduced SoundHound Chat AI for automotives. This combines our proprietary voice AI with the latest generative AI built from large language models. In our view, SoundHound Chat AI is completely unique in the industry and no one else can claim this type of progress. Within a short time frame, several of our existing customers have started piloting the solution in their products and we've received proposal requests from new brands. We expect the increased performance resulting from SoundHound Chat AI will result in faster adoption, better user experience, more frequent usage and ultimately, more revenue per device from our Pillar 1 category of automotive and IoT customers.
In a recent pilot conducted by one of our key customers, the usage increased by an order of magnitude after enabling the features. We expect adoption of our Chat AI platform from some of our customers as early as this year. In Pillar 2, which offers Conversational AI for customer service solutions, our Smart Ordering continues to benefit from our unique technology advantage of handling complex and compound queries, which is especially important in food ordering conversations over the phone. In the last quarter, we were able to further improve our solution by applying our generative AI integration really taking it to the next level.
Now, I'd love to play a sample dialogue with our next generation of Smart Ordering AI that is rolling out in the coming weeks to our existing and new restaurant customers.
What can I get for you?
Hi, I'm calling to place an order. My daughter is three years old and she is a picky eater. Do you have any recommendations for her?
Of course, for your picky eater, I would recommend our Kids Mac and Cheese. It's a classic favorite among children. We also have Kids Chicken Fingers and Kids Grilled Cheese if she prefers those options. Let me know if you need any more information or if you'd like to place an order.
Yes. Can I get the Kids Mac and Cheese with apple juice and yogurt?
I've added a Kids Mac and Cheese with apple juice and yogurt to your order. Can I get you anything else?
Yes. I was there last week and had one of those cheese burgers that was really good. I don't remember what you call it, it was something like Traditional or actually Classic. Yes, Classic. Can I get one of those with Cheddar cheese?
Sure. I've added a Classic cheese burger with Cheddar to your order. What else can I get you?
That's all. Thank you so much.
Most recently, we are excited to have launched our low-touch out-of-the-box AI customer service solution, Smart Answering, which will be formally announced soon. With Smart Answering, we expand our AI customer service offering from just restaurants to any business, even a single location barbershop that can benefit from SoundHound's AI customer service. Here is a short demo of Smart Answering with the barbershop.
Thank you for calling Smith Brothers luxury grooming salon for men. This call is recorded. And if you need privacy info, just ask how can I help you today?
Yes. Hi. I wanted to surprise my daughter who loves doing Barbie movie by dying my hair blonde like Kent. [indiscernible] Can you guys do?
Yes. We offer hair coloring for men at Smith Brothers salon. The cost starts from $250. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Well, honestly, I've never colored my hair. So, I don't really know how it would react. I was wondering if I could schedule something just to ask a few questions and get some advice.
Great. We offer professional consultations for hair coloring. You can easily make an appointment on our website. Would you like me to text you a link to make it easy for you.
Sure. That sounds great.
Okay. I have sent the link to you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Do you have any advice on how to get there? Should I drive or take public transit?
To get to Smith Brothers salon via public transit, you can take the Brown Line to Addison Station, which is a five-minute walk from our location. If you decide to drive, we don't have any dedicated parking, but there is usually street parking available on Lincoln Avenue. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Well, actually, yes. Do you allow dogs?
Yes. We allow dogs in our salon. If you'd like to learn more about our pet policy, I'd be happy to text you a link to our website where you can read additional details. Would you like me to do that now?
Well, the problem is that my new dog is a rescue and she gets a bit rowdy when around other dogs. I wanted to get used to going out, but it's best that there aren't any other dogs in the salon at the same time. Is it possible to figure out a time when that would work?
Okay. I will pass along a message to owner, Jared Smith, so that he can be in touch with you via text, to discuss arranging a time when no other dogs will be present. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that's it.
Thanks for thinking of us for your hair coloring needs. Have a great day. Good-bye.
Awesome. Thanks. Take care.
These were examples of our AI customer service solutions that are fully autonomous and a key differentiator for SoundHound, separating us from other vendors that use a human in the background when users engage with their AI offering. As compared to human-centric low-margin call center solutions, our fully autonomous solution is affordable and can attract brands of all sizes, whether the brand has a single location or thousands of locations. When a caller interacts with our AI, they're only interacting with AI and there is no human involvement. If a caller specifically asks to talk to a human, usually at the beginning of the call, our merchant have the option to receive the call directly or forward to an agent.
For example, during the last week of July, about 93% of orders placed with our Smart Ordering solution were handled by AI and only 7% were from transfers. We expect the rate of these transfers to decrease over time as callers become more comfortable and confident speaking to an AI. In fact, we expect the callers will ultimately prefer to speak to an AI instead of an human. Our AI is also always learning, both generically and specific to our merchants. After going live with the merchant, our AI capabilities and accuracy improve as it learns to interact with users specific to a particular business. With this technology, we believe we can unlock long-term value for businesses.
We've heard from restaurants loud and clear. They are hungry for this type of automation as it directly creates financial returns by addressing labor shortages, overall cost pressures and help them generate revenue. We are deeply engaged with thousands of brands and have already closed with hundreds of them, thanks to our direct sales and strong channel partner ecosystem, including Toast, Square, Oracle and Olo. Last week, we announced that we are significantly expanding our relationship with White Castle, where they're committed to provide AI-powered ordering to 100 drive-thru lanes by the end of 2024.
And because our products are designed to be scalable, we can address a wide vagary of restaurants across a diverse area of cuisines and different sizes. For example, we are also delighted to be providing voice AR technology to Beef 'O' Brady's, which is a part of FSC Franchise Co., is a restaurant company with multiple brands that span 25 states and more than 180 locations. And you're adding more customers every day. For instance, Kneaders bakeries, Hot Table, Naz's Halal, Slim & Husky's, Crust Pizza, Kumori Sushi, Noi Thai, Bozelli's Italian and Dialog Cafe, among hundreds of others, note especially the diversity of cuisine types and brand sizes, which give us access to a larger market share than vendors that due to technology and scale limitations need to focus on just enterprise customers or specific cuisines.
And with Smart Answering, we're just getting started, allowing any business to handle nearly any inbound customer inquiry using automated and customizable voice assistant. Using generative AI to automatically incorporate data from the business website in its AI knowledge base, Smart Answering provides quick and easy onboarding, allowing the customers to test it out within minutes and be live on the same day. The service can handle multiple calls at once 24/7 and continuously filters out spam calls, saving hours of wasted time for any business. It can also provide convenient SMS responses in addition to verbal answers and it can seamlessly transfer to any employee of the business, if necessary.
Smart Ordering and Smart Answering are complemented by our visually enhanced SoundHound Dynamic Interaction, which is our multimodal full-duplex interface for kiosks, drive-thru or any device with a screen. Dynamic Interaction is unmatched as a breakthrough and we believe will mark the next generation of digital assistance and AI interfaces, which allows input via speech or touch and provides real-time responses via visual and audio with no turn taking or wake words. I encourage everyone to visit our website and watch the demo of Dynamic Interaction. We consistently get a wow response anytime someone has introduced this product for the first time.
When we attended the National Restaurant Association Conference this year, Dynamic Interaction stole the show. Trade Media selected Dynamic Interaction as one of the top things to see on the shop floor among all vendors in all categories, so not just technology. A typical reaction from our target customers is not just if they're interested in SoundHound Dynamic Interaction, but how can we go live with this as fast as possible. We are already working with a number of potential customers, including a fast-growing large franchiser that operates in 30 states and we plan to start rolling out Dynamic Interaction in the coming weeks.
While we are excited about our Pillar 2 business, there is more to share in our Pillar 1 category where we power products such as cars, TVs and IoT devices. This has been a critical part of our business since launching our Voice AI platform in 2016. In particular, growth in the automotive industry requires long-term investment, global reach and is difficult to penetrate. Thanks to our track record and differentiated technology, we continue to expand into our large customer base of about 20 brands, including Hyundai and Stellantis as well as initiate production with new companies such as Togg, a transformational Turkish electric car manufacturer.
Overall, we are seeing expansion of usage in our categories, seeing more inquiries with the device of repower, which has increased our annual run rate to over $2.8 billion. This frequency of usage increases, the performance of our AI systems will continue to get even better and more intuitive as they learn from the new data and large amounts of existing data. Our extensive experience and data so far have already fine-tuned our machine learning tools to make our products highly valuable to businesses and more useful to users. We now predict faster adoption, new kinds of use cases and ultimately more revenue per device.
Our strategic channel partnerships are also generating momentum. For example, Qualcomm has integrated SoundHound Voice AI on its chipset with the Snapdragon Digital Chassis and is showcasing its on the Concept Vehicle. These types of channel partnerships are critical in developing growth in the automotive industry. I also wanted to specifically call out the traction you're seeing in TVs where we've increased the usage by over 80% compared to this time last year. Last quarter, we discussed the new revolutionary television manufacturer we signed. They entered the market with our technology in Q2 and you will hear more about them later this year. This should drive further usage of our technology in the space where we believe there is significant opportunity.
For IoTs, we have also either signed, extended or gone into production with multiple brands such as robots, printers, coffee machines and kiosks. And we are collaborating with a large home automation IoT company and one of the largest telcos in the U.S. As I mentioned earlier, with the launch of SoundHound Chat AI for automotive, we created a number of upsell opportunities and we are in conversations with the majority of our automotive customers as well as quickly gaining interest from new major brands.
We continue to see a surge in enthusiasm for AI, which has brought SoundHound significant interest from customers and AI followers. We believe the new AI disruption that is catalyzed by generative AI will have a larger impact in nearly all industries than the last mobile disruption. We believe SoundHound is uniquely positioned to achieve significant long-term success in the new AI era, given our deep voice and conversational AI expertise, robust patent portfolio, full technology stack and our years of collaborating with major brands within key industries, including automotive, smart devices and now customer service.
In line with our track record as a leading innovator in AI, SoundHound is training its own foundational model in generative AI. But our approach is different. Instead of yet another large language model, we are combining everything you've learned in nearly two decades to take it to the next level. Our foundational model will be multimodal, supporting audio and text inputs and audio and text output, which prompts based instant customization capabilities that used to take significant software engineering and machine learning to achieve.
We'll focus on features that we know will change the equation in the numerous applications we are building. We'll be able to use billions of real conversations and over a million hours of audio data in dozens of languages that we've so carefully accumulated over the years. The amount and highly relevant nature of this data give SoundHound a unique advantage. Our internal name for this foundational model is Polaris, matching our ambition to create the brightest star in the constellation of foundational models. We will have more to share about Polaris soon.
We have an amazing and passionate team that makes all this possible. I want to thank them for their tireless efforts to get us to where we are today and for playing a lead role in harnessing the technology at the heart of one of the biggest disruptions in history and making it practical and real. In closing, we are innovating faster than ever. We are growing. We are on our way to profitability and have significantly increased our cash position. We have the core voice and conversational AI technology built from the ground up, which gives us distinct competitive advantage to maintain our leadership position and further add to the AI disruption that will make the world a better place and create tremendous value.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance, key growth drivers and full year outlook in more detail. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter and solid first six months of the year with 48% year-over-year top line growth and a 75% gross margin, all while significantly reducing our operating loss. We have also vastly improved our cash position and closed the quarter with total cash of approximately $130 million. The accelerants and AI continue to expand our sales opportunities with existing customers and catalyze new customer interest. These new opportunities have only further validated our long-term vision to voice enable the world by bringing together billions of voice-enabled products and services and unleashing the flywheel of their interconnectivity and new monetization streams. This is the essence of the three-pillar business model we have described before; product royalties, service subscriptions and monetization.
This quarter, we ended with $339 million in cumulative bookings backlog, up 20% year-over-year. To reiterate, our bookings are derived from committed customer contracts and reflect expected revenue to be realized from those contracts over its life. These contracts can have minimum guarantees or include work completed, but amortized revenue not yet recognized due to ASC 606 rules. And in many case, they include customer estimates of volumes for auto or device shipments, for example, generally supported by historical benchmarks.
The cumulative bookings goes up as new deals are signed or if existing customers extend and goes down as revenue is recognized. As we have discussed previously, cumulative bookings backlog growth can be uneven given the scale of our enterprise customers relative to us. We've added customers across industries such as in telecommunications, printers and TVs to name a few. Including automotive, we have long-term contracts spanning up to 8.5 years with an average contract length of roughly 6.5 years. And as I've stated before, these are back-end weighted.
In Pillar 1, where we voice enable products, we continue to extend our offering across new units while adding more features. In autos, which represents the majority of this pillar, we increased our new units by 60% and our active cloud users increased by close to 70% versus prior year. Within Pillar 2, where we voice enable services, we are expanding our offering beyond restaurants to a much broader customer base with Smart Answering. Although, it's very early, because of the more streamlined onboarding, we are very encouraged with how quickly this can build. For restaurants, our Smart Ordering solution is beginning to solidify a strong subscription base. We have already closed with hundreds of brands, including the White Castle expansion Keyvan highlighted earlier. Aside from that, our current mix is predominantly SMB customers and we are expanding in regional and middle market segments.
Let me give you two quick examples of some of our traction. Naz's Halal has nearly 30 locations spread mainly over the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic region. A few months into onboarding two of their locations, our product surpassed performance expectations and they have now signed up to roll out across the entire remaining fleet in the next few months. Hot Table is selling delicious panini sandwiches in the New England region. And after piloting one location, just last week, we have activated four new locations in just one day and are on rapid pace to scale across all of their locations. These are tangible examples and when you envision the opportunity across the million food establishments in the U.S. alone, hopefully, you can understand our excitement.
Over time, we will provide more details of the key metrics we are watching here, but to give you a current sense of the near-term opportunities with solely the brands we have signed up to date at scale and full deployment across these customer groups, we would have over 1,500 locations and well over $10 million of ARR from this one specific business opportunity and our pipeline continues to strengthen.
Let me now get specific on our financial results for the second quarter. In Q2, we generated $8.8 million in revenue, up 42% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our product royalties, primarily in automotive. The expansion is mainly driven by an increase in auto units overall as well as a slight increase in unit prices. And on a cumulative basis, we saw our IoT cloud units expand both sequentially and year-over-year. Additionally, a customer contract modification positively impacted product royalty revenue as the royalty increases from other international customers. These were partially offset by a decrease in customization services revenue versus the prior year Q2.
In June, we finalized an agreement to modify the scope of an existing hosting services contract without changing the contract price. This modification involved the addition of new professional services in lieu of a tail support obligation beyond the contractual period ending 12/31, 2023. Consequently, a portion of the professional services fee that was scheduled to be recognized after 2023 before the contract modification occurred of roughly $1.8 million will be fully recognized in 2023.
In Q2, our gross margin improved to 79%, up from 60% in the prior year quarter, which was largely driven by the expanding scale of our business and increased data center efficiency. Also, this quarter was -- there was a positive impact from the previously mentioned contract modification. Cost of revenue for the quarter was $1.8 million, a decrease of 26% year-over-year. This improvement is due to the continued efficiency improvements from on-premise activities to the cloud migration, helping us to drive further gross margin expansion as we scale the business. Additionally, in Q2 last year, our data center migration weighed on our gross margins.
Operating expenses saw another step function reduction in Q2 compared to the previous quarter as we had our first full quarter after executing our announced corporate restructuring program in Q1. R&D expenses were $11.7 million in Q2, a decrease of 38% year-over-year and 45% compared to Q4 last year. This decrease was largely due to the restructuring program we announced last quarter. However, our investment in key areas has not slowed and this level of R&D spend is where we need to be. We have the talent and expert engineering to support our growth while remaining at the forefront of innovation.
Sales and marketing expenses were $5.1 million in Q2, an increase of 16% year-over-year and a decrease of 25% compared to Q4 of last year. We saw a year-over-year increase since we went public in Q2 last year and we're still in the beginning stages of ramping up our sales and marketing efforts. We continue to streamline our focus in digital marketing, lead generation and customer acquisition, both direct and through channel partners.
G&A expenses were $6.4 million in Q2, a decrease of 32% year-over-year and a decrease of 12% compared to Q4 of last year. We experienced the majority of our going public costs in Q2 and Q3 last year and we saw this already start to taper off as we ended 2022. Across all operating expenses, noncash employee stock compensation was $5.6 million in Q2, excluding the minimal expenses associated with restructuring as we finalize that program. As a result, our Q2 operating loss was $16.4 million, an improvement of 43% year-over-year. Interest expenses, which include ongoing amortization impacts and quarterly interest costs were slightly lower than anticipated at $5.6 million in Q2. However, slightly higher than we expect going forward due to one-time transaction-related fees and other charges incurred as a result of our debt financing in Q2.
Net loss was $21.9 million in Q2, an improvement of 28% year-over-year. This led to a net loss per share in Q2 of $0.10 compared to $0.19 in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash charges of stock compensation and depreciation and amortization as well as other nonoperating activities, including restructuring, was a loss of $9.9 million, which was a 50% year-over-year improvement. Net cash used in operating activities for the first six months was $33.7 million, improving roughly 28% year-over-year and a year-over-year improvement of 40% in the second quarter.
Now, on to our capital structure. Our cash position at quarter-end was approximately $130 million, up from $47 million at the end of Q1. In Q2, we raised $100 million of debt financing, which we partially used to pay off our existing debt of approximately $30 million and eliminate the associated principal amortization payment. Our previously announced committed equity line of credit gave us additional access to capital upon which we raised approximately $43 million in Q2.
In July, we filed a three-year shelf registration under Form S-3, which was not available to us previously. So, this is just standard capital management and good housekeeping. Part of normal ongoing capital programs that companies should have in place and we don't have any immediate needs to raise additional funding off of that shelf. That said, it does allow us to be opportunistic and agile if the right circumstances arise. Our capital position is now a source of strength and gives us the optionality we need to drive the business.
With that, let me discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. The first half in aggregate has landed pretty much in line with our expectations despite massive organizational market shift. We are proud of this. As we look to the second half, there are a number of factors at play. There is tremendous interest in our solutions that are opening many new avenues that we did not fully foresee earlier this year, particularly in generative AI. That said, most of these are in large enterprise deals that can have longer deal cycles and can fluctuate.
The pace and vastness of these deals gives us greater conviction on the potential strength of momentum into 2024 and beyond, but we will comment on next year later in the year when we get closer to that time. Because of our unique market positioning, differentiated tech and massive addressable market, we continue to believe over the longer term, we have the foundations to deliver strong, sustained and meaningfully disruptive growth. In the near term, there continues to be a nuanced macro picture and volatility in the markets in which we participate with uncertainties in green shoots growing together, mainly attributable to the timing of our large enterprise opportunities.
Ultimately, though, we believe the longer-term tailwinds are largely in our favor. All that said, calibrating the puts and takes, we reiterate our 2023 revenue outlook of $43 million to $50 million. As we noted last quarter, our revenue builds throughout the year due to seasonality of Pillar 1 and the scaling of Pillar 2, and we continue to work towards becoming adjusted EBITDA positive in Q4 of this year.
Before closing, I'd like to note that last week, our auditor, Armanino LLP notified us that they have made a business decision to exit their public company SEC audit practice. As such, our Audit Committee has launched a process to find a new auditor. This is a business decision by Armanino that affects dozens of their clients and is not at all a reflection of our financial position or any previously audited financials.
To summarize, we are driving significant market differentiation, delivering on customer demand and catalyzing disruptive innovation with a high velocity. Each quarter on our journey brings its own unique dynamics, yet we are steadily piecing together the foundations for sustainable, long-term growth and profitability.
Thank you, and we will now move to Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Congrats on the strong results here. In terms of the second half outlook, we should think about that as largely driven by license deals out of backlog? Is that still the key kind of second half driver? Mike, I think it will come from Pillar 1 activity, a lot of backlog, but also some new deals, potentials that I mentioned are sort of in motion. So, we do continue to see great traction in the Pillar 2. As I articulated, there's -- we're building sort of our ARR pipe. But as I think you're alluding to, as those really end up being monthly recurring. So, those will build and be consistent over time. But as we keep adding more and more restaurants, that's going to be increasingly a 2024 and out story. So yes, I mean we have -- and I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's been a seasonality that comes with our business, particularly with respect to autos and just the trending of vehicle shipments and so forth. So, it's a composition of a few different things, but I think that's kind of the mix. And I might have missed it, but did you say whether OpEx should trend down a little bit from here? Or is this a good kind of run rate level? It's -- yes, probably generally a good run rate level. What I'd say is we took most of those restructuring actions in Q1 itself. There was a little bit of restructuring expense in Q2 but largely complete. At this point, we feel like we're largely in the right place. We are being thoughtful about areas where things are moving around pretty quickly. So, where we need to be concerted about driving additional investments, we're not going to shy from doing that. Again, maintaining our commitment to getting to the right place on profitability. So, in a couple of pockets, we're making shifts, in a couple of places we're moving away from. So, I'd say, by and large, yes, it's appropriate to kind of think of it as this is a good level and it really kind of comes to scaling revenue. And just last one. Great to see the White Castle expansion. Can you talk a little bit about the ROI they saw in initial launch? And then I guess it's going to roll out over 1.5 years. I'm assuming it was a good ROI. So, why wouldn't they roll out a little faster? I think you guys can kind of deploy faster than that, but... Yes, the 100 number is by the end of next year, but it's not -- it's actually happening already quite fast. So, we are in multiple locations and they have an aggressive target to add more and more. It's just that drive-thru requires some hardware upgrade and it's not just a swap out of software, so that takes a bit of time. On your earlier question, they had a key metric that they were looking for in terms of order completion rate. That is correct. And we by far exceeded the number that they were looking for and we surpassed their human order takers. So, they're very happy with the partnership. And by the way, on return, Mike, there's obviously labor cost benefits of utilizing AI. There is the opportunity to have upsell, which could generate revenue. There's consistency of service. I think in our press release, we commented it's 24/7. So, coverage over for a place that does operate 24/7, that's meaningful. You don't get deterioration of performance because you're tired if you're AI as an example. So, multiple things from an ROI perspective, I think, are very attractive to these restaurants. [Operator Instructions] And that will come from the line of Brett Knoblauch with Cantor Fitzgerald. I guess the first one, I think we look at like other AI companies in the market who are kind of training models and they're spending a lot of money on CapEx in this build-out. And I guess when we look at kind of your guys CapEx, it's quite minimal. So, can you maybe remind us why maybe you don't need the capital intensity of some of the other AI businesses that are trying to acquire compute and whatnot? Well, we have been training models for over 10 years. So, some of that has accumulated. So, we have both AI models in dozens of languages. So, some of it is reflected in that. But yes, we have become very efficient in the way we train models and reducing cost. And also we have scale already with traffic that we have to serve with our real -- we process billions of queries and we are being smart about utilizing our capacity when the same hardware is not being used to serve the production traffic. So, we are trying to not have additional expenses to train large models beyond what we have already allocated going forward. And Brett, as we've talked about before, we've migrated cloud providers. We utilize Oracle OCI and we have a great partnership there that gives us access to GPUs and all the kind of technologies that we need to be able to train our models. So, sort of in the business model already. And then I guess now that you guys have like ample liquidity, what's going to be the investment strategy as it relates to building out your go-to-market strategy. This has historically been an area where you haven't invested much as you guys kind of been an R&D-focused or product-led company. So, I guess can you just maybe explain like what your vision is for what your go-to-market strategy would look like? Yes, certainly. So, it depends on the pillar. On Pillar 1, we built a real great set of partnerships and customer base and with really just a handful of business development resources and that was kind of our history dating back many, many years, and it was on the foundation of great technology, differentiated technology in the marketplace, our capacity to work flexibly and with a lot of agility and scale. And so that was sort of, I think we'll continue to grow. We leverage channel partnerships. We mentioned Qualcomm example an opportunity to leverage a great partner, embed the voice AI with Snapdragon chip and get access. There's other partners.
When we talk to Pillar 2, it's a little bit of a mix between direct go-to-market motion as well as channel partners. So, we have our own sales team. We've been growing. They're very active in engaging with small, medium enterprises, but also regional mid-market and going to conferences, getting our Dynamic Interaction technology in front of people because as Keyvan mentioned in the prepared remarks, when we get that out there, people see it, they're wow-ed, they really want to -- they want to keep the conversations going.
But we supplement that and really complement that and get a lot of scale with channel partners. So, we've talked about how we can now integrate with Toast, Square, Oracle, Olo, we're adding others. And those are great because take Toast as an example. I believe they have 1,100 sales reps that we've been -- we trained the sales reps before to kind of showcase our technology, how we can integrate with them, and that just gives us greater reach. So that's sort of what we're doing on the go-to-market motion. I will say you're right, we are feeling great about where we are from the capital perspective and it's really around execution and going out and continuing to get scale and ways that we can just quickly get large enterprise franchises are interesting to us and we'll continue to look at both direct and indirect ways of accessing those customers. And then for your full year guide, I guess, do you need any like one-time license or big one-time license deals for you to reach that midpoint? Or do you think that can come just from increased usage or inquiries from product royalties? We do different -- in our licensing, there's sort of a royalty scaling. And then we do have one-time NREs from time we do various deals. We do professional services engagement. So that's all part of the contemplation. I don't know that I can break that up too much other than just scaling in units at the pace we're going, that gets you part of the way. But yes, I mean we need to do some other deals in that, but that's part of our overall motion as we work. If we have to do upfront custom development work, then we get that. And if we complete that within a certain period of time, we recognize it. If the performance obligation is longer, we amortize it. So, some of it is the rollout and some of it is we got to go do deals. We've got a lot of deals in motion.
And I think I mentioned, especially with the generative AI stuff, there's just a lot more interesting conversations going on. But those are large deals and the timing is not always perfect. So, we're going to keep hammering away at those and showcase to you guys in future quarters what we've been able to accomplish. And then maybe if I could just ask one more. I guess you guys said the auto units were up 60% year-over-year. Pricing was also up year-over-year. So, I guess if I'm looking at product royalty revenue, which is $5.5 million last year, if I assume that grew 60% or just 60%, that gets me to a number that's more than the revenue delivered in the quarter. So I guess, what am I missing from that equation in terms of units and pricing that kind of gets me to like where you guys are at for this quarter's revenue? Yes. When we -- what I conveyed in the prepared remarks was around units and unit activity, which generally on our revenue recognition. As we get a royalty report, we invoice off the royalty report, we recognize that revenue. Revenue is also make comprised of previously completed NRE work that might amortize over the life of the support agreement, could also include professional services.
So for example, on a year-over-year comp, that's included in the prior year number, last year, we had announced sort of we had one particular customer in Europe, an auto customer that we did some engineering work, and that was, I think, particularly related to like language deployments and some engineering work that we had to complete.
So, those aren't necessarily related to shipments. So, you have to sort of adjust for those things. That's why I try to give the double click of like what's actually going on the ground with units that are shipped because there can't be that type of engineering numbers that they're playing out and I don't want to say reeking. They're just changing the numbers. So that's a reflection in our prior year numbers. Thank you. As I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time, this concludes today's program. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.","this call is being audio webcast in its entirety on our Investor Relations website . a question-and-answer session will be recorded after the speakers' presentation . with me today is our CEO, Keyvan Mohajer, and our CFO, Nitesh Sharan .",1.0

Thank you, Scott, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today.In our third quarter, we saw incredible momentum showcased by a strong revenue performance. We continued the fast pace in our creation of great products that delight customers and users. Businesses are seeing the value of SoundHound real time, and this is translating to the value we are creating for our stakeholders.This quarter, our revenue grew to a record $13.3 million, a 52% increase sequentially. At the same time, our key profit metric, adjusted EBITDA, continues to improve significantly, driven by operational excellence of our organization. We've consistently demonstrated our track record as a leading innovator in AI. This quarter, the products we are creating saw exceptional demand from automotive assistant regenerative AI features to customer service solutions for every business.Let me give you an update. In our Pillar 1 category, we power products such as autos, TVs and IoT devices. Since launching our voice AI platform, our Pillar 1 strategy has been a crucial part of our business. Journey of AI is fueling even more excitement and customer interest in SoundHound's products and solutions. Take automotive as an example. We recently published the results of a study that over half of regular drivers would like ChatGPT style capabilities from their in-vehicle voice assistant. We believe this will give rise to a steep and rapid increase in the number of drivers actively using voice recognition in their cars. As a result, our projection is that more drivers will use voice instead of touch interfaces and physical owners manuals at an increasing pace.We continue to expand in our existing large customer base, which includes over 20 car brands such as Hyundai and Stellantis. The automotive brands that have chosen SoundHound solutions represent roughly 25% of all units produced in the world today. As they ramp up production of units enabled with our AI, we expect to see further growth in the corresponding revenue, and we have also been winning more logos. Thanks to its enhanced performance, SoundHound Chat AI for automotive has created a number of offset opportunities. And last month, it became the first in-car voice assistant with generative AI capabilities to go live in vehicles in Europe.Last month, we also launched SoundHound Vehicle Intelligence, which also generates interest among a number of automotive brands. And another brand, Togg, the prominent EV automaker in Turkey continues to ramp, and we are actively engaged with a number of other EV companies. As carmakers both traditional giants and up-and-coming EV brands prioritize being more agile software companies, their interest in SoundHound's sophisticated voice AI solutions increases.But Pillar 1 is not just about autos. We are showing increased usage among all categories. We are seeing more queries within the devices we power, including TVs and apps, which has increased our annual query run rate to over $2.9 billion. As this frequency of usage increases, the performance of our machine learning and AI models get more advanced as they learn from this massive amount of data that keeps growing. The result will be more intuitive technology, which we expect will create faster adoption, new use cases and ultimately higher unit prices per device.For TVs, we continue to work with established players like VIZIO as well as new and disruptive manufacturers in the space to unlock the true potential of the most prominent connected device in most homes. In doing this, we've seen high double-digit growth in usage year-over-year. For IoT devices, the use cases are endless, and we are working with more companies every day to extend or go into production in multiple areas. This quarter, we showcased our technology with Cimbali Group, a professional coffee machine manufacturer with distribution network covering over 100 countries and involving 700 distributors. We are also working with some of the largest appliance manufacturers in the world and have either signed, extended or gone into production with multiple plants in industries such as telcos, robotics, printers, vending machines and kiosks.Moving on to Pillar 2. In our Pillar 2 category, we aspire to service hundreds of millions of businesses around the world with our AI customer service solutions. We've been discussing the great traction we are seeing in enterprise brands. We announced White Castle last quarter and this quarter, I'm happy to add 2 more incredible names to the list, Jersey Mike's and Krispy Kreme. We've also agreed to a trial with one of the largest global quick sell restaurants in the world for the use of our dynamic interaction drive-thru solution. We continue to sign larger deals in mid-market and regional restaurant space as well. Some recent wins include Chicken Shack, Bai Mai Thai, Bubbakoos Burritos, CoreLife Eatery, Dog Haus, Happy Endings Hospitality, Sam & Louie's, Tonyburgers and Zeeks Pizza representing opportunity of several hundred locations.Our expansion in White Castle drive-thrus is also ramping. We are live in approximately a dozen lands in the Midwest and are expanding into new locations in the Southwest United States. We are excited to be working with White Castle's first-class team as they bring the first truly intelligent drive-thru experience across the country.SoundHound has a unique competitive advantage in this vertical. We own and fully understand the entire conversational AI technology stack, which we have developed over nearly 2 decades. This ownership is important and hugely valuable to prospective customers because it means that we are able to fully drive improvements in the technology and its performance rather than hitting the limits of some black box APIs. Our customers understand not only is this more secure and cost effective, it allows for more innovation and customization, which in turn allows for differentiation in their own markets. With these restaurant solutions, which we first launched last year, we have coverage in about 35 states and continue to increase our footprint across the country. At the same time, we are also expanding internationally.Going beyond restaurants, with our Smart Answering, we are completely disrupting how businesses of all types directly respond more intelligently and usefully to their customers. We provide business owners with confidence that the customer relationships are improving while driving increased revenue and healthy mitigate costs. Smart Ordering and Smart Answering are complemented by our visually enhanced SoundHound Dynamic Interaction, which is our multimodal full-duplex interface for kiosks, drive-thrus and any device with a screen. We are working with a number of partners and customers and our pipeline keeps growing.We also continue to build out our point-of-sales ecosystem by joining Olo Connect. Now live with several merchants Olo is a significant addition to our ecosystem as a software platform, creating additional potential customer touch points to enterprise brands with more than 77,000 locations, adding to more than 150,000 restaurants that use our hardware merchant partners, Toast, Oracle and Square. Further accelerate our reach, we recently launched our POS gateway solution that streamlines custom merchant integration with SoundHound voice AI ordering products and accelerate time to market. We also joined forces with ChowNow, a leading online ordering and marketing platform. This will help enable restaurants to answer and respond to every inbound customer call so that orders are never missed. And just last month, we were pleased to have Samsung partner with us to unlock the power of digital outdoor signage and turn menus into interactive restaurant portals with almost unlimited potential.In 2016, after about a decade of stealth R&D, SoundHound launched its breakthrough voice AI technology, powered by innovations such as speech to meaning and deep meaning understanding. These capabilities allowed our voice assistance solution to process not just speech, but also meaning understanding in real time, just like the human brain. Our ability to quickly handle complex and compound queries accessing live data remains unmatched in the voice industry today.We've always believed that future of voice AI would be powered by a combination of software engineering and machine learning. In our own models, we have been using machine learning for a number of years to improve speech recognition and natural language understanding. The introduction of large language models has allowed our platform to reach new heights. With our strong foundation of balancing software engineering and machine learning, we were easily able to integrate generative AI into our technology stack. In fact, we believe we are one of the fastest disruptors to take this new technology into production.Our customers require a mix of real-time data and conversational intelligence. Furthermore, they need to make sure that brands are protected from the type of misinformation and hallucinations that occur from access to unmanaged generative AI. Thanks to our rapid adoption of these recent innovations, we are live in market with our generative AI-enhanced voice products across our automotive and restaurant customers. Our SoundHound Chat AI product is the first to have this unique blend of technologies and is fueling our momentum with new and existing customers.Building on our success in automotive market, we recently introduced SoundHound Vehicle Intelligence, which provides instant hands-free access to vehicle-specific information without drivers having to pull over or spend time leaving through a physical manual. SoundHound's voice-enabled vehicle intelligence domain uses internally developed artificial intelligence and large language models to provide answers to almost any question about the cars functionality, maintenance or repair completely hands-free. Of course, the opportunity of this kind of functionality for voice-enabled user manuals doesn't begin and end with automotive. It can be extended to any device or appliance, allowing a manufacturer to achieve cost savings by lowering the frequency of customer calls and saving customers the asset of having to find and figure out the instructions.While voice AI ordering technology is now decreasing their reliance on in-house staff, SoundHound products can also be used to augment human capabilities. For example, our voice-enabled employee assist technology can instruct a restaurant employee about how to make a particular item, allowing them to ask as many questions as they like to ensure the product is perfect without ever having to remove their gloves and consult a manual or distract another staff member.We initially launched dynamic interaction as a breakthrough multimodal ordering experience for drive-thrus, and the product has been well received, and we are gaining more traction and new customers every quarter. Since then, we have evolved the technology to allow in-store employees the same ordering experience previously limited to end customers. The ability to process orders visually in real time works equally well in store as it does in drive-thru, whether it's a customer or employee as the end user. With our advancements in the restaurant space, customers are seeing the benefits of taking orders and filling them simultaneously. In the automotive and IoT space, we are able to provide real-time conversational voice AI experience. We are excited about our continued delivery of key technologies that provide meaningful value to our customers.Last time I mentioned our ambitious Polaris initiative. It's an effort to weave together our learnings of the last 2 decades as well as billions of real-time conversations and over 1 million hours of audio to produce our own fully multimodal generative AI foundation model, which can work with both speech and text and respond with audiovisual output. I'm pleased to say we've completed the first phase of this project and successfully built a multilingual model that can handle queries in multiple languages interchangeably and respond with high accuracy with streaming audio in real time. We will be rolling out the first version of Polaris to our customers in the coming weeks. This is an important milestone, and we expect even more disruptive features in future phases of Polaris. We are excited about the potential applications of a model that can respond instantly and seamlessly and in different modalities to request in various languages across a huge range of potential queries. The commercial possibilities are clearly huge.We believe SoundHound is uniquely positioned to achieve significant long-term success in this new era of AI. We have believed from our founding moment that voice and conversational AI is the most natural way to interact with devices and services and eventually permeate through all businesses. We have an amazing and passionate team that believes in this vision and continues to push forward to create conversational AI technology that exceeds human capabilities and deliver value and delights and users alike.In closing, we are experiencing meaningful success and with every quarter that goes by, our momentum builds and our foundation gets stronger. Our products significantly reduce costs, increase revenue and add efficiency for our customers. Our fully automated technology is unmatched, and we remain at the forefront of conversational AI and are winning new businesses and expanding with our existing relationships.I'll now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance, key growth drivers and outlook for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone.We are pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenue, all while continuing to ascend the path to profitability. Three quarters into 2023, and we have continued to meet our internal milestones despite a continuously evolving and dynamic macro backdrop. As each quarter passes, the opportunities of bringing AI to life for customers are becoming more vivid, more tangible and more confirming of our unique customer value proposition. Generative AI and large language models are helping us develop natural conversations into a rapidly expanding ecosystem of voice-enabled products and services to one our completely new pathways of human computer interface, and we are leading at the bleeding edge.In Pillar 1, where we voice-enabled products, we continue to extend our offering across new units while adding more features such as our new Vehicle Intelligence solutions with generative AI. In autos, which represents the majority of this pillar, we increased our new units by 68%, and our active cloud users increased by close to 45% versus prior year. This quarter, we ended with $342 million in cumulative bookings backlog, up 13% year-over-year. We've added customers across industries such as in automotive, telecommunications, IoT, including coffee machines, printers and TV, just to name a few.In total, we have certain contracts that span up to 10 years, representing an average contract length of roughly 6.5 years. And as I've stated before, these are back-end weighted. These bookings, which mostly correspond to Pillar 1, are derived from committed customer contracts and reflect revenue we expect to realize. Within these existing contracts and more broadly with those partners, we have massive upside, and we continue to add new customers every quarter. Keyvan talked about a few of those earlier. We continue to believe this metric should be viewed on an annualized basis since growth can be uneven from quarter to quarter.Within Pillar 2, where we voice-enabled services, just last quarter, we expanded our offering beyond restaurants to a much broader customer service base in Smart Answering. This quarter, we enhanced Dynamic Interaction to now work with employees to improve the time from order taking to order fulfillment, again, adding new potential users of our products. For restaurants, our portfolio of solutions is gaining momentum in the market, and we are seeing traction in enterprise brands as we move upmarket and add more regional customers.Last quarter, we gave a sense of the key metrics we are watching here and wanted to provide an update on how those have been evolving. With solely the brands we have signed to date, at scale and full deployment across these customer groups, we would now have over 4,500 locations and well over $25 million in ARR. Combined with the rapidly growing pipeline of larger customers, we expect and continue to look for ways for this to accelerate even more in the future.Let me now get specific on our financial results for the third quarter. In Q3, revenue accelerated by 52% sequentially to $13.3 million and 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our product royalties, primarily in automotive, which included an increase in a multiyear minimum guarantee commitment for an edge contract. The expansion is mainly driven by an increase in auto units overall as well as continued unit price increases. Our IoT cloud units also continue to layer on top with both sequential and year-over-year expansion.In Q3, our gross margin was 73%, which continues to benefit from the expanding scale of our business and increased data center efficiency. We achieved this result despite a 39% year-over-year increase in cost of revenue for the quarter, which was $3.6 million. The year-over-year cost increase was primarily driven by product mix, which included a premium text-to-speech component in the aforementioned edge solution that was not in the comparable prior-year period.Total operating expenses improved by nearly 1/3 year-over-year, largely driven by the corporate restructuring program we announced in Q1 this year, which affected all line items. Included here are certain variable costs and discretionary items that we expect will help drive reduced operating expenses sequentially into Q4. R&D expenses were $12.8 million in Q3, a decrease of 34% year-over-year. However, our investments in key areas have not slowed. For example, with Polaris, as Keyvan mentioned, our existing talent and expert engineering remains at the forefront of innovation. As examples, we are advancing the state of large language models with ASR, automatic speech recognition, as well as implementing fully unsupervised training, which have rapidly improved our models. In addition, we continue to build out our existing suite of products and add new technologies such as Smart Answering as well as generative AI capabilities for auto and employee assist solutions with dynamic interaction.Sales and marketing expenses were $4.5 million in Q3, a decrease of 33% year-over-year. We continue to focus on go-to-market strategies and customer engagement and, in particular, drive new business growth and subscriptions as seen in the ARR expansion mentioned earlier. At the same time, our laser focus on high ROI areas of digital marketing, lead generation and customer acquisition, both direct and through channel partners like Olo, Toast, Oracle and Square remains an important part of our overall approach.G&A expenses were $6.9 million in Q3, a decrease of 28% year-over-year. This reflects the efficiencies we have been driving as well as some year-over-year favorability compared to the going public costs in the prior year. To note, we crossed the market threshold for market cap earlier in the summer that now indicates us to become SOX 404(b) compliant next fiscal year earlier than we had anticipated. As such, we are accelerating investments in our internal controls over the financial reporting processes. These were plans we had in place for 2024 anyway. So we were just getting a jump start, and frankly, it is about continuing to mature and improve our end-to-end processes.Across all operating expenses, noncash employee stock compensation was $6.7 million in Q3. As a result, our operating loss was $14.5 million, which reflects an improvement of 46% year-over-year. OI&E was $4.1 million for the quarter. Of this amount, interest expense, which includes ongoing amortization impact and quarterly interest cost was $5.4 million. This quarter was a first full quarter with our new debt in place, so this can be roughly considered a more normalized level of interest expense on a go-forward basis.Net loss was $20.2 million in Q3, an improvement of 33% year-over-year. This led to a net loss per share in Q3 of $0.09 compared to a $0.15 loss in the prior year, an improvement of more than 40%. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash charges of stock compensation, depreciation and amortization as well as other nonoperating activities, was a loss of $7.3 million, which was a 57% year-over-year improvement.Net cash used in operating activities for the first 9 months was about $54 million, improving roughly 26% year-over-year. Our cash position at quarter end was approximately $110 million, of which $96 million was in cash and cash equivalents. As I mentioned last quarter, our capital position is a source of strength and gives us the optionality we need to drive the business.With that, let me discuss our outlook for Q4. We are set up well for the future, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us, and it is growing meaningfully every quarter. Our existing contracts give us good visibility for future growth, which is encouraging. Now with an increased level of conversations with enterprises happening on a regular basis, our pipeline is building with major brands at various sales cycle stages. These large deals can be very lumpy. And given the size of customers we are working with, what's meaningful for us may not even be material for them. Accordingly, the Q4 guidance range we are giving reflects that.That said, where we stand today, we feel confident in an outlook of $16 million to $20 million of revenue. And if we deliver in that range, we continue to believe we can achieve adjusted EBITDA positive in Q4. This would be a major milestone for the company and quite the turnaround from levels just a few quarters ago. We are excited about the growth trajectory building into 2024 and beyond. We want to be aggressive with the investments that we know customers are clamoring for. We want to continue to bring our industry-leading solutions to the verticals that we have been discussing, and we want to accelerate the path to customer adoption. With a much improved financial profile, we can catalyze ourselves to another level by continuing to stay focused on the amazing opportunities in front of us.One final note before I close. In our upcoming 10-Q, you will see certain revisions to financial information from prior periods. These changes relate to the accounting for completing -- for the completed financial transactions we had, and these revisions will impact line items, including other income and expense and certain balance sheet metrics, but will have no impact on the results related to reported revenue, gross margin, operating margin, adjusted EBITDA or cash balances. Again, specifics will be detailed in our 10-Q.To summarize, it is clear the generative AI use case waves that are starting to hit ashore, and we are fueling title forces. As I have said before, each quarter brings its own unique dynamics, and we know the path forward isn't always linear. We are focused, committed to delivering meaningful business and customer outcomes and are laying the tracks for long-term profitable growth and strong returns.Thank you, and we will now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gil Luria with D.A. Davidson. The first question, Keyvan, the Jersey Mike's addition is a very substantial one. They have 2,600 stores. And so as we think about -- you talk about what the ARR would be when fully deployed with all these current customers before you even bring new ones in. How do we think about the time line to get there? So you're talking about dozens of stores rolling out for White Castle, which represents White Castle maybe a 400-store chain. So that represents a certain deployment. Is there an inflection point where there's enough units with enough track record that encourages other franchisees to accelerate? And can we apply the same percentages to a much bigger chain like Jersey Mike's? Yes, absolutely. Great question. So first, this really highlights that our strategy is working and our offering is really resonating. The AI and automation can save cost, increase revenue and improve the user experience and our restaurant customers really see that. It used to be that we had to go and educate them. Now they are more coming to us and they become more like automotive companies that they know they need voice AI. So it's been a big shift in the last year or so. And we will share more in upcoming announcements about these 2 brands, but I can share some quick highlights now.So Jersey Mike's is AI, our AI solution for Smart Ordering over the phone. These brands usually start small with a couple of locations before they expand. But in this case, we are actually very proud that they will start with 50 locations initially, and they go, of course, is to expand to the numbers that you mentioned. So we are encouraged by the initial number that is much bigger than in other cases that we had experienced. And we hope that once they experience the good quality of our solution, they will grow quite fast. We will again share more in an upcoming announcement more detail about the partnership.And so the other brands that I was sure you going to ask about the Krispy Kreme, that's actually a Dynamic Interaction solution to support the drive-thrus. Keyvan, maybe if it's okay, can I just add a couple of elements on there, if that's all right. Yes. And I have kind of 3 promises maybe just to build. Number one, of course, the characteristics of each restaurant is different. Some have franchisees where you have to kind of have multiple conversations, some are fully corporate. So there's -- and different franchisees have different -- sometimes they take the corporate technology downwards. Sometimes you need to have multiple conversations. That can affect the time line a little bit. The other thing that we're really excited with some of these restaurants and a lot of these conversations are very fluid. So I'll just be generic like we go in with product 1, and we can build up with product 2 and 3. A good example is like Smart Answering. We go in with Smart Ordering and we add on Smart Answering or vice versa and some of these other employee assist capabilities that we're bringing. So we actually see that these ARRs per franchise can also grow, which is very exciting.And then just the last thing, which is ultimately you want a product where the consumer loves it, covers it, that's where they want to go. And there's technological things that both Keyvan mentioned, and obviously, you can add a lot more depth to this. But one small example, things that we're focused on, for example, where we're going to get towards fully unsupervised learning and help that robustly really accelerate how our product works. To get the more data in the insights in that we can then on an unsupervised way just improve rapidly, gives us a lot of confidence of how we can improve the technology concurrently with how we scale this across different locations. So there's a lot to be excited about here. Yes. So Nitesh, on your guidance, obviously, a really big milestone crossing over to positive adjusted EBITDA. But you gave us a range on revenue and a point on adjusted EBITDA. Are you saying that even at $60 million revenue, adjusted EBITDA can be positive? And then the extension of this question to say, now that you're going to hit this milestone probably earlier than expected, what -- how do you see the trade-off between growth and profitability in your new framework with the new staffing levels that you have? Yes. First, maybe I can work backwards on your question, if that's all right, because they are interrelated. The trade-off is key. I think that they sort of work together. One is you want to build a healthy financial profile. And by the way, breakeven will be a milestone on our long-term journey towards what we believe is a predominantly software AI business, we can get very attractive margins over time as we scale. So we need to have that long-term vision at the forefront of every decision we make. And as you know very well, the AI space is rapidly evolving, and we have to be thoughtful. When customers are sort of clamoring for this capability from us because there are labor pressures, and they really want to help their employee base and we want to go and attack that opportunity. We don't want to sit back and say, ""Well, we got a cut over here. So we'll come back to you in 9 months."" Like that doesn't really work for our customers. So we got to be very cognizant of that.The other thing that sort of plays out is just that over time, we need to be primarily, I think, focused on the disruptive market opportunity we have, but we'll be cognizant of capital base and so forth. And we're not -- we did a lot of the capital raising earlier this year, and we put ourselves in a really strong position. But I think building that solid foundation profile is critical. So maybe using that long-winded comment to hit your first part of your question. It's a range we provided on revenue. I think I want to give directionality on adjusted EBITDA. Like frankly, generally, I think of that as sort of a midpoint and then you could go up or down. So at the low end, that will obviously put pressure on that, and then it will all be contingent on some of the choices we make. I'd say, at the higher end, even more confidence, right, that we'll be crossing through that.So I give that as a bit of a rough estimate. But obviously, to your point, the range on revenue. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are working on a multitude of pretty sizable deals, of which the probabilities are not certain. And so it depends on how those play out. And some of those things, if they pivot a bit a month or a few weeks or a few days here or there, it can affect how the particular quarter plays out, but I can confidently say that what we're building into 2024, the stabilization and the improvement in the financial profile, and it's hard for me not to go retrospectively back to where we started this year and say we've really made amazing strides to get our situation in a much better position. And then even more meaningfully, the traction we're getting with customers, some of the brands you're starting to hear, and by the way, there's a lot of brands that we just can't announce that's a conversation we're continuously having with them. That's the momentum we need to keep building into 2024. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of that context. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Palani with JMN Investments Research. I'm Vivek on for Mike Latimore of Northland Capital. I have a couple of questions with me. And the first one is, did you have a 10% customer in third quarter? Yes, we have -- we do disclose our customer concentration in our Qs, and we do have a few customers that do contribute a meaningful part of our total revenue. They currently tend to be on the auto side. We've announced and we have in our public materials, some of those great partners actually in this prepared remarks, we talked about a few of them. So yes, we do have some customer concentration that's heavy in the auto today and the products that we're building with restaurants, and we talked about a couple of those brands in the prepared remarks, that's really what we're building. So the short answer is yes. And they're great partnerships. We're expanding, growing, adding more. And then I'd say they're massive global enterprises. So for us, there's also a little bit of diversification that we get diversity of that contribution across the globe. So like in the autos, we participate with same brand in America, and we take the same brand in the Asia and Europe, et cetera. Okay. The next question is, can you please elaborate on any partnerships that are generating strong leads or bookings? Sure. I'll give you maybe a little bit of context on -- again, back to the autos, maybe I'll back up a step. So in the auto space, we've talked about partners like Hyundai and Stellantis. These are long-term partners for us. We scale differentiated, added new capabilities. We got cloud capabilities in the cockpit of the car. We've extended to edge, hybrid. We're providing different capabilities with Stellantis. They publicly announced in Europe, amazing technological leap ahead with the generative AI solution where hopefully, you could take a peek at some of what they published in terms of the capabilities of what we're bringing to car to ask a whole array of different things. You're on a long drive and you have young kids in the back and you want your car to tell your kids a story to put them in a bed like you can do that. You can ask directions. You can find out what happened in the game yesterday.So we're expanding, and those are going to be critical pillars for us for a long time. And by the way, I think we mentioned it a lot in the prepared remarks beyond auto, some of the nonauto product companies, the IoT space of the TV manufacturers. We talked about coffee makers that we're excited to be partnering with. So on Pillar 1, as we characterize voice-enabling products, there's a lot of great customers and partners that are contributing meaningfully to our bookings number.Pillar 2, the restaurant side, actually kind of -- we're kind of -- and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks that we dimensionalize a little bit more on the ARR side, and I noted a couple of points there. So last time we talked about, we were building partnerships with at scale, full deployment across their ecosystems with the restaurants that we worked with, White Castle one notable one. This time we talked about Jersey Mike's and others. Last time, we were at about 1,500 locations that has gone up to 4,500 locations. The ARR last time I mentioned was $10 million, that's gone up to $25 million. So just to give you a sense of the pace, that is rapidly growing. So that will be an increasingly part of our book of business.But frankly, we're not stopping there. It's beyond even restaurants into more customer service verticals that we can go after, personal care and onwards. And ultimately, what we're trying to do is build -- and we've talked about this before in our 3-pillar strategy is bring Pillar 1 voice-enabled products together with voice-enabled services and Pillar 2 and provide Pillar 3 monetization opportunities. And when you see the intersection of being able to drive around and access the type of food or drink that you want, when you want, how you want it, you can see how that can build over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little characterization probably a little bit more than you were asking for. Yes. That helps. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright. I guess, first, could you help give a little color on how we should expect the kind of cadence of maturation for a relationship like Olo? Is this something that takes 6 to 9 months just to educate before you can actually push out to some of their individual vendors? That 6 to 9 months is behind us. So we already did the integration and the partnership and when we announced actually whether at the maturity level, we are already live with merchants that use Olo in production. Perfect. That's helpful. And that gives us access to 77,000 locations that use Olo. Perfect. And then just given the momentum on the restaurant side, do you guys have the capacity to implement where you need to? Or is there a fair amount of hiring you need to do there to help you out with that process? No, absolutely, we are ready. And in fact, I think we are -- I believe, the only player in this market that is able to serve SMBs. So most of our peers have to only target brands that have thousands or high hundreds of locations because onboarding is a massive undertaking for them. But for us, a lot of those steps are automated, so we can actually sign up a single location, sandwich shop that -- and we can onboard them very quickly, and we have quite a few of those. Great. I appreciate that, Keyvan. And then last one, just quick. Any negative impact from the auto workers strike here in the U.S. over the last few months? No direct impact. First, I'd say on the immediate, we don't work with the big 3 in the U.S. Stellantis is a big partner for us in Europe, and we haven't seen an extension impact to them. Maybe in terms of opportunities, maybe that conversation slowed a little bit, but like no, we don't -- there's no direct impact. To the extent that things permeate down, we haven't really seen an impact from that. We're watching it. It seems like things are moving constructively. But yes, there's -- for us, no is the short answer. Great. I appreciate that, Nitesh. Congrats on the progress, guys. Thanks so much, Scott. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's program.

Once again, we broke a new quarterly record for revenue this quarter, which surpassed $17 million and was up 80% year over year. We are winning new customers and expanding with existing ones. We continue to create value for our customers, their customers, and their employees while delighting users with our technology. At the same time, we are also driving efficiencies with an 80% year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
At SoundHound, we've made 2 important predictions for the future of AI. The first is that AI customer service will be as necessary for every business as WiFi and electricity. Second is that speaking will become the primary way we interact with the devices around us. We believe voice and conversation is the most natural way to interact with technology, and fortunately for product creators, they can bring their products to life by simply adding a tiny, inexpensive microphone. These predictions are the foundation of our 3-pillar business strategy.
Let me start with our first pillar where we power products such as cars, TVs, and IoT devices. We have a mature history in Pillar 1. We went from 0 to over 20 automotive brands in just a few years. These brands represent over 25% of the automotive industry, and we've added several brands just in the last few months. We powered TVs from legacy giants such as VIZIO to exciting new innovators such as Telly. We are in millions of devices and process billions of queries from cars, TVs, and other forms of IoT devices. Our customers choose us because they believe our technology is the best, and we help them protect the brand, users' data, and because we partner with them to differentiate and innovate.
Then something incredible happened. The introduction of large language models and generative AI created a positive disruption in our field. While the big tech companies were disoriented and have been scrambling to make their own models, which could take years, we were able to swiftly integrate multiple generative AI models within a matter of weeks. Our integration was clever due to our years of experience and technology foundation and that introduced our SoundHound Chat AI product with generative AI. SoundHound Chat AI can integrate with real-time domains and can go back and forth between multiple models seamlessly in a single conversation session, and is able to utilize even multiple models for a single query. For example, the driver of the car can ask for real-time weather, request sightseeing recommendations that match the weather conditions, ask follow-up questions, then request to start navigation to one of the recommended destinations by simply referring to it, such as, can you navigate me to the second option you recommended?
SoundHound Chat AI has seen rapid adoption. Launched in early 2023, we are one of the first companies to show how generative AI could be integrated into a voice assistant. While others are still only making broad claims to generate headlines, we've been building applications for generative AI, thanks to our proprietary technology, which helps mitigate hallucinations and other issues that are inherent with unmanaged generative AI models, our applications are already live in production and in the hands of consumers across the world.
Let me highlight a few examples of our momentum and progress with SoundHound Chat AI. Immediately after it became generally available, auto brands saw the potential to increase in-car voice AI usage and improve the user experience using our product. That's because this is not just a simple API integration, but a seamless back and forth between large language models, content domains, and the onboard features of the car, such as the navigation system.
Throughout last year, we piloted our technology across a range of high-profile OEM brands. We found that by adding generative AI capabilities to in-vehicle voice assistants, the frequency with which drivers and passengers engage with it increased multiples and the user satisfaction increased significantly. The enhanced performance of SoundHound Chat AI for automotive has created numerous opportunities, and we are proud to announce that it has become the first in-car voice assistant with generative AI capabilities in the world to go live in vehicles beyond just an experimental pilot.
Last year, Stellantis started a pilot with DS Automobiles, and due to the incredible results, they announced going live in production in 18 countries. Recently, more brands such as Peugeot, Opel, and Vauxhall, have announced their plans to utilize SoundHound Chat AI. Given our strong partnership with Stellantis, we expect many more brands to go live into production this year. SoundHound Chat AI is increasing the product quality and user delight, but we also expect it to lead to an increase in revenue with a higher royalty rate for customers that choose to adapt, SoundHound Chat AI is enabling automakers to add value to their drivers' experiences with new functionality. We believe we are at the very beginning of a refresh that will bring exciting new opportunities for car manufacturers, drivers and SoundHound as we upsell these new features.
In addition to SoundHound Chat AI, we also launched a new incredible product called SoundHound Vehicle Intelligence in the fourth quarter. Drawing on SoundHound's voice AI allows automakers to simply and easily voice-enable the car manual. This means that drivers can use voice and conversation to ask about settings, special features, troubleshoot and more without having to spend time and effort leafing through a cumbersome printed document. SoundHound Vehicle Intelligence is another innovation that we expect will improve product quality and increase our revenue.
We are working closely with well-known EV brands and have been gaining strong traction with luxury brands as well. For example, we won the business for a prominent U.S.-based EV major to voice enable their full fleet of market-leading vehicles. In addition, we significantly extended and increased the volume of our existing committed contract with a large auto OEM until 2037. Creating value in our Pillar 1 category is not just limited to automotive. We also license our technology to smart TVs and many IoT devices. For example, we've integrated our AI voice assistant with Telly, a [ newly-started ] smart TV provider. Another customer, VIZIO, an integrated platform for cutting-edge smart TVs, is a strong opportunity with our monetization model using voice commerce such as ordering food, groceries, and supplies on the TV, which is typically the largest screen in the most social setting of every home.
For IoT devices, the use cases are endless, and we are working with more companies every day to extend or go into production in multiple areas such as with large appliance manufacturers, telcos, airplanes, robotics, printers, wearables, coffee machines, and kiosks, among many others. We are also thrilled that in Q4 we have a notable revenue contribution from a preeminent AI chip company. Although this company has been a close partner for us for a number of years, this was the first time we generated licensing revenue from the partnership, and we expect more value will be realized from this partnership in the future.
Moving on to Pillar 2 where we offer AI customer services for businesses such as restaurants, home services, personal care, and professional services. As we predicted a year ago, AI customer service is now outperforming it. User adoption is on the rise and consumers are increasingly choosing to interact with conversational AI due to its reliability and extended capabilities. We believe disruption in the customer service industry will be one of the first major commercial applications for generative AI and large language models. It is also becoming affordable and accessible to merchants of all sizes. Businesses are beginning to see AI as a necessity, just like WiFi and electricity.
We now have a proven scale in Pillar 2 as well. Today our technology is live in about 10,000 merchant locations. We are fully engaged with over 100,000 locations in our pipeline, and we have over 30 million businesses in our near-term addressable market. We are at the very beginning of what generative AI will bring to the world, and we are emerging as a market leader by offering applications with real-world use cases. There are 2 very clear reasons that we believe we are leading here. First, our solutions are built on proprietary technologies, and we alone own the entire technology stack. Second, our solutions are fully automated and therefore easily scalable and capable of serving brands of all sizes, from the largest brand in the world to your local favorite shop on the corner. We are offering easy-to-use, easy-to-implement solutions that make a real and immediate impact.
I'll share some examples across our various offerings. Our SoundHound Smart Ordering product uses voice AI to support businesses by answering all inbound phone calls, taking customers' food orders and answering numerous questions, allowing restaurants to free up their staff to focus on making food and engaging with customers in the store. Jersey Mike's, a chain with over 2,000 locations, went live in Q4 with Smart Ordering and is rolling out at a rapid pace. Targeted for an initial 50 locations, we've already reached that goal today, and we expect them to expand the partnership based on the solid results to date.
White Castle, our first drive-thru offering, continues to ramp up production. We are on pace to reach our goal of 100 lanes by the end of 2024. So far, we are also seeing our order processing of under 60 seconds, which is significantly faster compared to humans. In Q4, more large restaurant chains chose to integrate our voice AI ordering solution to help automate in-store operations, including Church's Chicken and a large hamburger chain located in the South, which have approximately 2,700 locations we can integrate our solution into.
With these larger deals for our voice AI solutions, we're also seeing a number of customers look to bundle these solutions with our other offerings. For example, we deploy our new SoundHound product called Employee Assist as restaurants look for multiple offerings to gain efficiencies in ordering and with employees. SoundHound Employee Assist is a gamechanger for businesses. It uses conversational voice AI to support restaurant employees like a copilot across a variety of tasks via their headsets. For example, it can provide ingredients and allergen information to customers. It can also train employees with step-by-step instructions to ensure the product is prepared correctly without them ever having to remove their gloves, consult a manual, or distract another staff member, significantly reducing the stress on the worker.
Another incredible SoundHound product, Dynamic Interaction, is our multimodal, full duplex voice interface for kiosks, drive-thrus, or any device with a screen. We are working with a number of partners and customers and our pipeline keeps growing. For example, Krispy Kreme has selected Dynamic Interaction. As you can see, our portfolio of restaurant solutions is taking shape and major brands, from convenience stores to multinational restaurant chains, are taking notice. They come to us to improve their order process, experience and accuracy of the order, while at the same time improving their bottom line. Today we have restaurant solutions live in all 50 U.S. states and now we are expanding internationally. With 25 languages in our arsenal, we believe we have a massive opportunity to go beyond English-speaking countries.
Next, Smart Answering is our phone answering solution that goes beyond restaurants and can be used by any company and any industry. With this product, we are empowering businesses of all types in how they respond to customers on the phone, allowing them to capture every business opportunity while also mitigating [ cost ]. Smart Answering can handle multiple calls at once, 24/7, conveniently filters out spam calls, saving hours of wasted time for any business. It also provides SMS responses, captures leads with intelligent messaging that asks important follow-up questions in addition to verbal answers around policies, [ hours ], products, services, pricing, and more. We are already live with customers with Smart Answering and the feedback is very, very positive. Given the Smart Answering experience is fully automated, we can easily offer this product to smaller businesses that in the past wouldn't have access, and to massively increase our ability to scale and offer this solution with no touch onboarding for any business, we've been piloting a self-service ecommerce approach in Q1 and seeing early adoption.
Let me talk about SYNQ3. Following up on the announcement of our acquisition of SYNQ3, we've begun the integration of their exceptional team with SoundHound. SYNQ3 brings more than 20 national and multinational chains spanning drive-thrus, fast casual, and casual dining segments, as well as convenience stores to SoundHound's fast-growing customer base. Examples include Chipotle, Casey's, Applebees, Panda Express, Papa John's, and 5 Guys. Because our voice AI is fully autonomous and does not use humans in the loop to perform, we are also able to rapidly scale our deployment without any degradation in quality. For instance, with SYNQ3, we recently completed the rollout of voice AI ordering to 2,400 Casey's general stores, which also is one of the largest pizza chains in the U.S. Jointly, we are combining nearly 2 decades of SoundHound AI innovation with decades of SYNQ3 industry expertise and established relationships.
Together, we will accelerate the deployment of leading-edge generative AI capabilities to the industry while ensuring that our technology always works to preserve the best interests of our customers, their customers, and society more broadly. The combination makes SoundHound the preeminent global provider of voice AI for restaurant, significantly extending our market reach. Although we only closed the transaction in Q1 of this year, we are already seeing tremendous momentum with their customers and the ability to offer them additional solutions such as Dynamic Interaction, Smart Answering, and Employee Assist. The synergies are already taking hold, and we are moving at a rapid pace.
As I mentioned earlier, we have 3 pillars: royalty from voice-enabled products; subscriptions from voice-enabled services; and the third pillar is monetization from connecting those services to those products. For example, drivers of a SoundHound-enabled car will be able to use their voice to order food by just talking to their car, and can do so before arriving at the restaurant, or they can make appointments to get a haircut, book a flight, or perform other types of transactions. We believe this will create the future of the voice commerce ecosystem, and SoundHound is in a unique position to realize this vision thanks to our strong footprint in both devices and [ services ].
With our expanded national restaurant reach, we see an acceleration of our Pillar 3 monetization strategy via transactions in millions of cars, TVs and IoT devices. We believe this is a powerful business model which could add significant value to all participants. We would collect a fee for generating new leads for merchants and facilitating transactions, the store or restaurant benefits from the new customers being channel in their direction, and the automakers and the device makers take a share of this economy. Most importantly, the end user will have the convenience of using their voice to get things done. We are excited to see our portfolio of customers using voice-enabled services continue to grow, which should allow us to begin to pilot this new commercial ecosystem.
In closing, our revenue has grown on an average of over 50% over the last 4 years. This incredible growth during challenging times and against global market headwinds is a testament to our strong foundation, demand for our technology, and great partnerships we've built with some of the most well-known brands in the world. Going forward, we expect to maintain this strong growth and see massive opportunities to accelerate it even further beyond this year. The timely AI revolution is creating tailwinds in our favor. We believe that SoundHound has a unique advantage with its own IP, 2 decades of experience building trust with global customers, a trove of data, and a track record of innovation to move fast and invent our way forward. We remain at the forefront of conversational AI, and that's why we have been working on Polaris, our multimodal, multilingual, generative AI foundation model, which could be another important tool for us as we position ourselves as one of the leading and major forces in this new era of AI.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance, key growth drivers, and outlook for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue increased by 80% year over year. We finished 2023 with accelerating momentum, and we are seeing exceptionally strong interest from enterprise businesses, most notably within the restaurant and auto sectors. In fact, demand for SoundHound solutions is so high that we now have a healthy waitlist of restaurant merchants, and we're calibrating our resources to ensure we deliver for the customers. While we continue to be mindful of our pathway to profitability, delivering against this demand is paramount.
The exceptional growth we realized was coupled with cost containment. We focused on cost discipline this past year and we'll continue to do so. For the year, adjusted EBITDA improved by over 50% and in Q4 our results were even better with 80% improvement. Excluding certain costs that were necessary to fuel our growth and transformation brings us close to the positive Q4 adjusted EBITDA target we laid out last quarter. For example, the near-term impact of switching to big 4 audit firm PwC midyear while becoming a large accelerated filer and upgrading some of our internal tools contributed to the majority of these costs. We expect these expense pressures to lessen as we go forward.
The underlying drivers behind the remainder of the expenses are positive indicators of our future. First, we saw some tremendous growth opportunities in the second half of the year that we chose to invest in. We saw significant demand from enterprise restaurants in particular. Second, we saw a great opportunity to inorganically accelerate our go-to-market motion and capture a sizable and meaningful restaurant customer portfolio. The acquisition of SYNQ3 clearly positions us as the leader in the restaurant AI space. Lastly, we accelerated investments in our administrative functions, notably around internal processes and controls, to ensure we have an even stronger foundation for the sustained long-term growth we expect to deliver.
We fundamentally rearchitected this company in 2023. We are more efficient, more focused, even more nimble, and aggressively driving disruption and growth across voice-enabled products and services. Accordingly, we are updating a metric we have previously shared in what we call cumulative subscription and bookings backlog, which includes our previously reported cumulative bookings backlog to also now include new subscription revenue streams that we are focused on. Cumulative bookings backlog takes into account the prior quarter-end balance plus new bookings in the current quarter, minus associated revenue recognized. Cumulative bookings backlog is still derived from committed customer contracts and this definition remains the same as the previous one.
Subscription backlog takes into account customers where we are the leading or exclusive provider and assumes a 4-year ramp to fully scale with a total 5-year duration. We have incorporated reasonable assumptions about adoption percentages, with lower percentages applying to pilot and proof-of-concept customers. We believe we can outperform these assumptions given the faster rollouts we are currently experiencing and expectation to work with these partners for much longer. Similar to the previous definition, we do not include expected auto renewals for our Pillar 1 customers. This allows us to combine our Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 businesses into a single unifying metric.
As we have communicated before, our cumulative bookings backlog mainly represented our Pillar 1 businesses. In Pillar 2, we have previously noted that ARR standardizes the annual subscription like potential of these contracts, while also indicating the better stability and predictability building in our financial model. That said, 2 different metrics on 2 different timescales doesn't synthesize our full potential in an easy-to-understand manner, so we believe this updated figure is more representative of our medium-term revenue potential. Ultimately, we are addressing a greater-than-$100 billion rapidly growing market. So this new metric gives you a view of the tangible customer activity we have won within that larger opportunity set.
In Q3, I mentioned our cumulative bookings backlog was $341 million, with automotive being the largest constituent. I also mentioned that separately in the restaurant vertical that at full scale-out we would have 4,500 locations signed up and roughly $25 million in ARR. When we look at the combined potential of our signed-up customers at the end of 2023, across both Pillars 1 and 2, our cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog was $661 million, up nearly 100% year over year on an apples-to-apples basis, thanks to growth in Pillar 1 and the incredible list of customers we have added in Pillar 2.
Let me now get specific on our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. In Q4, revenue was $17.1 million, up 80%, and within our guidance for the quarter. Full year revenue of $45.9 million was also within the outlook set at the beginning of the year. Revenue growth in Q4 was predominantly driven by automotive royalties, with strong increase in units offset by slight decreases in average selling prices due to a higher volume of edge licenses that generally have a lower royalty than our cloud licenses. Note that particularly with some of our new generative AI solutions and ultimately with monetization, we think there are meaningful opportunities for unit price expansion.
We also benefited in the quarter by a strong multiyear commitment of minimum guarantee volumes of our edge solution with an automotive partner and a new IP licensing opportunity with one of the preeminent AI chipmakers that Keyvan referenced earlier. Over the full year 2023, we increased auto units by 68% and active cloud users by 55% versus the prior year, and over the last 4 years we have delivered an overall compounded annual growth rate of greater than 50%.
In Q4, our gross margins were 77.2%, up over 600 basis points year over year, largely resulting from the greater scale in our business. This helped drive gross margins above 75% for the full year, also up over 600 basis points year over year, as we increased our revenue sequentially every quarter and at the same time improved our cloud and data center efficiency throughout the year.
R&D expenses were $12.7 million in Q4, a decrease of 41% year over year, resulting largely from our corporate restructuring actions earlier in the year. Despite the expense reduction, we continue to invest in disruptive innovation and expand our existing suite of products with solutions like Dynamic Interaction, Smart Answering, Employee Assist, Vehicle Intelligence, and SoundHound Chat AI.
Sales and marketing expenses were $4.5 million in Q4, a decrease of 34% year over year, also, due to the aforementioned restructuring. We continue to invest in go-to-market and customer engagement. As mentioned earlier, we are seeing tremendous momentum and heightened customer demand, largely resulting from the investments we have been making in sales and marketing. We will continue to invest in high ROI, demand generation, and brand awareness to ensure we further build upon the current traction.
G&A expenses were $7.6 million in Q4, an increase of 3% year over year. The increase in G&A reflects 2 elements, some of which was not contemplated when we guided last quarter. First, part of our spending was related to diligence, negotiation, and closing of the acquisition of SYNQ3. Second, we accelerated investment in financial and nonfinancial processes and internal controls to support requirements under SOX 404(b) as we became a large accelerated filer. In total, these additional expenses, as compared to prior Q4, amounted to over $3 million and were the primary factors not fully encompassed in our previously provided adjusted EBITDA outlook.
Across all operating expenses, noncash employees stock compensation was $6.5 million in Q4. As a result, our operating loss for Q4 was $12.4 million, which reflects an improvement of 57% year over year. Likewise, for the full year, we saw improvements in our operating loss of 35% as we successfully grew the business while maintaining cost discipline. OI&E was $4 million of net expense for the quarter and net loss was $18 million in Q4, an improvement of 42% year over year. This led to a net loss per share in Q4 of $0.07 compared to $0.15 in the previous year, an improvement of 53%.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash charges of stock compensation, acquisition costs, restructuring and depreciation and amortization, was a loss of $3.7 million in Q4 2023, which was an 80% year over year improvement and a sizable dollar reduction, down from an $18.8 million loss in Q4 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the entire year ended 2023 was about $68 million, improving roughly 27% year over year. Our cash position at year end was approximately $109 million, of which $95 million was in cash and equivalents. Given additional actions we have taken in early 2024, our current total cash balance is in excess of $200 million. Our capital position is unequivocally a source of strength and gives us the security and optionality we need to drive the business forward.
With that, let me discuss our outlook for 2024. We are committed to continuing to fuel strong growth, with cost discipline and returns focus. We expect to expand with our existing automotive partners and add Pillar 1 customers. We expect our Pillar 2 businesses to grow meaningfully and increase from less than 10% of our total revenue in 2023 to more than 20% in 2024. We see the overall top line growing to within a range of $63 million to $77 million, with $70 million as the midpoint target. As we look further ahead to 2025, we believe we will cross $100 million in revenue and deliver adjusted EBITDA profitability.
Our gross margins have been in the range of 70% to 80%, providing a strong indicator of our software business profile. Since we just completed the acquisition of SYNQ3, while we work on migrating their cloud and AI infrastructure to our own, we expect to have a temporary decrease in gross margins due to some of these duplicative expenses. In addition, while the majority of SYNQ3's revenue is AI-driven, they also have a legacy call center operation which their team has been gradually upgrading with AI. We expect to further accelerate this migration, which will ultimately calibrate their gross margins to ours over time. As a result, we expect the combined company will show a onetime gross margin decrease in the early part of 2024, with steady improvement towards our historical levels as we get to the latter half of 2024 and beyond. Overall, though, we see this acquisition as roughly EBITDA neutral over 2024 and accretive beyond.
Lastly, let me comment on expected revenue seasonality for the year. Our mix of business will shift through the year, as I described, to a greater mix of Pillar 2, but we will start the year more automotive heavy just as we ended 2023. As such, we remain affected by the seasonality in the automotive sector, which tends to be higher in Q4 and lower in Q1. Again, in 2024, we see our quarterly revenue building through the year and back end weighted. We believe we can grow our business roughly 50% year on year each quarter. Let me close by rearticulating our excitement about what lies ahead. Generative AI and large language models have created a generational technological shift. The old way is out. Customers are increasingly realizing they need partners like SoundHound to help pave the way forward. We are balancing the massive long-term opportunity with the inherent near-term volatility to navigate towards our goals, and we are bringing conversational voice AI to consumers everywhere so they can seamlessly access the information and services they covet through the products and devices they most interact with.
Thank you. We will now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Good quarter. Can you talk about, do you expect more strategic partnerships from a distribution perspective to happen over the next 6, 9 months? And is that going to be a big focus from a go-to-market? Yes, definitely, in our Pillar 2, we see that as a big contributor. We have partnerships with, for example, Olo and Toast and Oracle and Square as channel partners, and they help us reach a larger number of merchants. And in Pillar 1, our customers are generally very large. For example, we just signed an extended deal out to 2037 with one of the largest automakers. That's a lot of commitment for a very long time, so it shows a lot of trust. Okay. And then can you just talk about how the conversation with customers is changing? It seems like the vision has been there, but now you're starting to actually see the traction. Does it feel like it's more strategic in terms of conversations you're having, whether it's on restaurants, autos? Maybe you could just compare conversation today to even 6 months ago. It's totally different, Dan. The demand is going through the roof, and we are dealing with more demand than ever before. We have, for example, very large customers, like multinational chains with tens of thousands of locations, we actually have to put them on hold to deal with someone who's a little bit bigger, so it's a temporary problem that we're dealing with, but it's a really good position to be in. So customers are now coming to us, whereas maybe 12 months ago, even 9 months ago, we were actually going after them, knocking on their door. They are now knocking on our door. Our next question comes from Gil Luria with D.A. Davidson. I have one product question, one financial question. The product question, chip company, what's the nature of that revenue? Are they incorporating your technology in a chip? And then when they sell it into devices, you're getting a license revenue, or is it a different type of arrangement? And how does that scale once the chip makers incorporated the technology? Yes, actually, it was not a channel partnership, it was a direct revenue. So the company paid us for our IP, and we've known this company for a number of years. They're a close friend, close partner, and this was the first time we generated revenue from their relationship, so we are incredibly excited about it, and we expect more positive things to come out of it in the future, but that's as much as we can share today. So then maybe another product question. You mentioned a large or high-profile EV maker in the U.S. Does that mean that you can now send the technology over-the-air updates? Because part of your gating factor so far has been incorporating into new cars only as they ship. But I think the EV makers, based in the U.S. at least, the 3 that I'm thinking about, allow for over-the-air updates. They already have a microphone built in. So does this type of deal make it possible for you to deploy your software a little more quickly and to a bigger set of automobiles, as opposed to only the ones that get shipped? Yes, absolutely. Especially for our clouds, we could replace an existing solution, or sometimes they don't have a solution, so we could actually go to legacy cars and power them too. In this particular case, it would be for new cars and older cars that have already been sold. And maybe one thing to add, Gil, I think, a part of your question is about pace of scale. The other thing we're super excited about, as Keyvan mentioned the prepared remarks, is around generative AI opportunities that we're already adding with existing customers. So it's a build on top, and it really unlocks so many different use cases for us, and there's tremendous demand. So I think the opportunity of scaling faster and doing more per unit, revenue per unit, is a big opportunity for us. So then on the new backlog metric, I want to make sure I understand the duration. So it sounds like on the subscription side, you define the duration as a 5-year duration. What's the duration on the booking side, on the other side, on Pillar 1 that used to be, I believe, 6 years. Is it still the 6 years or are you now harmonizing, it is also a 5-year duration? No, great question. The current one is basically because they're committed contracts over the duration. So it's not like we're harmonizing. We're actually based on whatever is in the contract. So, in Q4, we actually had some deals that extended it. So I'd say the average of that -- I think when you take the weighted average of the full portfolio, it's still about that 6.5 years. But the actual device side, the product side did extend because we got some deals that extended the duration of the device for the Pillar 1 product. So the way, like you said, we, on the subscription side, made it 5 years to standardize, but just like we used to do with cumulative books backlog, we just tie to whatever the contract length is. Hope that makes sense. Our next question comes from Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright & Co. First, I was hoping I could get a little more color on your visibility into '25 and maybe why you're comfortable putting out a target today. Yes, I think it's a couple of different things. One is we're building and we're making choices to build a multi-year roadmap, and we're not playing short term, quarter to quarter, even 2 quarters. So I think with the pipeline we're building, with the customers we're working with, with the investment we're making to try to scale, we're getting increasing confidence beyond just this year. And we thought it made sense, frankly. We, through last year into this year, were giving mile markers only up until the 1-year mark. And so I think that with the bookings backlog type metric that we were talking about, there's a lot of good visibility. And frankly, it's like where we're sitting today in February, early in the year, and we know there's just a lot more pipeline and traction that we're gaining. So we felt confident enough to give an early read of 2025, which we'll obviously calibrate as we go forward. But I think it's really a sentiment of confidence and commitment we're seeing from our customers. That's helpful. Now, does that include any additional M&A or any potential deal you would do in the future would be on top of those figures? Yes, it doesn't require it. I will say we're super excited about the SYNQ3 acquisition and what it can bring. So from that vantage point, the 1 plus 1 equals a lot more than 2 opportunity we have with them. And then in terms of future opportunities, we'll continue to look. We think it's a very dynamic market with a lot of potential opportunities organically and then even possibly inorganically. So we certainly have nothing on the horizon to talk about there. But the numbers we laid out do not require it. If something structurally changed there, also it, obviously, as you know very well, depends on the flavor and the size and the type of M&A that possibly could be out there. So if something we do changes that architecture of that ramp, we'll let you know. And then on SYNQ3, I'm curious if you could give us something in terms of dollar terms, maybe what the upselling/cross-selling revenue synergy opportunity is there, or even as maybe a percentage of their legacy revenue. Yes. Let me try to think of the best way to unpack it. First of all, they bring this great portfolio of customers. We articulated the likes of Chipotle, Papa John's, Applebees, Firehouse Subs, it's -- just amazing are some customers that we're early days of having some of those conversations. We certainly had a thesis when we acquired them as to what the possibilities could be. And I'll just tell you, early days are even more exciting of what we can do together. To your point, cross selling, our solutions bringing together the different voice solutions, upselling some of the Employee Assist capabilities, Smart Answering, there's so many conversations going on. So I'm going to a little bit punt to later to give you better tangible visibility. But the roadmap we've laid out, we believe SYNQ3 will be a big contributor on that.
The impact I mentioned to margins, and particularly as they've been evolving the call center business to AI, that is an evolution we'll work through together. There is definitely -- anytime when 2 companies come together, there's a lot of work to integrate, and we're in the middle of that. But long term, I just want to clarify again, we're talking a restaurant space that for us is billions and billions of dollars of annual revenue opportunity, and we're just scratching at the surface of it. And together, I think, we can go faster in capturing a greater and greater share. We also think when we look out at the competitive landscape, it's mostly greenfield. We don't think people out there have comparable tech, not certainly in what we're seeing in terms of fully-automated solutions. And most importantly, the restaurant demand, it's exactly what they need. They have labor shortage, they have cost pressures, and they need consistency of service. And this is a solution that fits very well. So in terms of the organic opportunity is tremendous with SYNC 3. We're very excited about the synergies and the upside. And then the revenue outlook and even maybe to your first question, us coming together gives us confidence to give you a, call it, put a flag in the ground on what we think early signs of 2025 are. But I would just tell you, we wouldn't put that out there if we didn't think we could do that and even more. Our next question comes from Glenn Mattson with Ladenburg Thalmann. So, I just wanted to talk a little more about the comment that was made that perhaps some customers on the restaurant side have been put on hold for a little bit in terms of because demand is just overflowing your ability to fill it right now. So I'm curious if that means that there's got to be more hiring involved, or maybe it's more of a learning process as you've scaled up from more smaller mom-and-pops to national chains and whatnot. And perhaps there's a learning curve for both sides of the equation whereby the process of implementing the software will get faster over time or that thing. Maybe you could just give some color on your thoughts there. I'll start, unless Keyvan wants to get out on top. First of all, yes, we're constantly learning. This is a new market. We're disrupting, we're growing, we're improving every day. I think, we're learning a lot, frankly, also with the acquisition. One of the things SYNQ3 has been really good at is scaling very quickly. And I think we can come together and drive improvement coupled with -- one of the beauties of our solutions, being software, it can really scale very quickly once you get the integration with point-of-sale systems, get menu ingestion, some of those things done right. And every time we add a new customer, it really expands the market of other customers we can go to that we could really rapidly accelerate. So there's a lot of positive build effect here that we can build and we can continue forward with. On the investment side, yes, we definitely want to go after the growth. When the demand is there, we don't want to say no to any customer. We want to be thoughtful of the roadmap. So we will absolutely look at our hiring and make sure that we're calibrating it. And I wanted to jump in before Keyvan, just to put my point of view, like it's always going to be cost discipline focused and so forth, and we'll be very judicious. But I think that we know the opportunity there. We're not going to shortchange it by any stretch of the imagination. So we're certainly going to invest to make sure we're capitalizing on the demand. Yes, that's all that. And I would just add that the hold that I mentioned, we are talking about days and weeks, not really months or anything beyond that. And then last for me just on the model side. I think, Nitesh, you said that historically you've been 70%, 80% gross margin. And I guess theoretically, if you get to that north of $100 million 2025 revenue target that you put out today, a lot of the growth will be on the restaurant side or the SaaS side, which theoretically would be, I think, higher margin than the auto. So would you have us model towards the higher end of that range for 2025? I won't guide gross margin for 2025. I'll leave the guidance as I laid it out, but I will give you some color commentary to dimensionalize it. So, absolutely, long term, we are a software business, and so the margin profile should certainly be well north of 70%, and we think the EBIT margin should be 30% plus. And that's at scale, fully penetrated, I'd say multiple years down the road. We want to make sure we're investing in the near term. And then I would also say to your specific question on gross margin, I don't think it's as clean as Pillar 2 versus Pillar 1, because it depends. Even within Pillar 1, some of our edge solutions are very high margins. So it depends on the mix across both.
But I do think, yes, we'll be marching back to the 70% range, and then part of it will also be, this is going to be new where we bring on the call center business, which we'll continue to -- I think we look at Pillar 2 and the restaurants as the first gate on major disruption across customer service. I think we've said in the prepared remarks, generative AI in particular, one of the major disruptive areas is customer service, with very natural conversations to enable consumers to just seamlessly access information and services that they want.
So with that, and the reason I mentioned that is, we believe that we can scale that really quickly, and we can leverage the call center capability to get the data and the actual production, live customer interactions that will help improve our model. So there's going to be a bit of a journey to extend beyond restaurants into different verticals and finding that right mix between, maybe there is an advantage because the customer really demands a little call center support as if you go from, like, we can do the base 80% of the answering and maybe some part isn't. But those are things as we grow into Pillar 2 we'll calibrate on. So that's why I can't give you a precise answer right now. I will tell you, though, yes, long term, we absolutely should be growing back in the 70% range, but we need to keep going through the work and get closer to that finish line to give you an exact on what 2025 will be. Right. I know a lot of moving parts. I understand. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Congrats on an excellent year here. So last quarter you highlighted a lot of restaurant wins like White Castle, Jersey Mike's, Krispy Kreme. What percent of those opportunities do you think you might get deployed by year end? And what are the keys to getting there, whether it's internal work or leveraging third parties? Yes, depends on the customer. So drive-thru is a little different than phone ordering. We've publicly, last year, made joint announcement with White Castle about our opportunity to scale into 100 locations this year and we're on the pace. And that has some requirements of the drive-thru set up on the hardware side, and so that's a bit of the gating, pacing. They're a company that has full corporate ownership, so that's a little bit easier to fully deploy. Get into another type of customer that has franchisees, again, that's one of the gating points. Jersey Mike's is an opportunity in phone ordering. They have, I think, over 2,000 locations at scale and went out of the gate with 50 locations that we're pushing through. And so this can move really rapidly. So I guess not to [ answer ] your question too much, but it depends on the shape and flavor of the customer. And we are getting faster. Every week that goes by, we're learning and we're pacing it faster and faster. So we're hopeful that this is why maybe one dimensionality of the answer would be the assumptions we used in the subscriptions estimate that we gave 5-year, which we believe conservatively will ramp over 4 years, and we use the 5 year duration. So if you want to use the 4 year that I conveyed as the measure, I think that's conservative, again. We're going faster than that. But that's maybe not to set too high expectations too early. That's probably a safe place to think. Yes, that makes sense. And on SYNQ3, I think they had something like 10,000 locations, I believe. Do you feel like you could apply your tech to all those locations, or is there a percent that's already happy with what they have? The solution is already great, but there is an upgrade opportunity by combining what they have with what we have. And then there's upsell opportunities by offering things like Smart Answering and Employee Assist to existing customers. And we're pursuing both of those. And I'll also add, Mike, there's also an efficiency opportunity for us as we migrate their back end systems, the cloud systems migrate to our technology. So it's also backend not only just our front end, and that's a cost opportunity for us. I guess, just a basic financial question. What do you think SYNQ3 contributes in '24 and what is current share count? So in '24, it depends on the synergies and so forth, but they have a good book of business that we're growing. The reason we're hedging a bit is some of it is the AI and call center, that we're going to migrate the call center to AI. We're going to upgrade. So there's a few choices through the integration. Again, we're still pretty early in the integration process, but we're excited about the fleet of partners that they have and really mostly about the synergies that we think we could build. But it's all contemplated in our guidance, and we think together we can accelerate even faster than we could have alone. Share count, I think it's probably 270 million-ish, I don't have the number right in front of me, on the Class A side is probably where we are. We have, I think, I mentioned in the prepared remark, some capital raising that we've done this year to get the balance sheet over $200 million of cash. So that is about where we are. Our next question comes from Brett Knoblauch with Cantor Fitzgerald. It was nice that you gave us some info on, I guess, the year over year growth in auto units. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some type of indication for how many units or devices your technology is currently embedded in and if that's something you could foresee giving us on a more frequent basis going forward. We are in the millions. We have considered disclosing the exact number. One challenge is that some of our customers don't give us unique device IDs, so then it makes it more difficult to accurately measure. So it might all look like one device, but it might be on many devices. There are ways to interpolate that, but definitely we are in the millions of cars and TVs and IoT devices. The other measure we do give, and we put it in the press release, but it's the queries, which is another an indicator of usage and activity. And that has been growing. It's been growing. We've been giving that number for a couple of years now and crossing 3.5 billion run rate is an indication of the breadth and also just the usage curve increases that we're excited about. And then on maybe the restaurant business, I guess, any updates of how many units you guys are currently deployed in and what you're targeting for end of this year, I think, White Castle you're expecting to be in over 100 by the end of the year, but maybe more broadly speaking, given you expect Pillar 2 to be north of 20% of the business this year. Yes, I'll break apart. We do with SYNQ3 now have thousands and thousands, right? They brought a big arsenal of restaurants, the likes of customer names I gave a little earlier. And then we're always growing and have these massive deals that are currently we're working on that it's tens of thousands of potential opportunities. And I will say the pricing can range, if you're in the phone ordering, you could be in the hundreds of dollars per location. If you're in drive-thru, it could be more north of thousands. So really on our more advanced state could be well beyond that of tech. So units and location are going to be driven by the integration pace. We believe we are unpacking and addressing a market that has hundreds of thousands of locations. So what we have today is a small fraction. And I'd say in the U.S. alone, it's a million food establishments and globally, multiples of that. So we are going to grow from the 10,000 range by the end of the year quite meaningfully. And then hopefully we'll be soon talking about hundreds of thousands that we're in and the revenue numbers will follow. Thank you. Showing no further questions at this time.

Thank you, Scott, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Once again, we are reporting very strong growth. First quarter revenue was up 73%. Just a few days ago, we reached the milestone of being a public company for 2 years. While the tough external conditions of the last 2 years to 3 years have weakened or eliminated many organizations, we have become stronger. We've nearly tripled our first quarter revenue in just 2 years, while better leveraging our expenses. And we have more than doubled our cash position to its record high of approximately $225 million on the balance sheet.Our 3-pillar strategy is working. This quarter was a special quarter for our Pillar 2, where we offer AI customer service solutions for businesses. About 30% of our revenue was from Pillar 2 with over 10,000 locations live in production and over 100,000 in our pipeline. Just a year ago, these numbers were negligible. And for the first time, our next-generation drive-thru AI service, Dynamic Interaction is now live with one of the top global QSR brands and the results are incredible beyond expectation. The main challenge our customers face on the first day of being live with Dynamic Interaction was that our AI was so fast at taking orders that their kitchen could not keep up with the pace. Of course, they are addressing that on their side and are pleased with the results and immediately decided to expand to more locations.As we've said before, our AI solutions save costs for our customers, improves the experience of their users and also increases revenue by adding throughputs and proactively offering upsells. Dynamic Interaction is a SoundHound technological breakthrough like no other. We believe its impact on voice and conversational interfaces will be as meaningful as the Apple multi-touch technology on touch interfaces. If you have not seen it in action, check out the videos on our website. We have built a competitive moat with our proprietary technology that is creating a massive opportunity in customer service. We have agreements executed with several other large QSR brands that will be deploying Dynamic Interaction in the next few months, for example, Church's Chicken.The earlier version of our drive-thru AI experience has been live for several years and continues to thrive. White Castle continues to expand its footprint with more locations opening, including one of their busiest locations next to Disney World. Another major QSR with over 2,000 locations uses our AI for drive-thru and continues to expand our offering to more locations as they add more drive-thru capabilities to their existing in-store and takeout services.Next, our Smart Ordering offering continues its strong adoption. Smart Ordering uses our voice AI for answering all inbound phone calls to take customer food orders and to answer numerous questions, allowing restaurants to free up their staff to focus on making food and engaging with customers in store. We handle millions of calls per month, and we power national brands such as Chipotle, Casey's, Firehouse, Noodles and Five Guys. Last quarter, we announced the pilot with Jersey Mike's. The pilot was successful, and they're adding more locations. We also expanded with Applebee's and now have our voice AI offering across multiple franchisees, resulting in an additional 500 locations this quarter alone.We introduced a product called SoundHound Employee Assist, which uses our conversational voice AI technology to support employees like a copilot across a variety of tasks via their headsets. We already have several customers benefiting from this new service, and we will have more to share soon. Last year, we expanded our AI customer service offering beyond restaurants with Smart Answering, a product that handles multiple calls at once 24/7, conveniently filtering out spam calls, providing verbal and SMS responses, taking configurable actions, capturing leads with intelligent messaging and answering questions about policies, hours, products, services, pricing and more. Smart Answering is showing rapid growth within Pillar 2 and already has hundreds of locations signed up from single location small businesses to brands such as Planet Fitness.We estimate our Pillar 2 total addressable market to be over $100 billion with over 1 million restaurants and approximately 30 million businesses in North America alone that we can offer our solutions to. And with dozens of languages we already provide to our Pillar 1 customers, we plan to also go international in Pillar 2. We believe with large language models and generative AI and most importantly, the data science and machine learning behind our proprietary software, the time is now. Very few companies can offer businesses of all sizes and affordable, fast and easy-to-implement solution that addresses their growing needs. While other point solution providers and legacy call center vendors are trying to evolve their offerings to include AI, we already have a fully automated and therefore easily scalable solution. We own our tech. We have big data from real interactions and nearly 20 years of experience. This is why we are winning.Moving on to Pillar 1, where we power products such as cars, TVs and IoT devices. Within this category, our customers choose us because they believe our technology is the best, and we help them protect their brand users' data and because we partner with them to differentiate and innovate. We power millions of devices in dozens of languages. And this quarter, we reached an annual run rate of over 4 billion queries and in Q1, it represents a growth of more than 60% year-over-year. Last year, we announced SoundHound Chat AI, which combines the power of large language models with our AI assistant, making it more capable and powerful. This is an upsell feature that will increase royalties from existing customers and its unmatched quality is helping us win new customers.Last quarter, we talked about DS Automobiles being the first to quickly run a trial run to live production, which was unprecedented with car manufacturers. We have signed up new brands for SoundHound Chat AI, including Opel, Peugeot, and Vauxhall due to the success of their launch. And now this quarter, we are pleased to add Alfa Romeo and Lancia. We also went live into production with Stellantis vehicles in Japan.With our customer, Stellantis, we have been the first company anywhere in the world to launch an AI voice assistant integrated with ChatGPT into vehicles. We are also pleased to have been awarded a design win for our first automobile customers in Latin America with Stellantis. This is a brand-new competitive win. We also continue to gain interest and make progress with EV manufacturers. For example, a deal we won last quarter with a prominent U.S.-based EV maker, will voice-enable their full fleet of market-leading vehicles later this summer. This means we have gone from signing to in production in a matter of months, thanks to SoundHound's industry-leading capabilities and market-ready products. Additionally, we won a deal with a leading Asian electric car manufacturer to embed our software that aims to bring affordable and luxury electric cars with powerful engines. This is a brand-new automaker we have not announced before.This quarter, we announced the collaboration with NVIDIA during the GTC Conference. The solution we are partnering on combines SoundHound Chat AI with large language models running in vehicle on NVIDIA DRIVE for seamless voice interaction. Together with NVIDIA, we can now deliver in-vehicle generative AI responses with no connectivity required. We are also now partnering with ARM and have been officially added to their partner program. More to come on that later this year. Just today, we announced a partnership with Perplexity, which will bring cutting-edge online LLMs to SoundHound Chat AI. This allows us to offer a truly multifaceted next-generation voice assistant to phones, cars and IoT devices.SoundHound Chat AI will leverage Perplexity to provide accurate up-to-date responses to web-based queries that static offline LLMs cannot currently answer, expanding the type and complexity of the questions the assistant is able to answer. The move makes SoundHound Chat AI, the most advanced voice assistant available on the market today. We believe we are the only voice AI platform to be able to quickly provide this unified integration, combining our own technology seamlessly with third-party providers. We have also reached an important milestone with Polaris, our multimodal, multilingual generative AI foundation model. Polaris now beats our latest state-of-the-art speech recognition model in terms of accuracy, speed, model size, and [ run cast ], which already beat the other vendors we benchmarked against by a large margin, including models provided by the big tech.Polaris is now live in production with a growing percentage of our customers, and we will continue to provide updates on its progress. We believe voice AI is a bigger opportunity than just conversational AI. Our data and know-how along with our continued investment in this level of R&D will strengthen our position as a leader in our space. As I mentioned earlier, we have 3 pillars: royalties from voice-enabled products, subscription from voice-enabled services, and the third pillar is monetization from connecting those services to products.As we increase the notable names that we sign every quarter, and this quarter is no different, we get one step closer to mobilizing this third pillar, significantly increasing our addressable market while creating new, more convenient and accessible consumer experiences. We believe Pillar 3 will create the voice commerce ecosystem of the future, and many customers are signing up in Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 in eager anticipation of us rolling out this monetization strategy. We are excited to see our portfolio of customers using voice-enabled services continue to grow, which should allow us to begin to offer this new commercial ecosystem.In closing, we continue to build a strong business and fortify our financial position, all while gaining market share. We couldn't be more pleased with the demand we're seeing and the high praise we are receiving from the customers we are serving. With another quarter of strong growth and notable customer wins, our momentum continues to grow. We remain passionate about what we do, and that has not changed in the 20 years since we founded the company. We look forward to continued strong growth and creating value for our stakeholders. We are grateful to our amazing team that makes this all possible, as well as our customers, partners, investors and shareholders.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance, key growth drivers and outlook for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 revenue increased by 73% year-over-year. The results indicate another positive mile marker on our growth journey in which we exceeded $11 million in revenue in our seasonally smallest quarter of the year. We like where we are today, and we are excited about what we are quickly becoming. Our AI solutions attractively reside at a critical intersection. Macro factors like persistent inflation and wage pressures drive many of our customers towards automation for productivity.Concurrently, consumer demand for increased speed and convenience drive our customers towards automation to accelerate throughput and increase revenue. AI connects this intersection seamlessly and generative AI massively extend the value proposition further. The penultimate result is high consumer interest in SoundHound. With our recent acquisition SYNQ3 now fully in the mix, the benefits of integrating this pioneering restaurant tech organization with our years of voice AI innovations are clear. And the breadth of coverage we now have in the restaurant sector is so exciting and showing up in overflowing customer activity. One of the measures we use to gauge that traction is backlog. Last quarter, I introduced a combined Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 customer demand metric called cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog.In Q1, we saw approximately 80% year-over-year growth to $682 million with an average duration of about 7 years. As a reminder, this measure includes new subscription revenue streams and our traditional royalty contracts. The methodology for our Pillar 1 contracts has not changed. We include only committed customer contracts for exactly the duration of the contract period and capture various facets of the deal in total contract value like construct. These facets include minimum commitments, target volumes, professional services and other arrangements. We do not include renewals until the renewal takes place, even if contracts include auto renewal provisions. For subscriptions, cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog takes into account customers, where we are the leading or exclusive provider and assumes a 4-year ramp to fully scale with the total 5-year duration.We have incorporated reasonable assumptions about adoption percentages with lower percentages applying to pilot and proof-of-concept customers. Furthermore, this metric does not include pipeline opportunities, for which we have well over a 100,000 location opportunity for Pillar 2 alone. This metric is intended to directionally convey our medium-term revenue growth prospects.Before I walk through the financial results for the first quarter, given the impact of the acquisition to various aspects of the GAAP financials, we are introducing 2 new non-GAAP financial measures for gross margins and EPS to help investors better track how we manage the business operationally. I'll share more context in the relevant sections below.Q1 revenue was $11.6 million, up 73% year-over-year. We saw growth in Q1 across all major industry categories. Pillar 2 represented approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter, combining organic growth with positive contributions of roughly $3 million from the acquisition of SYNQ3. We also had a strong quarter in Pillar 1 as automotive royalties went up with volume increases year-over-year. Auto units and cloud users both expanded strong double-digits in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see growing demand in our generative AI solutions, and we are seeing meaningful opportunities starting to be realized for accelerated unit price expansion. We also signed a multiyear commitment in the TVs and devices category, and that led to strong double-digit growth from devices in the quarter.In Q1, our gross margins were 60%, down year-over-year, largely resulting from the acquisition, including the mix of lower-margin call center agent business. On a stand-alone basis, gross margins were up year-over-year. Adjusted for acquisition impacts, notably, the noncash amortization of purchased intangibles, gross margins would have been 65.5%. This is the non-GAAP gross margin metric I introduced above. While the call center business does pressure margins in the near term, we are excited about what this new capacity can do for broader business opportunities and equally so for the valuable training data it provides our AI models.That said, our goal over time is to automate and modernize. So we expect gross margin improvements through the year and ultimately back to premerger levels. R&D expenses were $14.9 million in Q1, an increase of 5% year-over-year. We have streamlined our R&D costs, increased efficiencies, and are prioritizing investments in disruptive innovation to expand our suite of products to address a wider array of customer needs. We are accelerating the training and deployment of large language models to provide even more value to customers, enabling us to open many doors and a wide variety of new conversational AI use cases.That said, we will continue to be thoughtful and opportunistic with greater emphasis on bringing unique value through best-of-breed large language models, including multilingual ASR foundation models, generative AI solutions, and voice AI capabilities that intermediate and arbitrate between our own models and partner LLMs. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.5 million in Q1, an increase of 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest in go-to-market and customer engagement to capture the strong momentum and heightened demand, and we are expanding reach through brand and industry marketing, demand generation and high ROI lead-gen strategies. Our sales reach continues to expand with both direct sales and through an amazing ecosystem of strategic channel partners.We know the best go-to-market ROI comes from customers loving us. And this quarter, with one of the largest QSRs, we were introduced to their executive management team as the best partners their team has ever worked with. G&A expenses were $10.3 million in Q1, an increase of 41% year-over-year. The increases in G&A reflect 2 main elements that we talked about last quarter. Our year-over-year comparison continues to be impacted by investments in financial and nonfinancial processes and internal controls to support requirements under SOX 404(b) as we became a large accelerated filer last year. And this quarter also factors in acquisition-related costs. All operating expense line items were impacted by the SYNQ3 acquisition as well as higher employer-related tax costs and increased compensation.Noncash employee stock compensation was $7 million in Q1. As a result, our operating loss for Q1 was $28.5 million. This included noncash acquisition impacts related to the fair value accounting that will likely introduce volatility into this line for the foreseeable future. OI&E was $4.2 million of net expense for the quarter, and net loss was $33 million in Q1 compared to $27.4 million in the prior year period. This led to a net loss per share in Q1 of $0.12 compared to $0.14 in the previous year. Adjusting for noncash acquisition related amortization of purchased intangibles, fair value adjustments, M&A transaction costs, stock-based comp and other noncash items, our non-GAAP EPS loss was $0.07 in the quarter.This is a measure we will continue to report upon in future quarters given it better normalizes the ongoing operating results of the business. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $15.4 million in Q1. The year-over-year decrease was a result of the previously mentioned higher operating costs as well as the SYNQ3 acquisition impact. Net cash used in operating activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024 was about $21 million. Our cash position at quarter end was $226 million, of which $212 million was in cash and equivalents. With this strong cash position, we have given ourselves some great optionality to drive the business forward and further improve our financial profile.We entered a new ATM program in the quarter to provide us with capital raising flexibility, although our balance sheet and forward projections indicate we don't have any time-sensitive capital raising needs. It would only be necessitated strategically either for capital structure optimization purposes or if another attractive acquisition opportunity presented itself, where the economic value merited it. All that said, we don't take this strength for granted and are committed to being prudent stewards of capital, focusing on creating long-term sustainable growth and profitability.With that, let me discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and pleased with our top line performance, coupled with the demand we are seeing in Pillars 1 and 2. And we are driving new opportunities in Pillar 3. We are ahead of pace in having Pillar 2 exceed 20% of total revenue mix this year, and we see that mix increasing as we go into 2025. Given the Q1 performance, we are raising the lower end of our guidance and narrowing our initial range, which steps up our midpoint to $71 million.Therefore, our revenue guidance for the full year is now $65 million to $77 million. We continue to believe the right expectation for subsequent quarters is roughly 50% year-on-year growth. We hope to outperform, but at this stage, we believe this is the appropriate expectation. Furthermore, we still expect to cross $100 million in revenue and deliver adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025. As I noted last quarter, the increased cost impact on gross margins and adjusted EBITDA is temporary, and we expect both to improve as we move forward. With the SYNQ3 acquisition, we are working on migrating their cloud and AI infrastructure to SoundHound, so in the immediate term, we have some duplicative costs.In addition, while a portion of SYNQ3's revenue is AI-driven, they also have a legacy call center operation, which their team has been gradually upgrading with AI. We expect to further accelerate this migration, which will ultimately calibrate their gross margins to ours over time. Overall though, based on initial conversations with customers and partners, we are making great progress, and there is strong interest to even further increase the value we create for customers.I'll close with another note of conviction in the business we are building. As I've said before, the path forward isn't always linear. In particular, creating disruptive transformational innovation is not for everyone, but it's a strong part of SoundHound's DNA. When the pieces start falling together though, there's a gravitational force at play. With our proven track record of progress, as each quarter passes, we get closer to our escape velocity. Despite our achievements so far, we don't take our success for granted, and we fight for it every day to aim higher and push the boundaries further measurably and persistently.Thank you. We will now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gil Luria from D.A. Davidson. Yes. A lot of product announcement and advances. Let me focus on a couple of the ones that seem most intriguing. The first one around the NVIDIA in-vehicle. It would be a big step forward for the whole technology around AI to do the inferencing without connectivity. What's the time line do you think that you can deliver this to one of your automotive customers? So that's one. I'll bundle the second one on product, which is, on the Perplexity, it sounds like you're going to be leveraging Perplexity AI in the SoundHound Chat AI app. Is there a potential down the road for the SoundHound technology to be the front-end for the Perplexity app? Thanks for the great questions. So on the -- so the NVIDIA announcement, as you noted, very big milestone because these generative AI large language models are very large. Typically, they don't fit on the edge, but with this partnership, we are able to run them on the edge, and a lot of the functionality will not need cloud. You still need cloud, like if you want real-time weather information or sports scores, you need some cloud connectivity. But for a lot of the functionalities, whether it's from general knowledge to getting things done inside a car or a device, you actually don't need the cloud connectivity. We think that the use cases are beyond automotive.In automotive, things take longer, especially when you're talking about hardware change. For software, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we are actually -- we had one case when we went from signing the deal to going to production in a matter of just a few months. But when you talk about the hardware change, that takes longer. But we think it's not just about automotive, even for QSR, Dynamic Interaction, drive-thru automation, you could actually bring some of that to the edge. So we are excited about things that can happen faster with that partnership. For Perplexity, it's not just about our Chat AI app. Our Chat AI is also a platform we offer to our customers, like automotive customers and beyond.We will offer it to them as well, and it will be for additional -- it's an upgrade feature, right? So they have already upgraded -- a lot of them have already upgraded from our pre-LLM versions to add the Chat AI feature. And as I mentioned again earlier on the call, that's an upsell. So our royalty, we expect it will go up. Now to access to the online LLM, it will be another upgrade moment for us. So it's very much beyond the Chat AI application that's on the phone. Now you also asked if we would power Perplexity properties, we haven't announced anything yet, but it's a beginning of a partnership we're excited about. We are both NVIDIA portfolio companies, like NVIDIA invested in us and then we are very complementary. So we think there's a lot more we can do with them. Nitesh, one for you, a little big picture. Last year, you were very effective at changing your overall cost structure to fit, frankly, what the capital markets needed you to do, which is to show a clear path to profitability. You did that very effectively. You reached that point. But as you sit here today, with significant cash on your balance sheet, much lower burn rates, and the long series of opportunities, a couple of which we just discussed, is there a potential or an opportunity for you to move the lever a little bit the other way and say, hey, we have so many opportunities on the technology front that maybe we need to fund more of those and relax a little bit of that shift to profitability? Yes. Thanks, Gil. I'll start by saying principally, we're trying to drive and create long-term value for customers, and we're seeding and hearing the demand. And we're seeing how the technology opportunity is intersecting with that consumer demand real-time and expanding, frankly, every conversation we have with customers. So I think the opportunity in front of us is tremendous. And so I don't think that gives us a carte blanche to just go spend, spend, spend. We do need to be thoughtful about the pathway and have conveyed our directionality towards getting to a breakeven profile next year.But to your point, I think there is more opportunity that we're seeing every day in terms of active conversations with customers to really go faster to invest in the solutions. I think, certainly, your first question on the opportunities in the auto is certainly there, and we're seeing that, especially with the speed that we're able to move with some of the EV players. But more broadly, on the restaurant side in particular, in customer service, there is just so much demand. We highlighted in our prepared remarks a bit around the traction that we're getting with larger and larger QSRs. The larger and larger QSRs for us could be at scale with them hundreds of millions of annual revenue -- recurring revenue, so that we see the size of the [ prize ] in the short term.And we also know given the ecosystem is so very dynamic, a lot of new players, a lot of new technologies that are advancing very quickly, tremendous pace of innovation going on, we need to stay agile. And so that's why the balance sheet is super important for us to have this real arsenal in our back pocket to be thoughtful. We will do it very judiciously and prudently with capital mindfulness around driving strong returns. But there's a balance in all of that. So I can't give a sort of unidirectional statement. I know ultimately, the principle that we govern our choices on investments around is it really creating value for customers, and are we hearing that? And as the echoes get louder and louder for that, we're going to go and serve those consumer interests. So I hope that's not too opaque of an answer for you, but that's how we think about it. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Yes. Congrats on all the developments here. Maybe can you just talk a little bit about the synergies you're seeing with SYNQ3 so far? What kind of cross-sell opportunities are you seeing and have had? Are you able to leverage some of their data to train your models? And then are you able to use some of their resources to help with deployments? Yes, I'll start and maybe Nitesh can add more. But absolutely, we see the synergy. We are -- it was a fantastic acquisition. We couldn't be more proud of it. Every day, we feel it. They had -- they have a ton of data, and we are already using that to make our models better. They have a lot of integration, and it's not just about offering a magical AI model that does everything. You have to go and integrate with POS systems. And a lot of these enterprise customers have their own in-house systems that you have to integrate with -- they have to -- analytics and menu management and so on. They have a lot of that, that we are using to accelerate our scale with our organic customers as well and they -- so on the technology and data side.But the synergy between the 2 companies in terms of experience -- we started as an AI company. We identified restaurant as a very right business to go into. They started as -- they were restaurant operators, and they identified automation as a good business to get into. And we started nearly 20 years ago each, and then they became more AI, we came into restaurants, but they understand that industry really well. And that experience is what we needed to improve our scale as we go forward. Yes. And I'll just add a couple of points on that. I think I kind of break it up into 3 categories. Revenue, there's a lot of opportunities in terms of the cross-sell, upsell Keyvan alluded to. I'd say on top of that, just the relationships they bring and some of the extended conversations were happening much faster than what we would have been able to do alone. That's happening at accelerating pace. And then just the ability to bring our core engines along with what they've already built, I think is an accelerant with their own customers but also with new customer relationships.So from a revenue standpoint, this is the multi sort of medium longer-term opportunities. We just get even more excited several months into the acquisition from the thesis we had going into it. On the cost side, we've talked about a couple of these, Mike, and I'd say these are -- we're in the midst of this journey, but there are some back-end costs in terms of cloud migration that we're in the middle of driving. There are architectural things in the software stack that we can bring our own, again, capabilities in, go faster than what we were doing, learn from learnings on both sides. So there's cost elements that you'd certainly didn't see in the Q1 numbers because the Q1 numbers sort of reflect a lot of both acquisition transactional stuff, but also just the, call it, unsynergized cost structure, that's not even a word, but that's what we're doing on the cost side.And so I think over the next quarters, you'll see more of that efficiency drive through. One specific thing is the gross margin, and I commented about this in the prepared remarks. But gross margins were depressed in the quarter, but this is okay. This is on plan. We know that they have a call center business and we, over time, will be migrating that to automation. Be able to leverage the real-time production data is gold to be able to improve our models. And so we're in process of driving that on our own. And just to put some data points out there, you didn't ask it, but SoundHound's gross margin year-over-year on a stand-alone basis was up over 300 basis points.So we're still driving the great margin profile, but we're going to have this transition with SYNQ3. And then lastly, I'll just say the innovation opportunity in terms of synergies and notably, again, data. Data is so important here, real-time, improving our models. And just again, being able to come together and go, boy, this really matters to customers, to be able to talk to their operators in 10,000 locations to say this is what matters to the restaurant ecosystem and to make our products more attuned to what they need, those are the types of things we're very excited about. So we could go much longer on this, but I know it's a short call, so I'll stop there, but there's a lot we're excited about. Yes. All right. It sounds like -- yes, it sounds like great progress out of the gate. And then just real quick on the restaurant vertical. Is there a clear leader here between phone ordering versus drive-thrus in terms of just like what's in the pipeline? Does it skew to one to the other very much here? Or does it kind of balance between phone ordering and drive-thrus? It's pretty -- it's balanced -- well, it is a bit of short-term, long-term answer to that question. It's balanced, and I would extend it to other opportunities, not simply the phone versus drive-thru, but we're excited about some conversations we're having on with a program we call Employee Assist, which is helping in-store employees. There's in-app conversations going on that a lot of restaurants are excited about. Our Smart Answering capability is sort of front-end vehicle on a lot of this is something else. So there's a suite of opportunities.And part of my last answer on innovation, I mean, those are things that are sort of getting incubated here. And then as we've said before, there's sort of a time line of deployment. So we know with drive thru, there is hardware requirement. There are hardware requirements. There are cycles we need to go through. We're building great partnerships with many hardware providers to standardize and move faster there. But that is -- we know that is the breakthrough. Nobody else is doing -- I mean, certainly, we don't disparage competition. We know that there are other players that could come.But right now it's greenfield. We have a unique value proposition that we're driving, and so we want to go really fast. And then even on phone ordering, they have a lot of great partners, and we're growing in that space. And some -- what we find is in certain cuisine types, you see a heavier weighting of phone volume, and so that we're going to service those particular cuisine types more so in that front. So little balanced, but excited on multiple fronts. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Mattson from Ladenburg. Yes. And I apologize if any of this is repetitive because I missed part of Keyvan's prepared remarks. But Nitesh, you just kind of talked about the -- some of the gating factors in rolling out the offering in retail, like some of the equipment that has to be placed in. And I think last call, you guys also kind of talked about the demand just been a little bit higher than you could like handle at the given time and that some customers are kind of put on hold while you kind of like decide who best to serve and how quickly and everything. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out or understand if there's been some change there or if that -- if you caught up to some of that demand somewhat or if there's more investment you need to make to get to that spot and just kind of an update on where you are from that point of view. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. We're working hard. We are making progress for sure. We don't like that -- and by -- even last time, I want to clarify also, we -- it's not that we're talking about months and months out. We are really trying to address some of these things where we've got a bit of a pipeline that we need to work through with those customers. So there's been a lot of progress. You'll see unpacking our costs this time, I know it will be a little complicated with the acquisition, but if I break it apart into kind of 3 pieces, one is just acquisition transitional things, one is the inclusion of sort of acquisition plus other one-time dynamics and seasonal things, and then there's sort of investments that we will continue to make.Again, with going back to Gil's question like this, target of getting to still profitability next year. We are accelerating investment in the right pockets to serve that consumer demand and customer demand. So to Glenn, to your question, we are making sure that we are hiring the right people, investing in the right capabilities so that we can quickly get and serve customers the right way. And so I'd say, we are making really good progress on that. The challenge and maybe a silver lining challenge is that we're hitting a lot more demand too.Every time we have meaningful innovation and progress, the word gets around pretty quickly, particularly in the restaurant side. We're excited actually. I think it's coming up very soon, the largest restaurant conference show in Chicago, and we've got a big showcase ready to go there to just get our word out. So while we are making progress with those existing relationships, the dynamic we're faced with is we're getting more and more demand. And that's a good problem to have, but we don't -- we can't sit back, rest on our laurels. We got to invest to make sure that we're serving customer demand.And so I mentioned in the prepared remarks, with one of the largest QSRs, hearing feedback about the technology moving really well, in fact, the challenge in that situation was the Dynamic Interaction technology was taking the orders too quickly for the back ordering preparation to handle. That's -- obviously, we want to work with them together to get that situation ameliorated. But that's a good sign of the progress we can make. And then hearing comments from our customers about the positivity of working with us, that's what we want to keep fueling. We know that's a virtuous cycle that could keep building. So I think we're trying really hard to keep pace with it. We're investing to make sure we're serving consumer demand -- customer demand. And -- but I will acknowledge we're still faced with a lot of demand that we're trying to work through. Great. That's very helpful and a good problem to have, of course. Second question just for me. The -- I feel like you've hinted at this in the past and maybe in this call as well. But just the outlook for what you're thinking about for future or further acquisitions beyond SYNQ3. Now I realize you have some digestion to do here for that SYNQ3 acquisition still. But curious what your thought process is in terms of what kind of attributes you're looking for in future acquisitions? And what -- how big your appetite is I guess? Thanks. Sure. So I'll start with, our opportunity organically is tremendous, meaning just -- we're excited about what SYNQ3 is bringing. We're excited about what we're able to address. But just with the capabilities we have right now, we know we can do a lot of great things. So we were --- 100%, the organization is focused on driving that, and it could fuel great long-term growth and build an amazing business. The ecosystem around us and the macro landscape and what we're seeing from other players, there's multiple things happening.First, I think the recent shift, Gen AI is disrupting a lot of people. Number two, it's bringing a lot of new players into the ecosystem. So we are certainly not going to sit with our head in the sand and kind of just drive our own agenda. We're going to be very mindful, because number one, it's not just an acquisition story, it's about partnerships, it's about learning from others. And so we're going to take a very holistic view of being very thoughtful of who are the new players. And we have a team dedicated to being on top of this all the time. And so the architecture, we think about any organic investment or inorganic opportunity is through our 3-pillar framework. We are aggressively going out and driving voice-enabled products, autos, IoT, other devices.We're aggressively starting the journey through customer service, leading with restaurants, but our Smart Answering is scaling across others. Keyvan mentioned in prepared remarks around fitness centers, beauty salons, real estate [ agencies ] and so forth, many, many different types of businesses that we are now servicing. And we are now, because of the scale we have, seeing great opportunities in generating momentum with monetization, which is when we're integrating the voice-enabled services with voice-enabled products. And frankly, we see opportunity to drive that organically.And then when we find companies who are doing a great -- they're doing some great things in a particular pocket, we're going to talk to them. And if there is 12 things need to line up for M&A to ever make sense, but certainly, partnerships makes sense a lot, and we're expanding those. We mentioned a few of those on the call today. So we're going to be open-minded. Having a strong balance sheet gives us and affords us the opportunity to be thoughtful. And yet again, we're going to be prudent stewards. So everything needs to be on strategy, needs to be on where the world is moving, what the tech is allowing, what customers want. And in terms of -- I guess you also asked, like appetite, it's all about to me, it's return on capital above your cost of capital, risk-adjusted.And as long as that math works out, then we'll be open to it. But we are a small disruptive company, so it's not always a dollar sign, it's also a speed sign. We want to go fast and continue to disrupt aggressively. So if there's sort of an opportunity that seems like that would slow us down, that's not the right thing. If things that will make us go faster, that's the right thing. So that's the frame we use. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald. On the restaurant side of the business, it's nice to see kind of demand continue to increase there. Can you just talk maybe about where that demand is coming from, from a lead gen perspective? Is it your outbound sales motion? Are they coming to you? For example, like with Applebee's, it seems like that got deployed very quickly. Or is it the POS partnerships that you have with Square and Olo? Just be curious more on that front about the go-to-market strategy on the restaurant side. Yes. Thanks for the question. So it's a combination. We have events that we participate in that [ increases ] awareness, like the one that's coming up, National Restaurant Association. We have now a good-sized sales team. The SYNQ3 acquisition augmented that. But we have seen a big shift that maybe 18 months ago, we had to knock on these doors and educate them about the value of voice AI automation. But now we see them knock on our door. Like, a lot of these brands that we used to dream about talking to, now they are coming to us knocking on our door, and they want to move fast. So there has been a very big change in the dynamic of the market. Perfect. And then on the partnership side, I guess what partnership are you most excited about from a monetization opportunity over the near term? Would it be NVIDIA? Would it be ARM, Perplexity? I guess, any insights into how we should be thinking about those translating into financials? Yes, I think channel partnerships are very impactful when there is a complementary business that has the same customers offering them something else that, then our service on top of it can be very complementary. And they can bring us those opportunities or take our stuff and take it to their customers. Like Olo, for example, is a partnership we are really excited about. Those channel partnerships are very key. But when we can improve our product, we know that it's going to translate to more adoption and more revenue. So the Perplexity partnership that we announced today was along those lines. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm showing no further questions. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",we will begin with some short remarks before moving to Q&A . we'd like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call .,1.0

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Keyvan Mohajer. Please go ahead, Keyvan. Thank you, Scott, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Before getting into the quarter, I wanted to talk about the announcement we made this morning to acquire a conversational AI leader, Amelia. This transaction is a natural extension of our strategy, and we saw a great opportunity to partner with a company that we believe will accelerate our mission of voice-enabling the world with conversational intelligence.
Our vision has always been to create a conversational AI platform that exceeds human capabilities, delivers value and delights end users, creates an ecosystem with billions of products and enables innovation and monetization opportunities for product creators.
Today's announcement is a continuation of that path and now is the time for such a bold move. SoundHound is a leader in voice AI and we have built a platform that we can perfectly leverage to expand into new markets. Coming together with Amelia is an important step along the way in this journey, and we are excited for a number of reasons.
Most importantly, this significantly expands our penetration in conversational AI across new verticals and [ deep ] into hundreds of enterprise brands. We are doing this in end markets that are expected to grow massively over the coming years, with enterprise spending on generative AI projected to grow 15-fold over the next 3 years to nearly $250 billion.
Together, we combine decades of experience in conversational AI. We have a highly complementary suite of products, and we believe we can offer best-in-class, scalable customer service support to a vast spectrum of businesses. The announcement today marks a significant and strategic expansion of SoundHound's existing customer service pillar. We are adding even more breadth and depth to this offering that has already seen substantial growth amid the accelerated adoption of voice and conversational generative AI solutions. Nitesh will provide some more insights into this deal and our overall M&A philosophy later on.
Now on to the quarter. Once again, we are reporting strong growth. Second quarter revenue was up 54% and cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog roughly doubled year-over-year to $723 million. We also saw a steep increase in engagement with our technology. Our annual run rate of queries is now over 5 billion.
We continue to see strong demand for our products, including SoundHound Chat AI in Pillar 1 and our AI customer service solutions in Pillar 2. Our value propositions are resonating with the industry. Customers choose us because they believe our innovation cycles are at a high level and results in powerful AI technology. They also know that we help them protect their brand, users and data. We have accumulated 20 years of intellectual property and technical innovation remains in our core DNA.
Last year, we announced Polaris, our multimodal, multilingual foundation model. Polaris now beats numerous benchmarks against state-of-the-art models in the industry. A growing number of our customers are switching to Polaris. The result is higher accuracy, better user experience, lower internal cost and faster response times. We can also deliver tuning and customizations much faster. These customizations have historically required long and expensive machine-learning training cycles. With Polaris, we can achieve them with just simple configuration changes.
Now let me discuss some business updates in the second quarter. In Pillar 1, we now have cars in production in almost 20 markets and support dozens of languages. SoundHound Chat AI, our voice assistant with generative AI is driving this high demand. DS Automobiles became the first brand to quickly turn a trial run to live production. This was the first in-vehicle assistant with generative AI capabilities to go into production anywhere in the world, and the results have been so well received that Stellantis has continued to integrate SoundHound technology into a large number of models across multiple brands.
In total, we are now live on the road with 6 Stellantis brands, Peugeot, Vauxhall, Opel, Citroen and Alfa Romeo and of course, DS Automobiles. SoundHound Chat AI combines the power of large language models with our AI assistant, making it more capable and powerful. This is an upsell feature that will increase royalties from existing customers and our booking this quarter increased as a result. This is important to emphasize.
While historically, there have been constant pressure from auto OEMs to lower their costs, for the first time we are seeing their appetite to pay more. They want to upgrade to SoundHound Chat AI to deliver a much better user experience to their customers, and they're willing to pay the additional royalties to do so. Therefore, we expect our revenue per unit in Pillar 1 will increase over time as more customers adopt the generative AI innovation in SoundHound Chat AI.
Last quarter, we talked about being the first company to roll out this technology integrated in vehicles in Japan. And now this quarter, we are also pleased to have signed a new contract to be the first company to roll out ChatGPT-style capabilities to in-vehicle voice assistants in Latin America. Initially, this will be with 3 brands and go into production in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
We also continue to gain interest and make progress with EV manufacturers. Earlier this year, we won a deal with a prominent U.S.-based EV maker, which will go live immediately. SoundHound Chat AI will be integrated across its full fleet of market-leading vehicles. This will mark the first U.S.-based OEM to integrate an assistant with generative AI capabilities. Additionally, we have expanded with an existing customer, a fast-growing EV manufacturer in Europe, to add SoundHound Chat AI to their digital assistant.
Last quarter, we also announced a partnership with Perplexity to bring cutting-edge online LLMs to SoundHound Chat AI. This has allowed us to offer a truly multifaceted, next-generation voice assistant to phones, cars and IoT devices. Perplexity helps SoundHound Chat AI provide accurate, up-to-date responses to web-based queries that static offline LLMs cannot currently fulfill, expanding the type and complexity of the questions the assistant is able to answer. The move made SoundHound Chat AI the most advanced voice assistant available on the market today, and we are currently in progress conversations with OEMs about having this capability go live.
Moving on to Pillar 2. This quarter, we won the business of 3 sizable QSRs. This means that in total, we have now won deals with 5 of the top 15 QSRs based on the number of locations. One of the QSRs we engaged in Q2 was a large, well-known pizza restaurant with thousands of locations throughout the U.S. This means that SoundHound is now working with 2 of the biggest pizza chains out there. Each of these QSR brands represents a sizable opportunity to deploy our technology across thousands of locations.
It's an exciting time. We are in a very fortunate position, so how we execute the business at this time will be critical to our performance in this space going forward, and we are mindful of this. Our customer service product portfolio is resonating with businesses of all sizes, so we are winning in large enterprises as well as small chains. It's become clear to us that very few companies can offer businesses of all sizes an affordable, fast and easy-to-implement solution that addresses their growing needs.
We own our tech. We have data from real interactions and nearly 20 years of experience. We believe we are winning because of the data science and machine learning behind our proprietary software. Last year, we introduced a product called Employee Assist, which uses our conversational voice AI technology to support employees like a copilot across a variety of tasks via their headset or a tablet.
We already have several customers benefiting from this new service. Those include some large QSR brands, and I'm proud to announce 2 prominent coffee chains have also signed up this quarter. We are finding that many customers are choosing to sign up for Employee Assist in combination with our drive-thru solution, Dynamic Interaction. They work together in tandem to handle and improve the customer experience, while supporting their employees.
SoundHound Dynamic Interaction delivers what we believe to be the next generation of all voice AI interfaces. It is full duplex, it's multimodal, it does not require constant use of wake-up words and turn-taking, and can be seamlessly multilingual. We believe its impact on voice AI and conversational interfaces will be as meaningful as multi-touch technology on touch interfaces.
Our AI solutions save costs for our customers, improve the experience of the users, and also increase revenue by increasing throughput and proactively offering upsells. Our phone ordering solution are continuing to ramp up with existing customers like Jersey Mike's. And as mentioned earlier, we are penetrating into thousands of pizza chain locations across the U.S. We announced Beef 'O' Brady's, where we are already live in all corporate locations and plan to roll out to 20 states very soon.
Going beyond restaurants, SoundHound Smart Answering is showing rapid growth within Pillar 2. We already have hundreds of locations live from single location small businesses to brands with multiple locations. Last quarter, we talked about Planet Fitness, and we have already gone live and continue to roll out more. We are seeing great traction in franchise retail businesses and across a number of industries. These include personal care, professional services, home and local services, automotive services among others.
We are excited about Smart Answering because the number of industries it caters to opens up a massive market for us to address with millions of businesses in the United States alone. The seamless implementation capabilities allow us to scale fast and the use cases for companies of all sizes are obvious. Whether it's handling multiple calls at once 24/7, conveniently filtering out spam calls, providing verbal and SMS responses, taking configurable actions, capturing leads with intelligent messaging and answering questions about policies, hours, products, services, pricing and more. We have built a competitive moat with our proprietary technology that is creating massive opportunity in customer service.
On to Pillar 3, where we are making great progress and accelerated that path this quarter with the acquisition of Allset. The ordering platform we acquired through Allset enables us to build a voice commerce ecosystem. The acquisition will ultimately enable consumers to use cutting-edge voice AI to order food from their vehicles, phones and smart devices. Additionally, the Allset team brings a wealth of marketplace experience and knowledge that will make a voice commerce ecosystem a reality.
We are creating a new category, and together, we plan to provide dynamic and convenient ways for people to order food and complete a range of other transactions, just by speaking naturally. And as we increase the notable names that we sign every quarter in Pillar 1 and 2, it also helps us get one step closer to mobilizing this strategy. With this strategic move, we have significantly increased our addressable market while creating new, more convenient and accessible consumer experiences.
Our customer engagement with this vision has always been well received, with existing and prospective customers, getting even more interested over time as our portfolio of customers using voice-enabled services grows. We always talked about the flywheel effect with this vision and we are starting to see that take shape.
In closing, we have consistently grown at a rate of 50% or more and continue to fortify our financial position, all while gaining market share, attracting new enterprise customers, and creating some of the most innovative voice AI technology in the world. We are proud of the best-in-class experiences we are creating for our customers and their customers, but our ambitions to keep aiming higher and push the boundaries continue to grow.
As an example of that ambition, today, we acquired Amelia. Amelia is an innovative company that shares our passion for AI-fueled conversations. We are looking forward to leveraging our shared capabilities to offer the best AI customer support solutions available anywhere. We are also pleased to welcome the team from Amelia to SoundHound and are excited about what we can do together.
We believe the disruption in the market for AI we are seeing today is building towards our exact vision when we created SoundHound almost 20 years ago. A lot of our predictions are now becoming a reality. With another strong quarter where we beat market expectations for revenue, we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum we are seeing and the demand for our products and solutions.
We look forward to continued engagements with our stakeholders as we create value. We are grateful to our amazing team that makes this all possible with their shared vision.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nitesh to talk about our financial performance, key growth drivers and outlook for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Keyvan, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 revenue increased 54% year-over-year. The results are another positive mile marker on our growth journey, where we achieved $13.5 million in revenue. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $10 million in revenue. We meaningfully improved our balance sheet in the quarter by paying down our debt and completing the conversion of outstanding preferred equity.
I mentioned before that our capital position is a source of strength and we want to maintain that strength because it affords us the opportunity to go on the attack when it makes sense for us. We do that through organic investments to fuel disruption, partnerships to help scale aggressively and acquisitions to accelerate our pace.
One of the measures we use to gauge customer traction is backlog. In Q2, our cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog roughly doubled year-over-year to $723 million, with an average duration of slightly less than 7 years. Most of the expansion this quarter was in the restaurant space, although we continue to gain traction with automotive partners. For example, with Stellantis adding 5 additional brands going into production with SoundHound Chat AI.
Today, we announced and Keyvan noted earlier, our acquisition of conversational AI leader, Amelia. Let me spend a minute explaining how we think about M&A. First, we believe having a programmatic M&A approach can be value-generating. Our acquisition philosophy stems from our overall strategy and vision, which is to voice-enable the world with conversational intelligence and transform the next wave of how humans will interact with technology, increasingly with voice and natural conversations.
We know the requisite underpinning technology to enable this vision is here now. In fact, we've built a lot of it ourselves, and we continue to see the customer demand and adoption for these capabilities growing. When we acquired SYNQ3 earlier this year, it was an accelerant for our restaurant business.
Last quarter, when we announced the Allset acquisition, it was to catalyze our monetization pillar to connect voice-enabled services and products seamlessly together. Today's acquisition of Amelia is about accelerating more broadly in Pillar 2, customer service, and significantly expanding our industry reach. The primary filters we have been using to select appropriate acquisition targets have been: one, does it fit within our long-term strategy?; two, will it amplify or accelerate our pathway to realize that strategy?; three, can we effectively operationalize it and drive meaningful synergies?; and four, can we buy it at the right price, appreciating the risks that inherently come from such transactions?
Amelia checked those boxes for us. While it would be a meaningful acquisition with a lot of complementarity, we don't take the integration effort lightly and know it will take some time to get it right. But the prize together was too attractive to bypass, in our opinion, especially with the enterprise traction and demand we have been seeing in the marketplace. We just announced this today, so it's still quite early and we know there will be questions, so please note that we plan to share more and dive much deeper on the opportunity we see. Stay tuned for more details.
With that, let me now focus on and discuss the second quarter financials in more detail. Q2 revenue was $13.5 million, up 54% year-over-year. We continue to see growing automotive unit growth of healthy double digits in addition to unit price expansion, driven by our generative AI solutions and overall product expansion. The quarter benefited from a minimum guarantee edge solution purchased by Stellantis and also from a year-over-year basis, the contribution from SYNQ3.
Within restaurants, we continue to scale with customers, sign meaningful new logos and further diversified product offerings. The quarter had nice balance across our pillars, where our restaurant business comprise roughly 25% of revenue.
In Q2, our gross margins were 63%, down year-over-year, largely resulting from the acquisition, including the mix of lower-margin call center agent business. Adjusting for acquisition impact, notably the non-cash amortization of purchase intangibles, gross margins would have been 67%. While the acquired call center business does weigh on our margins in the near-term, there is value in what this business can do for broader opportunities to come and what the data can bring to our models. That said, our goal over time is to automate and modernize.
R&D expenses were $15.7 million in Q2, an increase of 34% year-over-year. We are prioritizing investments in disruptive innovations like our Polaris initiative to expand our suite of products to address a wider array of customer needs, and we continue fine-tuning the way we leverage large language models to provide even more value to customers at less cost. For example, we will continue to be thoughtful and opportunistic about which models we work with versus using our own and always keep the customers need the top of mind. In the end, our ability to arbitrate between models is a differentiator that we will continue to expand upon.
Sales and marketing expenses were $5.7 million in Q2, an increase of 11% year-over-year. We continue to thoughtfully invest in go-to-market and customer engagement to capture the strong momentum and heightened demand. We are expanding reach through brand and industry marketing, demand generation and high ROI lead-gen strategies.
G&A expenses were $9.5 million in Q2, an increase of 48% year-over-year. The increase in G&A reflects 2 main elements that we talked about the past few quarters. Our year-over-year comparison continues to be impacted by investments in financial and non-financial processes and internal controls to support requirements under OX 404 (b), as we became a large, accelerated filer last year. Our G&A was also negatively impacted by acquisition-related costs in the quarter.
All operating expense line items were impacted by the SYNQ3 acquisition. Non-cash employee stock compensation was $7.3 million in Q2. As a result, our operating loss for Q2 was $22 million. This includes non-cash acquisition impacts related to the fair value accounting that will likely introduce volatility into this line for the foreseeable future.
OI&E was $14.7 million of net expense for the quarter. Compared to previous quarters, the increase in OI&E was mainly due to the one-time early repayment of our debt and associated extinguishment costs. We announced earlier in the quarter that we were able to repay the existing debt on favorable prepayment terms, allowing us to avoid sizable interest payments over the coming years.
And the net loss was $37.3 million in the quarter. This led to a GAAP net loss per share in Q2 of $0.11. Adjusting for non-cash acquisition-related amortization of purchase intangibles, fair value adjustments, M&A transaction costs, stock-based comp and other non-cash items such as the gain on bargain purchase, our non-GAAP EPS loss was $0.04 in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $13.8 million in Q2, improving sequentially by 10%. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by acquisition impacts and growth investments we have been making in the business. Our cash position at quarter end was $201 million and no outstanding debt. We see a market that is moving fast and believe having a strong financial profile in times like these is crucial to success. We are in a position of strength and focus on creating long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.
With that, let me discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024 and our prospects for 2025. We have made great progress. The core business is growing, our technology is permeating across and resonating with an increasing roster of amazing customers. We expect the acquisition of Amelia to improve our financial profile. There are top line synergies and we also expect to be able to extract a lot of value from the combined companies.
It's a little early in the process to be too precise, so let me build up how we see the rest of this year and entering into next year. We are cognizant that a significant acquisition like this will require heavy integration and will take time to fully align across the enterprise. We are baking this into our go-forward assumptions.
As we noted in our press release this morning, we expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the second half of 2025. And we now see 2024 revenue to exceed $80 million and 2025 revenue to exceed $150 million. There is much more potential here, but at this stage, it's appropriate for us to stay measured and calibrated on setting expectations.
Amelia brings a diverse business with strong recurring revenue and also some other businesses that we are calibrating on to identify how best to fit them into our portfolio. In full transparency, there are lower growth and margin businesses where we want to assess the life cycle value of each contract to determine the best go-forward approach. These decisions may affect the pace of our growth or our trajectory on margins, so we need some time to finalize the plan.
Ultimately, though, we see a combined growth profile that is even more attractive than we were standalone with greater profitability, and we see tremendous value to share with customers, employees and partners over the coming years.
In conclusion, we are happy with where we are. We are aggressively moving forward, and while we know the path forward won't be linear, we have a clear vision that we are accelerating towards.
Thank you. We will now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gil Luria from D.A. Davidson. One for Keyvan, one for Nitesh, both on the acquisition. This is a transformative acquisition. So, wanted -- Keyvan, up until now, a lot of the strategy has been around autos and restaurants, pillars 1, 2 and 3. There's a very good alignment in the strategy between those end markets and that pillar framework. How do you see that changing now that you're bringing -- that you'll bring Amelia into the fold in terms of what verticals you're going to have and what your focus is going to be in terms of pillars? Thanks for the question, and transformative is the right word. Thank you for mentioning that. So, the strategy just gets stronger. The Amelia acquisition makes us -- gives us a lot more scale in Pillar 2. We always knew we were going to expand beyond restaurants. We've said that restaurants to us are like what books were to Amazon. They started with books, now they sell everything. And we've always wanted to expand in AI customer service to other industries.
And when we looked at -- we have an amazing tech that we can deliver to these brands. But it takes time to penetrate the customer base and understand their needs and even integrate with their infrastructure, especially for bigger enterprise customers.
And Amelia has accumulated 26 years of customers and integrations. They also have great complementary products and technologies. So this just accelerates that vision. It gives us a much bigger scale in Pillar 2. And a lot of their customers also fit into our Pillar 3. They work with retail, ticket companies, insurance, financial services, retail, hospitality, and a lot of those actually have a very nice fit into the Pillar 3 vision. Got it. And Nitesh, I know you asked in your prepared remarks for a little more time, but want to talk -- as you talk about managing a company that next year is going to have $150 million, you're saying that accretive second half 2025 that -- strictly speaking, that just means your earnings would be higher than they would have been otherwise. In terms of the overall margin structure and where that could put you when you're managing a company that big, does it bring closer your breakeven in terms of your ability to generate cash flow, adjusted operating margins and then even GAAP operating margins, what does it do to the timeline of hitting those milestones? Sure. Thanks, Gil. So, yes, I'll put the caveat upfront. More details are certainly to come. We just announced this today that there will be filings and certainly a lot of details for us to talk through. But let me give you the high-level construct and the way we see this and the way we see us moving forward over certainly the near term, but more importantly, maybe over the medium and long term. So, what we're really excited about here is Amelia is a software business, has strong customer traction, deep and generally really robust relationships that permeate over time and where you have -- you can expand and add upsell, cross-sell, expand services, products and expand margins. They do have multi-components to their business and we will integrate that with our profile.
But I've said before, sort of pre this acquisition, over the long-term, we should have strong growth profile, very healthy software margin, 70%-plus gross margins, and at scale, EBIT margins that are 30% plus. And I don't think that changes at all with the acquisition. I've said also that you got to think of us in phases. We are migrating to breakeven phase after sort of, call it -- I'll call it, cash utilization phase. And that's the next horizon for us.
Going into next year and beyond, I think you should think of us as investing in these tremendous growth opportunities, because we do think of these as generational shifts in how humans interacting with technology increasingly through natural conversations and increasingly through voice. And so, we're going to be in sort of, call it, that breakeven zone for a bit, and we'll be funneling incremental dollars into our growth opportunities because there are tremendous growth opportunities.
And so, I think from an EBIT margin and even what I mentioned about sort of accretive in the second half, to your point, that's earnings-related. But even our profile is generally capital-light. And so that translates very seamlessly into cash flow as well. So, maybe to synthesize all of that is, the combination we will have to integrate. There will be synergy opportunities. There are cost opportunities as well as we look across both firms that we'll be working through.
But as you get into next year, certainly, we see earnings accretion, we see cash benefits and cash flow benefits. And I think as you start to think through end of 2025 into 2026, you're going to see a much more scaled, still strong growth company, very healthy gross margins software-like and EBIT margins that are not at our full potential because we're going to be investing those incremental dollars in our growth opportunities. But certainly, shortly thereafter, I think you could think of us as that 30%-plus EBIT margin type profile business. Our next question comes from Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities. [Technical Difficulties] great quarter. Can you just talk about how conversations with prospective customers have changed, let's say over the last 3, 6 months compared to even a year ago? Can you just maybe anecdotally talk about that, just given where everything is going from a technology perspective, new verticals? And I think the view of SoundHound is obviously changing dramatically in the market. Yes. So, in Pillar 1 where we power like automotive and devices, the big change is that they are willing to pay more for generative AI, whereas we have 20 years of history here, and there's always pressure to -- constant pressure to lower their costs. But we see it -- for the first time, we are seeing that when we say, ""Hey, if you want to upgrade to the SoundHound Chat AI, which brings generative AI, there's additional royalty that you have to pay"", and they're willing to pay it. So that's the anecdotal answer to the Pillar 1 question.
In Pillar 2, the big changes that our -- for AI customer service, brands are coming to us. We used to go to them. We used to knock on their door and we used to -- getting a meeting to pitch our value proposition was a big win. But now we actually have to calibrate how to handle all the incoming -- inbound demand. And they all want to move faster. They all want to be first. They want to go from pilot to production. They want to make sure we can scale with them. And that's a much better challenge for us to deal with compared to just getting meetings from them. Great. And then just like a follow-up, I mean, kind of like Gil asked, but even to take that, does it really feel like just given the momentum you're seeing, now is the time to do a deal like this? Yes, I'll take that one. Yes, we think it's a great time to do a deal. I mean, I think, first of all, we're seeing our technology can permeate into different ecosystems. And we've built the core proprietary tech over many, many years. And we're seeing it live in action and getting a lot of traction across when we extend it from autos into restaurants. And really now bringing in Amelia into the fold does a few different things, some of which we've highlighted in our press release, but there's really a lot more here.
It's a diversification of industry. It's really skills in integration. They have a great ecosystem of channel partners, by the way, which we can leverage across other avenues of our work, and there's a great intersection of product synthesis. So, when you look at other products that we've been deploying around our Smart Answering or Employee Assist, there's a great synergy that we could bring into their ecosystem as well.
So, when we look at things, again, I kind of laid out in the prepared remarks, the framework when we think of inorganic versus organic opportunities. When we see the market momentum, ultimately, to your first question, what are customers seeing? They're really thirsting for solutions. It's not just buzz out there. It's like how do you utilize this technology to help their customers and to help them grow? And it's not only productivity, it's actually about generating new revenue.
We see that with the restaurants, for example. It's not only about productivity. Obviously, they have workers in store that are overworked and strained and freeing up their resource is one thing, but we see consistent improvements in upsell. And automation never shies away from asking for that large drink or that extra French Fries. And those types of things are actually revenue and really meaningful ticket items for our customers.
So, I think we're seeing those demands. We think, yes, totally cognizant of, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, that anything meaningful, there's integration effort and so forth. But I really -- I think the way we look at it is, over the long-term, when we look at the -- sort of the calibration of risks and opportunities, this is the time to be aggressive and this is the time to be thoughtful, but definitely to be in go mode because we're hearing it directly from the customer. So, I think, combination with Amelia is something we're very excited about. Our next question comes from Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Congrats on all the developments here. Looks great. The query volume growth was 90%. And last quarter, it was 60% year-over-year. What caused that acceleration? Yes, a lot of it is automotive partners that upgraded to SoundHound Chat AI. We did mention that when you upgrade to Chat AI, because of the generative AI feature, the usage went up. So, consumers are actually interacting with the assistant a lot more. In some pilots, it was an order of magnitude. So that's one. And also, just scaling in Pillar 2 having more customer service customers. Got it. Great. And then on Amelia, can you talk a little bit about the core technology here? Is it that they have a kind of the platform that can handle orchestration, integration of data security and develop agents on that and then they can bring in your tech or maybe just talk a little bit about kind of what's the core elements of their platform is? Yes. So they have productized customer service, somewhat omnichannel. So they supports text and voice, phone and chatbots for both user-facing and employee facing. And there is a lot of synergies on using our tech to power that. For example, for speech recognition, they're using third-party APIs. We would replace that with ours. There is opportunity for improving accuracy and also cost savings.
There was a cloud migration for them to bring their cloud to our cloud, another cost-saving opportunity. And just the way AI works, we think we can improve a lot of the user experiences. But it's not just a complete replacement. They also have done a lot of innovation over 26 years. So, there's an opportunity to take the best of both. We saw that also with SYNQ3. When we bought them, we thought, let's go and look at the best of both and create something better, and we've done exactly that. Yes. Excellent. Great. Best of luck. Our next question comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright. First, I'm just curious, with the closing of Amelia, do you now have all the tools in the toolbox necessary to complete the 3 pillar strategy and do it successfully? Well, we've had the tools, we just needed the scale And we reached a point where we thought we had that scale earlier this year. We are now in millions of cars and double-digit thousand locations in Pillar 2. So just connecting them together seems like at the right time. We also have national coverage of certain brands, like Chipotle, for example, and the acquisition of Allset earlier is going to accelerate the integration. Now, we just need to do the integration of bringing those Pillar 2 customers into Pillar 1 products.
And with Amelia, we just massively increased our scale in Pillar 2. So, going from double-digit thousand locations, mostly in restaurants, now we are in almost 200 large enterprise brands in new verticals for us. So, we are in retail now, and we are in hospitality, we are in financial services, insurance and health care. Okay. So, there are no holes in tech that you still need to fill? It's now just about accelerating the [ scaling ]? There are no holes in our tech. We just -- absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then you've had some nice wins and then obviously some big opportunities out in front of you. I'm curious, from an implementation capacity standpoint, whether or not you need to go through a process of significant hiring or between your own team and the team you're bringing on through Amelia, you have the -- I guess, the hands-on-deck to meet that demand? Go ahead. Yes, I'll jump in. Yes, I think we're in a good spot. We have been steadily hiring in pockets where we've needed it to accelerate. I think, overall, we've been in a good spot where attrition has been low and we have -- our talent who's really passionate about what they're driving, and sometimes they do need additional resources or scaling with customers. And so there has been measured hiring. And we -- I think we know in pockets where if we see an opportunity to go faster, we don't -- I think we talked about this maybe a quarter or 2 ago, like we don't want a customer waiting for 6 months, so we really want to get the resources to be able to start to activate.
But I'd say generally, no major holes. But because there's growth, there's going to be some hiring to support that. And then I'd also add that, again, across the companies, there's synergy opportunities both on revenue upsell and cross-sell and leveraging that omnichannel opportunity, what do they bring to the table to amplify our voice capabilities. And I think there's just some overhead things that, naturally, there's going to be cost synergies.
So that's the work that we're kicking off really, earnestly. But to your point on -- or maybe the prior -- like from a tech stack, no major holes. From a product capabilities, no major holes. From a resourcing, no major holes. But when you're growing, you're constantly expanding and you're just kind of adding to as you go and that's kind of what we're always mindful of to make sure that we have what we need to grow. Yes. No, that's helpful guys. I appreciate the added color. That's it for me. Our next question comes from Brett Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald. Congrats on the acquisition. I guess just kind of digging a bit deeper there. I think in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about there being some slower growth, lower margin businesses and probably in the flip side, some higher growth, higher-margin businesses. Could you just maybe provide a framework for what that business is growing at? And additionally, walk us through why they sold for, call it, $80 million with expectations to do $45 million of revenue. It seems like a phenomenal purchase price for you guys. But I guess, why the sellers agreed to that? I guess they just not have it in them anymore. I guess, can you just talk about how that process happen as well? Yes. Thanks, Brett. I'll say a couple of things. First, again, more details to come. We'll see a lot more around the breakout and the details of the financial profile. The 8-K that we filed this morning on the transaction actually walk through the deal economics, so maybe I'll just start there. So, there actually were multiple components. So, there was sort of an upfront piece, some cash, some stock. There was also a part of assumption of debt, and we paid back part of that debt that was announced concurrently.
And then, like we've done in prior acquisitions, we like to share in the economics over time with delivery against the milestones and expectations that we're setting in concurrence with the target. And so, all those parts are there. I think $80 million is probably just a partial view, just to be clear. So, there is, again, some debt components and other things and some earnouts.
But we do -- I think, maybe the essence of what your question is, is value. And certainly, both parties need to say there's an alignment of value for any deal to make sense, and we've been going through that with them. And part of it is when you do stock transactions, there needs to be an attribution to future value of that stock, and there's a real belief both sides of what we can become and what we're starting to become. So, we think when you unpack all that from deal economics, that's why this transaction was successful, why we got it to this place.
Then the other question was sort of an unpacking of the various pieces of the business. So, we did articulate in the press release about the $45 million of ARR. They do have a strong recurring business that has been, over time, shifting from a licensing model. And -- so, that transition has happened. And so, that's a really -- that's what we valued really. It was a growing ARR business across those industries we talked about earlier, really rich set of customers, too big to fail banks and those types. So, people that -- it would take us a long time to really develop a system to support. And so, we're very, very excited about that.
But they do have other pieces. They have professional services. A lot of the deals they've had are complicated. There's implementation, customization services, and those can be very valuable. They tend to be a little lower margin. And so, that's a little bit of what we're alluding to. And then, they also have this piece of the business that's more call center-like. Think of it maybe in -- I forgot what that -- escalation support type capabilities. And those are partners that we work with and revenue that they generate, that is lower margin business, and we do openly need to dive in and understand contract-by-contract, what makes sense?
In Gil's question earlier, I talked about what's the profile of business we're building. We're really happy as an AI-centric, next-generation technology software provider that from my seat goes like, ""Hey, 70%-plus gross margin, 30% EBIT margins at scale,"" bits and bytes that can transition and scale very quickly. But when we need to provide services to support integration environments, we'll provide that.
When there are, like we had with SYNQ3, some call center capabilities that are additive, and by the way, appropriately measured with the customer where there's data that we can utilize to enhance the models and enhance the technology, we'll leverage that. So, yes, there are different pieces of business with different growth rates, and we're going to calibrate and we're just getting going. So, again, more details to come, so stay tuned. Perfect. That was very helpful. I think you guys also talked about how you like having the optionality to kind of go back and forth between different models that you're integrated with, whether it'd be Perplexity or ChatGPT. I was just wondering from the cost side on -- from your point of view, I guess, how are they billing you? Is that a usage model? Is it a one-time setup fee? I guess, how should we think about that dynamic? Yes. So, something we predicted before there were even multiple models was that -- and this is more than a year ago, was that there will be multiple models. They will be good at different things. and some will be cheaper, some will be more expensive, and some will be owned and made by us, some will be open-source. So, we built an infrastructure to be able to tap into different models, arbitrate, choose the right one. And even for a single interaction, sometimes we go to multiple models at the same time.
And that is working. It's seamless. The user experience is amazing. They don't need to worry about where it's coming from. They just get the right answer, and then it follows them as they ask different questions and so on.
Now, in terms of billings, it's -- again, some of these are models that we host. So, the cost is mainly hosting. And for the APIs, like OpenAI and others, you can sign up for enterprise accounts to bring the cost down and get more scale with them. That's something that we are doing. And then there are companies like Perplexity that have list prices, and then we have an arrangement with them that we can go to them when it scales to, for example, rev share arrangements or lower prices at scale. So, we future proof that for that, but it's too early to go into specifics of it. Perfect. Really appreciate it. Congrats on transaction again, guys. Our next question comes from Glenn Mattson from Ladenburg Thalmann. Building on that last question a little bit, with the expected new release of ChatGPT, maybe can you just talk about how you plan ahead for something like that? And maybe there's obviously opportunities, but perhaps is there any risks associated with -- maybe they could come out with some functionality that could potentially be competitive on a very low end or something like that? So, anyway, just generally speaking, managing the evolution of this process as well as maybe you can hit on other factors of the competitive landscape when you talk about this, just in general, whether it'd be Pillar 1 or Pillar 2. Yes. So, in terms of advancements by OpenAI and other similar companies, we positions ourselves so that as they do better, it benefits us as opposed to it harming us. So, we are able to use whatever they put out that is good. And if some of those overlap with something that we already have, we don't hesitate to integrate it because our goal is to deliver really, really good user experiences. And that was one of the advantages of SoundHound when the big tech players were kind of disoriented for more than a year. ""Oh, let's go build our own, we're never going to use OpenAI APIs."" We did it in 2 days, and that really benefited us.
We were the first to go live with our customers, and we were the first AI assistant that integrate generative AI and so on. So, we love it when they come out with something that is good because say, ""Hey, we can make our products better."" I don't think they are going after the -- our customers, because it takes a lot of integration, a lot of handholding and a lot of support to -- it's not just a model. We have to integrate, for example, in restaurants, we have to integrate with POS systems, and we have to integrate with their menu. We have to understand their needs.
In automotive, it's integrated with the head units and the navigation software in the car, the car control features. And those integrations even OpenAI probably said, they are not going to go after those. They're becoming a platform to enable companies like ours. And the advantage for us is that we have a lot of core technologies to augment what they have to really enable things that other companies are waiting for something to become available, we already have that, so we can go faster. I think I answered your question, but feel free to follow up. Yes. No, it was just beyond that, but it is possibly the competitive landscape, if there's been any changes, possibly even down to Pillar 1 or just across the board in terms of the traditional competitors? Yes. I'll jump in a bit. So I think -- so Pillar 1, it was really kind of the same group, and we've been gaining traction. We've been gaining brands and we feel great. And that's a primary comment around automotive. Broader than automotive and the other devices that we operate in, we've had a great position and we continue to gain traction there.
Within Pillar 2, it's a hot area. There are people coming, and I would say people who are -- who don't have the technology to compete, who are struggling. And we really have felt this way. We've seen it. I think what we're seeing from customer traction is that we are still, and we say this very humbly because things change in a heartbeat in tech land, we are a step function above others in terms of technology capability and the solutions that we have, and frankly, the package of solutions that we have from drive-thru, phone ordering, Employee Assist solution and beyond.
We're moving heavily beyond just at point site but into in-app, into text, et cetera. And there's a ton of engagement that we have the full portfolio of solutions. So, we really think we got a running start on the restaurant side. But yes, there's -- it's a very, very attractive market, and it's maybe one of the most sort of logical use cases of AI. So, I think we're going to continue to see entrants. We look at that as a good thing. It's a sign of a healthy market. But again, we feel like we've got a really strong position and really wouldn't trade our spot with anybody else. Our next question comes from Leo Carpio from Joseph Gunnar. First, congratulations on the deal and on the quarter. Doing a dive a little bit further into Amelia. In terms of the deal, can you guys talk us through, in terms of who approached who for this transaction? How did you became aware of Amelia? And then looking forward, post Amelia, what other verticals you may be interested in? Thinking here being that as you explore voice AI and develop the capabilities, you may discover second, third derivative technologies that may be of interest to you that could bolster your platform and capabilities. Sure. Yes. Maybe -- I'll start maybe with the framework I laid out in the prepared remarks. Like, first of all, we think that having or at least being open to the idea of having programmatic M&A and being aware of who the players are, from partnership perspective, to Glenn's question, and from a competitive perspective. So, being aware of what's going on in the marketplace is just our -- it's just part of who we are. So we're always aware. We've known of Amelia. They've been doing some great things for a long time.
And you can imagine in this space, it's -- particularly in the AI space over the last, I guess, it's 18, 20 months now, lot of bankers come out with ideas. And so we've had interactions and there's dialogue around partnerships, and we were heavily kind of going in our verticals. And as Keyvan noted, you got to start with the sort of overarching vision. We believe we are here to voice-enable the world with conversational intelligence. We think that there's a migration happening omnichannel, in essence, and it's going to permeate across all industries.
So, the end-all period at the end of the sentence wasn't always, okay, we're in restaurants, done. We're in autos, done. It was always to sort of, as Keyvan noted, kind of evolve from our origin industries into beyond. So, the question then is like, ""Well when and how and with whom or doing it organically?"" And those are iteration comments that were -- or conversations we're constantly working through.
So, in this case, yes, we connected. We started to explore. We just get to know and then it sort of moved from there. And every -- I don't want to go into details on their situation and what they were motivated by, but ultimately kind of landed in, ""Hey, is there a potential for a combination?"" And then, you have to explore the complexities of deals, which -- these things don't happen in short order. They definitely are a long journey of due diligence and getting to know one another to understand the cultures and could there potentially be a fit. And so, we've been going on that for several months and sort of landed where we were.
And then, I think maybe just to hit the other part, in terms of is this -- I think your question was like industries, is this -- is that the right set? I'll try to address it this way that humans have been interacting through voice and conversation forever, and our technology is kind of chasing that play. And we do think we're at the precipice of where human interactions and with technology in all manifestations can happen through natural conversations. And there will be great places where the touch, type, swipe is the best medium, but there will be more and more opportunities where conversations and using your voice will be the best medium.
So, I don't think there's a boundary on like this industry, that industry. It's really about journeys and consumer journeys. So, again, makes sense for, if you're driving your car, you want to pick up coffee. Great, well, there is the connection. Makes sense when you're just at the drive-thru and you want to order your food, and it makes sense if you're driving, you want to set some appointments or book travel or so forth. Like, there is so many interactions, and so it's -- we're just getting started here. We think this is the right action for us now. And so, we're excited to embark upon the journey with Amelia and continue on the journey that we've been driving for the past many years. Okay. And then, a quick follow-up question on the -- in the restaurant side, the tone of the conversations, have they switched from one where your marketing team is proactively reaching out to potential customers or are they now flipping in terms of coming their inbound calls to you? Yes. We commented for the last couple of quarters, there really has been a pretty significant shift towards the latter where originally, call it, 15, 20 months ago, we were really on the outreach side. I think your question was predominantly for restaurants, if I'm not mistaken. So, that certainly in that industry, it has -- we're working through making sure that there isn't too much of a wait because we're working through integrations with some major QSRs, as Keyvan noted, trying to make sure we're serving all our customers equally with excellence.
And so, we're not working with everybody. So there's still more conversations to be had. But we're going out to conferences. We've getting leads. We're talking to people. Some of those conversations take place over time. The other thing that these are virtuous cycles. If you can do well in one instance, the word gets around pretty quickly.
And also in a lot of these franchises that we're working with now, it's not just like a brand to a brand, but it's you work with a corporate and then it gets down to the franchise level, and some franchisees have a big number of -- dozens and dozens of locations and some of them have hundreds of locations. So, again, it has really moved towards a respond to, but that doesn't mean we're going to slow down on our outreach.
And we didn't really, I think, talk a lot about just beyond the restaurants and the Smart Answering capabilities. I mean, last time we talked about on the fitness space with Planet Fitness. There is a lot going on, on that side, too, beyond just restaurants that we're getting a lot of traction. And so, just excited to keep going forward, and as long as we deliver great products, we think the customers will come. Okay. Well, congratulations on the quarter. There are no further questions at this time. So, this now concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",the call is being audio webcast in its entirety on our Investor Relations website . we will begin with some short remarks before moving to Q&A . a replay will be available following today's call .,1.0
