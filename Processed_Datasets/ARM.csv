[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Ian Thornton. Please go ahead. Thank you, Latif. Thank you, everybody. My name is Ian Thornton, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at Arm. I would like to welcome you to our earnings conference call for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. I'm joined today by Rene Haas, the Chief Executive Officer of Arm; and Jason Child, Arm's Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully, you will all have downloaded and read the shareholder letter. If not, it is available on the Arm Investor Relations website at investors.arm.com. The shareholder letter provides a rich update on our strategic progress in the quarter.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, during the course of this conference call, Arm will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking information regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about the future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important risk factors that may affect our future results and performance are described in our registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on September 14, 2023. Arm assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
In addition, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations of certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a discussion of certain projected non-GAAP financial measures that we were not able to reconcile without unreasonable efforts and supplementary financial information can be found in the shareholder letter that we released earlier today. The shareholder letter and other earnings-related materials are available on our website at investors.arm.com.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rene, who has some prepared remarks. Thank you, Ian, and good afternoon, good evening, everyone. So I'd like to speak a few different comments about the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Jason for some specifics. And then we'll open it up to Q&A.
We had an outstanding third quarter inside the company. We could not be more pleased. Record revenues. We exceeded the high end of the range for the guidance and extremely pleased about results overall. For Q4, we're expecting another record quarter, and to that end, we've also raised guidance on which Jason is going to give more color on.
But a little bit regarding the why and how we got here. Arm has the most fundamental, foundational, pervasive compute platform really in the history of digital design. Over 280 billion units in the 30-plus years that Arm has been a company had been built. And that has underpinned a software ecosystem and hardware ecosystem like no other. And given the fact that a CPU design is really driven by the hardware and the software, it creates a flywheel for continuous development. That is the more hardware that exists on Arm, the more software that's written for Arm, the more software that's written for Arm, the more popular the hardware.
So we're building off a fantastic base that, when we look at what happened in the last quarter, not only did we see growth driven by a number of factors but growth that we think is long term and sustainable. For royalties specifically around some of the products that shipped in the quarter, we've seen a significant transition now continuing from our v8 product to our v9 product. Our v9 product garners roughly 2x the royalty rate of the equivalent v8 product, and whereas in the previous quarter, that was about 10% of our revenue for royalties. It's now moved to 15%.
And that has seen growth in not only the smartphone sector but also in infrastructure and other markets, which drives growth. We are also seeing strong momentum and tailwinds from all things AI. From the most complex devices on the planet for training and inference, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 to edge devices such as the Gemini Nano Pixel 6 from Google or the Samsung Galaxy S24, more and more AI is running on more edge devices and end devices, and that's all running on Arm. And what that has done is driven a very strong set of tailwinds for our licensing growth. When we look at demand for new products from a licensing standpoint, what we are finding from the end market is that we've reached nowhere near good enough relative to the capability of the technology, and end customers for new designs are needing more and more Arm technology to keep up, particularly with the AI demands. So with that, our licensing growth has been very strong.
We've also seen proof points around one of our strategies that we call Compute Subsystems. These are complete finished blocks of designs that we put together for our end customers that will save them significant time around validation of their engineering work and also around time to market relative to cycling products to the fab. One of the very first designs that was made public that uses this is the Microsoft Cobalt, which uses our Neoverse cores, a 128 CPU to be specific. We worked very closely with Microsoft around these designs using Compute Subsystems, and we see this trend only going to continue.
So between strong growth in royalties that are driven between v8 to v9, all things AI needing energy-efficient compute and compute subsystems, we feel very, very strongly positioned for growth. And again, this is completely underpinned by an ecosystem of devices that are in the installed base and a very, very large software community that develops on Arm.
So with that, I will turn it over to Jason, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. Thank you, Rene. I'm going to briefly touch on guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. Starting with revenues. For fiscal Q4, we are guiding to a range of $850 million to $900 million with a midpoint of $875 million. This represents a raise of over $95 million compared to our prior implied guidance for the fourth quarter. When combined with our strong Q3 performance, the full year revenue guidance rises to $3.155 billion to $3.205 billion, an increase of $160 million at the midpoint versus prior.
Within Q4 total revenue, we expect royalty revenues to grow mid-single digits sequentially and to be up over 30% year-over-year as we compare against the bottom of the industry-wide inventory correction that occurred in prior year Q4. Royalty revenue sequential growth is mainly coming from increasing penetration of Armv9, where royalty rates are, on average, at least double the rates on equivalent Armv8 products. Additionally, we are seeing an increasing amount of Arm technology in chips being deployed; and as the amount of Arm technology in chips increases, so does the royalty rate. With around 35% of Arm's total -- sorry, Arm's royalty revenue coming from smartphones, we have benefited from recovery in the smartphone market. But with 65% coming from markets beyond mobile, we are seeing more revenue growth from share gains and market share growth outside of mobile.
Additionally, we are expecting another strong quarter for licensing with revenue up sequentially to near record levels. As with recent quarters, we expect to sign multiple new ATA deals in Q4, and demand for our latest technology remains high as customers need access to AI-capable CPUs and related technology such as our Compute Subsystems.
Turning to expenses. We expect non-GAAP OpEx of approximately $490 million in Q4 and $1.7 billion for the full year. On a like-for-like basis, our full year guidance has increased by $10 million, driven by slightly higher spend in R&D. As detailed in the guidance section of our shareholder letter, to increase transparency and improve the comparability of our results, beginning in Q4, the presentation of our non-GAAP measures will be modified to exclude employer taxes related to equity classified awards. These taxes are dependent on our stock price at the time of vesting and, as a result, fluctuate independently of the operating performance of our business. The impact of this change has been factored into today's non-GAAP Q4 and full year guidance for operating expenses and total diluted EPS. On an EPS basis, revenue strength will flow through to profit, driving Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS up to between $0.28 and $0.32 and full year non-GAAP fully diluted EPS to up between $1.20 and $1.24.
In summary, we had an outstanding Q3 and expect our momentum to accelerate through Q4 and beyond. With that, I will now turn it back over to the operator to kick off the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Congratulations on the strong results, guidance and, of course, execution. December quarter, as you guys mentioned, right, second consecutive quarter of strong licensing, second consecutive quarter of book to bill greater than 1, strong ACV. Sounds like many of your customers across all of your end markets are focusing on accelerated compute and AI and the requirements for more compute capability. And that's obviously being reflected in the strong licensing performance.
How much of the expansion on recent licensing deals has been more about adding your AI-specific IP, right, like your Ethos NPU or taking advantage of some of your Helium and NEON vector extensions for AI workloads or Compute Subsystems adoption versus just buying up the stack on more powerful cores? And then more importantly, like do you guys see the strong licensing momentum continuing into fiscal '25? Yes. Harlan, thank you for the kind words. I'll take the first part of your question and then let Jason comment on the second half. One of the new products that we released relative from a licensing standpoint is something we call Arm Total Access, which Jason referred to as ATA. That gives customers access to a broad set of Arm technology including our most advanced CPUs and NPUs. And one of the things that we are seeing is exactly what you described. We're seeing demand for incorporating CPUs with anything that helps with AI acceleration such as vector extensions.
Additionally, the ATAs give customers access to the NPUs, which they can also use for an offload. What we are seeing anecdotally relative to when we engage customers is that the need for more compute, the need to be able to handle what I would call a bit of the unknown relative to these large language models that either run on an edge device or in a hybrid way is fundamentally driving a need for more compute than they had before.
So they are looking to upgrade to give themselves flexibility on the design and also to maximize their ability to deliver the most efficient product, whether that's lots of different cores or a smaller set of devices that may or may not include an NPU. So in summary, yes, your question, I think, is accurate relative to the conclusion of AI demand is driving a need for a lot of different products. And I'll let Jason kind of comment to the longer-term trend that we see. Yes. Harlan, I would say on the looking forward, so obviously, I only gave guidance for Q4. But going beyond that, when you unpack licensing versus royalty, because of the fact that we're largely almost entirely under contract for next year on royalties, we feel good about those trends. It's the license piece that's a little harder to forecast. If I look at last quarter and this -- in Q4 that's coming up, we've definitely had some upside from AI and selling additional licenses that were just not in our plan and not anticipated.
So I think we're going to need to work through this quarter to find out how much of that upside continues to -- and that trend flow into next year because we've seen this demand has been coming, I think, a little shorter sales cycles than we had seen typically before. So I'd say stay tuned, very hot. In 90 days, we'll give you a better view. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Let me extend my congratulations to the entire Arm team for the strong results. Can't help but notice the strength in business from Arm China. Maybe you can speak to what drove that strong result out of Arm China. And besides Arm China, were there any other greater than 10% customers in the quarter? Yes. I would say, broadly speaking, we are seeing increased market share gains for our products across the board, particularly around automotive and infrastructure/data center. Inside China, those are very good growth markets. One of the things we continue to comment on relative to the China market is that the China ecosystem tends to follow the global ecosystem. So as we see the share gains across different aspects of the market, we're seeing that consistent and holding true relative to China. Jason, do you want to take the other part of that? Yes, just on the numbers to make sure it's clear. So when we announce related parties, I think we're about 30% of growth. Arm China is the largest portion of it. However, there are others. So Arm China was about 25% of total revenue, just slightly up from the 20% from a quarter ago. That's helpful. The gains in the royalty rate per unit, if I can add a follow-on, certainly are accelerating. Is that all driven by Arm version 9? And should we continue to expect that upward inflection in the royalty rate per unit? Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it. So as mentioned, Armv9 was 10% of our royalty revenue last quarter, now 15%. We see that accelerating. The other thing we are seeing is that the mixes of devices that might have a mix of v8 and v9 cores are increasingly moving to more v9 cores. And the reason for that is, back to the AI comment, the compute needs of the end applications only continues to increase. And what we're seeing is customers looking to put more and more technology into their devices perhaps even more than they originally planned for when they had licensed the technology.
So it's a compounding effect of growth. We see growth from royalty happening from v8 to v9 transition and more Arm technology being used in the same devices. So it's a bit of a compounding effect that helps us with growth. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley of Barclays. Congrats on the nice results. I just wanted to add a question to the v9 pile here. You guys are talking about traction in AI, smartphones, infrastructure. You're saying that, that percentage as a percentage of total revenue grows into the next fiscal year. Where are you seeing the most of that traction? You called out AI a couple of times here early in the call. But is that coming more from the smartphone side or the AI side? And just maybe talk about the cadence of where you see that penetration rate growing as you get into the next fiscal year. Yes. So thanks for the question. So a couple of ways to think about it. There's definitely growth coming from the data center side. So proof points such as NVIDIA's Grace Hopper, the Microsoft Cobalt design, the work that AWS has been doing with Graviton, what we are seeing is more and more AI demands in the data center whether that's around training or inference. And because the Arm solution in the data center, in particular, is extremely good in terms of performance per watt and the constraints that are on today's data center is relative to running these AI workloads puts a huge demand on power, that's a great tailwind for Arm.
If we move to the edge devices such as a smartphone, we've seen, and I think the recent launches, as I mentioned, with Gemini Nano and the Galaxy S24, increased AI workloads being pushed to the phone. And what we're seeing from the design standpoint is more and more compute technology being pushed into those phones such that they are AI capable and AI ready because this field is moving very, very fast. A year from now, who knows what the type of AI applications it might be able to run on a smartphone. So what we're seeing is a shift to more and more high-performance capable technology to capture a wave to ensure that they can run these AI workloads.
Nobody wants to be caught behind with not enough performance when the new application comes out. So that has accelerated the v9 adoption, both from a standpoint of more devices using it and more devices using more of it. And to your question, where is it coming from, it's coming from everywhere. It's coming from certainly the data center, certainly from the edge devices, and we think, over time, even AI PCs. So it's a huge growth vector. Super helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up as well. If you look at kind of the seasonality of the closed year, you obviously saw really strong results in both the December and the March quarter. Obviously, you're not perfect with units. But if you look at June and the smartphone ecosystem, you're kind of seeing a little bit of a pause in the Android ecosystem and kind of some cautious data points from the supply chain in general. Could you talk about what you expect in terms of seasonality to start your fiscal year? Any tidbits there would be helpful. I know you're not guiding June, but any way to help think about how we begin the next fiscal year would be helpful. Yes. I'm not going to comment in terms of too far forward on the seasonality component to what we're doing. But what I would emphasize is that we're a bit of a different company to think about relative to how you think about other companies in terms of their specific exposure to a market. We are involved in just about every single end market, and every single end market is moving from v8 to v9, which have, as I said, doubled the royalty rates. And just about every single one of these markets is putting more compute into their devices.
So sometimes when we've had questions from folks saying, well, wait a minute, I'm trying to figure out how units match up to numbers, we're operating on a little bit of a different plane because of our broad, broad adoption and as I mentioned at the start of the call, the pervasiveness of the architecture. It's just driving a whole different set of growth vectors. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. I just wanted to clarify, Rene, is this -- on the v9, is the 10% to 15% related to number of customers, number of chips or revenue related to those sales? Because I think in the shareholder letter, it's qualified as v9 of 15% of royalty revenue rather than -- I guess a bigger question is -- just so that we have an apples-to-apples sense of how many of your smartphone units are actually using v9 right now versus the ones that used v9 in the last quarter. Is that a better way to track v9 adoption? And maybe we'll go from here, I guess. Yes, so let me try to answer your question, and maybe Jason, Ian, if I'm missing some facts, you guys can fill in. First off, the number, when we say 10% and 15%, that's a percentage of our overall royalty revenue. So that's the way to think about that. When you think about the number of units that are moving from v8 to v9, I don't think we have anything specific that I can give you on this call. But what I can tell you is, just as an example or an anecdote, is that v9 is being used extensively and almost exclusively now in all the premium smartphones.
And the premium smartphones, such as the Galaxy S24, those are actually part of the segments that are seeing a little bit better growth than their compatriots. So given the fact that virtually all the premium smartphones have now moved to v9 and as I mentioned before, people are trying to put as much v9 technology in that smartphone to capture the AI wave, I think that's maybe one way to think about proportionately where some of the growth comes versus units.
What we tend to see with the smartphone market, for example, is typically a waterfall over time where what was in the premium unit finds its way into the high end, then into the midrange. But that's the way I -- maybe a good way to think about it in terms of where the percentages are. There certainly is a lot of v9 in the premium smartphone, and we're seeing a lot of premium smartphones being sold. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Just actually as a follow-up, is there any way you could elaborate on the mix of v9 by end market, like a smartphone versus cloud compute? And I have a follow-up. I'll attempt to answer that and again, maybe Ian and Jason. As I said, premium smartphone is almost exclusively now v9, and virtually every high-end data center chip is v9. When you look at Grace Hopper, when you look at Graviton, when you look at Microsoft Cobalt, these are all v9-based designs. The only thing I would add, on a -- in terms of royalty revenue and then chips that have actually been deployed in the market, we are overweighted towards smartphones on v9 primarily because it's an annual refresh cycle. And so I would think of that being a bit ahead. Over time, I think the other lines of businesses will catch up, but it's predominantly -- or definitely weighted more towards smartphone for the reasons that Rene just pointed out on premium mix. Got it. And my follow-up has to do with the market share. I think end of FY '24 -- I'm sorry, end of FY '23, cloud was about 10% market share for you, and networking was 26%. Is there any way you can give us some color as how -- as you close FY '24, how those market shares are changing? Yes, not today. We're not prepared to give that. When we give the updates for next year or the next quarter, we can do that. But I can say we're very pleased about the direction of travel, and AI has only helped that grow faster. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Congratulations again on a great quarter. Just a quick question on the cloud compute side, if you could give us some way of how to look at what do you think will be the growth in 2024 given you have some pretty marquee customers with GH200 and Graviton and Cobalt 100 now? And I have a follow-up. Sorry, didn't catch it quite. You're asking about projected growth for next year in cloud? Yes. Just for calendar '24, how do you see the growth with those on the cloud compute side with -- you had some big marquee customers there now. How do you see that growth? Yes. As Rene just mentioned on the -- for the last question, we'll provide our market share update on -- specifically on compute, which is, for us, almost all cloud in infrastructure. And we'll provide some views on where we expect that to go next year. So give us 90 days. Got it. And then on the mobile side, obviously, you mentioned good traction with v9. Just wondering what penetration rate on v9 is now when you look at the premium phones, I guess, all of it. But how -- what the projection on that is for the year, I guess? How do you save it for later? Is your question what percentage of smartphones are v9? Yes. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, the numbers are somewhat skewed relative to the premium segment versus the broader segment. If you look at overall units, most of the premium, if not, all smartphones have moved to v9, and the rest of the segments have been slower to adopt.
But the premium segment draws a very, very large mixture of lots of cores and lots of royalty-rich cores. So it tends to weigh out the numbers relative to overall units. We expect v9, and Ian, keep me kind of comfortable on this, usually next 3, 4 years to kind of find its way throughout the entire smartphone category. Yes, if you go back to how v8 sort of took over from v7, it took about 3 years to get from where we are here to about 80%, 90% penetrated. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Congrats on the strong result and guide. I wanted to go back to the Arm China conversation. So a clarification and a main question. The clarification was that 25% that I think, Jason, you mentioned, was that of total revenues or just of royalties? And then the main question is could you just help us break down a little bit how that's so strong whether it's total revenues or just of royalties. That was a significant driver of growth, and depending upon the answer to the clarification, it could have been more than all of the sequential growth. So I just wanted to get my arms around what was really driving the growth and how much of it came from Arm China. Yes, China was 25% of total revenues in Q3, and that's up from 20% in Q2. And then what was driving that? Because, again, by that math, it seems like the China side was up, I don't know, 30% and everything else kind of went down a little bit sequentially. Was that just the China handset market coming back to life? Was it more goodness beyond that? Just any color you could give on what drove that China growth that was so impressive? Yes. We don't break down the individual customers, but as I said, the China ecosystem tends to follow the rest of the world relative to the growth. So when we talk about growth in data centers and we talk about growth in automotive, and to your comment, certainly recovering the smartphone market helped. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi of Needham & Company. My congratulations to Arm management team on the very strong results, very impressive. I do want to dig into a little bit more on the China and the related party side of the revenue because when I look at your historical numbers, your Arm China contribution tracks almost identical to the related party transactions. There seems to be a little bit of a gap, seems to be expanding a little bit over the last quarter.
And maybe related to that, you had very strong bookings in the last quarter, and this quarter, the booking actually comes down a little bit, but the licensing revenue actually was stronger than you expected. Was that the result of some of the earlier commencement of the licensing contracts that you probably signed a little bit earlier in the year, maybe in the prior quarter? And is that more of a timing that kind of surprised you to the upside? Yes. So first on the related parties. So yes, typically, China has been most all of it. We did have an additional license deal. That was roughly 5%, I guess, of total revenue, the difference between Arm China and the rest. That deal did come through this quarter. And so you're right. That's not something that's been continuous but was a deal that came in this last quarter.
In terms of the makeup of license revenue in general, we typically run somewhere around 40% to 50% of our license revenue was from backlog, so deals previously signed but relate to technology milestones that are delivered within the quarter. And then the remainder are new deals that are signed within the quarter. Clearly, we have good visibility into backlog and what our delivery is going to be. And we have a pretty good insight into renewals or deals that have relatively long lead times.
I think the one thing that we saw a little bit unique, both last quarter and this quarter, is with the increased kind of focus in AI and there just is a lot of focus on investing and building designs in AI. And I said it, so there's been some shorter cycle deals that have come up, kind of, I would say, a little bit unique versus what we've seen in the past. And that's the primary reason why we do need to spend a little more time this quarter to get our arms around how much of that momentum will we continue to see next year. Does that answer your question? Yes. If I may add, the China piece, your IP peers seems to be a little bit more cautious about what's going to happen, I mean, in this year and actually kind of cautious you started that late last year, but your China revenue is still going very strong. How do we reconcile the differences here? I mean this is my last question. Well, I wouldn't say that we're less cautious. I think our numbers have been strong. But from a forecast perspective, we've been forecasting that China likely goes down into the teens as a percentage of total revenue. This last quarter and the quarter before, we've just seen stronger recovery than we had previously expected, and that's been certainly a nice positive surprise.
In terms of going forward, we feel good about the progress we expect to deliver this quarter. And in 90 days, we'll let you know if we think that progress is going to continue into next year. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. I wanted to go back to the Armv9 conversation on a couple of points. I noticed that this is the first time, and maybe I'm just dumb and didn't see it, but I think this is the first time you had explicitly put in the shareholder letter and in writing that you were at least double royalty rates from v8 to v9. And I guess I wanted to ask you about that in a broader sense. Is that sort of across the board, across end markets and also across customers that are traditionally processor licensees and also ones that are traditionally architectural licensees and do the systems themselves? So I guess that's the first part of the question. Is that a blanket statement across the board?
And the reason I ask it, if you go back to lots of conversations around the IPO time frame, there were some aggressive ramps of royalty rates across your mobile business. And I think we were all trying to figure out whether the v8 penetration to v9 would drive those kind of expansion in results or if you would need some significant contributions from sort of both system license and the like to get those results. And so any context there about the applicability and breadth of that comment on doubling royalty rates on v9 would be really helpful. Yes. Thanks, Matt. So I'll attempt to answer it and let Jason and -- if Jason wants to chime in. Yes, you're right. This is the first time we've done it, although we only have done two of these letters, so we don't have a huge installed base to refer to. We wanted to provide some specific clarity because we had been receiving some level of questions around the thing you just asked about relative to how to think about v8 versus v9.
The double -- the V9 rate for the equivalent -- double v9 for the equivalent v8 is sort of a rough guidepost, but in some cases, it's quite a bit more. The Neoverse royalty rates have their own unique tables. The automotive royalty rates have their own unique tables. And some of the most high-performance CPUs that we ship into the client section have very, very significant lifted rates over version 8. So double is a good rule of thumb for like for like, but in some cases, it's even better than that. So that's -- but we did want to sort of provide just some clarity because we thought, when folks look at the numbers in the absence of that context, there would just be a question of just help me work out how you got here. So Jason, I don't know if there's anything you want to add on to that. No. I think to Rene's earlier point, we're -- I understand we're a little bit hard to model because we don't really track to other companies and because of we're getting paid royalties on roughly 8 billion chips a quarter and just the slightest bit of mix either to more premium handsets or to more v9 versus v8. That turns out to be a pretty sensitive variable. And when you look at the growth from last quarter to this quarter and what we're expecting from this quarter to next quarter, unit growth is very, very small. It's really almost all coming from rate growth increases.
And as we said back at IPO, we're almost 100% on contract for next year. So really, we're just seeing the manifestation of the work that was done in the last 2 years. We wanted to provide this v8 to v9 ratio as one way to help you guys be able to kind of see the progress and be able to model it. So I hope it's helpful. Yes, I can say that one thing that we had high confidence in when we started looking at the transition was v8 to v9, we knew we had increased rates, and we knew that the royalty picture would be better than what we were accustomed in the past. I think one of the benefits we're getting, and I would use AI as sort of a driver for all this, is that the amount of v9 cores or the mix of v9 cores has been stronger than anticipated because people are putting more CPUs down where they were not planning on putting as many or they may be putting a higher mix of v9 than v8. So that's all driven, I think, good forward momentum for us. No, that's super helpful, guys. Just a quick clarification. Any comment on -- I mean, the base rates may be different and obviously, different customers have different contracts. But all of that commentary at least directionally applicable to your architectural licensees as well? Yes. Yes, it is. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Gardiner of Citi. I had one on the licensing side. You guys have spoken about how strong it was in the quarter and the -- being surprised at the quicker sales cycle time on some of these licenses. A point that you haven't brought up on the call yet but it was within the shareholder letter was that you also saw 3 of the 5 ATA licensees in the quarter, the upgrades from the Arm Flexible Access program, and you said that was the first time that had happened.
Did that take you by surprise? Or were these customers that were getting to be particularly large for an AFA and so it was natural for them to upgrade? Yes, if it wasn't a surprise and -- is this something that might actually continue to surprise positively, right? Is there a portion of that cohort that is sort of natural to be upgrading from AFA to ATA and therefore contribute more in terms of license dollars? Yes. Thank you for the question. We didn't bring it up in our comments. We had a lot of good stuff to talk about this quarter. I was trying to keep it as concise. But the AFA transition to ATA, thank you for calling that out. That's a great trend for us. When we designed the program a number of years ago, that was absolutely the intent, is that customers that launched into an AFA would ultimately go on to a Total Access license.
What largely drives that, quite frankly, is the companies that took the AFA start to get commercial traction in their business. Some of the AFA customers are early-stage companies. They may have an early exit or get acquired. But as they get larger and mature, we expect them to embrace Arm technology in a broader way. So I wouldn't call it a surprise. I would actually call it an expected outcome that we have, and we're really happy to see it. It's great. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rene Haas for closing remarks. Sir? Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for the kind words on the quarter and the good set of questions that we had. We're thrilled about Q3, and we're very, very excited about Q4. I think what you're seeing coming to life are all the strategies that we've been working hard on over the last number of years, investment in the v9 technology, the diversification of our business into data center, into automotive and of course, IoT, and then now the -- what I think is probably the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, which is around AI.
And I think regarding AI, particularly when you think about artificial general intelligence, that's going to drive the need for more compute in a way that we've never seen before. So as good as the last couple of quarters were, we're just at the beginning. I could not be more excited about the growth that we have going forward, and thank you for all your time and questions. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","the shareholder letter provides a rich update on our strategic progress in the quarter . arm assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made .",1.0

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ian Thornton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My name is Ian Thornton, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at Arm. I would like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024.
I'm joined today by Rene Haas, the Chief Executive Officer of Arm; and Jason Child, Arm's Chief Financial Officer.
Hopefully, you will all have downloaded and read the shareholder letter. If not, it is available on the Arm Investor Relations website at investors.arm.com. The shareholder letter provides a rich update on our strategic progress in the quarter.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Arm will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking information regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important risk factors that may affect our future results and performance are described in our registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on September 14, 2023. Arm assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations of certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a discussion of certain projected non-GAAP financial measures that we are not able to reconcile without unreasonable efforts and supplementary financial information can be found in the shareholder letter that we released earlier today.
The shareholder letter and other earnings-related materials are available on our website at investors.arm.com.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rene, who has some prepared remarks. Thank you, Ian, and hello, everyone. So I'm just going to make a few comments to kick off the call and then I'll pass it over to Jason.
But in summary, this quarter, Q4, obviously being the end of our fiscal year, was just outstanding. We have record revenues for this quarter. And for our first fiscal year as a public company being completed, also record revenue, exceeding the high end of the guidance range.
More specifically for Q4, revenue was up 47% year-on-year. Royalty is up 37% year-on-year, and this is really driven by acceleration of v9 adoption, which I'll speak about a little bit more; and also licensing up 60% year-on-year, which is really a function of increased R&D investment to capture the huge opportunity that is all things AI.
Now in looking back, the expansion strategies that we talked about during our roadshow and then IPO are now all driving growth for the company. As mentioned, we had significant royalty growth in the last quarter, up year-on-year 37%, really driven by v9 adoption. And what we're seeing is the acceleration of v8 to v9, which drives not only better royalties but we're also seeing more CPUs inside the chip, which compounds that royalty growth really across all end markets. And the significant driver for that in client has been around smartphones, but broadly, we also see that in our infrastructure business as well. And v9 adoption will only continue to increase.
In the last quarter, we've also seen proof points of our diversification strategy. Google, the latest hyperscaler announced their Axion processor based on Arm custom chip intended for the data center. They chose us largely because of our compute efficiency but also the ability to not only have a high-performing chip but to design an increasingly performant blade, rack and system for a fantastic TCO.
We also announced our very first autonomous solutions based on v9. This is very, very significant as we're now bringing v9 performance to the automotive sector with automotive enhanced features such as functional safety, and we expect huge growth around this area. And we also have introduced the lowest power transformer on the planet, the Ethos-U85 for IoT-based designs.
One of the strategies we put in place that we are most comfortable with in terms of its growth but very confident in terms of its trajectory is around our, what we call, compute subsystems. And these are essentially taking blocks of IP, putting them together into a full solution, verified and validated, that saves customers huge time to market and also gives them a highly performant solution. So we announced our V3 Neoverse CSS this quarter, which will give increased performance and benefits to customers.
The first automotive CSS is now in discussions with our key partners -- to customers in terms of time to market and efficiency. And our first customer in the Neoverse space doing a design, Microsoft, their Cobalt chip is now ramping.
But probably from a more exciting standpoint, we are oversubscribed on this compute subsystem strategy. We have far more demand for the product than anticipated, and we are anticipating growing that significantly over time. Every end market that we approach has a need for CSSs, and we're very excited about talking about them in the future.
All of this is also being driven by AI. What we are seeing is, because Arm has the largest installed base of CPUs on the planet and has over 70% of the world's population using those CPUs, it's natural that, as these AI workloads are now being moved anywhere from the edge devices to the training data center, that they need support from an Arm CPU standpoint. So whether it's from cloud Edge, from GPT to Llama, all AI workloads rely and run on Arm. And we only see this increasing. Our licensing activity is probably the best proxy for that.
The way to think about licensing revenue as it applies to AI is, as software is moving faster than hardware, the hardware designs need to be upgraded quickly to make sure they can capture the needs of these new AI workloads. So because of that, we have seen huge growth in our licensing activity. We talked about that last quarter and it continued this quarter. So based upon this, we are very, very confident of our growth outlook for the upcoming year. This past year was over 20% revenue growth, and we expect that to be even better than that in this year and the upcoming years. Our growth has been accelerating.
Lastly, it's taken Arm 20 years to get to $1 billion in revenue. It took us 10 years to get to $2 billion. This year, we passed $3 billion in only 2 years after our first $2 billion year, and we expect to be near $4 billion this year. The future is very bright, and we'll run in Arm, and I could not be more excited about the future that we have.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason. Thank you, Rene.
Q4 was a strong end to a tremendous year for Arm. For the quarter, we grew revenue 47% year-over-year to $928 million, with licensing revenue up 60% and record royalty revenue up 37% while also delivering non-GAAP operating margin of 42%. Also, as well as delivering strong revenues, we also have grown our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, by 45% year-over-year to nearly $2.5 billion. The royalty acceleration and record RPO provides a great setup for FYE '25.
Turning to guidance. I will briefly touch on both the first quarter and fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. For Q1, we expect revenue of between $875 million and $925 million, representing a 30% to 37% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be $475 million, a sequential decline due to a change in remuneration as we complete our transition away from cash awards to equity awards, and a onetime Q4 expense. Resulting non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.32 and $0.36.
Unpacking Q1 revenue dynamics a little further, we expect royalty revenue to remain strong with year-over-year growth of approximately 20%. This growth is driven by continued Armv9 adoption and recovery in smartphones, along with continued share gains in automotive and at hyperscalers. This is partially offset by weakness in IoT driven by inventory correction in the broader industrial market, as has been widely reported by many of our semiconductor peers. For Q1 licensing and other revenues, we expect slight sequential growth driven by revenue from backlog.
Looking out to fiscal '25, we expect revenues of between $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion, representing a 17% to 27% year-over-year increase. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.05 billion, representing a 19% year-over-year increase as we continue to invest in R&D to support future growth initiatives. Our full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.45 and $1.65.
We believe our license business is best understood by the measure annualized contract value, or ACV. Our outlook for ACV remains strong. We expect low double-digit growth for the year, reflecting the durable demand in Arm's latest IP.
Licensing revenue, however, will continue to be lumpy from period to period due to the timing of revenue recognition. Based on our current forecast, we expect the first half to represent approximately 40% of our license revenue for the year, with Q2 being the smallest and Q4 being the largest quarter of the year. We have high visibility through a combination of backlog renewals and new licenses.
For royalties, we remain very confident in the demand for Arm-based chips and expect full year growth in the mid-20% range driven by continued v9 adoption, market share gains in cloud and automotive as well as chips based on our compute subsystems starting to ramp in the second half of the year.
Looking out further beyond this year, based on the pipeline for new licenses, agreements already signed, and royalty-bearing chips in development or now shipping, we expect to maintain total revenue growth of at least 20% year-over-year for each of the fiscal years ending in 2026 and '27.
I'll now turn the call back over to Ian. Thank you, Jason. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I hand back to you, operator. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Congrats on the strong results and guide. Rene, I had a question on your infrastructure business and specifically the cloud side. You rattled off a number of the disparate design wins that are starting to ramp from a number of the hyperscaler customers. What I was really wondering is, during the IPO process, you talked about 10% market share in that market rising to roughly, I think you said, 27% or so. Are those products that are occurring now and being launched, are they contemplating that original ramp? Or are you seeing an acceleration above and beyond the growth rate that you have laid out for all of us during the IPO process? I would say I'm still confident in those numbers, Ross. I would say one of the dynamics that has changed a bit since we've said it, and I think a positive for us, is the increased investment in the data center around all things AI. And that bodes well for Arm for a couple of reasons.
First off, when you think about power efficiency and what's required for the data center, the implementation of an Arm-based design gets very, very interesting relative to not only building a custom chip that will be more power efficient but by designing a blade and interconnecting to storage and an overall rack that will be much more power efficient.
Secondly, and I think we chatted about this during the IPO process with Grace Hopper, but I think now with NVIDIA's most recent announcement, Grace Blackwell, you are going to see an acceleration on the data center in these AI applications.
One of the benefits that you get in terms of designing a chip such as Grace Blackwell is, by integrating the Arm CPU with the NVIDIA GPU, you are able to get an interconnect between the CPU and the GPU that allows for a much higher access to memory, which is one of the limiting factors is for training and inference applications. In a conventional system where you might connect to an x86 externally, you have to do that over a PCIe bus, which is much slower. So by using a custom bus in the NVIDIA example, like NVLink, you get much higher memory bandwidth. So I think what that is going to mean is that Arm adoption in the data center will increase probably faster than the numbers that we had indicated, but we're not saying anything official right now. And our next question will come from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. It's on the v9 conversion. If I look at Slide 15 of the chart presentation that you have, it shows that it took about 7 years or so for v8 to become about half of the base. Rene, how do you expect this v9 conversion? It seems to have gotten off faster off the gates, 20% or so conversion in a year. What's your assumption of what that conversion looks like in your fiscal '25? I think Jason said mid-20% growth or so in royalty. What does that imply for the level of conversion exiting the year? Yes. I'll let Jason touch on that conversion rate. But what I can say from a high level, what is different between v8 and v9 is, back in the conversion from v7 to v8, we really didn't have an infrastructure business at all to speak about. We do today, and that is all v9. So that is going to be a growth driver that we saw in terms of conversion for v9 from v8 that we just didn't see from v7 to v8.
In the smartphone business, we are seeing a fairly rapid acceleration in the premium handset segment that is moving to v9. And I think it's been pretty well documented that it's the premium handset business that has enjoyed probably better growth than some of the other segments, which has accelerated as well. So those are 2 drivers for v9 that will look, I think, a bit different than v8 and why it should happen more quickly.
I'll let Jason comment on what we think the potential exit rate might be and particularly how it applies to our year-on-year revenue growth projection. Yes. I would say the 500 basis points of growth or as a percentage of total going from 10% to 15% last quarter and then this most recent quarter from 15% to 20%, I think that's a pretty steady clip. It could be plus or minus but that somewhere around 500 basis points of share growth per quarter is probably a reasonable assumption. So that puts you probably out somewhere in the 2- to 3-year time frame that we probably get to the high end, which is probably somewhere maybe around 60% to 70% because there is still going to be some v8 and v9 out there even as we see growth in the v9 adoption.
Keep in mind, I think when we talked about this back at IPO and even last quarter, you do also see an increased royalty that's almost double from v9 when you go to subsystems. And so we start to see our subsystems come online at the end of this year, in the back half of this year, and then that will start to take hold next year. That also probably has somewhere in the kind of 3- to 4-year time frame of becoming a large share of our royalties. So that's the reason why we have high confidence in a royalty forecast that should be pretty strong and kind of approaching or in that 20% range for years to come. And our next question will be coming from Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Rene, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the infrastructure business question that Ross sort of started off with. And one of the questions I've been getting from folks is I can see very, very clearly how things like Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell will be accelerants of pulling Arm into the data center, and you've announced with Amazon and Google and Microsoft other design wins that will do the same thing, on the flip side, in the accelerated data center, if you just look at a percentage of CapEx that goes to CPUs versus accelerators, that accelerator portion is going to be a vast majority, it seems like, and that trend is accelerating pretty rapidly. So maybe you could speak a little bit to Arm's role not just in the head node of accelerated servers but across the accelerator portion of that sort of exciting growth in CapEx. Yes. Thanks, Matt, for the question. I think if you go back to the original design win we had with the hyperscalers, and that was with AWS and Graviton, one of the benefits they talked about specifically in terms of using Arm was performance per dollar. And the performance per dollar metric becomes increasingly important as you talk about these large CapEx spends having to manage both the CPU and GPU balance.
I think that is candidly also going to be a tailwind for growth with us because not only do you get a better TCO from a chip standpoint in terms of performance per dollar but, again, just launching into the AWS example for a moment. They built a chip called Nitro, which is based on Arm, for storage offload. And when you combine a Nitro SoC with a Graviton SoC into an EC2 compute rack and then you potentially now configure that for acceleration, that's going to give you a pretty compelling cost advantage versus the competition.
So I think candidly, the trade-off, and this is why the question in terms of what's going on with AI and how we think about market share, I think that's going to be a tailwind for Arm because not only with these standard devices can you configure something that's fairly interesting but you can start to imagine, if anyone wants to do a custom implementation, to greatly enhance some of those interconnect features I talked about. It gets very, very interesting. And only Arm allows that flexibility. There's no way to do that with any alternative.
And not only is there no way to do that with the alternative architecture that is the incumbent today but, more importantly, Arm has done all the work with the partners relative to running the boot code, the system, interface, everything to booting the operating system. So we are extremely well positioned to do well in that platform.
So I think the short summary is I think everything you described is actually going to be quite good for us, which is why I think the growth numbers for our market share in the data center were probably better than we had originally articulated. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna International Group. Just want to go back to your fiscal year '25 color and specifically on the licensing. Should I assume that the licensing mix rebounded in the second half of fiscal year? Is that going to be driven by more of the smartphone customers renewing for Armv9? Or is that going to be more broad-based? I would expect it to be more broad-based. As I mentioned, it's going to be mostly in Q4. I mean, that's going to be the biggest license quarter of the year. But definitely with the focus on AI and the focus on AI capability in really all the different end markets that we serve, you should expect it to be quite broad-based. And on the smartphone, the royalty will kick in with the smartphone shipment in calendar year '25. Well, our first subsystems will start to launch basically in the last quarter of the year, so you should see it in our Q4, but I guess it would be in calendar Q1 of '25. Yes. From the time we license the technology to the time we see a royalty, it's probably 2 or 3 years, best case, which is why the confidence level that we have in terms of royalty growth is quite high because those contracts are done, we know the rates, we know the market share, et cetera.
For the new designs, to Matt's question earlier and Ross', if you're trying to develop an SoC that's going to fit in the server and it needs to run Linux and it needs to run SUSE or Kubernetes, et cetera, et cetera, there's really only one choice, Arm. If you're trying to build an SoC to run Windows, there's only one choice, it's Arm. If you're trying to build an SoC to run Android or Gemini, there's only one choice, it's Arm. So the confidence we have in terms of licensing happening is extremely high.
The tricky part is always in terms of the visibility, whether that license is signed on December 15 or January 15, which moves across a quarter boundary. But in terms of the confidence that it's going to happen, it's extremely high because the choices are rather limited if you want to participate in that market. And when you add in factors on the Windows such as Copilot and things such as Gemini for Android, that's why we're seeing an accelerating effort of the licensees to be able to get access to next-generation technology to take advantage of these new AI features. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Shi of Needham & Company. I have a question, maybe a little bit backward-looking. This was a question I got quite frequently over the last quarter about your royalty revenue growth seen in December quarter. And obviously, you see another very strong sequential growth in March.
So in December quarter, since you already disclosed how much of the royalty revenue coming from related parties, which is a proxy of Arm China, we did notice that Arm China actually was the driver for the royalty revenue growth in December, at least on a sequential basis. Outside of China, it's probably only like a 4%-ish of the sequential growth. So wonder if you guys can use this opportunity to clarify, what was driving that over 50% sequential China royalty revenue growth in December quarter? And can you kind of give us a breakdown for the March quarter, which one, either China or the non-China, is driving most of the sequential growth? Sure, this is Jason. I'll take that question. So first, I would say there has been a little bit of recovery in China in the handset market. It was up, what is it, 1.5%, 2% or so year-on-year going back to the December quarter. So a little bit was just the general market. But the bigger impact was, I would say, the mix shift of the Chinese consumer buying from, I would say, OEMs or partners. Our revenues are based not on where the customer is but based on where the partner who effectively sold the products was. So basically, there was a transfer from Chinese customers buying from Chinese producers versus someone from outside of China. And so what that shows up as, from a royalty perspective, is a shift from rest of world to related parties. And by the way, related parties is mostly China. There are other parties in there as well.
Now in terms of the March quarter end, you'll see similar trends. The rest of the world did accelerate. I mean, we saw a pretty significant royalty acceleration from, what was it, 11%, 12% back in Q3, and it was 37% in Q4. So there is broad-based increase across the world. But you are going to see more acceleration also in China for really the same factors that we saw back in Q3 as well. Got it. May I ask a quick clarification, Jason? When you talk about acceleration of the percentages, you mean year-on-year or Q-on-Q? Year-on-year. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. I had a relatively short-term question on the June quarter outlook for your royalty business, maybe one for Jason. Based on your comments, I think for royalty, you're assuming something like a 7% sequential decline in revenue. Given the v8 to v9 transition, I would think your blended royalty rate continues to grow nicely, so units must be down maybe double digits, again, Q-over-Q. I think typical seasonality is up sequentially if I look at your business over the past couple of years. So I guess the question is, what's driving that sequential decline? I know you're coming off a really high base, but curious what you're assuming, whether it be the smartphone market or some of the other big drivers. Sure. So the driver of the 7% sequential decline is really us looking at the combination of what are we seeing all of our partners forecast either through good faith estimates or what they've actually just disclosed publicly. I mean, you know all the big players, when I look across all those different markets, I'm basically seeing pretty significant declines or weakness, specifically in, I would say, networking and industrial and IoT.
I think on the mobile side, things will be pretty consistent. And so our growth overall will still be very, very much positive, in the kind of 20-ish percent range. But because we're coming off of the kind of the bottom out from over a year ago, the year-on-year will look a little less significant than it did last quarter. But we'll see. If our partners end up seeing different impacts, which, of course, flow through our royalties, there perhaps may be upside. But that's what we're seeing right now, and we'll obviously let you know what we see at the end of the quarter. And Jason, just to clarify, is it fair to say that automotive and IoT are relative underperformers into June and client and infrastructure should be relatively resilient. Is that a fair statement? Yes, I think it's generally right. And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. I guess, maybe Rene, I'd love to get your thoughts on PC potential over the next few years and your [ coherence ] in clients given all the work, various folks in the ecosystem that you've been dealing, there seems to be a lot of really interesting reciprocity going on. So just any thoughts on the potential would be great. Yes, thanks for the question. We've been obviously working on the Windows ecosystem for a long time. The Apple ecosystem has completely converted over. So when we think about our growth, we're talking about Windows. I think over the next number of years, we are very positive about the growth potential.
I think one of the things that's needed for the PC industry to grow, particularly the Windows on Arm segment is going to be a diversification of the supplier base to provide multiple units, multiple SKUs, multiple price points, and multiple experiences for end consumers. Everything I'm hearing says that there are going to be multiple suppliers to serve that market over the next 12 to 36 months. And with that, we think now will be the time, over the next 2, 3 years, where the Arm ecosystem will take a significant level of market share, primarily because of the level of experience that we've seen in the other ecosystem, the fantastic performance, the great battery life, the fact that you can build a high-performance machine minus a fan. I think all those things are going to add up for significant growth. So I think once the vendor base diversifies, I think we're going to see that growth start to kick in over the next 12 to 36 months. Our next question will come from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo Securities. When fiscal year '25 is done, you will have grown your licensing revenue 20%, a 20% rate for the prior 2 years, and that's well above what you were predicting during the IPO roadshow. And seemingly, you're predicting long-term 10% growth. So is that the new long-term target we should think about in terms of license revenue growth? And related to that, you highlight how you converted half of your top 30 customers into ATA licensees. How hard will it be to convert the other half? So thanks for the question. The way I think about the licensing revenue, and you're right, it's a nice upside that continue to be very, very strong, the indications that we get looking forward is that we don't see anything that would stop the licensing activity being a positive momentum. The reason for that is what I mentioned before. If you're trying to enter any of these markets, that are, a, requiring more and more AI; b, require the rich application ecosystem support; and c, broad OS support, the only logical choice that partners have is Arm. And for that reason, we're very confident that we continue to maintain and sustain that level of momentum.
I think in terms of what percentage of customers ultimately move over to an ATA, my estimation is that probably 80% of the customer base at some point in time can be on that, which will give us a lot of increased predictability in terms of license renewals, not so much the if they'll renew but the when, which is [ what we hope for ] going forward.
So Jason, I'll refer to you the second part of that question. Well, let's see, on ATA, I'm not sure if you caught in the notes, we did increase our ATA partners from 27 to 31, so we added 4 more. So a little over roughly half of our, I'd say, at least of the top 20 are there now. But I would say what we're happy about is, when we look into next year even versus what we thought at IPO, we thought that we would probably have closer to 30% year-on-year growth in royalties, and we were all expecting kind of full industry kind of correction. It turns out that industrial IoT and networking aren't quite there. And so even though we are taking down royalty a little bit, we're able to take up license by even more than that royalty reduction mostly because of what Rene just talked about specifically, this demand for additional licensing capabilities very much related to AI.
Now in terms of it being a new normal, I would say no because all license deals, or at least certainly the large ATAs, they have a very high conversion into royalties. Especially with the larger, more kind of mature companies, they typically are pretty good about turning those into design wins and then turning those into royalties. And because these deals are all in v9, they're higher royalty rates than the older counterparts. So I would expect what we talked about back at IPO, when we would get in the next couple of years, get to royalties at 75-plus percent of our total revenue, that's very much still the expectation.
I would say we're just starting to see that, as we get deeper into the v9 penetration life cycle and then also as we see the Compute Subsystems start to come online again at even higher royalty rates at the end of this year, that gives us a great setup for, I would say, a much higher mix of royalties as we go into next year. Our next question will come from Lee Simpson of Morgan Stanley. I just want to take us back to the v9 profiles that you stood out for automotive, the automotive enhanced profiles, and that includes licensing from Texas, NXP, NVIDIA, et cetera. Just trying to understand how much of that licensing would have been recognized in Q4's number, how much would have gone into RPO. And maybe just related to that, I don't know if I heard correctly but you mentioned multiple customers are working on the CSS release for this in 2025. Yes. So I'll let Jason go into detail relative to the contribution of the automotive v9 AI technology from a licensing standpoint.
On the CSS engagement, we have multiple partners who are engaged in that. The way to think about the automotive industry is that it is an extremely complex market that needs some degree of customization but also want some level of standardization. And each of the automotive OEMs would love to have a solution that supports a full software stack that would have a number of different contributions relative to differentiation but also something that could be standardized.
So to that level, we've had incredible engagement with lots of different OEMs across this level. And we're very, very confident that the kind of demand that we've seen for CSSs in our other businesses will be there in automotive. It just makes all kinds of sense when you think about the complexity of these devices, the cost involved but yet the need for supply chain resiliency.
So I'll let Jason address the question relative to the licensing revenue and how that all ties together. Yes. So the licensing revenue, in this case, for automotive is a little unique. Typically, we get around 50% of the booking. At the time of booking, it will be booked as revenue. In this case, since v9, it's not quite delivered for auto, it's coming very, very soon, that is actually delayed, so it all is going into backlog. It will be released as soon as it's launched, and we'll announce when that happens. Our next question will be coming from Timm Schulze-Melander of Redburn Atlantic. So I just wanted to dig back into the royalty outlook for next quarter and just trying to maybe disaggregate a little bit the volume and the pricing impact. I think you talked about the mix increasing by about 5 percentage points a quarter which, over the course of '25 should give us a pretty decent tailwind. But I think you guided that royalties are going to grow somewhere in the sort of 25% range. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color about how that breaks down between volume, price, and mix? Okay. So last quarter, if I look at all of our partners, and we don't have all their details on mix, but their growth on average was around 2-ish percent. And obviously, we grew at 37%. So that differential is very much the mix of either more premium chips, higher royalties as well as the higher royalties related to v9. So I would say, going into the next quarter, we're expecting that our overall peer group that we get paid royalties on is probably in that 5-ish percent range. And then we're now expecting that our royalties, as we said, will be somewhere in the 20% range. Obviously, the v9 portion we have a decent handle on, but the mix across the different aspects of the market of premium is just very hard to know ahead of time. So those are the key components.
I would say, going forward, we do expect to see effectively unit growth because, again, I'm assuming that the mix across most of these, we don't get all the detail, but I'm assuming that most of it is going to be pretty consistent. I would assume that we're going to continue to have our royalty growth mostly because of the v9 and mix impacts continue to run pretty significantly ahead of the overall market unit growth. Our next question will be coming from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Backlog was up 45% year-over-year, strong Q4 ACV, so very, very strong end to the year; obviously, a combination of some large renewals but, more importantly, customers. It seems like across all of your end markets, right, adopting the higher value-added compute and Compute Subsystems IP as they sort of look towards their future chip design programs. As you look at your renewal pipeline, discussion with customers and their program timing, looks like you are going to drive strong licensing growth again this year. But does the pipeline suggest that the team can grow total backlog this fiscal year? Harlan, this is Jason. I'll start with that. I'll start with your question. I think at a high level, if I look at last year, you can kind of back into bookings by looking at revenue plus change of backlog. That total number was about $2.2 billion last year. And if you look at kind of what we're assuming for this year, we're definitely assuming less than that. Now last year, we started with a number that was quite a bit below $2.2 billion. And as we mentioned, we had a really strong booking year mostly because of incremental deals that came mostly due to AI. So our assumptions for this year on license is that right now, we'll probably have maybe 60% of the bookings that we had last year, at least that's what it would take to get to kind of our plan.
Now there certainly is opportunity. If you look last year, there was some overage that was probably somewhere in that similar range. We started out with a plan that was probably more like 60% or 70% of what we actually achieved. So we do have good line of sight to the current plan, and we did provide a relatively wide range, mostly because we have to try to factor in the timing of when these deals are going to hit and whether it's Q3 or Q4 or whatever. But if you kind of back up and say, ""Well, when I see kind of the midpoint of guidance for this year, what's the confidence level?"" I'd say we're at 80-plus percent of the midpoint of our plan. Our guidance is already either in backlog or under contract in royalties.
So really, what we're trying to do is we're trying to forecast what is the incremental bookings that we're going to sign for the year, which a bunch of that's already in the pipeline, and then what possibly could there be beyond that. I'm not really forecasting the stuff that's beyond that, beyond what's in the pipeline today. But if this year looks like last year, that's where some possible upside would come. I would now like to turn the call back to Rene Haas, CEO, for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, and thank you for all the questions, very good set of dialogue and hopefully, we have given some insight in terms of why we are so confident about the future of our company.
This is our third quarter as a public company so it's the third time we've done one of these calls. And it's the third time that we've reported record revenue to you. And it's the third time that we're going to be forecasting growth on the quarter going forward. So we've had 3 quarters of record revenue as a public company. We're also forecasting that next quarter. And I think, again, what you're seeing is the validation of the strategies that we put in place some years ago all coming to fruition, the expansion of our business into multiple markets such as infrastructure, automotive, client PCs, and of course, smartphones. In addition to that, the AI tailwind, which has driven unprecedented growth for our licensing business.
So Arm is a platform company unlike any other. It's a business unlike any other. And the growth and outlook for the company could not have been brighter. To come off of a year where we're talking about 20% growth, and then talking about the year following and the year following when we will do better than that, it's a great business to be in.
So thank you for all your time, and I'll leave it now to Ian or who else to close the call. That's all from us, and thank you very much indeed. We'll talk to some of you later and some in 90 days' time. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ian Thornton .

Welcome to the Arm First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your first seeker today, Jeff Kvaal, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. On the call today are Rene Haas, Chief Executive Officer of Arm and Jason Child, Arm's Chief Financial Officer. 
During the call, Arm will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking information regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment of future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important risk factors that may affect our future results and performance are described in our registration statement on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024. Arm assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliation of certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as a discussion of certain projected non-GAAP financial measures that we are not able to reconcile without unreasonable efforts or supplemental financial information can be found in our shareholder letter.
The shareholder letter and other earnings-related materials are available on our website at investors.arm.com. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rene. Rene? Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to give you an update on our most recent quarter.
We had our fourth straight quarter of record results, 39% year-on-year revenue, which exceeded the high end of the guidance. That was record license revenue, up 70% year-on-year, as companies continue to invest in Arm for AI everywhere. We also had strong royalty revenue, up 17% year-on-year, as the v9 adoption increases. 
Now our long-term growth drivers remain consistent. Every chip being designed today requires a CPU, and these are being designed with Arm in mind, with our strong tie into all the world software. Now that has driven significant royalty revenue growth, more value per chip, v9 up to 25% now royalty revenue of overall, that's up 20% from the previous quarter. More importantly, our smartphone royalty revenue was up 50% year-on-year. That's against a single-digit increase in units.
Now we are seeing AI everywhere, which is driving demand for Arm's performance in power efficient compute platform. We had recent announcements in the last quarter of Google's Axion processor for the cloud, AWS Graviton for general availability. We were very excited to see the announcement of the brand-new Windows on Arm PCs that run Copilot through AI PCs, and we also announced the Arm Ethos-U85 for edge AI. 
One of the significant strategies that we've been investing in has been compute subsystems. With our recent launch of CSS per client, we now have active CSS engagements in the major markets of mobile, laptop, cloud and automotive. We are seeing demand for this technology everywhere. And this is all driven by the largest software ecosystem on the planet. 
Now hardware, of course, is nothing without the software, and that's what has made Arm the most ubiquitous processor in history. We now have over 20 million software developers, the largest in the world, and we've added KleidiAI software libraries, which will make it easier for developers to benefit from our Arm compute platform.
The future is very bright and will be built on Arm going forward. We are extremely pleased over the last 4 quarters. And again, if I look back to where we were a year ago and talking about whether Arm could be a growth company going forward, to have 4 quarters of consistent growth after being a public company, I could not be more proud.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Jason. Thank you, Rene. Q1 was a great start for fiscal year '25. We grew revenue 39% year-over-year to $939 million. This was our highest ever quarterly revenue and was above the midpoint of our guided range. Licensing revenue rose 72% year-over-year and royalty revenue was up 17%. We also delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 48%.
As always, license revenue is lumpy. We recommend that you look at annualized contract value, or ACV, to check the underlying growth rate. ACV in Q1 was up 14% year-over-year, consistent with recent quarters. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was up 29% year-on-year and down sequentially as we recognize revenue from achieving key delivery milestones from contracts signed in prior quarters our Q1 royalty revenue growth was driven by continued Armv9 adoption and the recovery in the smartphone market.
Royalty revenue from smartphones increased more than 50% year-over-year compared with a mid-single-digit increase in the number of smartphones sold. In addition, we continue to gain share in automotive and cloud service providers, and this is partially offset by continued weakness in IoT and networking equipment given an ongoing inventory correction in the broader industrial market, as has been widely reported by many of our semiconductor peers.
Turning to guidance. I will briefly touch on both second quarter and the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. This guidance reflects our current view of our end markets.
For Q2, we expect revenue between $780 million and $830 million which, at the midpoint, represents a steady revenue year-over-year. As previously guided, we expect Q2 revenue to be the low point of the year due to the timing of revenue recognition from licensing. However, we also expect Q2 to be one of our highest bookings quarters over the years. We expect year-over-year royalty revenue growth to accelerate to the low-20% range in Q2. Investments in our compute platforms are on track, and we expect our non-GAAP operating results to be around $500 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.23 and $0.27, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Looking out to fiscal year '25, we are reiterating our revenue guidance. We expect revenues to be between $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion, which represents an 18% to 27% year-over-year increase. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, this includes full year royalty revenue growth in the low-20% range. This is slightly below our prior expectation of the mid-20% range. Feedback from our customers suggest that inventory issues in the industrial IoT and networking seem to be more persistent than originally suggested. We expect the drivers of our healthy royalty revenue growth this year to be continued with v9 adoption, share gains in cloud and automotive and the initial ramp of chips based on our compute subsystems in the second half. 
We are increasingly optimistic about licensing revenue for the year. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we anticipate growth in the low to mid-20% range. We expect Q2 to be the smallest and Q4 to be the largest quarters of the year. We reiterate our outlook for ACV growth in the low double digits for the year, which reflects durable demand for Arm's latest IP. We have high visibility through a combination of backlog, renewals and the pipeline of new licenses. As a reminder, licensing is a leading indicator of future royalty revenue opportunities. Licenses signed now will generate royalty revenues in 2 to 3 years' time.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.05 billion, which represents a 19% year-over-year increase. As we continue to invest in R&D to support future growth initiatives, we expect operating expenses to ramp consistently throughout the year. We reiterate our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance of between $1.45 and $1.65. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff. Thank you, Jason. We will now move forward with the Q&A portion of the program. Sharon? [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Rene, I was hoping you could help us draw a line between the licensing upside of today to the royalty upside of tomorrow. When I look back during the IPO process, what you suggested for licensing, you have far exceeded that. But when do you think we will see that reflected in royalty upside in some commensurate manner? What is the right way to kind of help look at this conversion factor between licensing and royalties over time? Yes. Thank you for the question. We are super pleased about the growth in the licensing business. The way to think about that growth is really around continued investment in R&D. That is essentially customers who are looking to design their next-generation SoCs using Arm. What we are seeing, particularly with all things AI, is an increase in licensing momentum. And maybe one way to think about that is the AI workloads that some of these chips need to run. At the time these chips were conceived, some of the models that they're being taxed to run were never even invented yet, which kind of goes back to your time line question. 
From the time that we license a piece of IP to a customer, and from the time that they put that into a chip, and that chip goes into an end system, and then ultimately into the customers' hands, can be anywhere between 3 and 4 years and, in some cases, even longer. I would say the mobile industry, the smartphone is probably the fastest at around 3 years-ish. But when you start looking at other markets like the data center and/or automotive, it can be longer than that. 
So the way to think about all this increased licensing activity, I think, is a very, very good predictor of further royalty growth. Increasingly, we are licensing more and more v9, obviously, but also more and more of these compute subsystems. And both v9 over v8 and then compute subsystems over v9 carry significantly higher royalty rates. So all of this is a very good projection for the future. Your next question comes from the line of Lee Simpson from Morgan Stanley. Rene, it's noticeable here that you've had a raft of good product releases recently. We've had the new Cortex-X925 CPU. We've had Immortalis cores. So there's quite a lot of activity going on here, a lot for you to be licensing. I think somewhat unnoticed is there's quite a few CPU extensions that you've been putting out to market as well. So I'm really just trying to understand, do we see more momentum in the CPU extensions? Do we see more of these coming out? Which markets would they address? And how does this drive some of that royalty growth that you've been talking about over the medium term? Yes. Thank you for the question. The way t think about the CPU product line and the GPU product line, for that matter, in addition to some of the fabric that goes with it, we're introducing these products annually for the smartphone market and PC market, in particular. Those are annual beats for the data center market, more like every couple of years, and similar to that on the automotive side. And all of that is driving a pretty significant growth and demand cycle for Arm technology.
One of the things that we see to your question of extensions, if I understand it correctly, is really around taking advantage of more and more of the v9 features. There's a lot inside version 9 with security. There's a lot in terms of version 9 in terms of confidential compute. We're seeing increased demand for that across all areas, particularly in the data center. And when we think about the data center growth, one of the benefits we're also getting that's driving increased licensing activity is the fact that these AI data centers are largely custom, meaning that the blades, the racks, the interconnect, everything associated with building an AI data center is different each time, which leads its way to customization, which is good for Arm because these custom chips require Arm.
At the same time, the AI data centers, the power required by them is unprecedented relative to conventional data centers, and that's also good for Arm. And so the areas that I just mentioned around security and confidential compute, particularly these AI data centers, become hard requirements. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay, TD Cowen. Rene, Jason, I had a couple of questions. Maybe I'll just ask at the same time for expediency. But the first one, the licensing business has continued to be really strong for Arm and I think certainly stronger recently than you guys had even forecasted, the IPO process and whatnot. And maybe some of the, I don't know, upselling to make AI-capable devices in certain markets has been part of that. And obviously, you talked about some of the platform licenses and whatnot in data center. But there's no doubt some correction going on in certain parts of the semiconductor industry. We've seen that across a number of your licensees in broader-based markets. So I just wonder if you could maybe give some commentary about what you're seeing in the licensing pipeline juxtaposed against some weakness in some parts of the semi industry.
And then I guess the second part, I know you guys don't plan to report royalties or comment on them based on segments and lines of business on a quarterly basis, but you did call out 50% year-over-year growth in smartphone royalties against the total royalty pie growing 17%. So maybe you could talk about the puts and takes in some of the other non-smartphone sectors of the royalty numbers that you just printed. Sure. Thank you, Matt. I'll take the first part of your question, and then I'll let Jason address the second part. It's a great question relative to how to think about industry correction, inventory sell-through as a function of investment in R&D. And in cycles in the past, sometimes you might see the investment in future design be impacted by just what you described. I would say in the current moment of time, that is not the case. What we are not observing is any slowdown in licensing as it applies to anything going on in the end market.
And I think what really drives that is when you think about these AI workloads and what's required to go drive them, keep in mind that if a designer is designing an SoC and they're now having to run an AI workload or a small language model at the edge of a device, that is in addition to all of the things that the SoC and the system has to do anyway. So what that is driving is a demand for more compute, more compute capability, more CPU cores, more subsystems, all of the above, relative to new SoC starts. So we're not observing anything slowing down. And in fact, as you can see by the numbers, and your commentary relative to what we talked about 12 months ago during the IPO, it's probably picked up.
And I think one of the reasons that we're seeing the benefit of that from a revenue standpoint is these are all running off existing platforms that are Arm-based. And one of the things that we continuously say about what drives Arm demand is this virtuous cycle of the largest number of platforms from a software development standpoint are Arm-based. So the more software that's available to run on Arm, the more companies are trying to build chips that go into these end products, end up making them Arm based.
So we face very little competition, quite frankly, when the people are considering what is the CPU to use on the new design. And as a result, the availability of additional hardware just makes it easy for the software developers to choose which hardware to continue to develop on because it ends up all being Arm. So long-winded way of saying that on this cycle, not observing any slowdown in terms of R&D investment, even though there might be some slowdown in terms of end market consumption, as you state.
I'll turn it over to Jason to answer the second part of your question. Thanks, Matt. So on royalties, we're going to provide -- in the accompanying slides, we're going to update that. That will be sent out right when the call ends. But we'll provide an update, as we promised, the annual kind of update, on what is the mix of our royalties. And then what is the kind of update in TAM and kind of market shares.
Just at a high level, I'll provide maybe a little bit of update at kind of some of the key headlines. So first, as we said during the prepared remarks, we did see the mobile phone or smartphone royalty revenues grow by over 50%, and so certainly very, very strong growth, as you said, versus the unit growth. In terms of the clients overall, for the full year, we saw that grow somewhere kind of in the 20-ish percent range when you factor all the different businesses together. And again, we'll provide more color across some of the various sectors where there was maybe some slowdown, specifically in PCs last year was a slow year. Obviously, we expect that to change this year, but last year was pretty slow.
For the cloud compute market, we actually saw the strongest growth we've ever seen at, say, north of 75% growth year-on-year. And that's certainly driven by all the projects that we've talked about throughout this last year. Certainly, strong growth within AWS. But now with some of the projects coming online with both Cobalt from Microsoft and Axion from Google, we expect to see that number continue to accelerate. On the auto side, we saw that somewhere around 20-ish percent year-on-year growth. And again, that's a little bit different than what you're seeing in some of the other auto semiconductor companies. For the most part, really our exposure is primarily on ADAS and IVI, which are kind of the stronger growth parts of that market.
And then on IoT, networking, industrial, as mentioned, those categories, we've seen persistent weakness in those categories. So we've seen negative growth in those categories. Expecting to see things start to pick up maybe a little bit, at least sequentially this quarter, but last year, definitely, they were in the negative territory. But again, we'll provide a supplement with more detail. And so if you have other questions after seeing those details, we'll certainly be able to answer questions after that comes out. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Evercore. I had a question on the compute side of the business, maybe a two-part question, if I may. In compute on the CPU side of the data center, I think for us, it's more easy to track because there's more obvious deployments there. But I would say on the parallel processing side or the accelerator side, it's not as easy for us to track. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where you are in the penetration of that part of the market. And if you could comment about how that part of the business compares to the CPU side. And then along these lines, if we consider the model, my understanding is that you have more core accounts for CPU that drives ASP higher and that helps. And I'm wondering, is that same dynamic apply on the accelerator side. Yes. Thank you for the question. So when you think about the AI data center and particularly around the accelerator and the CPU that ties into it, clearly, the lion's share of the market today with accelerators belongs to NVIDIA. And NVIDIA, their numbers speak for themselves. But relative to the penetration of Arm in the data center, they had announced Grace Hopper about 1.5 years ago, which was the Arm-based design, which integrates an Arm-based CPU to a Hopper GPU. The next advanced platform that they announced, Grace Blackwell, which is going to be shipping soon, they've just now started initial volumes of that. We expect, with that design, to have the volumes be higher than it was on Grace Hopper. We think that Grace Blackwell, just given the performance and power, will be a very, very good ship for us in the AI data center, partnering with NVIDIA.
When we think about other accelerators that would connect to an Arm CPU, right now, most of those accelerators are custom that are being done in-house, and it's still early days in terms of that kind of volume. But back to my earlier comment relative to the AI data centers, and I think Grace Blackwell is a very good example of that, Grace Blackwell is a custom chip that goes into a custom blade, into a custom rack, into a custom system. It is a full system design with incredible complexity and also very unique in terms of its power savings.
We expect to see a similar trend with other accelerators that use Arm because the ultimate benefit of using Arm for an AI data center is the customization, i.e., being able to build something that's very, very custom in terms of the interconnect, custom in terms of memory, custom in terms of the overall network and, at the same time, will be the most power-efficient CPU architecture out there. So early days still is the short answer in terms of being able to count what the units are in terms of CPU and AI data center, but it's going to be growing rapidly, we expect, and the most obvious indicator of that is Grace Blackwell. Your next question comes from the line of Medhi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. I want to go back to the commentary on the smartphone. To what extent are you baking in your royalty? Any kind of inventory correction in a smartphone and then this is looking forward? And then back to licensing, are you still expecting the significant pickup in the Q4 fiscal year as you were highlighting in the last earnings conference call? This is Jason. I'll take those questions. So on the smartphone side, this last quarter, I think as Rene highlighted, we basically grew the royalties by about 50% year-on-year while units only grew in the mid-single digits. Our expectations for this year are that you're going to see pretty similar unit growth, but we expect to be outpacing just like we did in Q1 for the rest of the year because of the v8 to v9 transition. In fact, in smartphones, from a v9 perspective, about 50% of royalty dollars are now v9 dollars. So actually, we're ahead on our v8 to v9 transition in mobile.
Now we've also said previously that compute subsystems will start to come online at the second half of this year, but specifically in mobile, you'll see it starting in Q4. It will be pretty small, but next year will become, I would say, more material.
So overall, we expect our mobile royalty growth to significantly outpace unit growth for this year, next year, and I would say even for the next few years, especially because we see the CSS kind of ramp to be not unlike the v8 to v9 ramp, which is it's probably somewhere around a 4-year period for the adoption to mature, and therefore, to provide incremental growth tailwinds during that full time frame.
On the licensing side, yes, we do still have the strongest licensing growth from a total revenue perspective expected to be in Q4. We have a fairly wide range, mostly because we have a large pipeline of deals. As Rene said, the pipeline has been strong. Incrementally, it's actually slightly stronger now than it was even 90 days ago, which is why even with a little bit of royalty softness, we're actually leaning ahead a little bit on license.
Now those deals, typically, with large license deals, there are renewals and there are some incremental new deals. Those new deals, in particular, typically have a 6- to 9-month kind of cycle. And so it will take us a while to get a better sense on the shape and sizing, which is why we have a relatively large range still for guidance. And in particular, it's really on the license side where that range is most applicable. So high confidence based on the pipeline and the visibility and the discussions that we've had. We will update you throughout the quarters as we get more insight and can be a little more refined. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Just a quick question on the handset side. I know you mentioned that you're seeing a ramp with handset CSS on v9. As you look at the handset ecosystem, are you seeing the China handset OEMs start to license you for the Apple sort of core or AI cores? Because I think you're seeing the ASP start to explore. So just wondering if you're seeing the handset OEM try to build their own cores. And if so, when do you start to see licensing royalties on those? Yes, We don't call out specific licensing deals in China because we do that through Arm China, who is our design partner. But what I can say is that the macro trends that we see across the world, i.e., growth in data center, growth in the automotive, demand for CSS in automotive, demand for CSS, demand for CSS and smartphone, that all applies to China as well. There's nothing unique to what the China market wants to do relative to the rest of the world. And that's really because, and I can't overemphasize this enough, China runs off the same global software ecosystem that everyone else does. It's all running either iOS, Mac OS, stock Android windows, all that runs on Arm. So Arm China is how we quote the revenue in through China. So we don't call out partners specifically, but from a macro level, behaviors are the same. Your next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Rene, Jason, just want to use this opportunity to ask you about your comments you made at Computex in terms of the 50% PC market share in 5 years. Just to provide a little bit of context of why still I want to ask you this question. My understanding, we already have Arm-based PCs already, right? The MAC is one; Chromebook, another. Some of your peers, I mean, the x86 peers seems to disagree with what you said about that 50% market share in 5 years. And they basically argue whether you have a good AI PC or not, really is not ISA dependent. And wondering what's your response here? And can you provide a little bit more thoughts on why this time is different, why Arm can really take the market share up to 50% in a short period of time. Yes, sure. No, thank you for the question. Yes, I would be a little worried if they agreed with my comment that we're going to take 50% in 5 years. So the base of the question is why is this time different. I think, first off, you commented yourself relative to the other operating systems having now Arm-based solutions. One of them, Apple's operating system and their environment has moved over 100%. And that is obviously a pretty significant indication of the value proposition that they get.
I think what's changed this time in the Windows ecosystem, there's a number of things that have changed. First is that the products that are out today are using the most advanced Arm technology. They are optimized with Microsoft for the most effective battery life on the planet. If you look at, for example, Dell's XPS product line as an example, they're touting over 19 hours of battery life for the Arm-based solution well in excess of what you see from the competition. Additionally, some of the earlier Arm-based PCs for Windows were using technology that a, was designed for phones; and b, was 3 or 4 years old and not been updated or upgraded. That's all changed as well to have these products be AIPC compliant.
And lastly, ultimately, what you need to get to that kind of market share are a broadening of the supplier base. You also need the top to bottom SKUs to be addressed from the entry all the way to the top end. We're very confident, from everything we're hearing in the ecosystem that, that is all going to be filled out over the next number of years. So when you combine a supply base that has multiple vendors, also incredible battery life and then no compromise performance, I don't see really any reason why what happened in the Mac ecosystem can't happen in the Windows ecosystem. So the Mac ecosystem is virtually 100%. And so when we think of 50%, that doesn't seem too lofty for me in 5 years. The next question comes from the line of David O'Connor from BNP Paribas. Just one on my side, maybe for Jason on the royalty seasonality. Just looking there at the second half, Jason, and particularly when you consider you're kind of a big customer coming with v9 adoption in the fiscal Q3 and then the mobile CSS client kind of kicking in, in fiscal Q4. Can you help us out how to model that kind of second half in terms of royalties to get the kind of way things there, correct? Yes. So there's two things going on. There's the v8 to v9 adoption, there's CSS, but then there's also seasonality. But then lastly, what are we comping from a year ago since we had a kind of a recovery in industry. And so certainly, the bottom was a year ago last quarter, and now we're starting to comp stronger and stronger periods.
From a royalty growth, as I said, for full year, we're expecting kind of low 20-ish percent range year-on-year, down from the 25% that we had previously expected. When you look at the kind of growth on a quarterly basis, we expect it to be, I'd say, roughly 10% per quarter from this Q1 to Q2, then again Q2 to Q3 and then Q3 to Q4. And that will get you to kind of roughly in that low 20% year-on-year growth rate. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Gardiner from Citi. I just had another one on the licensing side. I mean you mentioned that it's a lumpy business, certainly it is. But fortunately,  practically every quarter since the IPO has been lumpy in one direction to the upside. What in the current quarter has driven that upside relative to your visibility? Was it your company is taking more on content? Did you have more bookings that we're able to turn quickly, CSS? Or was there pull forward from deals that you might have expected to recognize revenue on in future periods? I'm just trying to understand sort of where the upside is coming from.
And also, Jason, in the last call, you've given us sort of the bookings outlook for the year, saying that it had been such a strong year last year, that you expected about 60% of that level in fiscal '25. I think you touched on it in your prepared comments, but I apologize I missed it. What's the expectation for that after a strong first quarter. Thanks for the question. So overall, from really from last quarter, we do see a little bit stronger licensing to account for that slight reduction that we're expecting in royalties. That reduction in royalties is about $75-ish million for the year. So that increase then that we would expect to see on licensing is the same amount. So not a significant difference from what we had last quarter. So in terms of what we saw last quarter versus this quarter, for the most part, we still have strong visibility into our renewals, specifically some ATAs, which are the biggest drivers of license bookings and revenue.
We do have some I would say, some newer deals on newer technologies. Those are the ones that are a little harder to forecast, and that's why, depending on what the final shape and size of those deals look like, will help us figure out which part of the guidance range will fall into. And so as time progresses throughout the year, we'll get we'll get more clarity on those aspects. But in terms of the fundamentals, as Rene said, from the partner side, the demand for Arm designs continues to stay just as durable and as strong, maybe even stronger than it was 90 days ago. So those are all the key drivers and pieces.
The one thing I would say about the comment you said about positive to the upside. You're right, except in this next quarter, you're going to see it go to negative. Because we are now starting to comp some of those strong over-performance quarters that we had last year. So you're going to see negative 20-ish percent year-on-year because of what we're comping a year ago. You'll see it get back to kind of more flattish in Q3, slightly positive, and then you'll see strong growth again in Q4.
Now it will all shake out to be somewhere in kind of the mid-20% year-on-year range. And that's why each quarter is going to look very, very different. But on average, it's going to be not that far from what the ACV growth of roughly 14% looks like, and that's why I kind of like the ACV growth because of the fact that it's cutting through rev rec and treating everything ratable. It's a better kind of indicator of what the longer-term growth rate looks like. And so that's how I think about it. And your final question comes from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. The question is just some help on the slope of the Armv9 ramp outside of handsets. And you talked about v9, I think penetration was 25% of the total business, obviously, a lot higher within handsets. How should we expect that those higher v9 royalties to be layering into the non-handset part of the business over time? Yes. Well, as you're forecasting the overall business, I would expect, you've seen roughly 500 basis points of total royalty mix moving to v9. It's now been, what, 3 or 4 quarters in a row that we've seen that, I would expect that to be the continued trajectory. Our forecast show that it should be pretty close to that. It might move around a little bit and when it does, we'll let you know. That's how it works overall.
In terms of by category, certainly, mobile is well ahead for a variety of reasons. As Rene said, typically, the time frame to license, to tape out is faster. There were some of the early adopters on v9. So they will be ahead of others. You should expect probably the category behind them would probably be infrastructure as the next most, I guess, for this along. Behind them, auto and then really lastly, probably IoT.
But overall, forecasted by category, which we also do, I find it isn't really that doesn't give you a much better of an answer than using that roughly 500 basis points in total because that's closest to how our models have worked, and we think they will continue to work going forward. This concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I will now hand the call back to Rene Haas for closing remarks. Thank you. And again, thank you, everyone, for the great questions. In summary, again, 4 quarters as a public company, 4 quarters of record revenue. I do, again, harken back to when we were doing our IPO roadshow and testing the waters that Arm being such a quiet company for so many years, we had a lot of education we had to do regarding Arm being a growth company. I'm so pleased that a year later that not only have we shown 4 quarters of record growth, but I'm even more excited about the future. When it comes from either CSS or the growth with AI or what seems to be an insatiable need for compute, the world's platforms are all going to be built on Arm, and I could not be more excited about the future. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
