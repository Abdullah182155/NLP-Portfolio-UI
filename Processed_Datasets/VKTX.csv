At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 26, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Viking’s Manager of Investor Relations, Stephanie Diaz. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Hello and thank you all for participating in today’s call. Joining me today is Brian Lian, Viking’s President and CEO; and Greg Zante, Viking’s CFO. Before we begin, I would like to caution that comments made during this conference call today, April 26, 2023, will contain Forward-Looking Statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Viking’s expectations regarding its development activities, time lines and milestones. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today’s date, and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement made today. I encourage you to review all of the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning these and other matters.
I will now turn the call over to Brian Lian for his initial comments. Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon to everyone dialed in by phone or listening on the webcast. Today, we will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2023 and provide an update on recent progress with our clinical programs and operations. The first quarter of 2023 was an exciting time at Viking with important progress announced across multiple clinical programs.
With respect to VK2809, our lead thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis, early in the quarter, we announced completion of enrollment in our Phase 2b VOYAGE trial and we expect to announce top line data from the primary endpoint in this study in the second quarter of 2023.
With respect to our newest clinical program, the dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, VK2735 for the potential treatment of metabolic disorders, last month, we announced data from our first clinical study of this compound, a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. As we’ll discuss in a few minutes, the results were encouraging with mean weight loss of up to 18 pounds observed following 28 days of treatment. We plan to initiate a Phase II study of VK2735 in patients with obesity in mid-2023.
In addition, we announced the initiation of a new clinical study to evaluate a novel oral formulation of this compound. With respect to our third on-going clinical program, the novel thyroid hormone beta receptor agonist, VK0214, our Phase 1b trial evaluating this compound for the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy continues to enroll and we expect to report the results from this study in the second half of the year.
Late in the quarter, we also completed the successful public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $288 million that we plan to use for the continued advancement of each of our programs through key clinical milestones. I’ll provide further details on our operations and development activities after we review our first quarter 2023 financial results.
For that, I’ll turn the call over to Greg Zante, Viking’s Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I’d like to recommend that participants refer to Viking’s Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file today. I’ll now go over our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Our research and development expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, were $11 million compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased expenses related to clinical studies, preclinical studies and third-party consultants, partially offset by increased expenses related to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation and regulatory services.
Our general and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023 were $9.5 million compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to legal and patent services, stock-based compensation, and salaries and benefits.
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, Viking reported a net loss of $19.5 million or $0.25 per share compared to a net loss of $16.1 million or $0.21 per share in the corresponding period of 2022. The increase in net loss and net loss per share for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to the increased general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period of 2022.
Turning to the balance sheet. At March 31, 2023, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $135.7 million compared to $155.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The company’s Q1 2023 cash balance does not account for the completion of a public offering of common stock, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $288 million that was completed at the end of the first quarter and closed on April 3, 2023. Pro forma, including this offering, our end of quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $406 million.
This concludes my financial review, and I’ll now turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks, Greg. As mentioned in my opening comments, the first quarter of 2023 was an exciting time at Viking. In recent weeks, we announced positive data from a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers with our newest clinical program, the dual incretin receptor agonist, VK2735. These results, which I will discuss in more detail shortly, have served to broaden our presence in metabolic diseases and diversify our pipeline, further increasing the value of the company.
We are very pleased to begin the second quarter from a position of clinical momentum, financial strength, and optimism for upcoming data. I’ll now provide an overview of progress with our clinical programs, beginning with our compound, VK2809 for NASH and fibrosis.
VK2809 is an orally available small molecule agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor that is selected for liver tissue as well as the beta isoform of the receptor. A prior 12-week Phase 2a trial evaluating VK2809 in patients with hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, successfully achieved both its primary and secondary end points demonstrating significant reductions in liver fat and plasma lipids. Cohorts treated with VK2809 experienced up to 60% mean relative reduction in liver fat content and 88% of patients receiving VK2809 experienced at least a 30% relative reduction in liver fat content.
Importantly, the reductions in liver fat were durable with the majority of patients remaining responders 4 weeks after completion of dosing. This study also demonstrated the promising safety and tolerability of VK2809. No serious adverse events were reported and the rate of GI disturbances such as nausea and diarrhoea was lower among VK2809-treated patients when compared to patients treated with placebo.
We believe VK2809’s activation of the thyroid hormone beta receptor provides unique therapeutic benefits for patients with NASH. Perhaps one of the most important additional benefits of this compound is its ability to reduce plasma lipids, including LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and atherogenic proteins, all of which have been correlated with increased cardiovascular risk. It is important to note that a number of studies evaluating other NASH development programs have demonstrated elevations and meet with it’s following treatment.
In contrast, patients in Viking’s 12-week Phase 2a study experienced robust reductions in these lipids suggesting that VK2809 may offer a cardioprotective benefit. We believe VK2809’s broad lipid-lowering properties combined with its safety, excellent tolerability and significant liver fat reduction and oral route of administration, established it as a best-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of NASH.
Based on the promising results from our Phase 2a trial, the company initiated the VOYAGE Phase 2b study. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis. The target population includes patients with at least 8% liver fat content as measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction as well as F2 and F3 fibrosis.
Up to 25% of patients may have F1 fibrosis provided that they also possess at least 1 additional risk factor. The primary endpoint of the VOYAGE study will evaluate changes in liver fat from baseline to week 12 in patients treated with VK2809 as compared to patients receiving placebo. Secondary and exploratory objectives include the evaluation of histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of treatment.
During the first quarter, we announced completion of enrollment in the VOYAGE study and we look forward to sharing top line results, including the trial’s primary endpoint during the second quarter of this year.
I’ll now turn to our newest clinical program, highlighted by a compound called VK2735, which we believe has the potential for the treatment of various metabolic disorders, such as obesity, NASH and certain rare diseases. VK2735 is a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, or GIP receptor. Initial in vivo data from our dual agonist program demonstrated improvements in weight loss, glucose control and insulin sensitivity among diet-induced obese mice following treatment with Viking’s compounds as compared to a GLP-1 mono agonist when administered at the same dose for the same period of time.
In addition, the observed reductions in liver fat content were generally larger among animals treated with our compounds relative to those observed among animals treated with a GLP-1 monoagonist.
Based on these in vivo and other preclinical data, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of VK2735. The single ascending dose portion of the study enrolled healthy men and women and evaluated escalating single doses of VK2735.
The multiple ascending dose portion enrolled healthy men and women with a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared. In the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, subjects received VK2735 once weekly for 28 days. During the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the results from this study with VK2735 demonstrating promising safety, tolerability, a predictable PK profile and positive signs of clinical benefit.
Key takeaways from the single ascending dose portion of the study were that single doses of VK2735 were safe and well tolerated and that the compound’s PK profile demonstrated favorable characteristics in humans. Following single subcutaneous doses, VK2735 demonstrated the half-life of approximately 170 to 250 hours, a T-MAX ranging from 75 to 90 hours and excellent therapeutic exposures.
In the 28-day multiple ascending dose portion of the study, VK2735 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity. All cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated reductions in mean body weight from baseline ranging up to 7.8%. Cohorts receiving VK2735 also demonstrated reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 6%.
Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were maintained or improved at the day 43 follow-up time point, 21 days after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. Importantly, VK2735 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability following repeated dosing. 98% of observed adverse events were reported as mild or moderate and 99% of gastrointestinal-related adverse events were also reported as mild or moderate.
In addition, all cohorts treated with VK2735 demonstrated improvements in plasma glucose levels relative to placebo, though not all cohorts achieved statistical significance. We believe the tolerability data from this study indicates that higher doses may be achieved with longer titration windows, and we plan to evaluate further dose escalation in subsequent studies.
Turning to our future plans for VK2735. Based on the positive results generated in the Phase 1 study, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients with obesity in mid-2023. Concurrent with the announcement of the Phase 1 data just described, we also announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate an oral tablet formulation of VK2735. We believe the tablet formulation represents a significant potential expansion of the program’s overall value and utility.
In vivo data to date suggests that therapeutic plasma levels of VK2735 may be achieved via oral dosing, and we expect both the subcutaneous formulation and the oral formulation to provide unique benefits to patients. The ability to select either subcutaneous or oral dosage forms of VK2735 creates attractive potential treatment options and further extends the reach of this important program. The oral study is an extension of the Phase 1 study discussed a moment ago.
This portion of the study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, who have a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared. Subjects will receive daily oral doses for 28 days. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK2735 following 28 days of oral dosing. Exploratory endpoints include changes in body weight and plasma glucose. We believe the results from this study could potentially be available in the second half of 2023.
I will now provide an update on our third clinical candidate, VK0214. This is Viking’s second orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, and it is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy or X-ALD.
X-ALD is a rare and often fatal metabolic disorder. Patients with X-ALD have genetic mutations that impact the function of a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids. When transporter function is impaired, patients are unable to efficiently metabolize very long chain fatty acids and the resulting accumulation of these compounds is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of X-ALD.
In a prior Phase 1 study in more than 100 healthy volunteers, VK0214 demonstrated dose-dependent exposures, no evidence of accumulation and a half-life consistent with anticipated once-daily dosing. Subjects who received VK0214 experienced reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein a.
VK0214 also demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported and no treatment or dose-related signals observed for GI side effects, vital signs or cardiovascular measures.
Following these favorable results, Viking initiated the Phase 1b study of VK0214 in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN form of X-ALD. AMN is the most common form of X-ALD affecting approximately 50% of patients. The Phase 1b trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult male patients with AMN. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 administered once daily orally for 28 days.
The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids. This study continues to enroll, and we expect to report the initial results later this year.
Moving to other corporate updates. Late in the first quarter, we completed a successful public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $288 million. We were happy to see the receptivity and enthusiasm from investors and are grateful for their support as we continue advancing our pipeline programs.
As Greg mentioned earlier, pro forma for the offering, our end of quarter cash balance was approximately $400 million. This enables the company to further invest in pipeline programs, both existing and new and places Viking in a position of strength in discussions with potential corporate partners.
In conclusion, the first quarter of 2023 proved to be an exceptional quarter for Viking. We announced completion of enrollment in the VOYAGE study of VK2809 in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and we expect to report data for the primary endpoint of the study later this quarter. We also announced the first human data from our dual GLP-1, GIP receptor agonist, VK2735, demonstrated promising safety and tolerability and exciting reductions in body weight. We look forward to initiating a U.S. Phase 2 study in obesity in mid-2023.
We also further expanded the reach of this program by announcing the initiation of a study using an oral tablet formulation from which we expect to report results toward the end of the year. With our VK0214 program, we continued enrolling our Phase 1b study in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy and we anticipate reporting data from this study later in the year.
Finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter through a successful offering of common stock, which resulted in proceeds of over $280 million. Our current runway extends well beyond each of the clinical catalysts outlined here. We feel fortunate and grateful to be in the position we’re in and look forward to providing additional updates as they’re available.
This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks again for joining us, and we’ll now open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Steven Seedhouse with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I had a few on the oral formulation of the GLP-1, GIP. First, just you haven’t shared any preclinical data. So I wanted to ask, in general, if the expectation would be you could get to sort of exposure and ultimately efficacy levels that would be equivalent to the injectable or what specifically would be the expectations in terms of potency of what you could achieve at peak in humans? And then also with that compound, is this something that would lend itself to like a titration schema as well? Or are you essentially looking at flat doses in the Phase I? Hey Steve, thanks for the questions. With the exposures, yes I don’t think we expect the exposures to achieve the same level that are observed with the subcu formulation. Maybe I’ll be proven wrong, but I don’t think we’ll get there. It’s almost a different product. I would consider the oral formulation, maybe for someone who first doesn’t want to start with an injectable or for someone who maybe has a BMI 32 to 34 or something that might be adequately addressed with an oral formulation or potentially in a maintenance setting where you start with the subcu and then transition on oral. So there’s a lot of different ways that it could be used. But my own guess is that we probably won’t see the same exposures with the oral. What’s the second question?
Titration, yes. So yes, we will titrate in the upcoming study. So the first cohorts, flat dosing and subsequent cohorts will titrate up. Okay. So it’s just 1 dose of -- 1 tablet dose that you just give multiple pills, I guess, in that case? That’s right. Yes. The first cohort is 2.5 mg and that’s flat. And then from there, they dose up. I mean first week will be 2.5 and then the remaining 3 weeks would be a higher dose. And then as you go on through the cohorts, you kind of titrate up per week. Okay. A couple more just because it’s a really interesting program. Obviously, you mentioned maintenance dosing is one option. That’s just given how many people in the next decade are likely to be gravitating towards using incretin. I imagine there’d be some enormous group of patients coming on or having been on injectables. I’m curious if you’re going to gather that type of maintenance data in the Phase 1, can you take patients that you already treated with the injectable and start them on oral and see how they do? And then I just have one more on the program after if I could. Thanks. Yes. No, thanks. In this study, we’re really just trying to see if the formulation will provide exposures and what levels compared to subcu. So I think in the future, those transition type studies would be really important and really interesting, but this is just the first one, and we’re just going to see how the exposures turn out. Okay. And then the Phase 1, I think you guys were re-injectable at least you were collecting MRI-PDFF data, and there are maybe some other biomarkers in there that weren’t ready for the initial top line. So can you just comment on -- you have the guidance in place with the oral data. Should there -- is there any other data either from the clinical injectable study beyond the top line that you’ve already announced that would be coming here in near term that we should keep an eye out for? Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Steve. We’ll probably be reporting more data a little bit later in the year, potentially at Obesity Week, but we don’t have any near-term, nothing imminent there. But you’re right, we did have a number of biomarkers in liver fat in the study. Alright, thanks Brian. Thanks Steve. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joon Lee with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hey thanks for taking our question and congrats on the progress. What really stood out from the healthy volunteer study of VK2735 was how key the tolerability profile was. So is that -- is that just a function of the study being a small Phase 1 study? Or is there some mechanistic hypotheses as to why 2735 may be better tolerated and with possibly better weight loss? And I have a follow-up. Thanks Joon, thanks Yes. So I don’t really know. It was a small study, so you could argue that maybe we’re just looking at small numbers. What was interesting with the tolerability was that there wasn’t really a dose-related change in tolerability as you went up. I think the highest dose cohort actually had really, really good tolerability, better than some of the earlier cohorts.
So mechanistically, I know people have talked about arrest in recruitment being one thing that might lead to improved tolerability if you can have a sustained effect on GLP-1 without arrest in recruitment. You could see maybe an increase in efficacy without necessarily issues with nausea. But I don’t know -- otherwise, I don’t know that mechanistically it was anything obvious that would explain it. Fair enough. And both Lee and Novo have historically done heat to head trials of their GLPs, at least for diabetes. Do you have any plans to do a head to trial of VK2735 against other obesity drugs? Yes, great question. I think it’s a really good idea as we move further through the program, but this upcoming Phase 2 will not have an active comparator in it. It’s just placebo. But I do think that’s something important for the future just to see how they compare. Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks Joon. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask about the titration period that you’re considering for Phase 2. I mean, already, it looked like you had some good tolerability. It looks like you have some very good weight loss already within 28 weeks. So I guess I’m wondering why you would want to push that further and what kind of titration schedule might we be looking at?
So I guess that’s the first question. And is this the same exact molecule as 2735, are you changing the balance between GLP-1 or GIP in any way as you go into the oral if you don’t have the same, I guess, target exposure? And then I have one more follow-up. Yes. It’s the same molecule, Annabel, in the oral and the subcu. And we’re titrating in the 28-day study really because we’ve not dosed with this compound before, so we don’t know if there are any differences in tolerability, and we’re doing fewer cohorts. So in the subcu, we did have the first 2 cohorts were flat dosing, and then we titrated and here the first cohort is going to be flat and then we titrate. But nothing obvious that suggests we have to titrate.
And to your point, I think the tolerability was really, really promising in the subcu, but it’s just first study. And we know that GLP-1 agonism is tied to nausea and GI side effects. So we just want to try to control for that as best as possible. I guess, to be more specific, why do you feel like you need to go higher on the dosing if you’ve sort of attained some pretty competitive results as it is with good tolerability? In the oral are you talking about? No, in the injectable for Phase 2. In the injectable, yes, we’re going to go up to 15 milligrams because the 10-milligram was very well tolerated and maybe the 15 will work better. We won’t know until we get there. But that was the reason we were considering adding that 15-milligram cohort to the 28-day study, but we decided to just stop the study here and put that into the Phase 2, and we’ll titrate up to it. But I don’t think there’s anything -- I don’t think we’re necessarily pushing anything with increasing the dose to 15. Okay. And then if I can ask on VK2809. I mean, you have some pretty good validation from a competing program. But I guess, some of the KOLs we spoke to, one of the things that they brought up that they were a little bit surprised that there was not just NASH reduction, but they also were able to show fibrotic improvement as early as year one. So how do you really think about this? And would you expect the same for yourself if your seemingly superior liver fat reduction holds up in voyage? Were you surprised with the fibrotic effect within 52 weeks, given that it’s more of a downstream process from the fat reduction? Well, I don’t know. I think the -- yes and no, I guess. I mean the fibrosis improvement endpoint is traditionally a more difficult end point to show improvement on, but we know that the mechanism demonstrates in animal models, reduction in collagen load and improvement in fibrosis. And whether or not that’s secondary to fat reduction, I don’t think we know and haven’t seen that published anywhere.
So we weren’t totally surprised. I guess you could argue that it’s too short a window and this is more a metabolic targeting mechanism. But everything we’ve seen in animals suggests that it should actually do both. It should help with NASH resolution and improve fibrosis. Okay. Great. If I can squeeze in one more. Any thoughts about how long this $406 million will take you out to? Yes. Hi Annabel, certainly, we’re covered, as Brian mentioned earlier, well beyond all the catalysts in our 3 development programs. We wouldn’t point to an exact year, but certainly well beyond 2 years out and well beyond. Okay. Great, thank you. Thanks Annabel. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jay Olson at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Congrats on all the progress, and thank you for the update. Maybe just a follow-up on VK2809. Can you just talk about what we should expect to see in the top line results besides MRI, PDFF? Will we see change in LDL cholesterol levels? And then I guess, can you just talk about sort of the GI tolerability of VK2809? It seems like that’s potentially an important feature for your molecule. And then I had a follow-up, if I could, please. Sure. Thanks, Jay. The -- with the initial data, we would plan to have the liver fat by MRI PDFF and then a Lipid panel, so likely LDL, trigs and if we get the atherogenic proteins, Lp(a) and ApoB, we’ll report those as well as well as safety and tolerability. The GI profile to date has been excellent. We haven’t really seen anything different from placebo. And there’s no reason to think that we would see differences in the VOYAGE population, but we don’t have the data, so I can’t for sure yet. But there’s nothing that would lead us to believe that there would be any sort of a GI signal with the compound. It’s exceptionally well tolerated. Okay. Great. That’s super helpful. And then if you could maybe help us frame for investors what a best case scenario might look like with regards to MRI-PDFF and any other endpoints that we should be watching, including safety and tolerability? And then what you would see as the most important differentiating points from resmetirom? That would be great. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Jay. Well, I think the internal hurdle that we’re using is a 30% mean reduction in liver fat. If we can see treatment groups showing a 30% mean reduction that would be our success hurdle. Obviously, higher is better. We saw really nice reductions in the Phase 2a study. I’m not sure I would expect that level of efficacy in this study just because it’s a larger study and you often see a penalty into larger populations. But if we see 30%, I think there’s a lot of precedent that suggests that translates to a higher probability of histologic benefit.
I think there’s plenty of room for multiple of the same mechanism to coexist in NASH. I think there will be differentiation among products and they’re probably switching. I think our tolerability profile is outstanding, and our efficacy has been exceptionally strong so far. So I think we’re comfortable with where we would be competitively. Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions and we’ll look forward to seeing the results. Thanks very much Jay. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on all the achievements this quarter. So Brian, you mentioned a couple of times about the activities in liver fat at least in the preclinical model from these dual agonist candidates, including 2735. So I’m curious if that was by design or it’s an observation that you just observe as you advance these candidates from preclinical to clinical settings? Yes. It’s -- thanks, Andy. It’s -- I think the liver fat change from this mechanism, because there are no receptors in the liver, is probably most tied to weight loss and insulin sensitivity -- improving insulin sensitivity. So I don’t think there’s necessarily a direct effect on liver fat. It’s more tied to weight loss. But in animals, we did see really interesting data, typically generally always better than a GLP-1 monoagonist and comparable to better than another dual agonist.
So we’re really excited about the potential there. I think that the models we looked at were generally the diet-induced obese mouse. So if you’re skinnier or your body weight is lower, liver fat’s lower, you probably wouldn’t see as large an effect since the effect is driven by weight loss, but pretty interesting characteristic. Got it. We’ve gotten some questions from investors about relative contribution of weight loss from either fat or lean body mass. Do you have a good handle from the Phase 1 study about the proportion that’s the observed weight loss is coming from? We don’t. We didn’t do any DEXA scans in this study. So we don’t have the relative change in weight. We do from the animals, we saw predominantly a reduction in fat and not muscle, but I think it’s been shown in other studies that when you lose a certain amount of weight, you do start to cut into muscle. But we didn’t see that in any of the animal studies that we conducted. And we unfortunately just didn’t look at it in this study. Great. Is that something that you look at in the Phase 2 study? Not currently, no. It’s a 13-week study. So we don’t have a plan to do DEXA scans in the upcoming study. It might be something we’d look at in a longer-term study. Got it. Got it. That’s helpful. And then maybe lastly, for the oral formulation versus subcu, could you kind of help us think about the amount in terms of dosing from these 2 formulations on a relative sense? Yes. The oral will push up a little bit higher. We’re going -- I think the plan is to go to 20 milligrams with the oral. So not a huge amount higher than the planned dose to phase -- for the Phase 2 and the subcu. Got it. Okay, awesome. Well thanks for answering all our questions. Thanks a lot Andy. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Yale Jen of Laidlaw & Co. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question and congrats on the profit so far. Just a few quick questions. The first one probably is housing. In terms of SG&A in the first quarter, that seems significantly higher than prior quarters. Should we anticipate that to be a normal or this is generally a onetime situation? Yes. Thanks,. That’s primarily due to -- it is not something you should expect to see moving forward. That’s really due to timing of some legal expenses and those should be reduced moving forward, and you wouldn’t expect that to be the run rate moving forward. Okay. Great. And a follow-up question here again about the 2735 Phase 2 study. Could you give us a sort of overall view about what you anticipate to do for that study? Anything you can review in terms of the study design? Yes. The study design is a 13-week study with flat dosing in the lowest dose cohort and then titrated dosing in the higher dose cohorts. The top dose right now is targeting 15 milligrams, and we’ll do a stepwise titration up there. It’s 13 weeks in duration. So you’d be at the top dose for, I think, 3 to 4 weeks at the end there. The primary endpoint will be change in body weight. And how big the study might be in terms of size? Yes, we haven’t disclosed that, but I would say 150 or so or 100 to 150 would be the target there. Great. That’s very helpful. Maybe the last question here is that you mentioned that about -- with the cash in hand, you might also contemplate some additional pipeline expansions. I know you want to be focused, but nevertheless, was there anything in your mind that could be explored going forward? Yes, we have a lot of things we’re working on, but we haven’t disclosed, but we typically spend time in an area as little money as possible on some of these nascent programs and the ones that show promise, we bring forward. I think 2735 is a good example of that. And as things mature appropriately, we’ll have more to say about them. Okay, great. Thanks a lot and again congrats. Thanks a lot, Yale. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Justin Zelin with BTIG. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on all the progress. Maybe just a follow-up on the Phase 2 for the dual agonist here. You mentioned 13 weeks of active dosing. Will you continue to follow up the patients past the 13 weeks and for further longer-term data? Would we have to look towards another study here? And I have some follow-ups. Yes. To answer the second question, yes, I think longer data would come from a subsequent study of 26 weeks or longer, not that that’s the next study, but we plan to get through this study first. The follow-up period in this study, I believe, is 4 weeks. So you come back, I think -- well, multiple times you come back after the 13-week treatment period, but I think the last follow-up is at week 17 and Marianne is nodding in agreement here. Marianne, our COO. So anyway, that’s the duration. Great. And from the Phase 1 data, did you notice anything in the PK/PD profile that suggests that might be different from what we’ve seen with the tirzepatide compound. I’m just curious if there was anything that appeared in that data set yet? Or is it too early to tell? Yes. It’s really hard to make those comparisons because the -- obviously, they weren’t head-to-head in the population that we’ve seen published for the tirzepatide compound is just a different population than we looked at. We do see, I think, a later T-max, longer half life, and I think our exposures are improved. But again, very difficult to make those sorts of comparisons in the absence of a head-to-head data set. Great. And I’ll ask one last question. Further down the road, do you see any potential to run a combination with the 2809 and the dual agonist potentially in a NASH study? Yes, it’s not something we’ve talked much about. But if we were to do something like that, I think we talk about it if and when we have data on it. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks Justin. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Naz Rahman with Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just really quickly on the oral. What gives you confidence on the timing of the initial data for second half of 2023? Like are you guys seeing any potential competition or any issues recruiting patients with all the, I guess, various GLP-1 studies on-going? Yes. We think we can get the data in the second half. We feel confident about that. Luckily, obesity is the largest market ever. So we shouldn’t have problems with recruiting, but I don’t know, we haven’t had many competitive issues at this point. Right. How many sites are there? And for this study are all the sites also in Australia? Yes. It’s actually an extension of the earlier study, the single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study, it’s the same site. It’s a single site in Australia. The Phase 2 study will be here in the United States. Got it. Are you seeing, like, I guess, like faster rates enrollment or I guess, like higher rates of interest versus when you initially started your injectable studies? I think it’s maybe too early to say there. I don’t know the answer to that question. Alright, got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks Naz. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Stephanie Diaz for any closing remarks. Thank you again for your participation and continued support of Viking Therapeutics. We look forward to updating you again in the coming months. Have a good afternoon. Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. We thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.","the Viking Therapeutics first quarter 2023 financial results conference call is being recorded today, April 26, 2023 . the conference call will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . this statement is subject to risks that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely .",0.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 26, 2023.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Viking’s Manager of Investor Relations, Stephanie Diaz. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Hello and thank you all for participating in today’s call. Joining me today is Brian Lian, Viking’s President and CEO; and Greg Zante, Viking’s CFO. Before we begin, I would like to caution that comments made during this conference call today, July 26, 2023, will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Viking’s expectations regarding its development activities, timelines and milestones. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today’s date, and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement made today. I encourage you to review all of the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning these and other matters.
I will now turn the call over to Brian Lian for his initial comments. Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon to everyone dialled in by phone or listening on the webcast. Today, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, and provide an update on recent progress with our clinical programs and operations.
The first half of 2023 has been exceptional for Viking, with the company announcing positive clinical data from two programs and completing a successful financing to support the continued development of our pipeline. During the second quarter, we announced positive results from the Phase 2b VOYAGE Study of VK2809, in patients with biopsy confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. The study successfully achieved its primary endpoint, confirming VK2809's best-in-class therapeutic profile for the treatment of NASH.
In the first half of the year, we also announced data from our first clinical study of VK2735, a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists, for the potential treatment of obesity. This Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity following 28 days of treatment. I will review these clinical results later in today's call. Along with the Phase 1 results for VK2735, we also announced the initiation of a new clinical study to evaluate a novel oral formulation of this compound.
Finally, during the second quarter of the year, we announced the closing of a successful public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $288 million that we plan to use for the continued advancement of each of our programs through key clinical milestones. I'll provide further details on our operations and development activities after we review our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of 2023.
For that, I'll turn the call over to Zante, Viking Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I'd like to recommend that participants refer to Vikings Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file today. I'll now go over our results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, beginning with the results for the quarter.
Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were $13.9 million compared to $13.5 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to pre-clinical studies, manufacturing for our drug candidates, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits of third-party consultants, partially offset by decreased expenses related to clinical studies.
Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were $9.8 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to legal and patent services, stock-based compensation and salaries and benefits.
For the three months ended June 30, 2023, Viking reported a net loss of $19.2 million or $0.19 per share compared to a net loss of $17.4 million or $0.23 per share in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses, noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2022.
I'll now go over the results for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $24.9 million compared to $26.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased expenses related to clinical studies, partially offset by increased expenses related to manufacturing for our drug candidates, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits and regulatory services.
Our general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $19.4 million compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to legal and patent services, stock-based compensation and salaries and benefits. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Viking reported a net loss of $38.8 million or $0.44 per share compared to a net loss of $33.5 million or $0.43 per share in the corresponding period of 2022.
The increase in net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2022. Turning to the balance sheet, at June 30, 2023, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $392.9 million compared to $155.5 million as of December 31, 2022.
This concludes my financial review and I'll now turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks, Greg. I'll begin my comments with an update on our lead program, VK2809. VK2809 is an orally available, small molecule likeness to the thyroid hormone receptor that is selected for liver tissue as well as the beta isoform of the receptor. During the second quarter, the company announced positive topline results from the Phase 2b VOYAGE study evaluating VK2809 in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and fibrosis. We were very pleased to report that this study achieved its primary endpoint with patients receiving VK2809 experiencing statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 as compared with placebo.
The median relative change from baseline in liver fat as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction ranged from 38% to 55% among patients receiving VK2809. Importantly, up to 85% of patients receiving VK2809 experienced at least a 30% relative reduction in liver fat content. This level of efficacy is associated with the greater likelihood of histologic benefit in NASH.
Additionally, VK2809 treated patients demonstrated statistically significant reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and atherogenic lipoproteins, all of which have been correlated with cardiovascular risk. It is important to highlight that a number of studies evaluating other NASH development programs have demonstrated elevations in these lipids following treatment. In contrast, the Phase 2b VOYAGE data indicate that VK-2809 may be unique in its potential to offer a cardiovascular protective benefit.
Also important VK-2809 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability in this study. 94% of treatment-related adverse events among patients receiving VK-2809 were reported as mild or moderate. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low and balanced among placebo and treatment arms. As in prior studies, VK-2809 demonstrated excellent gastrointestinal tolerability in this study. Rates of nausea, diarrhea, stool frequency and vomiting were similar among VK-2809 treated patients compared to placebo.
These findings are consistent with a prior 12-week Phase 2a trial evaluating VK-2809 in patients with hypercholesterolemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The Phase 2a study also successfully achieved both its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant reductions in liver fat and plasma lipids.
Importantly, the reductions in liver fat were durable, with the majority of patients remaining responders four weeks after completion of dosing. The 12-week study also demonstrated the promising safety and tolerability of VK-2809 with no serious adverse events reported.
In our view, the top-line results of the VOYAGE trial combined with the eight previously completed studies of this compound, support our belief that VK2809's broad lipid lowering properties, along with the safety, excellent tolerability, significant liver fat reduction, and oral route of administration, establish it as a best-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of NASH. We look forward to reporting data from the secondary and exploratory objectives from the VOYAGE study, including the evaluation of histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of treatment in the first half of 2024.
Transitioning to our newest program, I'll now highlight recent progress with a [indiscernible] candidate VK2735. VK2735 is a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1 receptor, and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide polypeptide, or GIP receptor that is being evaluated for the treatment of obesity. Initial in vivo data from this program demonstrated improvements in weight loss, glucose control and insulin sensitivity, among diet-induced obese mice following treatment, as compared to a GLP-1 monolagonist when administered at the same dose for the same period of time. In addition, the observed reductions in liver fat content were generally larger, among animals treated with our compounds, relative to those observed among animals treated with the GLP-1 monolagonist.
Based on these and other preclinical findings, Viking conducted a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study of VK2735 to evaluate its preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile, as well as its potential impact on exploratory measures.
Earlier this year, we announced positive results from this trial with VK2735 demonstrated promising safety and tolerability, a predictable TK profile and encouraging signs of clinical benefit. The single ascending dose portion of this study enrolled healthy men and women and evaluated escalating doses of VK2735. The results of this portion of the study demonstrated that single doses of VK2735 were safe and well tolerated, and that the compounds VK profile demonstrated favorable characteristics in humans.
Following single subcutaneous doses, VK2735 demonstrated a half-life of approximately 170 hours to 250 hours, a TMAX ranging from approximately 75 hours to 90 hours, and excellent therapeutic exposures. The multiple ascending dose portion of this study enrolled healthy men and women with the minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter square. These subjects received VK2735 once weekly for 28 days.
In this portion of the study, VK2735 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity. All cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 7.8%. Cohorts receiving VK2735 also demonstrated reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 6%. Statistically significant differences in body weight compared to placebo were also maintained or improved at the day 43 follow-up time point, 21 days after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. In addition, all cohorts created with VK2735 demonstrated improvements in plasma glucose levels relative to placebo, though not all cohorts achieved statistical significance.
VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability following single and repeat dosing. The vast majority, 98% of observed adverse events were reported as mild or moderate, and 99% of gastrointestinal related adverse events were also reported as mild or moderate.
Given VK2735's promising tolerability, we believe that higher doses may be achieved with longer titration windows, and we plan to evaluate further dose escalation in future studies. Based on these Phase 1 results, the company plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial of VK2735 in patients with obesity later this quarter. In addition to the formulation of VK2735 that is administered subcutaneously, we are also pursuing an oral formulation of this compound.
Earlier this year, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate a novel tablet formulation of VK2735. This study is an extension of the Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study concluded earlier in the year. The oral portion of the study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers who have a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter square. Subjects will receive daily oral doses for 28 days. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK2735 following 28 days of oral dosing. Exploratory endpoints include changes in body weight and plasma glucose.
We believe the potential availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations of phase could provide patients with flexible dosing options and expand the compound's potential market opportunity. We expect to report the initial results from this study in the fourth quarter of this year.
I'll now provide an update on our third clinical candidate, VK0214. Like VK2809, VK0214 is an orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist. VK0214 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with Adrenoleukodystrophy or X-ALD. X-ALD is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder. Patients with X-ALD have genetic mutations that disabled the function of a peroxisomal transport of very long chain fatty acids. As a result, patients are unable to efficiently metabolize very long chain fatty acids. And the accumulation of these compounds is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of X-ALD.
Viking is currently enrolling a Phase 1b study evaluating VK0214 in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN form of X-ALD. AMN is the most common form of X-ALD affecting approximately 50% of patients. The decision to advance this program was based on positive results from a prior Phase 1 study in more than 100 healthy volunteers. In that study, VK0214 demonstrated dose-dependent exposures, no evidence of accumulation, and a half-life consistent with anticipated once daily doses.
Subject to receive VK0214 experienced reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A. VK0214 also demonstrated and encouraging safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported, and no treatment or dose-related signals observed for GI side effects, vital signs, or cardiovascular measures. The ongoing Phase 1 trial is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in adult male patients with AMN.
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 administered once daily for 28 days. The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels at very long chain fatty acids. This study continues to enrol and we expect to complete enrollment later this year.
Beyond the clinical achievements announced in the first half of the year, Viking also completed a successful public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $288 million. These funds position us well as we continue to invest in both the expansion and advancement of our pipeline.
In conclusion, the first half of 2023 has been an exciting period for Viking. With respect to our lead program VK2809, top-line data from our Phase 2b VOYAGE study affirmed our belief that VK-2809 is a safe and effective therapeutic with best-in-class features, demonstrating significant reductions in liver fat, while providing cardioprotective benefits through robust lipid reductions. Today, VK2809 continues to deliver the largest reductions in liver fat reported for any oral agent at this stage of development.
With respect to VK2735, our GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, the company's recently completed Phase 1 study demonstrated promising safety and tolerability and significant reductions in body weight following 28 days of dosing. Given these positive results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study of VK2735 in obesity later this quarter.
In addition, we are pursuing a novel tablet formulation of this molecule that we believe will offer patients important dosing options and significantly expand the compound's potential market opportunity. Finally, the Phase 1B study evaluates VK0214 in patients with adrenal mild or apathy continues to enrol, and we anticipate completing enrolment later this year.
As we look ahead to each of our currently anticipated clinical milestones, as well as others in the future, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet with approximately $400 million cash to support the aggressive development of our pipeline.
This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks again for joining us, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator? We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question here will come from Steve Seedhouse with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking a question. Wanted to ask first about the oral GLP-GIP tablet formulation, so you're going to have the Phase 2 obesity study underway in third quarter, and you'll get the oral data later this year. I am just curious, what then becomes sort of the next steps strategically for that molecule, if you can add it to that Phase 2 parallel Phase 2 and also specifically, are there any preclinical data necessary for the tablet formulation that you'd need to clear, like with FDA for a separate IND for instance, thanks? Hey Steve, thanks for the questions. So the path forward would parallel the plan for the SubQ formulation. So if the oral formulation looks promising, then we would seek to move that into a Phase 2 study that would likely be similar in design to the SubQ Phase 2 study. With respect to the FDA requirements, it will likely be under a separate IND, and probably have some more CMC-related information included in it, but we don't think anything will be, I think, gaining to moving forward. Okay, thanks, Brian, and also, there was a lot of data of course at ADA and emerging now for the oral formulations of some of the GLP-1 monoagonist and you guys have presented animal data comparing the subcutaneous version of this to semi-glutite or tirzepatide pre-clinically. Is it possible or easy to do those comparisons with sort of oral control molecules pre-clinically as well. Do you have a sense of how your tablet formulation stacks up pre-clinically against what's out there and through Phase 2 now? Yeah, it's a good question. So we don't expect the oral efficacy to be on the same level as the SubQ efficacy. And that's just -- we just don't know that it will be able to achieve the same level of exposure as the SubQ, I doubt it, but that doesn't mean there's not a terrific opportunity for it.
When we looked at the oral formulation in some of the earlier animal models, it was effective at weight loss and it does show, the efficacy probably I don't know, 50%, 60% as good as the SubQ. We didn't, pursue any specific dose ranging comparisons, but in the 14-day and 21-day models, they were -- it was very effective, but probably about probably 60%. I'm not remembering that percentage perfectly. So don't call me on that, but it is probably 60% or so as effective as the SubQ. And are you able to get your hands on or synthesize the control molecules for some of these other clinical stage emerging oral GLP-1 candidate, do you have a sense of how it stacks up laterally as opposed to just versus your own subcutaneous formulation, pre-clinically, of course. Oh! We've done a little bit of that, I don't want to get into the compounds we have tested against, but we have done a little bit of that, and I think from what we've seen, it looks very encouraging, but, these are animal models with a lot of pretty, pretty large air bars, but I think we're comfortable with what we've seen animals as far as exposures and weight loss thus far. Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Our next question will come from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Oh, hey, congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking the questions. For the oral 2735 data expected later this year, can you just talk about what kind of data we should be looking for and how you plan to disclose that? Thanks, Jay. Did you say the clinical data or pre-clinically? Sorry. Clinical. Oh, clinical. It would probably be roughly similar to what we announced with the SubQ. So we'd look at PK and safety and tolerability and preliminary effects on body weight changes. We aren't doing the MRI PDFF with the oral, but everything else I think is very parallel to the SubQ. Okay. And is that going to be a QD dosing and are there any dietary restrictions around dosing? It is QD dosing. We haven't disclosed dosing details on whether or not there are restrictions, but we don't think anything would be particularly problematic. Okay, great. And then given the ongoing supply shortage for some of the competing weight loss compounds, can you just talk about the cadence of enrolment for your 2735 studies? Yeah, it's a little lumpy with 2735. This is a single site in Australia, and it comes in fits and starts, but we think we can have data from the study by the end of the year, but you have little bursts of enrolment than a little dry spell and then a burst of enrolment. So it's similar to the SubQ enrolment pattern. Okay, great and may be one last question. Beyond GLP-1 and GIP, are there any other mechanisms for obesity that you're interested in? Yeah, we have a fairly robust effort in metabolic disorders and obesity in particular. I think not everything is ready for prime time right now, but we hope to talk more about those in the coming quarters, but I think we've got some exciting projects in house here. Great. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate you taking all the questions. Our next question will come from Joon Lee with Truist. Please go ahead. Okay, congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking our questions. Just to follow up on from Steve's prior question, do you think you saw around 50% to 60% of the weight loss effect for your oral formulation, versus the peak formulation, and so in other words, the 3% weight loss of placebo-adjusted in a Phase 1 study, is that the bar or are there other considerations like different dosing regimen that makes that extrapolation difficult and I have a follow-up? Yeah, thanks, Joon. Yeah, I think that extrapolation is very difficult because the animal studies are sort of sledgehammer studies you're dosing at levels that aren't really relevant to people, just to understand whether or not an effect exists. So, I wouldn't use that as a benchmark for expectations in people. We just don't know yet what the effect in people would be. Got it. And can we remind that how many arms you're testing in the oral formulation? Yeah, the oral formulation would be five arms. It will be placebo, and then four escalating dose arms. We do have flexibility to add arms in that study if we'd like, just like in the SubQ study at cohort Looking forward to data and in terms of VK2809 for NASH, assuming good -- it results in first half of the next year, what are you looking for in a potential partner who can take it forward? And how quickly do you think you could find such a partner? Yeah, well, I think its great question. I think it depends on what the data look like. We're excited to see how the biopsies turn out. And that I think will drive the interest and the speed in which we would move forward, we would hope to upon completion of the study, schedule and in a Phase 2 meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss the design and outline of the Phase 3 program. And our next question will come from Annabel Samimy with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. This is Stacy calling for Annabel. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking our question. I guess two on our end. How are you thinking about the landscape following ADA and the strengths of some of the new programs and the orals emerging? Do you feel that in your clinical trials you might find populations that might be more suited to have dual agonist than single or triple. And how do you start identifying those patients?
And I guess you're seeing potential encroachment from triple G for NASH or at least that's how it's been interpreted. Can you talk about the feedback from your side on how tirzepatide might affect your opportunity? Yeah, thanks, Stacy. A lot of talk about some of the data from ADA and how obesity uptake, the uptake of new obesity drugs is projected and how it looks right now. It looks very exciting. And I just, as a reminder, we have an obesity drug. So to the extent those drugs are used widely, that's great, because we think we've got a phenomenal molecule in the VK2735.
At this point, we haven't really seen from the obesity drugs compelling anti-fibrotic signal. So I think in that sense, some of the liver targeting agents and different mechanisms may have an edge on just an obesity type drug. I think when you look at the ADA updated guidelines that were announced at the conference ADA conference, the suggestion to screen earlier for NAFLD and Nash, we think that's a great update to the guidance. We think that'll raise awareness and I think really serve to funnel more patients into the GI specialist setting where they're probably more likely to receive a targeted agent versus just an obesity agent and so we think that increase in awareness is, I think, favorable to the more of the pure Nash drugs.
But, at the end of the day, these are large markets. NASH is a pre-substantial market. There will be room for multiple modalities to coexist. If someone has morbid obesity and NASH, maybe something like retatrutide would be suitable for some period of time, but there are plenty of people who don't fit that description and very large populations that people aren't necessarily obese and they have NASH. If you look at Asians, they typically get a skinny NASH. So, we don't necessarily see obesity drugs just taking over the NASH world. I think that's an over statement. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys. And our next question, will come from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have one for 2735. You mentioned about the flexibility to add another arm. I'm just curious about what considerations you'll be put in, in making that determination, especially in a context that some of when you dose escalate, especially in such short-time intervals, sometimes the magnitude of weight loss don't really separate. Instead, the difference is really where they plateau. So, I'm curious about the thinking into adding that that's original arm.
And then, in terms of oral dosing versus SubQ, just curious if you have disclosed that and, it'll be helpful to kind of get an understanding of kind of the ratio between the SubQ dosing normalize to weekly versus oral dosing? Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Andy. So, with the oral dosing, we just have the flexibility and the protocol to add cohort just not. We have to make that decision based on the data and the data would be exposure PK, tolerability data. Those would be kind of the primary drivers to understanding whether or not we want to add another cohort.
With respect to the doses that are planned, I think we said previously we're looking at 2.5 milligrams per day, 5 milligrams per day, 10 milligrams per day, and then 20 milligrams per day and so, those would be the planned doses, and then if we make any changes, we have some flexibility there in the protocol. Got it, that's very helpful. And our next question will come from Yale Jen with Laidlaw & Co. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. I've got two here. The first one is from the meeting, the recent meeting that the GGG product, at least on the SPC side seems to be very promising. My question to you is that it was adding glucagon agonist, it was something for you guys to consider, or you feel this is probably not necessarily the best strategy forward and I have another follow-up. Yeah, thanks, Yale. We have looked at the triple agonist here and in our hands, we couldn't get them to outperform the dual agonist, the target, the GLP1 and GIP. What we do see from some of the data on the triple agonist compounds is that the incremental benefit on weight loss is it's there, it's relatively modest given the, I think, significant change in the adverse event profile. So with elevated hypersensitivity and potentially concerns on cardiac safety, we'll see how those pan out long term, but those would be potential challenges that may or may not be worth it in every patient.
So right now, we're looking at the GLP1 GIP dual agonist. There may be other mechanisms outside of glucagon that could be layered on to those two and provide a very nice enhancement of the signal. Okay, sounds great. And that's very helpful and maybe just one more question here, which is for the Phase 2 Sub-Q study you're going to start. Any color in terms of what level of your longer duration or other aspects in the trial design you can reveal and thanks. Yeah, thanks, Yale. So we're going up to 15 milligrams. We plan to go up to 15 milligrams in this study. It's a 13 week study and we would plan to tie trade in three week blocks to move up to the 15 milligrams dose levels. So I believe at the end of the study, if you are randomized to the 15 milligram arm, you would be on that arm for about four weeks. Okay, great. That's very helpful and look forward to data later this year. And our next question will come from Thomas Smith with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple on the obesity program, I think you've alluded to obesity week. This directly is a reasonable venue for presenting the detailed Phase 1 data. Can you just comment on whether that's still your expectation. And I guess what additional datasets we should be looking forward to with the detailed presentation beyond the top line? Yeah, thanks, Tom. We did submit an abstract as a late breaker and I don't know when those notifications will be sent out. We haven't notified yet. And we would hope to have -- we did collect a lot of different and we looked at plasma lipids. I'm sorry, plasma lipids and plasma glucose is what I meant to say. And we also looked at liver fat. So maybe some more color around some of those things as well as a little bit more on the PK side. We haven't talked a lot about PK, but probably expect to have a little bit more PK data. Okay, great. And so wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on the regulatory progress with 2735 in the US and I guess specifically, if you could comment on whether you filed the IND and if you have, I guess, what the gating factors to filing the IND would be? Yeah, thanks, Tom. We have recently filed the IND. And we hope to be able to start the study in the third quarter, but we have not -- we're still in that window right now. So there aren't any gating factors that we're aware of today that would preclude that, but we haven't heard back yet. Got it. Okay, great. And just one last question if I could on the voyage trial and I know you've commented previously about using one pathologist, the screen patients for entry. And I guess if they're on the border of F2, F3 or if they have a NASH equal to four, they get referred on to a second pathology review. Maybe you could just comment or give us your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about the biopsy evaluation for the 52-week biopsy. Are you considering adding additional pathologists or maybe changing to a consensus review methodology or just what are your latest thoughts on the histology efficacy evaluation? Yeah, thanks, Tom. It's obviously a lot of evolved since we initiated the study. We think we're best served now to sort of keep the two reader approach where you have a primary reader that sends things to a secondary reader when they are on the cusp of different gradations, F2 versus F3 or anybody with an NAS of four would still go to the second read and they -- those two pathologists much must reach consensus and I'm not aware any time thus far that they haven't reached consensus. So, I think that it's working for us now. In a Phase 3 trial, we would probably move to maybe a three reader approach, but right now we're going to stick with what's currently in the protocol. Got it. That's helpful. Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. Appreciate it. [Operator instructions] Our next question here will come from Justin Zelin with BTIG. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress here. So Brian, we recently saw an acquisition in the obesity space. Could you give us the latest thinking on the BD strategy at Viking, either bringing things into the company or likewise out? Oh, yeah, thanks, Justin. Our plan today is to develop things really as far as we can. We don't see ourselves launching either a NASH or an obesity product, but we will continue as aggressively as possible with the clinical development of our programs and be open minded to opportunities as they arise things that make sense for the company and our shareholders, but that's what folks on is our own internal programs. Right now, I'd say, bringing new things into the company probably a lower priority given that we have our hands full. Great. That makes sense to me. Thanks so much for taking the question. And our next question, will come from Dylan Dupuis with Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just one quick question on the Phase 2 obesity study that you guys are planning to start. Just around the dosing cohorts and at what point you think you'll need to start implementing dose? Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Dylan. Yeah, we do plan to titrate the lowest dose in the Phase 2 study would be a 2.5 mg fixed dose, but subsequent doses would be higher and will titrate into those doses in three week blocks. So, for example, second cohort is a five milligrams cohort we plan to do three weeks at 2.5 mgs and then the remainder of the trial at the 5 milligrams dose. So that's how we anticipate the titration scheme working. Thanks, Dylan. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Stephanie Diaz for any closing remarks. Thank you all for your participation and continued supportive of Viking Therapeutics. We look forward to updating you again in the coming months. Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation.

I encourage you to review all of the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning these and other matters. I will now turn the call over to Brian Lian for his initial comments. Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon to everyone dialed in by phone or listening on the webcast. Today, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and provide an update on recent progress with our clinical programs and operations.During the third quarter, Viking continued to build on the momentum established during the first half of the year. As a reminder, during the first six months of 2023, the company announced positive clinical data from our phase one trial evaluating VK2735, a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, for the potential treatment of obesity, and from our Phase 2b VOYAGE Study, evaluating VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis.Also, during the first six months, the company initiated the Phase 1 trial to evaluate a novel oral formulation of VK2735. Finally, the company closed a successful public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $288 million that we plan to use for the continued advancement of our pipeline programs through key clinical milestones. Building on these achievements and following the positive results from our phase one trial of VK2735, during the third quarter, the company advanced this program into Phase 2 development with the initiation of the venture study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VK2735 in patients with obesity.We recently announced that interest in this trial exceeded our expectations, allowing us to upsize the study and complete enrollment more quickly than expected. I'll provide further details on our operations and development activities after we review our financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. For that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Zante, Viking's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I'd like to recommend that participants refer to Viking's Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file today. I'll now go over our results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, beginning with the results for the quarter.Our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $18.4 million, compared to $12 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to preclinical studies, clinical studies, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits, and third-party consultants, partially offset by decreased expenses related to manufacturing for our drug candidates.Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $8.9 million, compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to legal and patent services, stock-based compensation, third-party consultants, and salaries and benefits.For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Viking reported a net loss of $22.5 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $15.8 million, or $0.21 per share in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2022.I'll now go over our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $43.3 million, compared to $38.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to preclinical studies, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits, manufacturing for our drug candidates, regulatory service costs and third party consultants partially offset by decreased expenses related to clinical studies.Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $28.2 million, compared to $12 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to legal and patent services, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits, and third party consultants.For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Viking reported a net loss of $61.3 million or $0.66 per share, compared to a net loss of $49.3 million or $0.64 per share in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net loss during the period was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses noted previously partially offset by increased interest income, compared to the same period in 2022.Turning to the balance sheet, at September 30 2023, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $376 million, compared to $155 million as of December 31, 2022. This concludes my financial review, and I'll now turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks, Greg. I'll begin today with an update on our VK2735 program, which is the newest clinical stage compound at the company. VK2735 is a dual agonist of the Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 or GLP-1 receptor and the Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide or GIP Receptor that is being evaluated for the treatment of obesity.Earlier this year, we announced positive results from a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study of VK2735. The study was designed to evaluate this compounds preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile as well as its potential impact on exploratory metabolic measures including body weight and liver fat.The single ascending dose portion of the study, which enrolled healthy men and women demonstrated that single doses of VK2735 were safe and well tolerated and displayed favorable pharmacokinetics. Following single subcutaneous doses VK2735 demonstrated the half-life of approximately 170 to 250 hours and excellent therapeutic exposures. The multiple ascending dose portion of this study enrolled healthy men and women with a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared. These subjects received VK2735 once weekly for 28 days.In this portion of the study VK2735, demonstrating a encouraging safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity. All cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated reductions in mean body weight from baseline ranging up to 7.8%. Cohorts receiving VK2735 also demonstrated reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 6%. Statistically significant differences in body weight compared to placebo were also maintained or improved at the day 43 follow up time point 21 days after the last dose of VK2735 was administered.In this study, the VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability with 98% of observed adverse events reported as mild or moderate, and 99% of gastrointestinal related adverse events reported as mild or moderate. These results were featured earlier this month in an oral presentation at obesity week, the annual meeting of the Obesity Society. The presentation highlighted the prior safety tolerability and weight loss findings, as well as new data demonstrating VK2735s impact on liver fat and plasma lipids.Notably, after four weekly doses of VK2735 subjects in the Phase 1 trial reported liver fat reductions of up to 47% from baseline. Among subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, placebo adjusted reductions in liver fat reached approximately 59%. Though the sample size was limited, these results may indicate VK2735s potential benefit in patients with various forms of fatty liver disease. The obesity week presentation also highlighted VK2735s effect on plasma lipids. Despite normal baseline plasma lipid levels among these healthy volunteers, treatment with VK2735 produced encouraging reductions from baseline and total cholesterol of up to 21% and reductions in LDL cholesterol of upto 23%. In addition, plasma levels of apolipoprotein B were reduced by up to 21%.Following the encouraging results from our Phase 1 study, during the third quarter Viking initiated the Phase 2 VENTURE trial to evaluate VK2735 in patients with obesity. The VENTURE trial is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled multicentre study, that is evaluating the safety tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735, administered subcutaneously once weekly for 13 weeks.This trial was designed to enroll approximately 125 adults with obesity, or adults who are overweight with at least one weight related comorbid condition. The trial will evaluate VK2735 doses of up to 15 milligrams compared to the 10 milligram top dose evaluated in the prior Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study. The primary endpoint of the study will assess the percent change in body weight from baseline to week-13 among patients treated with VK2735 as compared to placebo. Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate a range of additional safety and efficacy measures.Earlier this week, we announced that the VENTURE study is now fully enrolled. In addition, due to heightened clinician and patient interest, we announced that the trials enrollment size has been increased to 176 patients from the original target at 125 patients. We expect to report the top line results from this study in the first half of 2024.In addition to the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 under evaluation in the VENTURE study, we are also pursuing an oral formulation of this compound. Earlier this year, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate a novel tablet formulation of VK2735. This study is an extension of the Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple same dose study discussed earlier. The oral portion of the study is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled study in healthy volunteers who have a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared. Subjects in this portion of the study will receive once daily oral doses of VK2735 for 28 days. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK2735 following 28 days of oral dosing. Exploratory endpoints include changes in body weight and other pharmacodynamic markers. Enrollment in this study is continuing and we expect to report the results in the first quarter of 2024.I'll now provide an update on our most advanced compounds VK2809 for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis. VK2809 is an orally available small molecule agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor that is selected for liver tissue as well as the beta isoform of the receptor. Earlier this year, we announced positive or top line results from the ongoing Phase 2b VOYAGE study evaluating VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis. The study successfully achieved its primary endpoint, with patients receiving VK2809 experiencing statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 as compared with placebo. The median relative change from baseline in liver fat as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, proton density fat fraction ranged from 38% to 55% among patients receiving VK2809.Importantly, up to 85% of patients receiving VK2809 experienced at least a 30% relative reduction in liver fat content. This level of efficacy is associated with greater likelihood of histologic improvement in NASH.Additionally, VK2809-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and atherogenic proteins, all of which have been correlated with increased cardiovascular risk. These data indicate that VK2809 has the potential to provide longer term cardio-protective benefits.The VOYAGE data also reinforced VK2809's encouraging safety and tolerability profile. 94% of treatment related adverse events among patients treated with VK2809 were reported as mild or moderate. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low and balanced among placebo and treatment arms. Consistent with prior studies, VK2809 demonstrated excellent gastrointestinal tolerability in this study. Rates of nausea, diarrhea, stool frequency, and vomiting similar among VK2809-treated patients compared to placebo.The findings from both the Phase 2b VOYAGE study, as well as a previous Phase 2a NAFLD study are consistent with multiple prior studies that have demonstrated VK2809s lipid lowering properties, as well as its safety, tolerability and significant liver fat reduction. It is our belief that these features combined serve to establish VK2809 as a best-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of NASH.In the third quarter, the VOYAGE study continued and we expect to report data evaluating histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of treatment, in the first half of 2024. I will now review progress with our third clinical candidate VK0214 which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b trial in patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD.Like VK2809, VK0214 is an orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist X-ALD is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder that is caused by genetic mutations that disable the function of a Peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids. As a result, patients are unable to efficiently metabolize very long chain fatty acids. And the accumulation of these compounds is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of X-ALD.In a prior Phase 1 study in healthy subjects VK0214 demonstrated dose dependent exposures, no evidence of accumulation and the half-life consistent with anticipated once daily dosing. Subjects who received VK0214 experienced reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A. VK0214 also demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile, with no serious adverse events reported, and no treatment or dose related signals observed for GI side effects, vital signs or cardiovascular measures.Viking is currently enrolling a Phase 1b study evaluating VK0214 in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN, form of X-ALD, which is the most common form of the disorder. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multicenter study in adult male patients with AMN. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 administered orally once daily for 28 days. The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels very long chain fatty acids. This study continues to enroll, and we expect to complete enrollment by year-end.In conclusion, the first nine months of the year have been extraordinarily busy at Viking. Our newest program, evaluating VK2735 for the treatment of obesity was announced less than two years ago, and the program has matured quickly in 2023. During the first nine months of the year, we reported the results of the first Phase 1 trial of VK2735, which demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability and exciting early signals of efficacy. We also initiated the complimentary Phase 1 trial evaluating a novel oral formulation of VK2735, which we believe may expand the market opportunity for this therapeutic.In the third quarter, we initiated the VENTURE Phase 2 trial to evaluate VK2735s longer term clinical benefits. We are very excited with the progress we've made with this program during 2023. And we look forward to reporting additional data for both the subcutaneous and oral formulations in the coming quarters. With respect to VK2809, the top line data from the VOYAGE study announced earlier this year, once again demonstrated best-in-class data from this program. The results reaffirmed VK2809's ability to drive significant reductions in liver fat, along with potentially cardioprotective benefits through robust reductions in plasma lipids.The VOYAGE study is continuing, and we expect to report data on histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52-weeks of treatment in the first half of 2024. And with respect to our third clinical program VK0214 the Phase 1b study evaluating VK0214 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy continues, and we anticipate completing enrollment by year-end.Importantly, as we aggressively advance our pipeline, we continue to carefully manage our finances and maintain a strong balance sheet of approximately $376 million, which we believe extends our operating runway beyond the value creating milestones ahead for each of our programs. This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks very much for joining us, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joon Lee of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, congrats on the progress and thanks for taking our questions. For the VK2735, based on the completion of Phase 2 VENTURE trial enrollment disclosed earlier this week, we'd expect a top line from the 13-week study to come sometime in the February or March time frame. So, first quarter of next year. Any reason why we shouldn't expect data in first quarter of 24? And I have a quick follow-up. Hey, Joon, thanks. We're guiding really to the first half. Hard to put a more precise date on it than that because you never know if there are extra things to clean up in the database or things like that. Your timeline doesn't seem crazy, but I would be cautious to guide too detailed right now. We just completed enrollment. Yes. And congrats on the enthusiasm that met the over enrollment. And, on the Oral VK2735, can you elaborate on the reasons why it may be delayed to first quarter of next year? Is that due to an addition in possibly another cohort or those? Or just wondering what the delay could be due to? Thank you. Yes, thanks, Joon. No it's really just going more slowly than we'd like. Nothing more than that. We haven't reached the point. The protocol is flexible in that we can add additional cohorts, but we're not to the point of making any of those decisions at this point. Our next question comes from Steve Seedhouse from Raymond James. Please go ahead. On the Oral 2735 study, I just wanted to ask if you have a sense of whether the pharmacology of the oral formulation is really translating clinically as you'd expect and if the relative potency versus the injectable formulation is sort of holding up. Can you comment on your updated or current conviction there? Well we think, thanks Steve. We think the mechanism should hold if the drug is well absorbed and we get good exposures. We're blinded to the study right now. So it's just ongoing. We don't have any further comment really on efficacy or tolerability or any of those metrics just yet. Okay. Thanks for that, Brian. And just following up on the progress of the study, can you comment just generally on sort of where you are relative to the planned overall number of cohorts, like where you are in terms of dose levels? Has your thinking evolved at all? And specifically, obviously, the VENTURE Study enrolling the way it did, does that sort of change your urgency or your strategy with how you're executing this Phase 1 Oral study? No. It's a good question. No. The VENTURE Study enrolled really quickly, a really high interest and enthusiasm there. But it's a different study. It's a parallel cohort study and multi-center as opposed to the Phase 1 where it's a single site and it's a sequential cohort type of study. And in that type of a study, if, for example, the cohorts are not completely filled on a specific day and you have to have a patient or subject come in in staggered timeframes, it just delays the entire execution of the study. And that's really the reason for the delay there. It's just slower to move forward than we'd like. VENTURE, I think, is moving along really well. Got it. And just lastly, I mean, obviously this space is hot right now and everyone is aware of these types of drugs. So I guess it's not totally shocking that the trial wouldn't enroll so fast. But there's also a lot of competing studies and commercially available products, of course. So anything you wanted to expand on just in terms of what you learned in the past six or seven weeks, just how that exceeded expectations so much? And is there anything specific you would call out? Or is it just what I noted, the general awareness of the mechanism? Yes, no, thanks. It's a great point. And we were surprised with the enthusiasm from the sites and everybody, all the investigators, had more people available than we could enroll. I think it's partly due to the extensive media coverage of weight loss drugs today. And I'm sure some contribution is there from the shortages that we see from semaglutide and Tirzepatide supplies. So I think both of those sort of combined here, that hyper-awareness and the commercial shortages. Is it too early? Because it's an experimental product. Do you have a sense that the investigators or even the patients just don't really distinguish between the drugs? In other words, if this is as big of a market as we all suspect, like there's going to be plenty of room for a lot of different players and that leaves room for you guys of course. Because it just seems like that would be implied by the speed with which you enrolled an experimental product. Yes, I think the investigators are aware of the differences in mechanisms certainly. On the patient side, I'm not so sure that awareness is there. There is a general awareness of GLP-1 agonists being attractive weight loss agents. And this drug has GLP in the part of the mechanism description. So to that extent, I'm sure it excited some candidate patients. But I don't think the patients necessarily view a dual as different from a single at this point. I think over time that will evolve as we get more data from the duals versus the singles. But today I just think it's sort of a high-level awareness in general from media coverage. The next question comes from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Maybe to shift gears over to NASH for a moment. Can you share any thoughts on the failure of Akero's FGF21 drug and F4 NASH patients and talk about it? If you would consider studying cirrhotic NASH patients similar to the way Madrigal is doing with an outcome study? Hi, Jay. Yes it's a good question. And I'm not super close to the FGF21 mechanism. So I'm probably not the best person to ask there. But our understanding has always been that the F4 patient is just different from the F3 and earlier. They're just in a sicker state. The liver is far more advanced in disease and it's just different. We've seen failures in that indication before. Maybe if it was a longer study, there would have been a higher probability of success. But I don't know. That's just a speculative comment.We will have to look at our biopsy data to drive any further decisions on going forward in cirrhotics versus just non-cirrhotics. But we don't have the data right now to support that decision. Okay. All right. Sounds reasonable. And then congrats on getting the late breaker at AASLD for VK2809. Anything you'd like to highlight for investors to look out for in that presentation? Yes, thanks, Jay. Well, we will be looking at some subsets. Diabetics versus non-diabetics because the prior 12-week study didn't have diabetics in that study. We'll also report data on effect sizes in F2 versus F3 to see if there is any differential efficacy as patients are more advanced in disease. Those sorts of things would be the incremental data around the presentation. The next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel. Please go ahead. Hi. I wanted to just pull back and look a little bit more big picture. So given the naturally higher potency of the dual agonists and the competitive profile of the injectable, which I think compares very favorably to others, and also the recent benchmarks set by other oral GLPs, I guess, have you reset your expectations around what we might see for the Phase 1? I guess they were relatively modest based on what we're seeing in some of the new benchmarks that are being set. So can you put some context around this? And are your more modest expectations possibly related to like a molecule-size question for dual agonists versus single agonists that could impact bioavailability? Thanks. Thanks, Annabel. So we think that the dual mechanism is a really competitive mechanism. I think over time, the addition of a second agonist mechanism should allow the efficacy to exceed a monoagonist. Whether or not that's evident to 28 days, I mean, I don't know. We're still looking for if we see something in the 1% to 2% in excess of placebo, that would probably, and good tolerability and safety, that would probably be sufficient to move it forward into phase 2.But I think it's important to keep in mind these are 28-day PK safety and tolerability studies, and they're being compared in ways that are almost like phase 3 registration studies. And there's a reason you don't treat obesity in 28 days. It takes years to develop, and it takes longer than 28 days to really effectively treat. Registration studies have to be at least 52 weeks. So I understand all the comparisons, but we're not too worried about our mechanism being non-competitive. Yes, I'm not worried about the non-competitiveness of the mechanism. I think the dual agonists are pretty strong. I'm just wondering if you had any reservations about getting a larger molecule into an oral formulation, if that is one of the reasons for your more cautious or conservative expectations. No, no. It's just generally the exposure levels from oral peptides are lower than sub-Q. So that would tend to lead to a lower level of efficacy long-term. And that's kind of what we've seen in other settings as well. But over 28 days, I think we're just looking for a signal of are the exposures there? Are we seeing some weight loss? And is the tolerability acceptable? Okay, fair enough. And then on NASH, I guess, what are your thoughts on the impact of some of these anti-obesity products on NASH? Is it more of a growth impactor for the market, or will it potentially eat into the opportunity? I mean, we're recognizing that the market is large and very heterogeneous, but some KOLs have cited meaningful reductions in the market. Just want to hear your thoughts on that, even with your own compound that's shown, 2735 has shown also liver fat content reductions for NAFLD patients. So I'm just trying to think about how you're considering the impact on the market. Yes, it's a really heterogeneous market. You have diabetics and non-diabetics, obese patients and non-obese patients. You have patients who have heavy fibrosis and not a lot of liver fat, and you have patients with a lot of liver fat and fibrosis. So it leads to the possibility of multiple combination therapies. I do think that expanding use of GLP-1s might lead to that being looked at as more of a sort of backbone type of therapy, but I don't think that precludes an opportunity for more directed drugs that are really targeting the liver and address specific features of NASH, where the single and dual agonists and triple agonists don't necessarily do that directly. So I think maybe the increase in awareness from using more GLP-1s in NASH in patients with NAFLD could help actually some of the more directed agents in that some patients who might not respond as well on liver histology might see earlier use of a combination agent with a GLP-1 or other dual agonists. Okay, got it. And then one last question if I may. Could you remind us what your patent situation is with both products? Well, with the dual agonists, the IP estate was run beyond 2040. With the VK2809, the thyroid beta agonist, we have multiple patents in the 2037 to I think 2043 range now. The composition of matter for that compound would expire in the mid-2030 time frame. I think it's May 2030 with a five-year extension on it. But we have at least five additional patents that begin to expire 2037 out to 2043, I believe, for this one. Our next question comes from Joe Pantginis from HC Wainwright. Please go ahead. Brian, I want to latch on to your comment about the hyperawareness around the GLPs. And specifically, look, there's a growing notion here about the ""Emerging AE profile"" of these drugs as they're used for longer periods of time. I mean, no need to quote a lot of the studies or what have you. So I guess, can you take a moment to add a little more color or emphasis why you believe 2735 has a better AE profile? Obviously, it appears like it's coming out right now in the studies and what you've disclosed. But anything you can really emphasize, I think, would be helpful for us, as well as similar to an earlier question, as this field evolves, has it changed any of your thinking with regard to how your own development plans might progress? Yes thanks, Joe. I think what we've seen in the Phase 1 experience with VK2735 is really encouraging on AEs. AEs, for the most part were mild to moderate. Tolerability was really outstanding. We didn't really see a dose dependency in some of the AEs. The highest dose cohort actually looked a lot like the lowest dose cohort when it came to the GI tolerability side effects like nausea and vomiting. And it's a small data set, so it's hard to talk too much definitively. But there is some evidence that when GIP is activated, there is an offset to the GLP-1 induced nausea, and that might allow better tolerability with the dual agonist where GIP is part of the mechanism.Really early in our data set to say that, but if that is true, then the dual agonist should separate on tolerability over time relative to simply a high dose GLP-1 monoagonist. But really early to make those sorts of comments right now. Any views on development plans? Have there been any alterations in your mind based on how the field has been evolving? No, no. We're full steam ahead on both. The oral program is a little more slow than we'd like, but it's pedal to the metal on both programs right now. No changes to our plans. The next question comes from Andy Hsieh of William Blair. Please go ahead. So, looking at the obesity week presentation, I'm just curious if you have thoughts regarding baseline characteristics, especially for age. Looking at the average age, 29 for placebo, 42 for the highest dose. Does that favor placebo and underestimate the effect size of 27, 35? We've seen some imbalances in age across, several obesity studies. Yes, I don't know if that's â€“ there were some imbalances in age and also in weight, and then some of the cohorts had more men than women and more women than men, and it was really hard to discern any differences based on any of those metrics. But I think, we'll be able to make a better call on that after the Phase 2 study. It's a good question, though. Yes, okay. Great. So related to that, just curious about, expectations or how you frame expectations for liver fat reduction for the VENTURE study that we'll read out in the first half. Well, with VENTURE, we're looking more at body weight and not at liver fat, so we're just looking at body weight changes. We're not doing the MRI in the VENTURE trial. We did see really attractive reductions, although the numbers were small in the Phase 1 study, but nearly 60% relative reduction in liver fat after four doses. That was really impressive, a bit higher than we expected in just four doses, but we're not doing the MRI in the VENTURE study. Got it, okay. And maybe lastly for manufacturing, obviously there's a lot of press and attention related to the drug class. I'm just curious, you can comment on 2735's CMC where it is, capacity for either like a Phase 2b or Phase 3 study? Yes thanks, it's a great question and an area we're spending a lot of time on. We don't foresee any capacity constraints near term. If we were to be launching the drug next year, that would be different because the demands would be much higher, but for the clinical supplies, absolutely no problem we foresee today. We are looking more now than I think we probably would otherwise have looked at scalability and various approaches to enhance yields and shorten timelines for large scale syntheses. And I think we're a place where we have several options available to us. And I don't think by the time this compound would be available commercially, I don't think supply constraints would be the challenge that they are today. The next question comes from Thomas Smith of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Just on 2735, I think you've generated quite a bit of preclinical data now for the oral form of this compound. I was wondering if there's any plans or opportunities for you to present some of these preclinical data in the near term, maybe before we get the Phase 1 data that's now expected in Q1. Yes thanks, Tom. We've been pretty quiet about the data from the oral formulation. And so we don't have any plans at this point to present data between now, animal data between now and the Phase 1 readout in the first quarter. Okay, got it. And another question on 2735. I know you just showed some strong liver fat reduction data at obesity week. Can you just remind us Brian, how you're thinking about 2735 potential in NASH? And I guess whether you're considering generating any of your own data there with 2735, either alone or in combination with 2809? Yes well, we did the MRIs here and we didn't have a baseline requirement for an MRI in the Phase 1 study, but we did it just to see if there was some impact. We know with the GLP-1s, I think we can see 30 some percent reductions. And so we had hoped with the GIP and GLP-1 dual agonists that you'd see something in that neighborhood. And we did see that and better. But so it was kind of a sort of proof-of-concept there. We don't have any plan today to move into NASH. It was just something that we wanted to know how does it compare to a mono agonist.And I think it compares favorably to the mono agonist that we've seen. And I think it also, even though the timeline's a lot shorter it compares favorably to the triple agonist data that are out there, the much longer time treatment window with that compound. But I think we feel good about what we've seen so far. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Yale Jen of Laidlaw & Company. Please go ahead. Again, on the obesity week data, just curious that if the VENTURE data also looks good, does the obesity, I'm sorry, the obesity week data in the plasma lipid as well as in the statin lipid, would impact on your potential future, let's say Phase 3 study in terms of selecting more sub-cohort of the obesity patients or that's not necessarily into consideration? Not in consideration at this point. I think the plasma lipid effects were really interesting in that they might allow you to reduce the dose of a statin or something like that. So that was a really neat finding. And it was kind of across the board there. We saw a nice reductions in plasma lipids. But for now, the VENTURE Study will be a pure obesity study. It is a pure obesity study. And we anticipate the subsequent studies to really focus on obesity and not any subsets at this point. Okay, great. Just one more question here. In terms again, in 2735, first of all do you guys have any specific injectors used in the study? And how do you see that in the future that at least currently there's some shortage issues? What's your thoughts? Yes, yes. Fortunately, we have some time to work through that. And we are looking at sort of the early models of injectors. This trial is a vial and syringe trial where people are dosed in the clinic. But the next studies we would anticipate to use some form of an auto-injector. Okay, great. And congrats on all the progress and look forward to readout early next year. Our next question comes from Justin Zelin of BTIG. Please go ahead. Hey, Brian. Congrats on the progress here. Just wanted to ask you've seen promising data from both 2809 and 2735. Just wanted to hear your current thoughts on a potential study using both agents in the treatment of NASH. And then just a quick follow-up. Yes thanks, Justin. We spent a lot of time on that thinking about how these could be combined. They're different formulations. And so the up-front formulation work is a little more extensive if we were to pursue a combination agent. And then the other requirements on tox is also, it's just different with two unapproved agents. So more extensive on that front as well. So I think it's a really potentially high-value combination. But we don't have anything to say further about it right now. I think it could be very useful though in the future. Right. That makes sense to me. And then you're developing both an oral and an injectable. Maybe just to hear your current thoughts on how that market might evolve. Obviously with multiple modalities, do you think patients might start in an injectable and then move to an oral for maintenance? Yes. We view them as different products, really. The option you mentioned where somebody maybe doesn't want to start with an injectable because they feel like it's a little more intensive or intrusive, whatever starting with an oral and seeing some weight loss might lower the resistance to start using injectable. So that's one option. The other would be the flip side where someone who's lost a lot of weight on an injectable might want to transition to an oral and so for more of a maintenance, longer-term usage. That's another great opportunity.And then the other big bucket we think about is, temporary use. Somebody wants to lose some weight for summer or an upcoming event or something like that. I think there would be a great opportunity there. So the oral does not need the same efficacy as the sub-Q because the uses will likely be different. So I think they're nicely complementary products and have completely complementary areas of application. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like now to turn the conference back over to Stephanie Diaz for any closing remarks. Thank you again for your participation and continued support of Viking Therapeutics. We look forward to updating you again in the coming months. Have a good afternoon. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 24, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Viking's Manager of Investor Relations, Stephanie Diaz. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Hello, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Joining me today is Brian Lian, Viking's President and CEO; and Greg Zante, Viking's CFO. 
Before we begin, I'd like to caution that comments made during this conference call today, April 24, 2024, will contain forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Viking's expectations regarding its development activities, time lines and milestones. 
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement made today. I encourage you to review all of the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning these and other matters. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Lian for his initial comments. Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon to everyone listening in by phone or on the webcast. Today, we'll review our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, and provide an update on recent progress with our clinical programs and operations. 
During the first quarter, Viking announced positive results from 2 of the company's key pipeline programs. First, our Phase II VENTURE study, evaluating our dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, VK2735 in patients with obesity, successfully achieved its primary end point and all secondary end points demonstrating statistically significant reductions in body weight at all doses as compared to placebo. 
Also during the quarter, the company announced results from a Phase I clinical trial evaluating an oral tablet formulation of VK2735. This study demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability as well as promising weight loss following 28 days of once-daily dosing.
The company plans to advance both of these programs into further development later this year. In addition, during the first quarter, the company completed the final biopsies in the Phase IIb VOYAGE study evaluating the novel thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, VK2809, in patients with NASH and fibrosis. We expect to report the biopsy results from this study later this quarter.
Finally, during the quarter, Viking completed a public offering of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $630 million. These funds substantially strengthened the company's balance sheet and will support our plans to aggressively develop our pipeline.
I'll provide further details on our operations and development activities after we review our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. For that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Zante, Viking's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I'd like to recommend that participants refer to Viking's Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file later today. I'll now go over our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. Research and development expenses were $24.1 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $11 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to manufacturing for our drug candidates, preclinical studies, clinical studies, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits and services provided by third-party consultants. 
General and administrative expenses were $10 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits and services provided by third-party consultants, partially offset by decreased expenses related to legal and patent services. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, Viking reported a net loss of $27.4 million or $0.26 per share compared to a net loss of $19.5 million or $0.25 per share in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in net loss for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2023. 
Turning to the balance sheet at March 31, 2024, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $963 million compared to $362 million as of December 31, 2023. First quarter balance reflects receipt of gross proceeds of $630 million from the company's public offering, which closed on March 4, 2024.
This concludes my financial review, and I'll now turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks, Greg. The first quarter of 2024 was an eventful quarter as we received and reported the results from 2 key clinical trials. Our Phase II VENTURE trial evaluating subcutaneous VK2735 in patients with obesity. And our Phase I clinical trial, evaluating an oral tablet formulation of VK2735 in healthy volunteers. Both studies were successful, demonstrating promising weight loss and favorable safety and tolerability and we look forward to advancing both of these programs into further development later this year. 
As we have recently reviewed the results from each of these studies on separate conference calls, I'll briefly review key takeaways in my prepared comments, and refer you to our February 27 and March 26 press releases for more details. In addition, I'm happy to provide further detail in the Q&A portion of the call. I will first provide an update on our subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 for obesity. 
VK2735 is a dual agonist of the glucagon like peptide-1, or GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulin atrophic polypeptide, or GIP receptor. In the first quarter of 2023, we announced positive results from a Phase I single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study of VK2735. This study demonstrated the promising safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK2735 when administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection for 4 weeks. 
In addition, subjects in the study demonstrated up to 7.8% weight loss from baseline after 28 days with no signs of plateau. Based on these positive results, Viking initiated the Phase II trial called the VENTURE trial to evaluate VK2735 in patients with obesity. The VENTURE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735 administered subcutaneously once weekly for 13 weeks. 
In the first quarter, Viking announced positive top line results from the VENTURE study. This trial successfully achieved its primary end point and all secondary end points with patients receiving VK2735 demonstrating reductions in body weight at all doses compared with placebo.
For the primary end point, patients receiving VK2735 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight from baseline ranging up to 14.7% as well as statistically significant reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 13.1%. 
Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for all VK2735 doses starting at week 1 and  were maintained throughout the course of the study. Weight loss in all treated cohorts was progressive through 13 weeks and did not show evidence of plateauing. We believe this suggests that further weight loss could be achieved through extended dosing beyond the 13-week treatment period of this study. 
Additionally, the VENTURE study showed VK2735 treatment to be safe and well tolerated over the 13-week trial with the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events being characterized as mild or moderate. Based on the Phase II VENTURE results as well as prior Phase I results, Viking plans to meet with the FDA later this quarter to discuss next steps in the development of VK2735.  
In addition to the subcutaneous formulation, the company is also developing a novel oral tablet formulation of VK2735. We believe a tablet formulation could represent an attractive treatment option for patients with obesity, and we see this as an important potential expansion of the overall opportunity for the program. Last year, we initiated an extension of the previously reported subcutaneous Phase I study to incorporate an evaluation of our tablet formulation. 
The oral portion of this study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults with a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter squared. Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VK2735 administered as a tablet once daily for 28 days. Secondary and exploratory objectives include an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of orally administered VK2735 as well as various pharmacodynamic measures, including changes in body weight and other metrics. 
During the first quarter, we reported the initial data from this study. With respect to safety and tolerability, oral VK2735 was shown to be safe and well tolerated following once-daily dosing for up to 28 days at doses that were titrated up to 40 milligrams.
Among subjects receiving VK2735, all treatment-emergent adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity with the majority, 76% reported as mild. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were reported for gastrointestinal adverse events among subjects treated with VK2735 compared with placebo. 
Importantly, to date, no serious adverse events have been reported in this study. In addition to safety and tolerability, and exploratory assessment of change in body weight was conducted. Subjects receiving oral VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in body weight, ranging up to 5.3% from baseline. Placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight reached up to 3.3% from baseline. Body weight reductions compared with baseline and placebo were statistically significant at the highest dose evaluated. 
In addition, weight loss during the 28-day window of this study was progressive at the 20-milligram and 40-milligram dose levels with no plateau observed. Given the promising weight loss signal observed in this study, along with the excellent tolerability profile thus far, Viking is pursuing further dose escalation. In addition, based on the encouraging trajectory of weight loss and the lack of a plateau at 28 days for the higher dose cohorts, we believe that further benefits might be anticipated from longer dosing periods. 
To this end, we are proceeding with plans for a Phase II trial in patients with obesity, and we expect to initiate this study later this year. Details on study design will be provided as we get closer to study initiation. 
I will now turn to our most advanced clinical program, VK2809 for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis. VK2809 is an orally available small molecule agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor that is selective for liver tissue as well as the beta isoform of the receptor.
Last May, we announced positive top line results from the Phase IIb VOYAGE study of VK2809. The VOYAGE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter international trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis. 
Enrollment included patients with at least 8% liver fat as measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction as well as F2 and F3 fibrosis.
Last May, we reported that this study had successfully achieved its primary endpoint with patients receiving VK2809 demonstrating statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 as compared with placebo. The median relative change from baseline in liver fat among patients treated with VK2809 ranged from 38% to 55% after 12 weeks. 
In addition, up to 85% of patients receiving VK2809 experienced at least 30% reduction in liver fat. This level of efficacy is associated with a greater likelihood of histologic benefit in NASH.
As in prior studies, VK2809-treated patients also achieved statistically significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and atherogenic lipoproteins. We believe these results indicate that VK2809 has the potential to provide longer-term cardioprotective benefits. 
The initial VOYAGE data also served to further establish VK2809's promising safety and tolerability profile. 94% of treatment-related adverse events among patients receiving VK2809 were reported as mild or moderate.
Discontinuations due to adverse events were low and balanced among placebo and treatment arms. In particular, VK2809 demonstrated excellent gastrointestinal tolerability with similar rates of nausea, diarrhea, stool frequency and vomiting observed among VK2809-treated patients compared to placebo. 
Last November, Viking presented additional data from this study at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. These new data demonstrated robust liver fat reductions among patients with or without type 2 diabetes as well as those having either F2 or F3 fibrosis. Among patients with type 2 diabetes at week 12, reductions from baseline in liver fat ranged from 36% to 54%, which was comparable to the reductions observed among patients without type 2 diabetes. 
Treatment with VK2809 also demonstrated potent reductions in liver fat among patients with either F2 or F3 fibrosis with liver fat reductions ranging up to approximately 58% from baseline. Thus, these results indicate that neither the presence of type 2 diabetes nor the presence of F2 or F3 fibrosis meaningfully impact VK2809's efficacy in reducing liver fat. 
During the first quarter, we completed the final biopsies in the VOYAGE study and remain on track to report the histology data from this study later this quarter.
I'll now provide a brief update on our second thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, VK0214, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase Ib trial in patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy or X-ALD. Like VK2809, VK0214 is also an orally available small molecule that is selected for the beta isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor. X-ALD is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder, that is caused by genetic mutations that disable the function of a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids. 
As a result, patients are unable to efficiently metabolize very long-chain fatty acids and the accumulation of these compounds is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of X-ALD. In a prior Phase I study in healthy volunteers, VK0214 demonstrated dose-dependent exposures, no evidence of accumulation, and the half-life consistent with anticipated once-daily dosing. Subjects who received VK0214 experienced reductions in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A. 
VK0214 also demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported and no treatment or dose-related signals observed for GI side effects, vital signs or cardiovascular measures. The ongoing Phase Ib study of VK0214 is being conducted in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN form of X-ALD, which is the most common form of the disorder. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study in adult male patients with AMN. 
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 administered orally once daily for 28 days. The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids. The company expects to report the top line results from this trial in mid-2024. 
Finally, during the first quarter, the company successfully completed an underwritten public offering of common stock. The gross proceeds to Viking from this offering were approximately $630 million. As Greg indicated a few moments ago, these funds have strengthened our balance sheet which, as of the end of the quarter, held approximately $963 million in cash, significantly extending our runway. This provides the company with the resources to aggressively develop our programs through important clinical milestones. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, Viking reported positive data from 2 key clinical trials of our lead obesity program, VK2735. The Phase II VENTURE study demonstrated up to an approximately 15% reduction in body weight from baseline following 13 weeks of dosing by weekly subcutaneous injection as well as promising safety and tolerability.
The Phase I study of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity with subjects reporting mean weight loss of up to 5.3% from baseline following 28 days of oral dosing. We plan to meet with regulators to discuss the path forward for each of these programs, and we expect to initiate further clinical trials with each later this year. 
We also plan to report data from the Phase IIb VOYAGE study of our thyroid hormone beta receptor agonist VK2809 in biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis later this quarter. The initial data from this study successfully achieved the primary endpoint and affirmed VK2809's potent efficacy of reducing liver fat, along with its favorable tolerability and safety profile.
We recently completed the final biopsies in the VOYAGE study and look forward to reporting data on histologic changes assessed after 52 weeks of treatment later this quarter. 
Finally, we expect to announce data from our Phase Ib study of VK0214 for the treatment of adrenomyeloneuropathy midyear. To support our maturing pipeline, the company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet of $963 million.
This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks very much for joining us, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joon Lee with Truist. Congrats on the quarter. Sarcopenia is getting a lot of attention these days and some companies are talking about adding SARM to GLP. You certainly have your share of experiences with SARM and sarcopenia in general. Any thoughts on bringing back 5211 as an add-on strategy? And I have a follow-up. Joon, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, it is, I think, getting to be more popular in the conversation, what we have kind of always said and hasn't really changed. It's hard to understand the clinical significance of the loss in muscle and whether that actually has an impact on function or feeling or survival, which are what -- or typically used for approval.
But -- it's a good point that 5211 compound is the most potent SARM that we're aware of. And to the extent muscle losses considered to be clinically relevant more so in the pharmacologic setting versus the regular diet exercise setting, it could be something that's really useful. Okay. Looking forward to your update on that, can you update us on where you are with the oral VK2735 dosing and what the stopping criteria or the maximum dose that you tend to test for the oral? Yes. Thanks, Joon. It's ongoing still and we are planning to continue dose escalation until we either get to some sort of a -- some reason for stopping or maybe a plateau on the exposures or a plateau on the weight change or some tolerability issue. And so we'll probably have more to say about that around the middle of the year when we have data from the additional cohorts. Great. And one final question. At a steady state, stay around half year mark. Is it your expectation that VK2735 would drive percent weight loss greater than tirzepatide? Or would it be similar to tirzepatide and what is the basis for your thinking. Sorry, on the -- were you talking about the overall or what... Yes, for injectable, let's say, subcutaneous. For the subcutaneous. Well, it seems that at any given dose, the exposures are significantly higher. And so whether it would be better or comparable hard to say. But I think at any given dose we should have greater load on board without -- in our view, without a meaningful change in the tolerability profile. So how that translates, I think we would have to see a longer study before making a call on that. The next question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. This is Kambiz on for Roger. Maybe on VK2809, what's the general translatability of kind of the 12-week MRI-PDFF result into later histology endpoints and are you planning to move the program into -- the NASH program into Phase III yourself? Or do you intend to partner? And then maybe as a third and final question, how do you think the thyroid beta agonist market will develop. There's kind of been some recent evidence that GLP-1s, both dual GLP-1 and GIP and dual GLP-1 glucagon agonist have shown potentially fibrosis improvement. So just your thoughts on how that market will develop and will be really helpful. Yes. Thanks, Kambiz. So with the translatability for liver fat to histologic improvement, generally, it has been shown that reducing liver fat, particularly above that 30% relative reduction threshold has led to improved odds of histologic benefit. There are some exceptions to that. But generally, there are more examples of that proving out than not. And I think it's more of a compound by compound situation when you try to translate to precise liver fat reduction to histologic improvement. 
I think the best comparator for us would be the other thyroid agonist that was recently approved. It showed in the -- somewhere in the teens range for NASH resolution and it did show some improvement in fibrosis. So to the extent we have a similar or better liver fat reduction, I think that would be sort of the range we would be looking at for NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. 
With respect to the overall market, yes, it does seem like there is a rapid expansion of the GLP-1 utilization. And so that probably does create some headwind on the uptick of new NASH drugs, but we've not had an approved drug for NASH. So now that we do, I think it's going to be really important to see how the first few quarters mature there.
And maybe there is a backlog of people waiting to try it and a backlog of clinicians waiting to prescribe it. So unknown right now, it's hard to project. But it is true that the GLP-1s are getting more and more utilization. There's a middle question in there, I think I skipped. Yes. Just some plans on Phase III for your NASH program kind of intend to do it solo or maybe search secret partner? Yes, yes. Great. Yes. So the -- we plan to do is, receive the data from the VOYAGE study, and then we'll schedule an into Phase II meeting with the FDA for later this year and get the current view of registration endpoints and any trial design suggestions the agency might have. And I think we'll have to see what the data look like, but we'll be -- we're probably looking for a partner with the program, but hard to say without having a look at the data first. The next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel. I have 2 on the oral. So when you think about the additional doses for the oral, which already has shown some pretty respectable weight loss metrics. How are you balancing, how high you push the dose versus the manufacturing capacity issues getting a lot of questions around that, given the supply problems that current manufacturers have with their own therapies right now. So I just want to know if you're going into this with that thought in mind.
And the second is, I guess, given some of the additional benefits that weight loss drugs are having, whether it's on CV risk or hypertension or kidney disease and now sleep apnea. Are there any additional trials or subpopulations that you can be baking into your later-stage development programs to sort of position yourself competitively even at a minimum from a payer perspective, as the space evolves without having to do Phase IV trials, but at least have some kind of idea or metric in the late-stage trials that you're already designing. So those are my questions for now. Thanks, Annabel. Yes. For the second question, we'll probably focus mostly on obesity as the primary or early indication, but all of the subsets that you just mentioned and the successes in those populations are really important. So to the extent we could add a cohort with dyslipidemia or something like that to look at effects on plasma lipids that might have a read through the cardiovascular benefit that maybe we're primarily, though, looking at the weight loss indication for the Phase III program.
With respect to manufacturing, it's an area that, yes, we're acutely aware of it. And I think a couple of things. We're right now in this very acute stage where these compounds have just been recently approved for weight loss and there is just overwhelming demand and the supply isn't quite there. We don't consider that to be a terminal state. We do see from the existing companies in the space, ramp-up in manufacturing capacity. We know on the contractor side, there is a massive attention being paid to this issue. And so I think the supply dynamics will probably evolve over the next few years. Still going to be a difficult challenge, but I think we're not in a permanent shortage state, we don't think. The next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Congrats on all the progress, and thank you for providing this update. For subcu VK2735, what kind of data should we expect in 2Q? And do you think you'll have enough data to support less frequent dosing? And then -- what are your latest thoughts on the Phase IIb study? And then I had a follow-up question, if I could. Yes. Thanks, Jay. So we'll -- we haven't received the final data from the study yet. So we would be looking for the lipid data, some of the PK data, the exposure data after 4 and 6 weeks after the last dose. That sort of thing, I think, would be important for us to understand. And what's the proper form for presentation maybe some of it would trickle into earnings updates or corporate presentations.
But probably later in the year, we would have a presentation at a medical conference. And with respect to less frequent dosing, and that's part of the PK data that we will receive, if it looks like we're in a therapeutic range at some period after the last dose, maybe that will be a feasible strategy and we would look to incorporate that into a subsequent trial. So really important data coming out of the PK data set. Okay. Great. And latest thoughts on a Phase IIb study? Phase IIb study, yes, we're going to have a Type C meeting with the FDA later this quarter. And so we would hope to be able to start the next study, a Phase IIb study seems likely, but we would look to start to that later in the year, probably fourth quarter would be the timing for that study. Okay. Great. And if I could ask one more question. Given the positive data you've already presented for both injectable and oral VK2735 what additional cards would you like to turn over before seeking a partner or a potential strategic transaction. Well, I think more data is always helpful to potential partners, but we don't view it as gating for us to have meaningful conversations. And I'm not sure it's necessarily gating for others to have meaningful conversations with us. But generally, the larger partners like to see more data as programs evolve. But again, not a -- I don't think that's a mandatory requirement right now. Next question comes from Andrew Hsieh with William Blair. So the first one I have is really on the potential framework for duration for the Phase II subcutaneous study, maybe from 2 directions. One is really on maybe the GLP talks, maybe you can provide us with an update regarding how long you can dose this upcoming study based on all the GLP talks that you've done to date?
And then secondarily, it's mostly like a [indiscernible] question on how you view the importance of seeing a pretty consistent plateauing just to get the maximum weight loss data just in terms of derisking the program, is it important to see the plateauing. Yes. Thanks, Andy. For the plateau, from what we've seen right now, the Phase IIb studies that were performed with semaglutide and tirzepatide had not plateaued prior to the registration studies being initiated. So it's hard to really know how the FDA will judge the assessment of a plateau when the currently approved drugs did not reach that in their Phase IIb studies. So that's one of the things we hope to learn a little bit about in the upcoming Type C meeting.
With the tox coverage, we're finished with the chronic talk. So we don't have a limitation toxicity wise or GLP tox study limitation on duration. So we could dose as long as we'd like. And I think probably 6 months or 9 months would be the 2 most likely candidates for duration of the Phase Ilb. Got it. That's helpful. Since we're talking about the upcoming discussion with the FDA, I'm just curious if you have any lingering questions or action items you'd like to discuss with the agency around midyear? Well, we're not going to disclose the nature of the conversations, but we're interested in study design and duration and going back to your question about understanding the ideal duration prior to Phase III. So those are all key questions. Got it. Okay. And then lastly, the Gannex dispute, obviously, we're expecting NASH data coming up. So curious if there's any sort of procedural things that we should anticipate with the IP dispute there. Yes. So we would expect a ruling on that dispute sometime this quarter, but hard to speculate since it's ongoing litigation. The next question comes from Steve Seedhouse with Raymond James. This is Nick on for Steve. We have a question related to Annabel's on manufacturing. Are you able to specify what materials or factors are most gaining to ramp up commercial supply of 2735. And would this only be a potential issue for the higher doses of the oral formulation? Yes. Thanks. I think it's an issue for all doses. When we look at the currently approved drugs that are difficult to start because of shortages. So I think all doses, it's relevant to today. With respect to overall, what is the -- where the great shortage. I mean, they're -- throughout the supply chain, solvents, whatever is needed for solid-phase synthesis fill and finish materials. So it's a pretty thorough shortfall right now.
But again, we don't think that's going to be a terminal state for this class of compounds. When you look at the market opportunity, that incentive is pretty high to figure out these problems. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Thomas Smith with Leerink Partners. Just ahead of the VOYAGE study readout, can you remind us what your expectations are on the 2 histology endpoints, fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution. And -- can you comment on what data you expect to have available at the top line versus data sets that you expect to receive later or perhaps say, for presentation at a medical meeting? Yes, yes. Thanks, Tom. So on the hurdles, what we've always thought is if we can show a NASH resolution delta in that low to mid-teens rate for treated versus placebo. And for the proportion of patients with a 1-point improvement without worsening of NASH, similarly, sort of low double digits, although with fibrosis, I would be -- I would not be expecting statistical significance just because the numbers are smaller. But those would be the key hurdles that we're looking for with the data set.
With respect to what would be available and when, well, those are the primary components of the data that we'll receive. We will be receiving probably a little later data on paired biopsy reads, what is someone's NASH better, unchanged or worse at the end of the treatment period, that kind of thing since those take a little bit longer to evaluate. Understood. That's helpful. And then just for oral 2735, can you just clarify, do you expect to report data from the ongoing higher dose cohort once that's available or is it possible that you could add some additional higher dose cohorts before we see any incremental data from the study? Probably more of the latter. So we don't just kind of drip data out. We would probably want to report what we have when the study is completed rather than cohort by cohort. The next question comes from Yale Jen with Laidlaw & Co. Brian, you're talking about that 2735 later on will be presented at the medical conferences. Just curious anything in mind at this point that you are thinking? Yes. Thanks, Yale. Last year, we presented the Phase I data at Obesity Week and so that would seem like a good candidate. We haven't submitted anything but that would seem like a good candidate for data presentation. Okay. That's helpful. And a follow-up question here is that for the subcu version, 2 things here. One is the auto-injector, are you guys are already working on that? And secondly is that do you anticipate any kind of bridging PK study in between before you heading to more pivotal studies. Yes. Great question, Yale. We will be using the pen type device. And we would hope that's available prior to initiation of the next clinical study, but we're not going to let that be a gating factor. So if the device is not ready, we would plan to start the study with vial and syringe and then transition on to the auto-injector. But do you anticipate at one point, even whether you start earlier before that or later that you need a bridging study for that? Or you think that PK data could be supportive? Well, no, I don't think we would need a bridging study at this point. That's not what we're contemplating. I mean, if we have to do when we would. But I don't think that's going to be a requirement we would transition people. Congrats on the progress further. The next question comes from Justin Zelin with BTIG. Congrats on the progress. Brian, you just mentioned for the VOYAGE study for fibrosis, you mentioned that there might be a few patients here. Can you just remind us if the study is powered to show a difference in fibrosis in the study? And I have a follow-up. Yes. Thanks, Justin. It wasn't powered on fibrosis. It was powered on NASH resolution rates. And I'm not sure we ever disclosed the power. It's in the 80% range to show approximately a 20% delta on NASH resolution. But it was not designed around fibrosis since that generally requires quite a bit larger end than we have in this study. Understood. That's helpful. And maybe I'll ask because I don't think any others have asked yet. Just expectations on 0214 for X-ALD, what would be a success here in your view for the Phase Ib. Yes. Yes. So we have previously shown with that compound, somewhere in the 20% range on LDL reduction and in the 20% range for ApoB [indiscernible]. So we know it's effective at lipid reduction. And we also looked at very long chain fatty acids in the healthy volunteers. It's kind of tough to look because they're -- they're healthy volunteers, and they don't really have abnormalities and very long chain fatty acids, but we did see some reductions in very long-chain fatty acids in the prior Phase I experience.
So if we can see somewhere in the mid- to high teens on the very long chain fatty acid reduction, that would be pretty interesting, hopefully, more than that, but that would be probably the gating factor to consider further development in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stephanie Diaz for any closing remarks. Thank you again for your participation and continued support of Viking Therapeutics. We look forward to updating you again in the coming months. Have a good afternoon. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Viking's Manager of Investor Relations, Stephanie Diaz. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Hello, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Joining me today is Brian Lian, Viking's President and CEO; and Greg Zante, Viking's CFO. 
Before we begin, I'd like to caution that comments made during this conference call today, July 24, 2024, will contain forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including statements about Viking's expectations regarding its development activities, time lines and milestones. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements made today. I encourage you to review all of the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning these and other matters. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian Lian for his initial comments. Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon to everyone listening in by phone or on the webcast. Today, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter and 6 months ended June 30, 2024, and provide an update on recent progress with our clinical programs and operations.
The first half of 2024 has been an exciting time at Viking. During the first quarter, we announced positive results from the Phase-II VENTURE trial evaluating VK2735 for the treatment of obesity. This trial demonstrated impressive reductions in body weight after 13 weeks of treatment. We also announced the initial results from a Phase I trial evaluating a novel oral formulation of VK2735 in healthy volunteers, which showed encouraging reductions in body weight and excellent tolerability after 28 days of dosing. The positive momentum from these readouts continued into the second quarter with the announcement of the 52-week histology results from our Phase IIb VOYAGE trial, evaluating VK2809 for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis. This study successfully achieved secondary and exploratory endpoints of improvement in NASH resolution rate, fibrosis and the combination of both.
I'll summarize the highlights from these studies later in the call.  During the second quarter, Viking also announced early results from a series of internally developed dual agonist of the amylin and calcitonin receptors at the 84th scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association. These compounds demonstrated body weight reductions, decreased food intake and improved metabolic profile in animal models.
Finally, we ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet with over $900 million in cash providing the resources to aggressively advance each of our pipeline programs. I'll provide further details on our operations and development activities after we review our financial results for the second quarter and 6 months ending June 30. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Zante, Viking's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, Brian. In conjunction with my comments, I'd like to recommend that participants refer to Viking's Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we expect to file later today. I'll now go over our results for the second quarter and 6 months ended June 30, 2024, beginning with results for the quarter. Research and development expenses were $23.8 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $13.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to manufacturing for the company's drug candidates, clinical studies, preclinical studies, salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation. 
General and administrative expenses were $10.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $9.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based compensation and services provided by third-party consultants, partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to legal and patent services. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, Viking reported a net loss of $22.3 million or $0.20 per share compared to a net loss of $19.2 million or $0.19 per share in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in net loss for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2023. 
I'll now go over the results for the 6 months ended June 30, 2024. Our research and development expenses for the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, were $47.9 million compared to $24.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to manufacturing for our drug candidates, clinical studies, preclinical studies, stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits, services provided by third-party consultants and regulatory services. 
Our general and administrative expenses for the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, were $20.3 million compared to $19.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits and services provided by third-party consultants, partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to legal and patent services.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, Viking reported a net loss of $49.6 million or $0.46 per share, compared to a net loss of $38.8 million or $0.44 per share in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in net loss for the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses noted previously, partially offset by increased interest income compared to the same period in 2023. 
Turning to the balance sheet at June 30, 2024, Viking held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $942 million, compared to $362 million as of December 31, 2023. 
This concludes my financial review, and I'll now turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks, Greg. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the first half of 2024 has been an exciting period for the Viking team. In recent months, the company has announced positive results from 3 clinical programs with each readout demonstrating what we believe to be best-in-class results. Further, the company recently announced preclinical data from a new internal program that we expect to become an important addition to the company's pipeline.
I'll first review the status of our lead obesity program, VK2735. This compound is a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, or GIP receptor. A Phase I single and multiple ascending dose study of VK2735 demonstrated the promising safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK 2735 when administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection for up to 4 weeks. In addition, subjects in the study demonstrated up to approximately 8% weight loss from baseline after 28 days with no signs of plateau. 
Last fall, we initiated the Phase II study of BK2735, known as the VENTURE trial. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735 administered subcutaneously once weekly for 13 weeks.  In the first quarter, Viking announced positive top line results from the VENTURE study, which successfully achieved its primary end point and all secondary end points with patients receiving VK2735 demonstrating reductions in body weight at all doses compared with placebo. 
On the primary endpoint, patients receiving VK2735 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight from baseline ranging up to 14.7% and as well as statistically significant reductions in body weight relative to placebo ranging up to 13.1%. Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for all VK2735 doses, starting at week 1 and were maintained throughout the course of the study. Weight loss in all treated cohorts was progressive through 13 weeks and did not show evidence of plateauing. We believe this suggests that further weight loss could be achieved through extended dosing beyond the 13-week treatment period of this study. 
The VENTURE study also showed VK2735 treatment to be safe and well tolerated over the 13-week trial with the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events being characterized as mild or moderate and primarily related to expected GI effects resulting from activation of the GLP-1 axis. Following completion of dosing in the VENTURE study, patients returned to their respective clinical sites at various time points for follow-up assessments, including pharmacokinetic measurements. We believe the resulting PK data merit the development of less frequent dosing regimens. To this end, we expect to explore monthly dosing of VK2735 in a future study.
We believe the flexibility afforded by offering both a weekly and a monthly regimen should provide an attractive option for patients who wish to tailor dosing to their individual lifestyle and preference. Details on trial design will be provided as we get closer to trial initiation. 
In the second quarter, following completion of the VENTURE study, we requested and were granted a Type C meeting with the FDA to help us plan for next steps in the development of VK2735. Based on written feedback from the agency, we intend to advance VK2735 into Phase III development for obesity. As a next step, we plan to schedule an end of Phase II meeting with the agency to review development plans and we currently expect this meeting to take place in the fourth quarter of this year.
In parallel with the development of a subcutaneous formulation of VK2735, we are also developing an oral tablet formulation of this compound. We believe a tablet formulation could represent an attractive treatment option for patients who are hesitant to initiate injection-based therapy or for those seeking to maintain the weight loss they have already achieved. A key advantage in this regard is the potential to transition patients from the subcutaneous formulation to an oral formulation, which utilizes the same molecule. We believe this may reduce the risk of unexpected safety or tolerability challenges and could be an attractive option for both patients and clinicians. 
Last year, Viking initiated the Phase I study to evaluate the tablet formulation of VK2735. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults with a minimum body mass index of 30 kilograms per meter square. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VK2735 administered as a tablet once daily for 28 days. Secondary and exploratory objectives included an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of orally administered VK2735 and as well as various pharmacodynamic measures, including changes in body weight and other metrics.
In the first quarter of this year, we reported the initial data from this study. With respect to safety and tolerability, oral VK2735 was shown to be safe and well tolerated following once-daily dosing for up to 28 days at doses that were titrated up to 40 milligrams. Among subjects receiving VK2735 all treatment-emergent adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity with the majority reported as mild. No clinically meaningful differences were reported for gastrointestinal adverse events among subjects treated with VK2735 compared with placebo. 
In addition to safety and tolerability, and exploratory assessment of change in body weight was conducted. Subjects receiving oral VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in body weight, ranging up to 5.3% from baseline. Placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight reached up to 3.3% from baseline. Weight loss over the 28-day window of this study was progressive at the 20- and 40-milligram dose levels with no plateau observed. 
Based on the promising weight loss signal observed in this study, along with the excellent tolerability profile at doses up to 40 milligrams per day, further dose escalation was pursued. In the second quarter, we filed an IND with the FDA to allow the addition of U.S.-based enrollment in order to facilitate an improved rate of study progression. Following clearance of the IND, we continued dose escalation and have since completed dosing in cohorts of both 60-milligram daily and at 80 milligrams daily. A 100-milligram daily dosing cohort is currently ongoing. 
We recently submitted an abstract describing this study for presentation this fall at Obesity Week. We believe the data generated from this study support evaluation of oral VK2735 in a larger, longer Phase II trial in patients with obesity. To this end, we plan to initiate a 13-week study in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving to our third clinical program, VK2809 for the treatment of MASH or NASH, in the second quarter, we announced positive histology results from the 52-week VOYAGE study of VK2809 in patients with NASH and fibrosis. As a reminder, VK2809 is an orally available small molecule agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor that is selective for liver tissue as well as the beta isoform of the receptor. The Phase IIb VOYAGE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial, designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis. Enrollment included patients with at least 8% liver fat content as measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction as well as F2 and F3 fibrosis. 
The initial data from the VOYAGE study reported last year demonstrated that the study had successfully achieved its primary endpoint with patients receiving VK2809 demonstrating statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 as compared with placebo. The median relative change from baseline in liver fat among patients treated with VK2809 ranged from 38% to 55% after 12 weeks. In addition, up to 85% of patients receiving VK2809 experienced at least a 30% relative reduction in liver fat. 
Efficacy on liver fat was independent of either fibrosis status or the presence of type 2 diabetes. Reduction of liver fat is associated with the greater likelihood of histologic benefit in NASH, suggesting that VK2809 held the potential to provide benefits on histology endpoints assessing NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. 
Last month, Viking announced additional results from the VOYAGE study, demonstrating the successful achievement of the trial's secondary endpoints evaluating histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of treatment. The histology results showed that patients receiving VK2809 experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in NASH resolution rate, fibrosis stage and the combination endpoint of NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. 
On the endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis, VK2809-treated patients demonstrated resolution rates ranging from 63% to 75% compared with 29% for placebo. On the secondary endpoint evaluating the proportion of patients demonstrating at least a 1-stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH, the proportion of VK2809-treated patients demonstrating improvements in fibrosis range from 44% to 57%, compared with 34% for placebo. On the secondary endpoint evaluating the proportion of patients experiencing both the resolution of NASH and at least a 1-stage improvement in fibrosis, the proportion of VK2809-treated patients achieving both measures ranged from 40% to 50%, compared with 20% for placebo. 
Turning to safety and tolerability, VK2809 demonstrated an encouraging profile through 52 weeks of treatment with minimal differences compared with the previously reported results from 12 weeks. The majority, 94% of treatment-related adverse events among patients receiving VK2809 were reported as mild or moderate. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low and balanced among placebo and treatment arms. VK2809 also demonstrated excellent gastrointestinal tolerability through 52 weeks of treatment with similar rates of nausea, diarrhea, stool frequency and vomiting among VK2809-treated patients as compared to placebo. 
We believe these data clearly demonstrate VK2809's best-in-class efficacy on both NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement, along with the potential for cardiovascular benefit through improvement in plasma lipids. We are currently preparing for an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA to discuss the registration path for VK2809 in NASH, and we expect this meeting to occur in the fourth quarter of this year. 
I'll now move to our fourth clinical program, VK0214, for the treatment of the rare neuromuscular disorder called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy or X-ALD. VK0214 is our second thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist in clinical development. Like VK2809, VK0214 is also an orally available small molecule that is selected for the beta isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor. X-ALD is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder that is caused by genetic mutations that disabled function of a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids.  As a result, patients are unable to efficiently metabolize these assets and the accumulation of these compounds is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of X-ALD.
VK0214 is being evaluated in a Phase Ib study enrolling patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN form of X-ALD, which is the most common form of the disorder. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult male patients with AMN.  The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 and administered orally once daily for 28 days. The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids. We recently completed enrollment in this study and expect to announce the top line results later this year. 
I will now briefly summarize our newest program, targeting the amylin receptor for the treatment of obesity. During the second quarter, Viking presented preclinical data at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions from an internally developed dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist program. As the amylin receptor plays an important role in food intake and metabolic control, we believe it may represent an important target for therapeutic intervention in obesity and an attractive opportunity to expand the company's pipeline in this area. 
The company's ADA presentation highlighted the effects of treatment on body weight, food intake and metabolic profile in healthy rats and in diet-induced obese mice. The study results demonstrated that Viking series of dual amylin calcitonin receptor agonist reduced food intake in lean rats in the period from 0 to 72 hours following a single dose. At 72 hours post dose, Viking's compounds resulted in up to 8% body weight reductions compared to vehicle-treated animals. In a diet-induced obese mouse model, treatment with Viking's amylin agonist for 24 days resulted in up to 10% weight loss from baseline.
We believe this mechanism represents an interesting approach to using body weight, both as a single agent or in conjunction with other mechanisms. We plan to move our amylin program into clinical development in 2025. 
In conclusion, the first half of 2024 was a period of intense activity at the company, highlighted by the announcement of successful results from 3 different clinical trials as well as the introduction of a new pipeline program targeting obesity. The VENTURE Phase II study of VK2735 demonstrated up to an approximately 15% reduction in body weight from baseline following 13 weeks of dosing by weekly subcutaneous injection as well as promising safety and tolerability. 
We're currently planning for an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and plan to initiate Phase III development upon completion of that dialogue. The Phase I study of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity. We expect to initiate a Phase II trial for this program later this year. 
And the recent readout from our Phase IIb VOYAGE study of our thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, VK2809, in NASH, demonstrated that up to 75% of VK2809-treated patients achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, up to 57% achieved at least a 1-stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH, and up to 50% achieved both the resolution of NASH and improvement in fibrosis.  We plan to schedule an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA later this year to discuss the development path for VK2809.
With respect to our orphan disease program, VK0214, we recently completed enrollment in a Phase Ib study in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy form of the disease and expect to announce data from this trial later this year. 
Finally, during the second quarter, Viking presented promising preclinical data from a series of new internally developed dual agonist of the amylin and calcitonin receptors at the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association. We believe these compounds have the potential to add value to our pipeline, both as single agents and in combination with other mechanisms. 
Finally, to support Viking's maturing pipeline, the company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet of $942 million, providing the runway needed to execute key milestones for each program.
This concludes our prepared comments for today. Thanks very much for joining us, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joon Lee with Truist Securities. This is Asim on for Joon. Congrats on the quarter. So further in response from the FDA, has the FDA made any commentary on Phase III design or what on the Phase II conversation will center around? And just to make sure I heard correctly, is monthly dosing under consideration for the Phase III? And just one more. Based on what you've seen so far in terms of tolerability for the oral, are you considering additional cohorts beyond 100 milligrams? Thanks for the questions. So the end of Phase II meeting that one of the primary goals of that dialogue was to understand if we were okay to go forward into Phase III. And we feel based on the feedback that we are okay to go forward. As far as trial design and things like that, that would be discussed more in a subsequent meeting and end of Phase II meeting. And as far as the details on what doses and frequencies, we're just not in a position to outline trial design at this point. 
With the oral dosing, we're at 100 milligrams right now. The dose level review team generally meets upon completion of cohorts and makes a recommendation whether or not to proceed. So hard to say if we would proceed, we haven't had completion of this cohort yet. Our next question comes from Steve Seedhouse with Raymond James. Having completed the 60 and 80-milligram oral cohorts in the Phase I and moved to 100 milligrams. I guess the inference there is safety and tolerability were acceptable. But can you just elaborate on that inference what you've seen to 80 milligrams and if you're also seeing a dose response on weight loss through 80 milligrams? Steve, thanks. We're blinded to the data. So hard to comment on weight changes. Tolerability seems to be continuing to be very encouraging, I'll just say that. On that trial, can you clarify just the titration schema of those 60, 80 and 100-milligram cohorts, what's the starting dose? And what are the titration steps there? Yes. No, good question. We typically -- what we've done is we've started each cohort with the highest dose from the prior cohort. So the 40-milligram started at 20 for a week and then went to 40, the 60 started at 40 and then went to 60 and then the 80 started at 60 and then went to 80. That's the typical approach that we've used as we escalate in doses. Okay. And just regarding Phase III since you're now able to move directly into that. I wanted to clarify, do you have enough drug on hand and enough cash to complete the fully complete the Phase III program that you intend to propose to FDA for an obesity indication. Yes. Another great question. Yes. We do have enough supply on hand to meet really all of our planned clinical trials with both the subcu and the orals. So we won't be needing further material. We're always making material, but we won't be needing any further material to complete the planned studies. Our next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Can you please comment on how many Phase III studies you're thinking of running for subcu 2735? And also how much each study might cost? And I guess since you were considering Phase IIb versus Phase III, I guess, what were some of the deciding factors in selecting to go ahead straight to Phase III? Thanks, Jay. Yes, for the clinical path in Phase III, the guidance requires 2 studies and a minimum of 4,500 people in those studies with at least 3,000 exposed to the drug. As far as the specifics of the trials we plan to conduct, I think it's early to disclose those details, but we would be looking to the guidance for the overall design strategy there. I may have forgot your -- the cost. Greg, do you want to talk about it. Yes, Jay. I think with respect to the cost, the Phase III registration program for subcu would be around $300 million, in forming the guidance. Okay. Great. And if I could please sneak in one more question on the oral Phase II study. Since that's expected to be 13 weeks of treatment. Is it fair to assume that a pivotal study could be started following the completion of the oral Phase II study? Good question. It's early to say. We're kind of in the process of designing the Phase II. But I think too early to call that. Our next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel. And the 60 to 80 milligram, you made clear that the safety and tolerability were holding up and then it allows you to move into the 100 milligram. What are the thresholds to stop dosing for the oral? I guess that's my first question.
And the second is related to the Phase III program. Can you talk about some of the exploration that you feel that you need to do versus want to do with both -- with the injectable I guess, as it relates to titration, dose finding and I guess, the administration profile you mentioned there's going to be potential for monthly? So does this all need to be conducted within the Phase III? Or are you doing any side exploratory Phase IIs in conjunction with that? So if you can just clarify that, that would be great. Yes. Thanks, Annabel. With the dose escalation studies with the oral formulation, Normally, the stopping in a Phase I study is driven by adverse events or a plateau on exposures or plateau on some other metrics that you deem important. And so the decision to continue escalating is driven by the dose level review team, and they've not indicated any reason to stop escalation. We do plan to start a Phase II study later this year. So at some point, there needs to be a decision to proceed on to the Phase II. We're not at that stage right now, and it's hard to say when we would get to that stage. But we do plan to start the Phase II later this year.
With respect to the overall Phase III strategy and doses and titration schedules and the cadence of titration, also the cadence of overall dosing, it's just too early to discuss that right now. We're designing the Phase III program right now, but it's -- we have to have the end of Phase II meeting and then outline the path forward from there. Okay. And then I guess if I can ask another question related to the other program that you have. So -- we hear or understand that a lot of potential partners are more interested in next-generation drugs. So when we hear something like that, with the -- you have a dual agonist. So where do you think that fits into the mix of next-generation drugs? And you have a DACRA, how important is it to move that forward as a potential next generation for -- and explore different combinations or explore exactly where it stands for some of the other novel mechanisms in development? So how are you thinking about your novelty versus potential future novelty that you have in your portfolio and where that -- where you stand in the mix? Yes. Thanks, Annabel. And it's always hard to know what defines the next generation. It seems like most of the oral agents today are based on older scaffolds. So what defines next generation is a little murky to us. The backbone here has been a GLP-1 agonist that additional activities added onto, whether it's GIP or glucagon or amylin. I think having a GLP-1/GIP agonist with the potential to add amylin agonism on top of it could represent really best-in-industry efficacy profile. So that would be an attractive area to explore. But we've seen already earlier this year, really good data from the amylin mono-agonist mechanism. So I think that program has a couple of different areas that can be explored as a single agent and in potential combination with other mechanisms. Next question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. Great. Maybe just a follow-up on the partnership discussions, understanding you have open-door policy for the potential partner. But given this new development FDA allowed you to proceed into Phase III directly versus you need to got into the Phase II, do you think that will change the conversation you have been having with the potential partners? Any comments will be helpful. And I have a follow-up. Yes, sure. Thanks, Roger. Yes, no real additional comment to add on partnering discussions. We've been consistent with our receptivity to interests and opportunities and we remain so. In the meantime, we're well capitalized and focused on execution of the development programs and I think, in our view, continued execution, we'll continue to add value to the pipeline. And I think that's all we can say at this point. Yes. Understood. And then another key topic is related to the scalability, particularly for your -- now you have 2 formulations subcu and oral, particularly with oral understanding you have been having discussion with various CDMO. Can you just remind us then what the scale of the investment in terms of the dollar and the time to be able to build the capacity to potentially need commercial demand as an oral peptide also considering your this dosing is going even higher with the good tolerability? Yes. Good question, Roger. I mean we -- in answer to Steve's question, we currently have enough API to get through all of our planned clinical studies with both the subcu and the oral. And we continue to engage with suppliers for both the raw materials and the finished product, and we certainly expect to be able to supply the initial commercial demand at the appropriate time. What the CapEx requirement is, it's probably a better question for the CDMOs or the companies that are building out their own facilities. At this point, our supply will be derived from CDMO sources though. So the CapEx from Viking is limited. Our next question comes from Andy Hsieh with William Blair. So Brian, I'm curious about your strategic positioning for the amylin program. I'm just curious what areas you would like to potentially position this asset? Would it be kind of increasing the magnitude of weight loss in the type 2 diabetes or the preservation of lean body mass? So that's question number 1.
I also like to take your temperature on 2 topics, if you don't mind. One is on the titration. If you look across the landscape, it seems like other companies are exploring more rapid titration with kind of a more aggressive step up? Is that something that is worthwhile exploring for the 2735 program?
And the other topic is really on the monthly dosing that you just mentioned, obviously, with the half-life at the end of the cycle, the drug level would be pretty low. Just curious if you can talk about that delta when you go from the end of the cycle to the next cycle that increase and it's relevance to the AE profile? And I have 2 just really quick check-in questions. Sure, Hsieh. I'll try to remember this, but you may have to repeat it one or more. So with the amylin compound, really interesting mechanism that as a stand-alone, I think has a lot of promise. And in combination, I think, also has a lot of promise. And we think both are worth exploring. So where they would actually position in the overall landscape, it's early to say. But to the extent maybe you could spare GLP-1 use or not and see even further improvements in efficacy. We just don't know yet what that profile will look like. So we'll have to follow where the data lead us.
As far as the question on the different titration approaches, I think our tolerability profile and the PK profile would lend themselves to alternative titration cadences, but we did the 3-week in the VENTURE study, which looked really promising. I think we could probably go to 2 weeks. Certainly, we could use 4 weeks and maybe that would lead to an even further improvement in tolerability, so we're not yet at a position to say one way or another, what's the preferred titration scheme, but I think we could probably go faster.
With respect to the monthly dosing, you're right, as you dose monthly by the end of the month -- now keep in mind the half-life is 180 hours or so. So it's more than 1 week. But by the end of the month, you are at a lower level than you were at the beginning of the month. And as long as you're in a therapeutic range, that next dose might not be expected to result in any tolerability challenges. We won't know until we get into a study using it.
But -- it seems like generally, with these mechanisms, tolerability is observed early. And if you get through those first few weeks, tolerability tends to wane at least with the injectables. And tolerability issues seem to wane. So if you're within the therapeutic plasma levels for 28 days or 30 days, and you're just raising those levels a little bit. It seems like you would reduce the risk of tolerability challenges. But again, hard to say at this point. Yes, that's super helpful. And then, Greg, maybe just one quick one. So for the $300 million cost that you mentioned, does that include the cardiovascular outcomes trial. And then I guess, the monthly dosing that Brian, you're talking about, I'm assuming that you're talking about that in the context of the Phase II study and not a Phase III study. Andy, on the cost side, that's just -- the $300 million is the Phase III registration program, not any outcomes, additional studies for that. Got it. And then with the monthly -- yes, we haven't decided what the next study will look like with the monthly at this point. Next question comes from Mike Ulz with Morgan Stanley. This is Rohit on for Mike. Just in terms of dose escalating for oral VK2735, is there a point where tablet size and available supply become an issue and how high you can dose the drug? Yes. No, it's a good question. Probably, we're not there just yet. But yes, I think those are considerations that need to be taken into account when you dose up with oral. I think moving forward, if the oral was used as a maintenance therapy after target weight was achieved. That likely reduces dramatically the actual requirements of API. And if the dosing were able to be less frequent, that also would dramatically reduce the API demand. So a lot of moving parts there and trying to project the API demands moving forward. Our next question comes from Justin Zelin with BTIG. Congrats on the progress here. Maybe just a decision to move to a monthly dosing regimen including that in the move forward program. Was that based off of the PK/PD data that you've seen thus far? And do you think you'll be able to present that data perhaps at obesity week? Yes. Thanks, Justin. Yes, it is based on the PK profile. The PK profile does suggest that monthly is feasible. We won't know until we actually do a study, but at least what it looks like today as it's feasible. Our next question comes from Thomas Smith with Leerink Partners. Congrats on the progress. So you're going to have multiple Phase III programs ready to start here in the -- pretty much in the near term. I know you've previously talked about having a partner potentially for NASH. Can you just provide an update on how you're thinking about business development and partnerships across obesity and NASH? I guess, your appetite to execute across these programs on your own. Yes. Thanks, Tom. We're capitalized to proceed with all of these programs, fortunately. With the obesity program, we will be moving aggressively into a Phase III development program as soon as possible. With the NASH program, the plan there is to have an end of Phase II meeting and receive the feedback and understand what the current thinking is around registration paths and what we've been saying or what we've been preferring with that program really is to work with the larger party together on a registration path. So that remains the preference for the NASH program. Got it. That makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask one just on sort of the earlier maybe preclinical work you have ongoing in obesity. I mean you're going to move the DACRA program into the clinic next year. It seems like a pretty quick turnaround from preclinical and getting that into the clinic. Can you just talk about some of the other targets that you, I guess, may be interested in, but more about how much preclinical work you have ongoing with respect to some of these targets and how we can think about the potential cadence or the timing for advancing some of these earlier efforts into the clinic? Yes. No, thanks, Tom. We're pretty busy and pretty -- everybody's stretched pretty thin. We do have other programs that we haven't disclosed that I think will, over time, add further value to the pipeline. So it remains a pretty active -- preclinical development remains a pretty active component of the company's activities. But we generally don't disclose targets in that work until we're a little bit closer to the decision to move into the clinic. Our next question comes from Yale Jen with Laidlaw & Company. And congrats on all the progress. I've got 2 questions here. The first one is in terms of the orals 2735 for the obesity week readout. Do we anticipate that will also include the 100 milligrams as well? And would that be -- also use that as a basis for your 13-week study? Then I have a follow-up. Yes. Thanks, Yale. We will present all of the data that we have at the time, and I would expect the 100-milligram cohort to be included. And as far as the Phase II doses, we haven't decided yet, so we need to complete the ongoing cohorts and understand -- get unblinded on the data and understand what the profile looks like before we select those doses. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And the next question here is basically for the end of Phase II meeting, what do you anticipate to bring on the table in terms of the sort of subjects you want to discuss at least at this point? Well, with the target population, normally, that's pretty well defined by the guidance. It's a BMI of at least 30 or at least 27 with 1 -- with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. And then in the second study, it's generally overweight people with type 2 diabetes. So those would be the, broadly speaking, the target populations for the Phase III program. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stephanie Diaz for any closing remarks.
