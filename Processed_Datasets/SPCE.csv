At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Virgin Galactic's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Eric Cerny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Virgin Galactic's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michael. Michael, please go ahead. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. We last spoke with you just 2 months ago. And within that short period of time, we have made significant progress. As you saw yesterday, we are at a defining point for the company. We announced our return to space with our Unity 25 mission planned for late May, and it will build from there. We will be opening access to space, applying scientific researchers and civilian astronauts on a regular basis, beginning with our Galactic 01 flight planned for late June.
Turning to our agenda on Slide 3. I'll start with our commercial space line operations, followed by an update on our future fleet development. Before turning the call over to Doug, who will provide a financial review and commentary on our economic model. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to take your questions. So let's turn to Slide 4, commercial space line operations.
Our team completed ground testing of our mothership in February, including fit checks where we validated modifications to the upgraded launch pylon on VMS Eve. We then conducted several validation flights with VMS Eve in both solo and made configurations. These flights validated enhancements that were made to increase Eve's flight rate capability and overall service life.
Test points included functional checks of the new horizontal stabilizers, upgraded avionics and mechanical systems. On April 26, we successfully completed a glide flight above Spaceport America, taking Unity up to 47,000 feet and releasing the vehicle to glide back to the runway. That flight verified the performance of VSS Unity in the glide phase, including the handling qualities and flight controls of the space ship. The ability to conduct these tests without the need for rocket power further highlights one of the many benefits of our distinctive flight system.
We are very pleased with the way both our ships performed and the flight provided the necessary data to clear the vehicles for our next mission, Unity 25. Unity 25, scheduled for late May, will mark our return to space with 2 pilots and 4 Virgin Galactic mission specialists making a final assessment of the full space flight and customer experience before opening commercial service later this quarter. Our first commercial flight Galactic 01 is planned for late June and will be a scientific research flight with members of the Italian Air Force.
We plan to follow Galactic 01 with both civilian astronaut and research customers flying on regular intervals thereafter. Turning to Slide 5. As we shared in February, our commercial space line has 2 major areas of focus. The first is flying our current ships, VMS Eve and VSS Unity on a recurring basis. We are removing barriers to allow private citizens and scientific researchers unprecedented access to space. The second focus is progressing the development of our future fleet, particularly the Delta class space ships which will be the key driver of revenue growth and profitability as we scale the business over the long term.
On our last call, we shared a high-level overview of the production road map associated with this multiyear fleet development program. With our manufacturing strategy and primary suppliers in place, 2023 is focused on completing designs for the delta space ships, building the required tooling and beginning the parts fabrication for the ships. As we move into 2024, we anticipate parts fabrication will continue, and the assembly phase for the Delta class spaceships will also begin using the subassemblies from our suppliers.
We are working through the interior design, production layout and fit-out phases of our manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, to support the final assembly of the deltas. This facility is expected to be operational in 2024. We can continue to operate on a time line that supports testing in 2025 and advance of the first Delta ship entering commercial service in 2026.
Doug is going to share some of the compelling economics behind the Delta program in his financial review. Given the strong returns we see in the Delta class, investing in this program is our top priority to drive future growth and profitability. At the same time, we recognize that financial markets are more challenged today, and this requires us to maintain optionality, exercise cost discipline and be strategic in how we deploy our capital. As we said before, we have flexibility around the sequencing of our various programs, and Doug will be able to share an example as part of his remarks. And with that, Doug, let's turn the call over to you. Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 6 and our financial results for the first quarter. We generated revenue of $392,000 driven by future astronaut membership fees. Operating expenses were $164 million compared to $92 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in R&D costs tied to engineering work for our future fleet and the enhancement period on the current fleet.
SG&A increased $13 million, primarily driven by nonrecurring legal and severance costs as well as investments in our supply chain and other support organizations as we scale the business. We reported a GAAP net loss of $159 million compared to $93 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher R&D costs. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $140 million in the first quarter compared to negative $77 million in the prior year period.
Moving to Slide 7. Free cash flow was negative $139 million in the first quarter compared to negative $68 million in the same period last year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $874 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the quarter, we raised $32 million in gross proceeds through the issuance of 5.8 million shares as part of our aftermarket or ATM equity offering program. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, while prudently investing in growth initiatives where we see the highest returns. To that end, we've often said that the Delta class will be the driver of revenue growth and profitability for the company.
So let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll share additional detail around our Delta ships that illustrates the strong financial return that we anticipate these ships will bring to the company. We expect very attractive margins from the operation of our 6 seat Delta class vehicles. As we begin to fly our recently ticketed astronauts with a price of $450,000 or more per seat, we expect to generate at least $2.7 million in revenue for each space flight. We have relatively low variable costs of approximately $400,000 for space flight, including the rocket motor for the spaceship, fuel for the mothership and training and hospitality costs for the astronauts.
Following the nonrecurring costs associated with the development of the first Delta ship, we anticipate the cost to produce an incremental Delta ship will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. Assuming a useful life of at least 500 flights per ship, we would estimate the amortized cost of the spaceship to be approximately $100,000 to $120,000 per flight. Extending that analysis, following the nonrecurring development costs associated with the first mothership, if we were to include amortized costs of both the mothership and the Delta spaceship to each passenger flight, we expect to see margins exceeding 75%.
Looking at this another way, the payback period for each incremental delta ship is expected to be approximately 6 months, assuming a weekly flight cadence. With such attractive economics associated with the Delta class, we remain laser-focused on the progression of the program. This is why the production model we are pursuing for our unique spaceflight system is so advantageous as it delivers strong cash flow-through and significant return on investment as we scale the fleet.
As we drive our strategic programs forward, we're also managing our spending in the back half of the year to protect our strong balance sheet. For the second quarter, we forecast free cash flow to be in the range of negative $130 million to negative $140 million. In the third and fourth quarters, we anticipate that our free cash flow will improve and be in the range of negative $120 million to negative $130 million per quarter.
Clearly, the current economic environment demands operational flexibility. We are fortunate to have effective levers that can be employed to manage costs. One of these levers is adjusting the sequence of our various programs. As an example, given the strong performance of our mothership following the modification period, VMS Eve now has the capability to carry the initial Delta ships through their flight test programs.
This increased capacity of Eve enables us to sequence our next-generation mothership to enter service later than originally planned, but still in time for the ramp of the Delta fleet. This is just one example of where we are leveraging our flexibility to manage spending while simultaneously executing on our future growth drivers. We continue to monitor capital market conditions and are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to fulfill our business priorities.
With that, I'll hand the call back to Michael for some closing comments. Thanks, Doug. The excitement continues to build, and we are finally at the cusp of what will be a defining moment for our company, commercial space line operations. We are starting regular flights to space beginning this month. We are building a production system that will deliver Delta ships with excellent economic returns, and we are delivering a best-in-class astronaut experience. We are being vigilant with our cost management, while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on our core programs. We have multiple paths available to us as we progress forward to become a strong, profitable and inspiring company at the vanguard of a new industry.
With that, we'll turn to questions. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Good evening. Just to start, I always appreciate the additional information. But just in terms of the forward-looking free cash flow usage, you have a modest improvement in H2, and you talked about that a little bit. Can you talk about where we see that, whether it's R&D coming down? Is it revenue coming online, you mentioned Eve. Like where will we see it in the financials? And then kind of with that, should we think about H1 free cash flow usage as kind of the peak and maybe H2 kind of the run rate as we go into next year? Thanks, Greg. This is Doug. So what we are seeing in terms of our spending is really in the R&D coming down. The first thing that's happening is we've completed the enhancement period and the investments associated with that around Eve and Unity. So now they're moving into commercial service, so we don't have to be spending so much on that.
And then secondly, we talked about the sequencing of the program spending on the future fleet. So we're focused on the Delta program, which is first and foremost. And then we have this opportunity to shift the timing, the spending on the mothership, the new mothership into the future. So those are some of the things that you see as kind of larger levers that are changing the R&D rather than a revenue impact, as you asked about.
So we did give guidance through the second half of this year. And while we're not giving guidance past that, I think it is reasonable to assume that this is an appropriate level of spending going forward. And we may toggle that up or down as we see opportunities and always focused on the growth engine of the company. And adjusting our spending as appropriate.
There may be some lumps in there. If something comes along like some tooling in a particular quarter. But I think that's a reasonable spending level to assume for the foreseeable future. The key is we're going to keep flexibility, and we have levers that we can continue to exercise up or down as needed. And then just on Delta, I mean you've made, obviously, a lot of amount since the past 2 quarters around the supply chain and production. When you think about that $50 million to $60 million for the recurring part per Delta. How much of that's locked in? And then what production expectation is assumed within that $50 million to $60 million? Sorry, Greg, just for clarity, how much is locked in and how much is production? Could you just clarify the question for me? Happy to answer. Yes. So I mean, you obviously have reached out to the supply chain. What percentage of the cost of building that do you have 100% visibility into. And then obviously, there's some fixed costs. So are you assuming -- I know you said you have capacity for 6 a year? I mean does that assume you get to that 6? Is it 3 just thinking about fixed costs around production. Doug, do you want to take this one? Sure. Yes. So we are quite a way through the planning and estimating process with our suppliers. And in the beginning, it's time and materials and then it moves to a firm fixed price kind of basis. But we're moving through the scoping and scheduling and refining those estimates to the point where we were able to give that out today with the range we were comfortable with based on what we know today.
So we -- it's not tied to any particular production level. The way to think about it, right, is there's the NRE for the first one, the development cost. And then the per ship cost, when we think about the labor and the materials to produce each incremental one is the range we gave you, which is $50 million to $60 million, it isn't in our mind, particularly sensitive to the volume given the range we provided. And just for clarity, the volume we expect, we're building the Phoenix facility to handle 4 to 6 ships on a yearly basis. We'll ramp up on the first year of that. But that gives you a range of volume that we expect to produce in that facility that matches against these numbers. The next question is from the line of Mike Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good afternoon. I wanted to start following up on the peak cash burn. It appears we're at or near the rate -- the peak rate given some of the guidance that you provided. In the past, you talked about the flexibility that you have, and you gave the example here. But as I'm looking at the guidance for the next 3 quarters, does that assume that the investment that you have planned or scheduled and going as we thought would progress 3 months ago? Or have you made any -- have you incorporated any flexibility into that cash burn guidance? The main thing that is in there that changed was the sequencing of the mothership. If you think about the phases of spending on each program, for example, the Delta class, there's an engineering phase and then some tooling investments and then you move into parts fabrication. And by staging these in such a way that the next mothership follows that peak spending on the Delta class program, it allows us to kind of layer in the work on the mothership and maintain roughly that level of spend is what we're modeling today.
So I would say in plus or minus, right, there can be some bumps as I talked about it, but fundamentally, it's maintaining the same growth engine and those key deliverables that we have talked about before, just staggering the spending, so they're not laying on top of each other and creating a peak in 2024, as I indicated last time. This is allowing us to smooth that out by staging one after the other. This is Michael. I'll just kick in with, hey, what enabled us to do that now. So originally, we plan to have Eve our mother shipped it's in service, it is flying Unity to space and bring the next-generation mothership in time to fly the test flight program of the deltas, which would have the mothership showing up as early as 2025. We're quite happy with how Eve came through the modification program. And when you look at the capacity we have with Eve, it can fly far more frequently than Unity can fly.
And so we have enough capacity within our existing mothership to carry us through the delta class test program. So that gave us the opportunity to then sequence the next-generation mothership. We don't need it for the flight test program, we do need it when we're ramping up the delta class fleet. And so what you're seeing here is our taking advantage of that opportunity and just kind of having a more consistent cash burn going through the next couple of years. And then looking longer term on some of the Delta class testing, are there any technological advancements or things you've learned over the past few years from the Unity and Eve testing that could potentially reduce the time and/or the number of flights that you might need for Delta class testing? Or do you expect it to be a similar process as we've seen in the past? It will definitely be a faster, I'd say, much faster test program than what you saw in Unity, which happened over many, many years. So we expect to start that test program in '25 and conclude that test program in '26. So within a year-ish or so. And the main things that we're changing, you may have heard from us in the past, we're keeping the look, the shape, technically the outer mold line of the vehicle, the same. We are changing the composite system and moving with a high temp composite with that.
That gives us the ability to reduce weight in a variety of places, change the way we manage the thermal forces upon the ship. We will make updates into our avionics packages, things like that, and generally take advantage of all the learning that we've had across the flight test program and across the development of Imagine. All those things combined give us confidence to design a ship that will be able to turn on a weekly basis, which is versus Unity, which currently turns on a 1-month basis. So -- but I think the flight test program itself will be constrained within roundly a year. The next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. I wanted to follow up on the $50 million to $60 million cost for the Delta class ship. I think we usually see on the commercial aircraft side is the first aircraft is much more expensive, then the second one is a little bit less and it sort of goes down steeply and then there's a learning curve. So I guess are you expecting a similar learning curve on these? And if so, is that $50 million, $60 million like the cost of ship, too? Or is it like somewhere kind of further down the learning curve? I don't think it will be too far down the learning curve. And I think the range we're giving is generally a good one. We've built -- this isn't a from scratch design, right? We have a flying ship that is fundamentally the same as what we're building here. And so that advances our confidence in all things far more than you would see on kind of a clean sheet new ship that's being built. So what we are planning, though, is to have the tooling done, so that's going to stay the same.
We feel confident that, that keeps the parts generally in the same piece as they're doing. Our primary suppliers for Delta in Bell and Qarbon will be doing -- adding those parts up into major subassemblies. They'll have a bit of up and down with that, but those are sophisticated companies that should be able to dial that in fairly quickly. And then we'll final assemble these in Phoenix. And we plan to open up the Phoenix facility a little early, actually get in there ourselves and, I'll call it, rehearse, if you will, with before the actual subassemblies arrive.
Just so we start to dial in the processes we'll use so that we're a little bit quicker off the gate. But I think there will be a little bit of difference in the time that it takes us to assemble the first couple that will be our flight test vehicles. But then as we start -- and we have time with those flight test vehicles. And then as we start to really move into the production side of that, we do expect to be fairly well dialed in. Okay. That makes sense. I guess -- is there a way to think about sort of what percentage of the parts or the content is kind of common to the prior design? Or how much is that? Well, we could probably come back with a little bit more specifics of that. Generally, the ship is very common, right? It's same outer mold line, same feathering design generally the same aerodynamic handling facility there. What we are doing, as I said, we're changing the composite materials. We're upgrading systems, avionics systems, mechanical systems so that the general ability to fly and maintain and turn the ships are there. So those are the real changes that are going in.
I don't have a, I'll call it, a part count there. What we are doing is when we change the composite system, we do go back in and touch most parts with that, especially, anything Qarbon is getting retouched, but we know what we want the function of the part to be we just have to go through the process with the new material system. The next question is from the line of Oliver Chen from TD Cowen. This is [indiscernible] on for Oliver Chen. Can you discuss some more of that construction progress with the Delta classes manufacturing facility in Phoenix? Are there any other major milestones ahead that you're looking forward to? And sort of what's the time line on that? Sure. You saw a, I'll call it a rendering in our presentation there of that facility. Probably at our next call, we'll bring some just in-progress construction photos just to share as well. But the general timetable in this year, outside of the Phoenix facility is when tools are being built and parts are starting to be fabricated. So we're not using the Phoenix facility this year. We're doing the designs here in Orange County, and partnership with Bell and Qarbon. Bell & Qarbon are building tools and beginning to knock out the parts for those tools.
In 2024, while that parts fabrication is continuing, and being put into subassemblies with Bell and with Qarbon, the Phoenix facility will become operational for us and those subassemblies and parts will begin to arrive in Phoenix, that will start us in 2024. So that's when you'll see that plant actually up and operating.
And then 2025, we'll continue the assembly of the initial vehicle that we used in flight testing. And then we'll actually start testing that. We'll come in, have Eve come in, pick that vehicle up out of Phoenix, we'll probably have a couple of flight test vehicles. We'll pick up out of Phoenix and bring those to Spaceport America where they will go through their ground and flight testing. And then that leads into 2026, where we'll conclude through the testing program and into commercial service with the early ships. Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And then just briefly on ticket sales. Do you plan to issue more tickets for sale? And how have those ticket sales through your travel agent partner? How have those been trending? You're welcome, . So we have generally held our sales process just as you know, we have a 3-plus year backlog already with the 800 or so that we have. We've seen minimal cancellations in that, and we do expect to open sales back up after we start flying. So you've heard us today talk about Galactic 01 will be the start of commercial service, and then we will start with civilian astronauts and then on a recurring basis.
So as we get a few flights under our belt and get momentum there, we will go ahead and when we have a kind of clear eye towards the, I'll call it, the length of time somebody would be on the manifest, then we'll go ahead and open sales back up. But right now, I would expect the Virtuoso group as the group you're talking about, I would expect that they will make their sales pushed following our Galactic 01 and Galactic 02 flights, where we're kind of in the market with momentum, makes it a little easier on their side The next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Thanks for the color on the economics on a flight basis, I was curious, you lay out some of the variable economics. A couple of the items that weren't in here, if you could just touch on insurance on a per-fleet basis, maintenance, the ground operation costs. All 3 of those, I kind of think is variable, maybe that maybe you were thinking the ground operations is more fixed. But can you size those relative to the 400,000 you have what's on side? There's multiple pieces there. This is Doug. So the insurance actually, we did include in that cost. So that's in the $400,000. There's fairly small costs there relative to other components, but that's included. In terms of the ground operations and other fixed costs, what we are outlining for you is something similar to a contribution margin, right, for our -- after the variable cost. So it's contribution towards our fixed costs such as the ground operations, which would be one of our larger costs running the company and maintaining that flight cadence.
We didn't lay that out for you yet in terms of what that cost would be per flight. That's something that as we get more practice and we get more efficient and we scale, we'll have better visibility into. But we have estimates, but that will be what our team will be focused on is that efficiency and getting the economies of scale there. So I think it's a little premature to put that out there, but it's something we'll be focused on to make sure we get the best economics we can out of each flight. And Doug, what about maintenance, I would think that's variable, but maybe you think of it as more fixed. Yes. They put that in the fixed cost as well. So think of it as all the costs associated with our Spaceport. So out there, we have our technical operations team, and we have our space missions teams that support maintenance and the flight crew and all of these things, which are fundamentally fixed. Those are costs that would be there if we have a flight on a day or not. So we looked at it that way, but they are important ones to manage as we go forward. But I did put those in the fixed bucket for this discussion. Okay. And then maybe a high-level one, Michael, the FAA mandate around dual mandates for commercial human spaceflight, I think, still expires in October. What's sort of your expectation as to how that gets renewed, if it doesn't get renewed, what does it mean? And do you anticipate any impact to sort of your operating plan over the next couple of years? Are you talking the learning period, Myles? Yes, the that they have to both ensure safety as well as promote human spaceflight. Right. Just for clarity, you're not talking our operating licenses here. No, not your operating licenses, just FAA... Yes. So I think you know this right. We've partnered with the FAA from the very foundation of this program all the way through having the FAA in our mission control at each step along the way. So the -- we typically, I'd say shorthand, that is the learning period that's gone on with commercial space. Is that to expire, there's a lot of review with government, with the FAA, with industry. We are part of those conversations along the way.
From our standpoint, obviously, it's early in commercial space and of course, we and our other industry partners are continuing to learn. However, wherever the FAA chooses to go and whether the government chooses to go with that, we feel we will be continuing our operation just fine in those regards. So we maintain an active voice, Mike Moses, our President, is Chair on the Safety Committee for ComStack, and I think those are really good dialogues that are going on.
I see it as an important part of evolving commercial space as an industry, but I don't see it in the way -- one way or the other, really, to our business model and how we'll grow. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Maybe I could start off with Unity. I know a lot of questions have been focused on Delta today, and that might be my follow-up question. But on Unity, with Unity 24 test last month, it's very encouraging to see you complete these tests. How have the data from Unity 24 compared to your expectations? And do you anticipate to make any tweaks between now and the Unity 25 test later this month? Thanks for the question, Kristine. And we're all really proud and excited for Unity. And of course, momentum is very high and continues to build in the company for these flights. So the glide flight was an important flight for us, but I call it -- it was a time where we were validating changes that had been made. So we were expecting the flight to perform just as we thought. It did perform as we thought.
And so we made -- it was a very successful flight from us -- for us, validating the data, giving us the data to analyze that came through clean. So we've cleared ourselves to move forward. And what's happening now is we're only 2.5 weeks away or so from the Unity 25 flight. At this point, this is pretty much dialed into the technical operations team moving through their procedures. So nothing we are planning to add at a level of materiality between here and there. Great. That's really helpful color. And then a few follow-up questions on Delta. So when you talked about the recurring expected cost of $50 million to $60 million, at what unit delta do you anticipate to get to that $50 million to $60 million cost? Is this after a full year of production? Is it after a few units? Or are we talking about closer to 2030 when you've had a few years of full production of delta? Thanks, Kristine. This is Doug. Yes, so Michael touched on part of this earlier about the learning curve. And we haven't made dramatic changes to things like the outer mold line, and we're making some refinements how we manufacture and such to the ship, which helps us in terms of not starting with a clean sheet of paper. The other thing I might mention is we're leveraging really the latest digital technologies to partner with our suppliers, so we are using all the same databases, working through all of the practical side of manufacturing so that we streamline that process as much as possible and eliminate surprises.
So again, these are things that help us go much faster than we have in the past. So it shouldn't be too long into that, the manufacturing cycle where we expect to see those types of costs. So we'd be a short ways in. I wouldn't put a specific number on it, but we expect to be much faster than we've been before. And hitting that learning curve benefits much earlier in the cycle than you might otherwise expect. Yes, well before 2030, right? I think the first 2 vehicles out, which will be embedded in our flight test program, I'm sure we'll do learning on those. And then as you shift into more of kind of a run rate effort, that should be a much faster ramp-up in learning. That's really helpful. And in terms of production, with your conversations with suppliers and your partners for Delta as that matures, how are you expecting to manage cost overruns should they arise? Is there a component of the contract that the shared cost or risk sharing partnership with your suppliers? Yes. There is risk sharing built into the contracts. So it works both ways, right, if things are running ahead, that benefits them. If they're running behind, there's penalties for that. So yes, we're in it together with a risk-sharing arrangement. Great. If I could sneak one last one. On Delta, can you provide more color on the nonrecurring engineering costs, annual dollar spend that you anticipate for the program? So we haven't quantified that in its entirety. I think it's just best to think of it in terms of that cash flow that we've talked about. You can see it in our R&D spend. That's going to be a bulk of our R&D going forward and fitting inside that $125 million envelope. But to date, we haven't put the NRE total cost out there. That's something that we're still working through with everybody, but we're comfortable at the spending envelope that we've given you. Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session. With that, we will also conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Please enjoy the rest of your day.","we will open the call for questions following prepared remarks from Michael Colglazier and Doug Ahrens .

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call.
We are thrilled to have launched commercial service and look forward to sharing more about that on today's call.
Turning to our agenda on Slide 3. I'll start today's call by highlighting the activity around our spaceflights during the quarter, and then discuss the progress we are making on our Delta Class ships, before turning the call over to Doug to share insights into our financial performance. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. We returned to space in late May with a spectacular Unity 25 space mission. The Unity 25 crew spent four days in training and preparation at Spaceport America, before boarding VSS Unity and rocketing to space at nearly 3 times the speed of sound. The mission was an incredible success. Not only did it validate the efficacy of our astronaut training program, it also affirmed the absolutely stunning experience Virgin Galactic provides.
Moving to Slide 5. On June 29, we transformed VSS Unity into a suborbital space lab with the launch of our first commercial space mission, Galactic 01. The mission brought members of the National Research Council of Italy and the Italian Air Force to space, along with 13 research payloads. Galactic 01 was an outstanding achievement for our customers, as the Italian astronauts and ground-based crew successfully executed all 13 of their research experiments. Feedback from our Italian partners was extremely positive, and the Italian team members received congratulatory notes from across their country, including from Italian Prime Minister Meloni.
As highlighted on Slide 6, our spaceflight system and flight profile provide researchers with a long list of benefits. Our spaceship cabin is modular and can be adjusted to various needs. Experiments can be structured as autonomous payloads, human-intended research racks, and even as research studies designed to be worn by the crew themselves. Our unique runway take-off and landing enables research payloads to be loaded immediately prior to flight, minimizing time that experiments spend outside of the lab, and providing researchers with expedited access to their data after landing.
Our ability to provide unprecedented access to space for researchers, government agencies, and universities means more opportunities for microgravity research and more expansion of human knowledge. Historically, microgravity research is required accepting the very long lead times and extremely high cost of accessing the International Space Station, or accepting the limited continuous microgravity duration offered by parabolic flights.
We believe our suborbital space lab product hits a sweet spot, and we are pleased to offer researchers and scientists access to several minutes of continuous microgravity that will allow for deeper and more frequent study of microgravity's effects on the human body, fluid dynamics, plant and food growth, and much more. As we now begin to build out this product vertical, we believe the combination of extended time in microgravity, capability for researchers to accompany their experiments in space and relatively favorable cost positioning will enable the attraction of both new and repeat research customers.
On to Slide 7. While Galactic 01 showcased our research product, Galactic 02 is going to set the stage for a new era of suborbital human spaceflight that will dramatically broaden access to space for private individuals. We are just over a week away from the planned launch of this historic flight.
The Galactic 02 crew provides a glimpse into the breadth of access that Virgin Galactic will enable as we scale our fleet and expand our business. Their ages range from 18 to 80; they hail from two of the more than 60 countries already represented within our future astronaut community; they have widely diverse reasons for wanting to travel to space; and their journeys will have widely diverse and positive impacts within their respective communities. Along with our pilots and astronaut instructors, they showcase that commercial space is opening the door for opportunities that are within the aspirations of all humans.
Similar to Galactic 01, we will be live streaming the Galactic 02 mission. The livestream footage, widespread media coverage from these flights, helps to showcase our product and build awareness of the safety of our systems as well as the unique and highly differentiated space experience delivered by Virgin Galactic. I encourage all of you to join us on August 10 for the live stream of this historic mission at virgingalactic.com. As we go forward to flying our customers to space, the majority of our webcast will be for private viewing as we focus our efforts on customers and their guests.
Turning to Slide 8. We are building consumer interest and confidence by operating our commercial space line safely and consistently on a planned monthly cadence. We are executing on that objective. The performance of our spaceflight system over the last two flights has been excellent, and we've been very pleased to see both spaceship Unity and our mothership Eve performed so predictably following their enhancement programs. The enhancement program was successful, and the improved ship performance now enables us to plan our flight dates with reasonable advanced notice to our customers. Regular flight cadence gives us a meaningful database of feedback around both the astronaut experience and overall spaceflight performance. Monthly flights also provide valuable maintenance data with which we can continuously improve our operation.
Moving to Page 9. We continue to progress the development of our Delta Class spaceships, which will drive the revenue growth and profitability of the company as we scale the business. Our production roadmap for the Delta Class remains consistent with what we shared last quarter, with 2023 focused on completing designs for the Delta spaceships, building the required tooling, and beginning fabrication and structural components for the ships. As we move into 2024, we anticipate completing the assembly and equipment installation designs, completing parts fabrication, and initiating the assembly phase at our facility in Phoenix, Arizona, utilizing the sub-assemblies from our suppliers. We continue to operate on a timeline that supports testing in 2025 in advance of the first Delta ship entering commercial service in 2026.
Delta ships have been designed to have a relatively low unit production cost and have material improvement in flight cadence relative to our initial ship VSS Unity. The Delta development process has yielded some excellent enhancements to the ship's architecture, particularly with regard to manufacture-ability and maintainability, and we are tracking well against our primary ship performance criteria.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to convey how incredibly moved our astronauts have been following their flights. Across the board, whether it be research flights or private astronaut missions, Virgin Galactic is delivering an incomparable experience. It is exciting to be flying to space on a regular basis, and we also know that we have many more milestones ahead of us. We continue to make progress on our Delta Class ships as these vehicles are going to enable us to deliver the same incomparable experience to more customers at a faster rate.
With that, Doug, let's turn the call over to you. Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone.
Turning to Slide 10 and our financial results for the second quarter. We generated revenue of approximately $2 million, driven by a commercial spaceflight during the quarter and future astronaut membership fees.
Operating expenses were $141 million, compared to $110 million in the prior-year period. The increase is primarily attributable to a $24 million increase in R&D costs tied to engineering work for our future fleet. SG&A increased $7 million.
We reported a GAAP net loss of $134 million, compared to $111 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher R&D costs.
Adjusted EBITDA was negative $116 million in the second quarter, compared to negative $93 million in the prior-year period.
Free cash flow was in line with our guidance at negative $135 million in the second quarter, compared to negative $91 million in the same period last year.
Moving to Slide 11. At the end of the second quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet totaled $980 million, a sequential increase of $106 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we raised $241 million in gross proceeds as part of our at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering programs.
With the start of commercial service, you will see some changes in the presentation of operating expenses when we report third quarter results in November. Going forward, the customer experience category will be expanded and renamed Spaceline Operations, accounting for costs associated with operating a commercial space line. These items include components of space line technical operations and space line missions and safety, which were previously presented in R&D or SG&A. This re-categorization does not change aggregate operating expenses.
Moving to Slide 12 and our financial outlook. With commercial service, we anticipate a monthly flight cadence beginning in August with two commercial spaceflights in the third quarter and three commercial spaceflights in the fourth quarter. Given the flight cadence and manifest details, we forecast revenue to be approximately $1 million in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Our capital expenditures for the third quarter are expected to be between $10 million and $15 million. The growth in CapEx is driven by the construction of the spaceship assembly facility in Phoenix, as well as technology used in the design process for our Delta Class vehicles. We continue to expect our forecasted free cash flow for each of the third and the fourth quarters of 2023 to be in the range of negative $120 million to $130 million.
With that, I'll hand the call back to Michael for some closing comments. Thanks, Doug.
In closing, the second quarter was an important one for us. We celebrated a critical milestone for the company, having safely and successfully launched commercial service with extremely satisfied customers. We are very excited to be just over a week away from our second commercial spaceflight with Galactic 02 flying the first of approximately 800 customers with reservations. We look forward to delivering this transformational experience on a recurring basis, and we remain on track to scale the business in the future with the delivery of our Delta Class fleet.
Finally, before we end the call today, I want to take a moment to address the passing of our good friend and Chair of the Board Evan Lovell. Evan was a champion for our mission and for the Virgin brand. We continue to keep his family in our thoughts, and will forever be grateful for his leadership and his time with us. Our entire Board has been incredibly helpful, and Ray Mabus, our Lead Independent Director, has seamlessly stepped in as our Interim Chair. Ray brings extensive public sector experience to our Board, having served as U.S. Secretary of the Navy and as the Governor of Mississippi.
With that, we'll turn to questions. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Good evening. Hi, Greg. Maybe just to square the revenue comments, I mean, you did over $2 million in Q2, you talked about $1 million in Q3 and Q4 on two and three flights. What's included in that? I would think they'd be a little bit higher just given the spaceflight activity. Hi, Greg. This is Doug. So, in Q2, we had the Italian flight, which was a research flight, so a little higher revenue. Going forward, for Q3 and Q4, when we look at the manifest details, it depends if it's going to be astronauts or research flight. So, depending on what we do with that mix and the manifest in particularly the fourth quarter, we may see higher revenue. So, if we look at the potential here is probably going to be closer to $1 million in Q3. And if we do research in the fourth quarter, it would be probably over $2 million. And then just on the R&D, you talked about the restatement in Q3, but R&D stepped down about $25 million sequentially, CapEx up a little bit. Is that Q2 R&D kind of the right level ex the restatement going forward just given the rework and re-entry of Eve now being complete? Yes. So you're going to see some things changing on the income statement, because the R&D will start to move over into space line operations. So, things that were historically there will now be in the operations category, which basically represents the cost of operating the space line. So, you'll see our technical operations group go over there, space line missions and safety, this is all the maintenance and ground support and safety and pilots and all of that. So, a lot of movement. But in general, what you're still seeing without that restatement is R&D is continuing at this level for a while because we're in the design phase of the Delta Class and that effort is continuing for the foreseeable future into 2024. So, without that reclass, you'd still see the R&D progressing at these similar levels. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Hi. It's Tom on for Oliver. Just a question on how ticket sales are trending, especially after the most recent flight? And then how you expect that to trend forward? And additionally, if you could just remind us on how long the lower-priced tickets are expected to last relative to the price increase? Hey, Tom, Michael here. So I think you may recall, we have -- I'm sure you'll recall, we have around about 800 people in the queue. And with the kind of monthly cadence off of our first ships, Eve and Unity, and until we get the Delta ships going in '26, that turns into generally a four-year backlog, which is a little longer than we prefer. I think a two- to three-year backlog is the appropriate place for that.
So, you're going to see us, I'd say, use these early flights to add confidence in our system, to add confidence in the safety of human spaceflight on suborbital journeys, to see -- I think you're going to hear excitement, really impressive excitement from the people who fly and as those stories come back. And that combination is purposeful for us, because it will build confidence in this new industry, confidence in what this can be and aspirations and excitement to come.
And so, we're going to let that build a little while, because we have a backlog that's a little longer than we would prefer. And then, as we start to get a little closer in towards our Delta ships ready to come online, we will open up in successive tranches of sales. And I think you'll see that from us that lets us manage the price points at which we release inventory. And we intend -- we will be supply constrained for a little while. So, it also helps us manage and we'll manage the supply as we put that out.
So, we're going to not have sales outside of what we've talked about before. We've continued to allow for research sales to play forward, and we have a small amount of sales available through the Virtuoso travel network. And anybody who kind of wants in will probably go through that channel over the next reasonable period of time. And then as I said, as we get closer to being able to have the Delta fleet scale up, then you'll see us open the door with larger and larger tranches, always keeping a two- to three-year backlog along the way.
The second thing I think you asked was how do I think about the price points. So, of that 800, the first 600 or so of those, the vast majority were in between $200,000 and $250,000, ranging from tickets that were sold all the way back in like 2005 up through when the company went public. We then brought that price point down and opened up a price point of $450,000. And so roughly, you've got another 200 seats in $450,000. The research flights we sell, which are fewer in number and we expect plus or minus around 10% of our volume of the first 1,000, those will be at, on average, $600,000 per seat equivalent. So that kind of gives you a mix of these early flights. We have, effectively, outside of the Virtuoso seats, closed at the $450,000 price point. When we do reopen up sales, we haven't announced pricing for that, but we -- [obviously] (ph) we don't expect that to be less. Great. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up on the research flight demand. Could you just talk a little bit about the drivers of demand for research flights? And then what factors lead you to prioritize research flights relative to ticketed passengers for tourism? Thanks. Hey, I'll take the last part first and then go forward. So, on the whole, we're going to prioritize the vast majority of our inventory to private astronauts. I think that's the broad vision that's always been at the founding of this company and kind of core to our vision of opening space and access to space up for individuals who aspire to do so.
We do believe research is important. We believe research matters to the ongoing growth of human knowledge. We believe that research is a profitable business along the way. And we also believe research appropriately adds, I think, a halo -- a positive halo over the top of commercial spaceflight. And so, for all those reasons, we've allocated generally 100 of our first 1,000 flights, about 10%. And I would like to see that kind of be in that range as we grow.
Now, what are the factors that are here? I mentioned briefly in kind of prepared remarks, there's kind of two ends of the spectrum that are currently available to people who want to do microgravity research. And microgravity research is hugely important as kind of humanity at large starts to work to spend more time in space for all the various reasons that are out there. So, there's a lot of research needs to be done. It has either been an experiment that goes to the space station, which is a long time to get in line, because there's not that much capacity for that. It's very expensive to get it there, and you kind of have one shot to make it work. And that puts a lot of pressure on those experiments to make them very, very robust. And you kind of have one experiment that lasts a long time.
On the other end of the spectrum, you have parabolic flights at the higher end of the current piece, which, on average, give you about 20 seconds of microgravity. It's not as pristine microgravity, as the planes can bounce around in the air a little bit. And you can get repetition on that, but you just don't have enough length of time or sounding rockets are very short or drop towers are very, very short. And so, what we heard coming back from our Italian partners on this and from other researches we've talked to is there's a sweet spot that suborbital space is enabling.
And the flexibility that our spaceship provides is we can either keep or renew seats, add payload racks in or not, allow those to be tended by the researchers or actually flown -- research experiments flown on the astronauts themselves, hits this middle ground that has just never been available before. And so, now we can provide minutes of very clean microgravity time. And that allows not only for a wider range of experiments that could go up, but because our cost price points, especially compared to getting to the space station are so much less. Now researchers can actually plan for a sequence of experiments or repeating experiments with slightly different parameters as they learn more. And usually, those are on the way towards either a larger piece that will go to the space station or eventually the moon, or sometimes they are just -- they can get everything they need through us.
So, those are the parameters that people need. And then the people who buy those are heavily government and government-funded institutions. And so what we're doing now is taking the success of this first flight, putting that into a kit that all those researchers and government agencies can use in their own appropriations discussions, U.S. government and other governments across the globe. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Osterland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. I'm on for Mike Ciarmoli this afternoon. Appreciate you taking the questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, I appreciate the color you've given on pricing, but just kind of following up on that. In this timeframe where you're operating just with Unity, is $0.5 million per flight about what you're expecting on average for civilian flights through 2025? Or are there any considerations related to number of passengers per flight on these first couple of flights that are different from what you'd expect on average as you kind of get into 2024, '25? Sure. So, when we look at the capacity of Unity and the ticket prices that we're flying these days, you would expect to see for the near term, about $600,000 per flight, because there is one seat allocated for an astronaut trainer in the near term. As we move into 2024, we expect to open up that fourth seat. And so then you would see 4 times $200,000 or $800,000 in revenue per flight is what we're projecting. And if we get research seats mixed in there, you would see some uplift from that. Very helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on your fleet development activities, have you experienced any challenges or surprises that you'd call out either in terms of cost, labor or design challenges that might be different from what you expected at the beginning of the year? Or has it mostly just been on track up to this point? No, I haven't seen surprises that are here. Aerospace, in general, is growing and competition for engineering roles in certain types of fields remains healthy. The defense industry has more pressure upon it for everything that's going on with the war in Ukraine. And so, we continue to hold our own, I think, against that, and we have an incredible group of engineers that are delivering against this. So that part, I would say, is just kind of normal for all aerospace that's going on.
And we've had, I think, really pleased relationships with our Delta suppliers here. So, in fact, we've got some of them on site today from both Bell and Qarbon. And that's been really good. We are working with them. It's not new technology, but more state of the industry technology of using -- we'll use the word digital thread, you may hear digital twin. But design and software that allows us to go both for the design phase into the parts of the tooling and manufacturing phase, eventually all the way to maintenance.
And so, ensuring that all of our teams, whether that's ourselves or our partners are facile with that software moving through is something that we put a lot of training into, but again, not surprising. So we are keeping great focus on this. Obviously, each time we talk about the Delta ships, we reiterate this is where the business model depends. This is where we ramp both in cadence and an ability to have a relatively low cost on the variable production unit cost of those ships. And they're super important. So all attention is on it, and we're going to keep it that way. Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Thanks, Peter. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask just your latest thoughts on Imagine. And I think you've described that as kind of option value that you could activate at some point. Now that you've got Unity flying, is that something you could look to exercise at this point? So, Imagine is, as you said, we've kind of kept it as an option for us, and it's going to remain as an option for us. The picture -- Page 9, I think, of the accompanying deck, which was talking about our Delta Class ships. That image is actually an image of Imagine. And we used it because Delta is derived from that base. And there are many things that we've already been able to benefit from in evolving the production model shift from Imagine.
The reasons that we put it kind of off to the side is because the engineers that we have focused on this early design phase for the Delta ships are the same types of engineers that we would have through the testing phase of Imagine, modified sciences, like avionics work, areas like that. And we need those people focused upfront on Delta so that we can get the momentum of Delta into the supply chain that we've built.
At the time when those key engineers have kind of completed that and we're kind of well down the path towards Delta, the production -- the build and production of those Delta ships is pretty quick. And the way in which we are not only going to learn through flight test, but we're also building -- as you would expect to see in a rapid commercial aerospace development program, we are building -- you'll hear the words iron bird or a static test article, we're building systems that are on the ground that can allow us to very rapidly move through design elements. And we're wind tunnel testing the Delta ship actually this month. So a lot of that allows us to have a relatively abbreviated flight test program.
And so, when you hear us we're doing flight testing in '25 and allowing the first Delta ships into commercial in '26, we're kind of at a point where they're almost outpacing Imagine at that point. So, we are going to keep Imagine, all right? It's still here with us, and we have it secured and ready. But it's likely going to be used in service of the Delta program as opposed to, hey, we're going to turn our attention over to Imagine and get that going. And again, that allows us to anchor our technical operations, our flight support and mission control group on one consistent vehicle, which is the Delta ship. And then, as we have multiple of those ships, it's the same engineering base, it's the same maintenance manual, it's the same program, and that will allow for a more efficient operation. Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. I'll leave at that one. Thanks, Matt. Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Hey, guys, good afternoon. Hi, Kristine. You mentioned the ability to flex cash burn by controlling the timing for next-gen motherships. Can you provide any color to your current thinking around the timeline? Yes. So that strategy that we outlined in the last call is still consistent with what we're looking at today, again, because we're pleased with how Eve is performing after the enhancement period we're doing so -- or we did. So that now we see Eve continuing through the Delta flight test program. So, we are benefiting from that. So because of that, we are still anticipating that we will be working on Delta first and getting through some remaining design elements and then moving on to the parts fabrication and rolling off of that over to the next-generation mothership program. So it's a lot of the same engineers, again. So it allows us to stagger the engineering resources and the focus on the company from one program to the next. So that would be in the following year. So, 2024 is when you see the mothership program start to pick up more heavily as we roll off of the initial phases of the Delta program. So that's still consistent with what we were planning before. And then just -- it's Michael, Kristine, just final continual thought on that is that allows us to bring these additional motherships in at this kind of sequence when we're building the volume of our Delta fleet. So that way, right at about the time that Eve will tap out from a capacity standpoint, we would be bringing on new motherships at that point to manage the scale of the fleet. Great. Thanks. And then also after you guys changed your pricing structure to the $450,000 for the passenger flights and then you've got $125,000 in a fully refundable deposit, can you discuss any cancellation requests that you've received so far? And how sticky has been the orders that you guys have received to date? So, we have a limited number of cancellations kind of year-over-year. The largest was not unexpectedly way back in 2014. And we have not seen, I'll call it a, out-of-line uptick in any of that. Where I get the most questions on that particular topic was following the Titan experience, and -- ""hey, did you see any fall-off associated with all the media around that?"" We did not, in fact. And we've heard from many of our future astronauts, they are very clear, especially those who have been with us a long time about everything that goes into the safety of this platform. And they were able to talk that through with themselves and others. And so we've not seen any dropouts due to that either.
You'll see some people drop for -- not often, but sometimes it will be for economics, sometimes it can be for medical reasons or health reasons. And then that's why you've heard us say we keep some house seats there. And so what we're doing is generally replacing those as -- if somebody falls off, we can replace onesies and twosies back on the way. So hopefully, that gives you some color window into those. Yes, great. Thank you for the color. Thanks, guys. You're welcome. Thanks, Kristine. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to start on the cash balance that you're at today. And just as we think about some of the optionality that you have with your common stock offerings, what level of cash in marketable securities are you comfortable with? And do you expect to maintain that position of around $1 billion for the foreseeable future? We're very pleased with the balance sheet right now and the strength there and our ability to have access to the capital markets, it's been great. So yes, we are approximately $1 billion today, and we like where we are. This gives us the flexibility to invest in these programs that we see are going to generate really high returns and gives us a pretty good runway. So we like where we are. And we fully intend to keep our balance sheet strong throughout this phase as we move towards the ramp of the Delta Class. So, we don't have a specific minimum cash balance, but we do intend to keep it strong. And then following up on the Delta Class progression, you had mentioned you're on track with the development process. But wanted to ask a bit more specifically since you previously expected to complete design and tooling and then begin parts fab this year, is that still the near-term expectation? And what has been accomplished to date? Yes. So that is still the expectation. Tooling will sequence before parts. And both of those sequence, of course, before the subassemblies can be created and then sent over to us. And the way we're rolling that a bit in a sequential pattern, we'll have tools completing this year, some parts being built on those tools, tooling probably finishing in early next year, so the tools that are needed later in the process come on and then the parts that are needed later in the process come back in. And all those need to be done because probably second half of the year, we will be bringing those into Phoenix for kind of starting the final assembly process. So that all kind of remains on track and moving as we expected through there.
The -- yes, I think you asked a question what else are we seeing in there. One of the things, I guess, I'd share, I said in on, I'll call it, an executive overview, it wasn't an executive summary. It was a deep day on the design process and report out for where we are in some of the major milestones of Delta and how we've used the Imagine baseline into this fourth-generation spaceship, the Delta Class. I was really pleased with what's come forward there. The key things we're trying to do is not create a ship that looks different. And the ships that will -- we think will perform generally the same as our Imagine ship will perform. It's lighter, carry six people, go higher, all those things.
What's really been validating is the work that has been done to enable us to turn this ship on a weekly basis, we're going to continue to aspire to even improve there, and the work that has been done to confirm the length of time, I think we put 500 approximate flights out for useful life, and we feel very good on those numbers as well. And that weekly turn, that length of time in the flights, that's where the cost of this, on a per flight basis, gets to be really positive compared to other mechanisms of human spaceflight.
So it's been the detail of that design and showcasing how we're going to carry that through, that's been very confidence building for me. I mentioned briefly just a little bit ago, we are putting the right energy into doing this. These are not going to be one-off ships. So, we are developing, you'll hear us use the word, a copper bird. We're actually doing that in our engineering headquarters. It gets located in this week. And that will have us running through all the avionics and avionic systems, electrical systems that we can just cycle and cycle and cycle in advance.
We'll be building an iron bird to test out the mechanical systems that go through there and running and running and running and running those. So, we're not having to wait until we get into flight test or actual use to understand the margins and the maintenance intervals of our parts were going to all the way through. We'll be building a static test article for our ships and being able to take that to a kind of an ultimate limit load to confirm all the maintenance intervals that we're putting in.
So, those things are all very confidence building for me as I watch the diligence with which our engineering and program teams are putting these together. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good evening. Hi, Myles. Hey, Michael, I was hoping you could talk a bit about the engagement plan after Galactic 2.0. And in the frame of reference, I think you mentioned these would start to become more private experiences. And I'm just curious, how do you maintain the visibility that's going to be required to create and sell the experiential side of this while keeping it intimate private, what basically the customer is paying for? Right. We have to do both, of course. So one, I'd say we will definitely find a frequent cadence of our flights that we want to kind of do deep showing of. That's easy around our research flights as we do those pieces, and there's new stories along the way there. And there will be some flights that we will want to do in a full public manner. As you'd expect, a lot, maybe not all, but a lot of our future astronauts are quite excited to tell their own story, but don't necessarily want us to broadcast their personal experience. And so, we'll find the balance. I think you'll always hear us talking about when our flights go, there'll always be recaps, there'll always be footage and video pieces out. There doesn't always need to be kind of a detailed streaming of the interior of the cabin for each group of private astronauts that fly. And what I do think you'll see though is we'll be giving that material to our astronauts. And not all, but I imagine the majority of those will also become very active in bringing those out.
So, we're going to -- I won't even call it finding the balance, this is a both end type of a scenario. We have to, first and foremost, focus on our customers, deliver the experience that they want, deliver the quality and not kind of overly commercialize their personal experience. They've put a lot of energy and effort and aspiration into this, we have to deliver that. And when we do that right, that is the absolute best marketing we will get, because they will become missionary for us. So we're going to get that right.
And I think within that, we can also ensure that we are touting what we do and building confidence in the safety, confidence in the power of the experience and just the general excitement of our company. I think we can do both. So, I don't want to overplay it now, probably I have just by over answering, but we -- I just want to make sure [indiscernible], ""Hey, we may not showcase like the interior of every cabin flight, because it's not appropriate."" Yes. Maybe a different operational question on the Delta Class. At this point, do you have a viewpoint of how many would actually be in service in '27? Is it one or two, or is it the four to six you're thinking about it on an annual basis of capacity out of manufacturing, those four to six could be on the line in '26? Yes. I think the end of '27 is what you're asking, we'll probably be in between there. As you've heard us say, we're building our factory for four to six ships a year. It's logical to start that on the lower side, right, as you start to build up just muscle memory and kind of work any kinks that are in the system out. So, we will probably be less than the full cadence of that, but more than the first couple, we're wanting to get a couple out right away. And because we will be using two ships, Myles, in the flight test program. And so those will roll right into service. We'll have probably a little bit of a break between those two, but not so far that we kind of mess up the line from a supply chain standpoint. And then we'll start moving again on a pace, probably let's get the first four out.
I think the other question that will come with that is what's the turn rate of those ships. As I mentioned just on the question before, feeling very good about our ability to hit a weekly turn from all the analysis we've seen. And we're going to keep pushing on that metric. So nothing else to add today, but that's another one that I think has got some interesting leverage. Okay. And last one on the financials. Is this a point where you can kind of confirm you're past peak cash burn quarterly cadence? I guess, it's implied for the second half, I just don't know if you're able to say that we're past this quarterly cadence we saw in the first half into next year as well. Well, we're only giving guidance for Q3 and Q4. And for the following years, we are going to be making sure that we're able to invest in the fleet because we see these great returns. So that involves the Delta Class and the motherships because we see really great financial returns from those investments. So, we're going to be leaning into that when possible. But if necessary, we can control that pace. And we could slow that spending and keep that level down. But we think the returns are very attractive and shareholders will be supportive of us really trying to build the fleet at the rapid rate. So -- but we've got flexibility. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Myles. This concludes the question-and-answer session as well as today's call. Thank you for joining.

Virgin Galactic successfully achieved several important milestones in the third quarter, which, in combination with some important adjustments we are making in our near-term operating model has set the company on course to define and lead the suborbital space travel industry.We're going to cover a lot of ground today, so I'll open the call with 4 key headlines:First, we have demonstrated that our spaceflight system works on a repeatable basis. As planned, we completed 6 spaceflights in under 6 months with our initial spaceship, VSS Unity. This is an unprecedented achievement in human spaceflight.Second, the virgin Galactic customer experience has been overwhelmingly positive and meaningful, and the value of our experiential product is exceeding our high expectations. The backlog of demand for our experience is robust, and our early customers are Virgin Galactic astronauts, I love it.Third, we expect the advances being built into our Delta class ships will enable each of these new ships to fly up to 8x per month during steady-state operations. This turn time metric is unrivaled in the industry and will enable breakthrough capacity and revenue generation.And fourth, we forecast our quarter end cash and marketable securities position of approximately $1.1 billion, provides sufficient capital to bring our first 2 Delta ships into service and to enable our crossover to positive cash flow in 2026. We look forward to sharing details behind these headlines on today's call.Turning to our agenda on Slide 3. I'll start with an overview of the Virgin Galactic astronaut experience and shared customer insights from our first 6 flights. We'll review progress from our Delta spaceship program and talk more specifically about the expected unit economics of our Delta class ships. We'll then discuss adjustments to our near-term operating model, including restructuring actions announced yesterday, that will redirect resources towards our Delta program as we focus the entire company on realizing the profit potential from these ships. Finally, we'll share financial results for the quarter and discuss the expected spending profile of our Delta program in greater detail. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.Turning to Slide 4. Since our last earnings call, we completed 4 space missions on the monthly cadence that we had planned. Each mission was an incredible success, and we are now graduating customers from our future astronaut community into the Virgin Galactic astronaut community. Our Virgin Galactic astronauts experience their spaceflight in ways that are unique to their background and motivation for traveling to space, 1 point of commonality though, has been that the overall experience is dramatically impacting our customers in an extremely positive way.Moving to Slide 5. The quotes on this page are from some of our astronauts following their spaceflights, and they capture just a sliver of the meaning that our customers have come away with. I'll read just 3 of them on today's call. The first is a quote from a Galactic 02 astronaut. ""This has been the best day of my life, the most sensational day of my life, and it can't get any better than that. It exceeded my wild streams."" The second is from a Galactic 04 astronaut, who said, ""I always knew it was going to be the most extraordinary experience of my life. I always knew that, and people kind of told me it was going to be. But then when it is, and it's on another level to the experience you thought you were going to have and it's very difficult to explain."" And from our youngest astronaut, who shared, ""I was shocked at the things that you feel. You are so much more connected to everything than you would expect to be. You felt like a part of the team, a part of the ship, a part of the Universe, a part of Earth, it was incredible, and I'm still starstruck""Vastly exceeding the expectations of our customers is the best way to convert those customers into ambassadors for our company. Based on initial feedback, we are delivering a truly incomparable experience that our astronauts will carry with them for their lifetimes. We will continue to learn and adjust the overall customer journey, but the early results have been exceeding our very high expectations.Moving to Slide 6. Our focus on the astronaut's journey and the very way in which we bring people to space is paying off and the overall experience. Our training takes place at Spaceport America an incomparable facility built by the State of New Mexico, and the stunning setting has been a hit with astronauts and their guests alike. The 90-minute spaceflight experience, including the climb to release altitude while attached to our mothership, is proving to be an experiential advantage. The smoothness of it all, combined with the raw power of the rocket motor during the boost phase has been a standout feature for our astronauts. The view of the earth and natural habitat of space has literally taken breath away and drawn tears and deep emotions because of its stunning beauty and brilliance, and the fact that we land back on the same runway where we took off with all the friends and family awaiting has made for a completely magical return experience.Our training program is a huge differentiation point. We took the opportunity on our early flights to have our astronaut instructors observe the customer experience from within the cabin to guide adjustments to our ground-based training process. This process was valuable and has been successfully completed. Starting with Galactic 06, we will open up this instructor seat, and all 4 Unity seats will have paying customers. 6 human spaceflights in 6 months with VSS Unity is a tremendous accomplishment that establishes new turn time records for reusable human space light systems. It's important to note that the primary business objectives of Unity's missions are to demonstrate the efficacy of our spaceflight system to build learnings that inform our Delta program and to showcase the incredible emotion, impact and value of Virgin Galactic spaceflight experience. We have done that.These flights have built confidence in our spaceflight system, increased credibility as we consistently deliver on plan and clearly demonstrated the powerful customer benefits of a Virgin Galactic spaceflight. The success of these flights has been accomplished through the collaborative effort of our entire company, and I'd like to call out the incredible work from our teammates who have made this possible.Moving to Slide 7. Virgin Galactic spaceship and mothership both have industry-leading reusability metrics, but our airplane-based mothership has the additional benefit of fast turnaround times. Our primary goal with the Delta program is to also bring that fast turn time capability to our spaceships to unlock a step function increase in capacity.In this regard, the next page, Slide 8, makes it clear why we are so focused on our Delta ships, 2 metrics that will be of importance to our industry; our revenue per flight or RPF, and flights per month or FPM, which is referenced on a per ship basis. Taking a look at the table on Slide 8. Our 4 seats spaceship 2 model, Unity, has a revenue per flight potential of $1.8 million to $2.4 million at our current prices depending upon if it is flying private astronauts, research customers, or a mix. Unity has an average flights per month of around 1, and the product of those 2 metrics leads to modest revenues.As I mentioned earlier Unity's flight objectives are to demonstrate our system, showcase our astronaut experience, and provide learnings for our Delta program. Our 1 flight per month with Unity is a material step above competitive offerings, the total cost to support unities flights surpassed the relatively modest monthly revenues. Delta ships will have 50% more seats than Unity. So using our most recent pricing at $450,000 per seat or $600,000 for research seats, the revenue per flight for a Delta ship is $2.7 million to $3.6 million.With our current expectation of Delta ships turning twice per week in steady state operation, Delta ships would have a flight per month metric 8, which makes the monthly revenue potential of a Delta ship up to 12x that of Unity. As a high temperature carbon-composite space plan, we expect each Delta ship to have a vehicle lifecycle of 500 or more flights. And as we shared previously, we expect each new Delta ship to cost around $50 million to $60 million in steady state production.Our Delta class ships are powerful economic engines. Because of their breakthrough capacity and revenue generation, we are choosing to leapfrog past our third generation ship VSS Imagine and move directly to our fourth generation, the Delta class as the model type basis for our production fleet. VSS Imagine will be used to support ground-based elements of the Delta program and we will not bring that ship into service. Our Delta program continues to track to the key milestones, we've laid out. Tooling builds have already started and our spaceship factory in Phoenix is well underway and will come online in Q2 of 2024. Ground and flight-based testing of Delta class ships is on track to begin in 2025 with revenue service beginning in 2026.The top image on Slide 9 shows progress that is being made on our spaceship factory in Phoenix. Construction has been advancing on schedule, and we expect to begin interior fit-out in April with major assemblies from our primary suppliers, Bell and Qarbon, beginning to arrive midway through 2024. We are making several upfront investments in test infrastructure, and we'll be conducting extensive ground testing of our Delta ships. This is a key factor in accelerating our flight test program and in our ability to verify the durability and longevity of our ships. Build-out and installation of this test infrastructure has begun and build-out will continue into the first half of 2024. We will incur onetime expenses for these important test assets during those periods. The first test asset is known as a Copper Bird systems mock-up. The Copper Bird will allow us to configure and test our avionics, flight controls, and electrical systems.As you can see in the image on the lower left of Slide 9, this effort is already underway at our engineering headquarters in Orange County, California, along with the design and testing of our updated cabin interior, including our new seat design shown here on the lower right. The second test system also located in Southern California is known as an Iron Bird, and it will be verifying and cycle testing our mechanical systems and validating our designs. Each of these test systems as well as a dedicated static test article will enable us to verify the performance of the key elements of our Delta ships that are driving our improved turn times and will reduce the amount of time needed for final assembly, ground test and flight test.Moving to Slide 10. We expect near term uncertainty in capital markets to continue as high interest rates persists and geopolitical unrest expands. In response to this environment, Virgin Galactic has taken several important actions to ensure our existing cash runway is sufficient to reach positive cash flow. As a growth company that is also defining a new industry, Virgin Galactic has been pursuing 2 parallel work streams. Our Spaceline Operations teams have been demonstrating our technology and customer experience with our Unity spaceship, while our Programs and Engineering teams have been developing a production platform that will deliver profitable growth with our Delta program. Both of these areas consumes substantial resources and both have been critical to our company.That said, our company's financial growth is built around our production space ships, the Delta class, and we are shifting all company resources towards the safe, efficient and successful execution of this program. This necessitates 4 changes to our near term operating model:First, we will reduce net spending within our spaceline operations by decreasing the cadence while increasing the revenue per flight of Unity's remaining missions. Galactic 06 is expected to take place in January as planned and we will move to a quarterly fight cadence versus a monthly flight cadence for Unity's remaining space missions. We expect the average revenue per flight for Galactic 06 and Galactic 07 to be in the range of $2 million to $2.5 million, which is approximately 4x greater than the revenue per flight that Unity realized in the third quarter. This increase is driven in part by the additional revenue seat that had previously been occupied by an astronaut instructor and in part due to a customer mix that includes research revenue. Additionally, when we have openings in the flight manifest, we are making those seats available to customers who are interested in participating in an earlier spaceflight at a premium price. These seats as they become available, have been priced closer to $1 million than to our prior price point of $450,000.Second, we will be pausing Unity space spaceflight in mid 2024. So our highly skilled spaceline operations teams in New Mexico can support the final assembly effort of our first Delta ships. This is cost efficient, as it allows us to optimize our total workforce. It also provides our technical operations teams hands-on experience with the Delta ships during the build process, which will be invaluable for maintenance and turn time support and those ships moved to Spaceport America for flight testing revenue service. Flights from Spaceport America are expected to start again in mid 2025 with Delta Flight Test.Third, and as shared on our last call, we have resequenced the timing of our next mothership to coincide with the ramp up of our spaceship fleet. This allows us to better manage the timing of our capital expenditures and it allows our engineering teams to complete the bulk of the Delta work, before pivoting to the next mothership effort. We expect the first of our next 2 motherships to enter service in 2027, which will support the timing of additional spaceships coming off the line in Phoenix. Our existing mothership, Eve, is performing well following its enhancement program, and Eve will carry our first 2 Delta ships during their flight test program and into revenue service in 2026 where it will support meaningful revenue and cash flow positivity.And fourth, as we focus the entire company towards a successful execution of the Delta program, Mike Moses, with his deep expertise from both NASA and Virgin Galactic, will take on the expanded role of President of Virgin Galactic Spaceline. We will be aligning the entirety of our technical engineering and non-customer facing operations team under Mike, with a full company focus on bringing our production fleet into service, crossing over to cash flow-positive operations, and readying our company to scale and continue to lead this exciting industry.With these adjustments to our plans, we project our end of quarter, cash and marketable securities position of nearly $1.1 billion to be sufficient to support the development and entry into service of our first 2 Delta ships and to achieve cash flow positivity in 2026. These adjustments to our near-term operating model have impacts on our flight manifest and on our staffing levels. Regarding manifest impacts, with Unity's fewer seats and low flight cadence, these changes will have minimal impact on total astronaut carried. However a subset of customers who are early in the manifest, will have a longer time extension before their flights. Internally at Virgin Galactic, achieving this plan has required us to make the difficult decision to reduce the size of our teams that support our spaceline operations and our staff areas.Our teammates at Virgin Galactic are talented, purpose-driven and excel in their professions and it is deeply unfortunate to part ways with some of our coworkers and our friends. With the restructuring announced yesterday, along with headcount management efforts that have been taking place across the year, we expect to enter 2024 with approximately 840 full-time employees. By taking these actions now, we ensure Virgin Galactic continues to have access to the resources needed to reach positive cash flow and to deliver on our mission, bringing the wonder of space to our existing customer base and to the generations of customers who will follow.Doug, let's turn the call over to you. Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Page 11 and our financial results. In his opening remarks, Michael provided some important information about the company's operations and the related economics. As a follow-up, I'd like to share some additional context relating to both our near term and long term financial outlook.First, I'll explain the new expense category called spaceline operations and what trends to expect going forward. Second, I'll review the financial results for the third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Third, I will describe the shift has begun towards the building of capital assets, our longer-term projections for overall spending and the expected path to positive free cash flow. And fourth, I'll expand on the attractive future economics we foresee with the expansion of our Delta class fleet.Let's start by taking a closer look at the new expense category, Spaceline Operations, and how that plays into our third quarter results. In our last earnings call in August we previewed the introduction of spaceline operations, which followed the launch of commercial service, an achievement of technological feasibility for our current Spaceline system. In order to understand and interpret what spaceline operations represents. It is important to recognize at Virgin Galactic is somewhat unique as a company that both producers and operates space vehicles. We first built fixed assets such as spaceships and motherships, then we utilize those assets to provide spaceflight services.While we were able to capitalize certain costs for production of vehicles, some production cost cannot be capitalized and must be recognized as an expense. These noncapitalizable production costs reflected in spaceline operations along with the current cost of conducting spaceflights. Note that the presentation of Spaceline operations does not indicate an increase in spending, but rather a remapping of expenses that were previously in R&D or SG&A. I'll share more about our expectations for the Spaceline Operations Expense category following a discussion of our results for the third quarter.Turning to Slide 12. We generated revenue of $1.7 million, driven by commercial spaceflights during the quarter and future astronaut membership fees. Total operating expenses were $116 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period. Spaceline operations expenses were $26 million compared to approximately $1 million in the prior year period with the increase attributable to the updated presentation of expenses. R&D expenses were $45 million compared to $97 million in the prior year period, with the $52 million decrease primarily due to remapping of some expenses to spaceline operations and lower outside vendor costs. SG&A expenses were $42 million compared to $46 million in the prior year period, with the $4 million decrease primarily due to remapping of some expenses just spaceline operations.We reported a GAAP net loss of $105 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by lower operating expenses and a $9 million increase in interest income from returns on our portfolio of marketable securities. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $87 million in the third quarter, compared to negative $129 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by lower operating expenses. Free cash flow was negative $105 million, compared to negative $102 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow came in better than our guidance of negative $120 million to $130 million due to the timing of certain vendor payments.Moving to Slide 13. At the end of the third quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet totaled approximately $1.1 billion, a sequential increase of $108 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we raised $211 million in gross proceeds as part of our aftermarket equity offering program.Moving to Slide 14 and our Financial Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be approximately $3 million, primarily driven by 2 commercial spaceflights; Galactic 04, which occurred in October; and Galactic 05, which occurred last week. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter are projected to be between $25 million and $30 million. We expect to approximately double our capital expenditures over the third quarter, primarily due to the construction of the spaceship assembly facility in Phoenix, and building of tooling for the Delta class spaceships.We expect our forecasted free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 to be in the range of negative $125 million to $135 million to account for both the timing of vendor payments that favorably impacted our third quarter, as well as the increase in capital expenditures, just mentioned. In connection with the restructuring effort that Michael mentioned and which is already underway, we estimate a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $5 million and an annual cost reduction of approximately $25 million relative to our current cost base. This cost reduction will be realized beginning in the first quarter of 2024.Now I'd like to provide some context around our longer-term financial outlook. Let's move to Slide 15. For clarity, it is helpful to first consider our business model, our economic life cycle began with a multiyear research and development phase to create and prove out our initial spaceflight system. We have successfully demonstrated that by conducting regular commercial spaceflights on a monthly cadence with our Unity spaceship, and mothership Eve. We are in the upfront investment phase of our production vehicles, the Delta class spaceships, which are expected to deliver 12x the monthly revenue capacity of the initial spaceflight system.A period of nonrecurring engineering or NRE is followed by a period of upfront capital investment to build the fixed assets such as a factory and tooling that are then available to produce multiple vehicles, namely spaceships, on a continuing basis and at a relatively low recurring cost per vehicle. Each of these vehicles are additional assets and expected to have significant ongoing profit-generating potential based on the performance criteria we have specified.Through 2023 as spending has predominantly gone toward operating expense mostly tied to nonrecurring engineering costs for the development of our spaceflight system. As we achieve certain milestones in the development of the Delta class vehicles in 2024, these engineering costs begin to be capitalized. In addition, we are investing in fixed assets, such as the space-up assembly factory, tooling, sub-assemblies, test assets, and spaceport facilities that will drive future growth. This chart shows how our spending is expected to shift primarily to CapEx in 2024.While this chart is for illustrative purposes, we're not giving specific cash flow guidance for multiple years. You can generally see that the 2-year average spending for 2024 and 2025 will be below that of 2023. Spending is expected to be weighted more to the front end because of our planned CapEx investments in fixed assets that enable future revenue growth. Earlier, we discussed the actions we're taking to reduce our cost structure. Because of the reduced slight cadence our spaceline operations expense is forecasted to decrease in 2024 compared to our current spending level.Other reductions in headcount and streamlining of operating expenses contribute meaningfully to our lower spending footprint going forward. Given the strength of our balance sheet with approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities available, combined with our actions to reduce spending, we have paved the way to positive free cash flow in 2026 with our existing capital.I'd now like to provide more insights about our expected future economics upon the completion of the Delta class spaceships. While cash flow breakeven is 1 milestone along our journey, we clearly intend to capitalize on our unique high-margin product offering to drive top line growth and strong shareholder returns. By 2026, we expect to be entering the cash-positive growth phase, as shown on the chart on Page 15. We mentioned on a previous call, that we project the contribution margin from our spaceflight to exceed 75%. Given this margin profile, we expect that we will cross over to positive free cash flow in 2026, when we have 2 Delta ships in service. At this point, cash inflows from spaceflights are projected to exceed our overall cost base.Importantly, by 2026, we anticipate we will have completed the upfront investments in manufacturing capacity to produce incremental Delta class spaceships at a cost of $50 million to $60 million each. Given the expected flight rate and revenue capacity of these ships, we expect a payback period of less than 6 months for each new vehicle that we added to our fleet. Additional motherships will also be required to accommodate the expanded fleet of spaceships. Given these compelling economics, we are singularly focused on the delivery of Delta class spaceships.As mentioned earlier, our $1.1 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, is expected to be sufficient to achieve positive free cash flow. While not required in the near term, we intend to utilize the approximately $113 million left on the current at-the-market equity offering, which would support further investment in revenue generating assets like additional motherships, additional Delta class ships or to further strengthen our balance sheet. To summarize, with a focus on cost management, we are mitigating the risk associated with accessing capital markets in order to meet our longer-term objectives. We project we have sufficient capital to build the revenue-generating assets necessary to achieve positive free cash flow.With that, I'll hand the call back to Michael for some closing comments. Thanks, Doug. To recap the key items from today's call, our spaceflight system works on a repeatable basis, and the astronaut experience is exceeding our very high expectations. With each new Delta ship delivering steady-state revenue capacity of up to 12x greater than VSS Unity, we expect to cross into cash flow positivity in 2026 as we bring our first 2 Delta ships into service.Our end-of-quarter cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.1 billion is expected to be sufficient to bring these first 2 Delta ships into service as we tightly manage and prioritize our resources against the Delta program while reducing expenditures associated with flying VSS Unity. All of these factors support our business model, which is highly profitable and cash generative at steady-state. While the upfront capital costs are meaningful, ongoing CapEx needs for each spaceport are relatively modest given the long lives and high capacity of our ships. Variable costs are relatively low, in relation to our ticket prices and incremental spending to expand our fleet is expected to bring high operating leverage, high double digit contribution margins, and excellent return on investment.I'd like to thank our Virgin Galactic customers, shareholders, and fans for their support as we work to ensure our company's future for the long term. And I'd like to sincerely thank our teammates for the incredible work they have been delivering, while also recognizing the loss that will be felt across the company as we part ways with some of our friends and coworkers. We are now, stepping forward and placing all focus on safely, efficiently, and successfully executing the Delta program.With that, we'll turn to questions. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. This is Eric Yan on for Matt. Could you discuss more details around that Delta works you've done this year so far? And if there are any updates to the plans or milestones you laid out for the next couple of years? Sure, Eric. I think, as we shared in the prepared remarks, we've been executing Delta on our plan, on our schedule. This year is primarily about adapting the designs from all the learnings that we've done in building out our first initial spaceflight system. In particular transitioning those designs to a different carbon-composite system is a big part of that, that has a lot of benefits into the process. That design process and taking advantage of the things that we've learned from flying Unity on a monthly basis have led us build in and confirm the much improved turn times that we're going to see from the Delta shifts along the way.We've also begun working through our test asset systems, we clearly are designing for this churn rate, we're also building the test assets to verify them. You heard us referencing a Copper Bird and an Iron Bird, those systems have started up. We've been working closely with our partners, our key partners that will be building these ships with us, in particular Bell from Bell Textron, and Qarbon, they tightly interwoven with our efforts and using the same software platform along the way. And the tooling that those companies are building that will then do the parts has already begun, initial parts are coming off those tools, but the majority of parts and fabrication will happen in 2024, in line as we bring our spaceship factory in Phoenix done.If you see the image of the spaceship factory, I think it's Page 9 in the attachment, the core and shell that's all done, we're going to be starting to do the interior build out of the factory in the first quarter of next year, actually probably end of this year and then we plan to occupy that somewhere around April so that we can then put in our own systems to begin the final assembly of the ships. So that's all tracking as previously shared and that puts us on the path to our flight testing in 2025, and putting these into revenue service in '26 Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. Also wanted to ask if you have a more specific timing on the Delta launch now? Is it more like the first half or later in the year? Nothing more specific for today, but I will say you're going to see them flying in 2025 as we do our flight testing. Flight test will include, they'll start with what we call captive carry flights, then they'll move to what we call glide flight, where we're releasing without the power of rockets, and then we'll start to power the flights up towards space. So you'll be seeing all that happening in 2025. Your next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Just to start with one clarification question, I mean you talked about pausing Unity flights in mid 2024 and I think you mentioned Galactic 06 and 07, is 07 going to be the last Unity flight? And is there any commercial flight activity between mid 2024 and the introduction of Delta into service in 2026? Yes, just kind of more color on what we're doing. Obviously, we've had incredible success line Unity and as we are sharing the business reasons for flying Unity are to demonstrate what this industry is about, both the safety, how the ships work, the fact that we can repeat them. And importantly, getting a chance to showcase the customer experience. Because unlike whether you are a new electric vehicle startup or something similar, people are familiar with the business model and human space flight is something that private citizens have really never had the chance to do. So Unity is demonstrating all that, but it is very resource consumptive as we do it. So the big move, we're making here is pivoting the resources that are -- have been being put into the Unity flights and redirecting them over to get the Delta ships done with the cash we have on hand, and you take that kind of market risk off the table.So as we're doing that, we will continue to fly it, and we're moving to quarterly because it allows us to reduce cost as we do that and we know we'll go on -- January is when we're doing Galactic 06 and we'll do Galactic 07 probably in the earlier side of the second quarter. And then whether we do Galactic 08 with Unity before we move our team or not is really around the specific timing of when our very skilled teams that are in New Mexico, both technical operations and engineers. We want them to be a part of the build process of our Delta ships, it's better from a spending standpoint. So we aren't ramping up as many incremental folks along the way. And it really the importance as it allows our teams that will maintain these ships to have the hands on experience of building them and that will help us more quickly ramp up to rate as we bring them into service.So whether that starts, I'd say at the tail-end or the beginning of the third quarter or the tail end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter or a little later will depend upon whether we fly Galactic 08 with Unity or not. So we're not going to make that call today, and we're going to let the Delta program and need for those team members to drive that. And then we will take a pause with Unity whether it's after 07 or after 08 as we put our attention on building these Delta ships, because that's where we will drive the economic value of the company. That makes sense. And then the 8x per month on Delta, I think previously maybe you talked about weekly flights if I remember correctly. What's kind of changed there or got you comfortable with that higher expected flight cadence? Yes. Previously, we've been talking weekly. My direction internally to our engineers really will be weekly, we should be able to turn these on a bi -- twice a week basis. But the team had work to do on that. And so, the first piece that's informed that is just the progression of our designs. And specifically designs that are enabling us to do less between each flight.Now, the Unity flights have been really important in that as we've gone through the 6 and 6 months and built that operating cadence, it's very dialed in. Our technical operations teams are pros and they know exactly what they're going to be doing between those flights. And while that work happens to turn Unity, that also shows our engineers and design teams exactly the things that we would like to engineer out of the Delta systems, so that we don't have to put that work in between flights, because we built the ships in a way that it doesn't require. That work has been kind of validated on the design side, as we've learned the specificity of maintenance on the Unity flights. So that's been super, super helpful.And then, you heard us talking about the test articles that we're putting in here. We're not going to wait all the way until flight test to validate that. We're going to be validating these designs with our Copper Bird and Iron Bird in our static test article systems along the way. I'm really proud of what the engineers have been able to do and what our technical operations teams have delivered, it's that collaborative effort that lets us speak with confidence on a 2x a week or kind of 8x a month on average flights for Deltas when we get to steady-state. And then just sneaking one last one in. I mean 8x12, 96 or so flights a year for each Delta. How are you thinking about capacity for each spaceport? I mean I think, you've in the past you maybe talked about 400, just thinking about how many spaceships to fill up the first spaceport and kind of start planning for a second? Yes. You're bringing up a great point. With the turn time objectives on Delta, now something we've got confidence in, this has great benefit in reducing the amount of CapEx needed for every spaceport, right? So with each spaceship being able to do round about 100 flights a year on a steady-state basis, you probably need 4 to 5, right? And that's what we would put in at a spaceport.And so, we'll probably start with 4 and just see how we're doing with those and do we need to add a fifth, as kind of 1 that's always kind of available on the side. We will take I'm sure, a month out of that year. I'm giving you monthly rates on average. We'll take a month of the year as a more intensive overhaul, like an annual overhaul, like you would see in other aerospace type vehicles. But the average of the year will be 8x a month, 96-ish a year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective on that. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. I was hoping to pick up where that left off maybe. As you get into 2026 and you're sort of going to this very, very high OPTEMPO. How quickly have you assumed getting to that OPTEMPO in the cash flow breakeven analysis? We're giving ourselves in 2026 time to sort new ships out. Now we have gone through the whole flight test and ground test and with the extensive ground test assets we've talked about. In this type of work, in our internal modeling, we're giving ourselves half a year, a year to ramp that up. I would note the skill of our technical operations teams. We've given ourselves several flights before we were kind of sure if we'd hit a monthly cadence on Unity, and we hit a monthly cadence pretty much right out of the gate. So I'm very proud and impressed with that team, and they'll be moving that as quickly as we can, but we think it's prudent to be conservative at this point. Okay. And obviously, this is not -- the company has not been one to run the business without cash on hand, so I just want to make sure I understand the $1.1 billion is what you require to get to cash flow positivity. Is that without thinking about just a normal level of cash on hand? Or is $1.1 million basically the CapEx and operating costs to get from here to there, is another way to ask it? Yes. This is Doug. Yes, sufficient to get there. And we mentioned, we would likely at some point, tap into the ATM, what's the remaining of $100 million, we don't need to in any near term timeframe. So we haven't put like a minimum cash balance out there, but we foresee that the $1.1 billion is sufficient to get through to cash flow positivity by 2026. One thing, Myles, I'd probably add is context to that, we often will look to say how much of that time runway do you want to have on hand. As we get out into 2025 and move into 2026, the overall cost footprint of the company is also much less than it's been. At this point, we are through all sorts of things. We're through all the upfront engineering, the nonrecurring engineering. We're through all the upfront tooling and infrastructure test assets go in. We're in through all the infrastructure of the factory. We've got the supply chain built out and going. And so all of those costs are behind us at that point in time and we're at a lighter footprint. So the need for cash on hand is less than you may have seen from us in the past. And just one other one. The mothership you said, the second one, you're planning enters in 2027. I think, the mothership is more restrictive in terms of how many flights you can actually achieve. Can you remind us of what the status is on that, because obviously, you've made pretty good progress on the Delta? What's the current status of limitations of flights on the mothership? So our first mothership, Eve, as we fly with Eve and Unity, Unity is the bottleneck in the system. Eve -- we'll be able to turn Eve as an airplane around quickly, and we feel Eve is able to do 2 or more flights a week on spaceflights and Unity can't keep up with that. So generally [ if you look into ], we think there's probably some opportunity to go above 2 with Eve. But that means Eve will be the kind of constraining factor as we bring the first Deltas on board. So that also balances out as we're learning to turn the Deltas on that twice a week cadence by having 2 of them out, they'll probably balance out with Eve alone. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. I wanted to start just asking now that we're in commercial service for some time now, you've had several successful flights. I wanted to ask on how Unity has really influenced the Delta class production and design of that fleet, and how are you thinking about Delta class differently versus maybe 3 or 6 months ago in terms of flight cadence or technical capabilities. You have the 8x a month flight right now, but anything else that's different than what we had initially expected? Sure. The flights have been fantastic. I've had a chance to talk to the majority of the astronauts who have flown. It's very, very meaningful. We put just a few of the quotes in here today. And that's been very rewarding to the entire company. But business wise, it's super meaningful. I've never contemplated an experience that is having the value that this is having for people and I think that will bode incredibly well for us as we go forward. So Unity has been delivering that. There are a lot of things on Unity that are like, this is fantastic, and it will carry forward.We love the design of our cabin. We love the way the cabin interior generally is laid out. I would love the mirrored element in the back. We love the way we have the windows scattered around the sides and the ceiling kind of becomes a glass bottom boat as we flip the ship outside down. The collection of all those and being able to see almost kind of like through, the French doors looking out on able to use your peripheral vision as you're above the planet and see the vast expanse of space. All that in Unity is amazing and will be carried forward into the Delta ships.Now Unity has things that we want to change, right? It is heavier than the Delta ships will be. And so Deltas, of course, will come out with 6 seats, so you're adding 50% to the capacity along the way. We're changing the system, the composite system of Delta. And that's really what's driving the majority of the work on the Engineering side as we update the parts elements for that. So then, as you kind of pivot to what is really different in Delta than where we've been before. From our Engineer standpoint, not much is different than where they are before. They're just confirming for me what I'd ask them to be able to deliver is, we should be able to turn these ships on a twice a week basis. And as we've advanced our design, that charge kind of extra credit charge they had for me, they have been delivering against. So, that's very compelling and that's why we're feeling comfortable sharing that with you here today.There are smaller things that I think we're learning around the flight. But the biggest things that we've picked, I'd say, of value on this type of call is by understanding what it takes to turn Unity on a month by month basis, we know that very specifically. We can target those things specifically in our design and verify it and test, so that we don't need to do all those things flight by flight, and that's how we're going to turn this so much more quickly. And then, I wanted to ask on research flights. Would you look to increase your mix in terms of more research versus private astronaut flights before you get to free cash flow positive just given the higher revenue per flight? Or are you still targeting that 10% research number? Yes. I think, the mix is going to be important. It's incredibly -- for our future, we have to be commercially -- in a commercially reasonable cadence with our early flights. And while we have, I'd say the long term is 10%. I've been very pleased listening to our researchers; both the Italians, Alan Stern and Kellie Gerardi, have been very powerfully speaking about the benefits of this, and the cost benefit of this for research. So I think we're going to lean into that.One of the things you're seeing in the revenue per flight we kind of pointed out for Galactic 06 and Galactic 07, it's meaningfully higher than what we've seen in the early flights, and that is leaning in, has the 4 seat of course, leaning in heavily to the research mix also has a place where we've had -- if seats have become available in the manifest, we are offering those up kind of a market rate. And that market rate, as I mentioned, has been closer to $1 million on a seat versus our kind of based pricing that we'd had last at $450,000.And so, all those things kind of combine into the mix of a revenue per flight. When we come into Deltas, we clearly want to be moving through our existing customers. They've been very patient. We also have to use commercially reasonable efforts to make sure we've got the revenue coming in to maintain a cash positive and a profitable position, so we'll work with the mix to balance all that out. Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Michael and Doug, there's a lot of very helpful information on the Delta class contribution margin as well as cost. On the 75% contribution margin, what would you articulate as some of the major sensitivities there in terms of upside or downside potential?And then Michael, as you continue to enhance the customer experience, it sounded like there's a lot of great personalization as well. What are your thoughts in terms of retaining the customers that experience the flight? And any earlier thoughts on customer lifetime value as you think ahead and continue to innovate commercially? Oliver, this is Doug. I'll take the first question. So, regarding the contribution margin, we have a good line of sight into the cost structure, because we are already flying, right? We know how much it costs to purchase or build the items that get consumed in the flight. So, the cost part of that is something we can see and we'll continue to drive efficiencies there over time. That has things in it like the rocket motor and the fuel and that sort of stuff -- things.The more variable item is the revenue per flight. And Michael talked about some of the variation there that can occur depending on the mix of the manifest -- and the -- we've got the standard astronaut ticket pricing or we have some research mixed in there or any other variety. So, I'd say there's some upside in that more than downside, because when we gave you that 75% that was using a $450,000 per ticket price. So, we've indicated today that there's upside there based on what we're seeing today and the flights that are coming. So, I'd say more upside than downside in that metric. And thanks for the notes, Oliver, we have tried to bring forward good information for everyone today. You talked about what we think we've been learning from the experience talking about retaining people, and then lifetime value and future opportunities, so I'll try to hit those. It's hard to describe how powerful this experience is, and the customers -- the future astronauts who are now graduating to our astronaut community, they're just bode over and so happy and so pleased, and it has been a long way, it has been so worth it. And that experience is going to help in kind of retaining of others as they share that, of course. But as I kind of move into like the value of that group, some of those people, not all -- but some of those people will themselves want to repeat. They want to repeat at Spaceport America or they'll want to repeat as we move to other spaceports.The other thing, I think, second, in value is all of their direct friends that are here. So, what we've learned in these last 6 spaceflights is the event and the moment that is happening around these spaceflights. So, currently, these are just kind of opened up to the friends and family of our astronauts who are flying and it is happening. It's emotional, it's meaningful. It's fun. There's -- of course, there's celebration and ceremony that goes with that. And so, there's some, I'll call it, ancillary revenue opportunity just around that. That probably gets bigger as we open up the spaceports to more have viewing because it is an event, and we keep hoping to get people out to witness this. And I hope you have a chance to come do this. It is just super meaningful to even watch.But then [ not ] only the friends coming to watch, that's the best chance we have to convert somebody, as bringing friends to watch and like your friend or your family member goes and you see what this is about in person, it is very compelling to then want to move those people forward. And then, the next piece of that is, when you've had a meaningful experience at this level of depth and emotion is much easier to become missionary and a passionate ambassador for our company going forward. And that's where you really get the multiplicative value to us. That's where you get lifetime value of an individual customer, but also through them bringing in new people into our community.So those are a bit, I'll call it, the direct side. As we graduate people into the astronaut community, we absolutely are going to look how to curate that for additional value to those, now Virgin Galactic astronauts, but also, of course, driving value to the company. So we're just starting to build that community up, but I have a lot of high interest and engagement of what we can do with a very kind of passionate and deep allegiance to the company group of people like that. Okay. That's really helpful and innovative. Last question, the spaceship factory is on track to open in mid 2024. I mean in the past, there were supply chain disruptions, of course, and timing and also the cost and time and money. What's ahead with that in terms of what you're monitoring? And is that enough cushion in terms of what you see in the current environment with availability and the flexible arrangements you're using as well? So we've got a team on the program management side of this, I'll call it more so than the engineers per se and our supply chain team, these groups are pros. And the big thing that's going on now, of course, are scanning out the long lead items and there's a little bit of whackable with that, but we whack down things when we see those things pop up. And by having our Delta design be a derivative design, not a brand-new thing, it's a derivative design of the work that we've done in the past, we know what those long lead items are. And so, we've got the time to be out searching and adapting as we need to.We're working with really seasoned partners in Bell and Qarbon, they've been incredibly responsive, we've started to bring some of their team members and leaders out to see our spaceflights. I think it's really important that those teams feel part of our team and feel part of the emotion and the huge value of doing this, so that helps us build kind of cultural momentum there as well and it's a collective effort. So I -- this is an aerospace project, and there's always things that are popping up, but we've got the right focus and the right team and the right buffers built into our plans and schedules that we feel good on them. And we're going to continue to manage day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month on that. There are no further questions at this time. This will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining.

Please go ahead. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was incredible for Virgin Galactic, as years of R&D and flight test culminated in launching our Commercial Spaceline and successfully flying back-to-back monthly space flights, each delivering an exceptional experience for our customers. Importantly, 2023 proved that each time we fly to space, we change lives for the better, and I'm incredibly proud of and thankful to our Virgin Galactic team for this successful year.Since our inception, the vision for our company has been clear and consistent to make space more accessible to people around the world, and to do it in a way that's transformative and unforgettable. That vision, that dream behind Virgin Galactic came into sharp focus as we repeatedly flew spaceship Unity in 2023. Now, in 2024, we're poised for even more meaningful accomplishments as we build the fleet of spaceships that will turn the dream into reality and long term success.It's a new day for Virgin Galactic. We've entered Phase 2 of our company's journey, having grown beyond our R&D and prototype roots into an engineering, manufacturing and astronaut-driven consumer space company with an industry-defining product and customer experience. At the top of the call, I'd like to share that our Delta class spaceships remain on track to begin ground and flight testing next year, and commercial service in 2026, and our balance sheet continues to be strong with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at just under $1 billion.Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. I will start with a recap and overview of 2023 covering our launch of commercial operations, the incomparable life experience we are delivering to our customers; and related to that experience, the strong value and pricing opportunities we are seeing. I'll then revisit our strategy to scale the business and drive long term growth. Because our Delta class spaceships play a pivotal role in our future, I've asked Mike Moses, President of Virgin Galactic Spaceline, to join today's call and dive deeper into how these next generation vehicles are being built and how they will accelerate value creation for the company. Finally, Doug will share financial results for the year and the fourth quarter, thoughts on the size of the commercial space travel market and our growth model as we build out our Spaceport operations. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. With that, let's get started on Slide 4.We officially commenced commercial operations last year with great success, proving that we can execute as a commercial spaceline flying safe, regular and repeatable missions. We've created a customer experience that sets the industry standard for years to come. The comments from our newly minted astronauts have been overwhelmingly positive. To hear them describe it, the customer journey delivered by Virgin Galactic from preflight activities and immersive training to the spaceflight itself is perhaps the most meaningful experience of their lives.We're not only taking our customers to space and back, our customers tell us it's an incomparable life moment, and we're seeing what's called the overview effect in action, where the experience of seeing the Earth from Space literally changes you. It's a thrilling and overwhelming sensory experience, to be sure, giving everyone who does it the adventure of a lifetime, but it's also the visceral realization of the vastness and the brilliance of the Earth and the enormity of the human endeavor that brought them to this point.This is a life journey, and it matters like nothing else people have experienced. Because we take off and land from the same spaceport runway, our astronauts can have their family and their friends share in this journey, and that is just wonderful. They watch their loved ones rocket into space, see them floating in awe above the planet, and then cheer as they gracefully glide back down to the spaceport. The reunions and the hugs are deeply emotional, because we thoughtfully integrate family members and friends into the scheduled activities and overall experience, the days at Spaceport America become a shared experience that is completely unique and deeply meaningful for everyone involved.On Slide 5. For our last flight, GALACTIC 6, we hosted our largest crowd of friends and family since launching commercial service, and the energy was undeniable. We host this group for the benefit of our customers, but this service also enables invaluable sharing and testimonials via word of mouth, which will be of great value to the company when we reopen sales ahead of the Delta ship's arrival. In addition, many of our flown astronauts have become ambassadors for our product, which will draw more people to the adventure and discovery associated with our spaceflight experience. Our astronaut testimonials are very moving, and I encourage you to go listen to our more recent ones from GALACTIC 6 on our social channels.Since May of 2023, we brought 24 people to Space, bringing Virgin Galactic's current total to 32 astronauts. This is almost 5% of human history's total number of astronauts, and we will surpass the 5% mark with our next mission GALACTIC 7 later this year. All this was done with our first prototype ship, and these numbers will be dwarfed as we scale up the Delta class fleet.Everything I just discussed, how we deliver successful flights, along with the superlative customer experience has tangibly demonstrated the appeal and the value of being a Virgin Galactic astronaut. And our experience with actual customers has reaffirmed the company's strong market opportunity. As a practical example of this market opportunity, we have sold recent openings in our manifest at a market rate that is substantially above our historical pricing. Our next spaceflight, GALACTIC 7, will have a blended manifest of researchers and private citizens, and we expect the revenue for that flight to exceed an average of $800,000 per seat.With a current backlog of approximately 725 future astronauts, new sales are not planned to open until we are closer to the launch of our Delta fleet. However, we have a limited number of house seats that we have made available to private astronaut referrals from our future astronaut community. We have moved the entry price point of these private astronaut seats from $450,000 to $600,000, in line with the entry level price per seat of our research flights. We believe these prices continue to reflect outstanding value for the product and lifetime experience we are delivering. And as Doug will share in a moment, we believe there is a large and robust addressable market at these price points.Before I hand the call over to Mike and Doug, I want to clarify and reaffirm our vision and growth strategy for the company.Moving to Slide 6. let's start with the building blocks of our core business model. We've laid out the unit economics of a single Delta ship. With 6 seats, these ships can deliver a revenue per flight of $3.6 million at current pricing levels. We are targeting each Delta ship to average 8 spaceflights per month. Allowing for annual maintenance cycles and an appropriate amount of redundancy, we expect each spaceport will be optimized with a fleet of 4 to 5 spaceships and 2 motherships. This set of assets should enable a range of 300 to 400 spaceflights per year per spaceport in steady state operation.To illustrate, a spaceport that operates 300 flights a year at $3.6 million per flight, generates over $1 billion per year in revenue from the spaceflights themselves. But that's not all that we expect to have going on at a spaceport. As we've demonstrated with our early flights, witnessing a spaceflight in person is an extremely compelling experience, not only for friends and family, but also for people who are interested in Space and Aerospace technology in general. As we approach a flight cadence that is closer to daily than weekly, we expect many people will wish to be part of that experience. Some of those people will eventually become astronauts themselves, and some will be satisfied with being part of human spaceflight from the ground. All of them, however, will have an outstanding experience during the day at our spaceports, and this can be accomplished at prices that are much less than our spaceflights.This larger volume of attendance at our spaceflights is very important to the communities where we operate. On top of the high wage jobs generated directly and indirectly from our operations at the spaceport, additional jobs and positive economic impacts should flow into the community as all the people in attendance during their spaceflight days spend time and money within the surrounding areas. At a macro level, it is this fully-utilized spaceport that is the primary economic engine for both Virgin Galactic and our communities. It will be a compelling public-private partnership that we're working to first scale-up and realize at Spaceport America in New Mexico. We will then take that fully-utilized spaceport model to governments and communities in other parts of the world that wish to develop a local Space economy.I want to note that the upfront infrastructure we are now building for our Delta class ships, including our final assembly spaceship factory in Phoenix, is planned to support this future expansion. This is where we expect to drive excellent contribution margins and this is where we see significant upside potential in our business model.Once our upfront infrastructure is in place, we expect to lean into the profitable expansion of our fleet. While the capital we have on hand is sufficient to bring our first 2 ships into service, we do expect to bring on additional growth capital to fund the assets needed, primarily additional spaceships and motherships to expand our business at an appropriate rate. With high margins and short payback periods on additional spaceships and motherships, we forecast the returns on this growth capital, when deployed, to be very attractive and value accretive to the company. Our primary effort right now, however, is to remain laser focused on completing the upfront design, build and test work so we can launch our Delta fleet and move into cash flow positive operations.With that in mind, I'll hand the call over to Mike Moses, President of Virgin Galactic Spaceline for an update on our Delta ships. Thank you, Michael. It's great to join all of you today. It's a tremendously exciting time for our company and I'm thrilled to be part of it. I'll start by addressing a couple of questions that I hear frequently, because the answers will help everyone better understand the strategy and design behind our next generation spaceships. The first question I hear most frequently, how is Delta different than Unity? Typically, that question is quickly followed with, what gives us confidence that we can deliver the first Delta class ships next year to begin ground and flight tests ahead of commercial service in 2026?Let me start on Page 7 with the first question. What is different between Unity and Delta?Simply put, Delta will look almost identical to Unity. The dynamics of the flight, the shape of the vehicle, our pilot-led approach and our fundamental customer experience won't change, but each of the aspects will be enhanced. The Spaceship system emphasizes safety first, and then ultimately, reusability and frequent flight rate. While it will look very similar, there are differences, and they can be broken down into 3 categories: capacity, flight rate and cost. First, each Delta spaceship has increased cabin capacity. Delta will be able to carry 6 astronauts in addition to the 2 pilots, compared to only 4 astronauts in Unity, this is a 50% increase in seating capacity, which directly translates into increased revenue per flight.A key metric that highlights why we are so focused on the Delta fleet is, revenue per flight. More seats in each spaceship means more revenue per flight. We achieve the increased capacity by removing weight from the design. One of the key enablers to reducing the weight is the composite materials that we use to build each ship. We have switched to a high temperature composite resin system called bismaleimide, typically abbreviated as BMI. The ability of the base composite material to withstand higher temperatures reduces the amount of thermal protection required for each Delta ship, thus saving weight and increasing our cabin capacity.In addition, we are optimizing the structural skeleton of the Delta spaceship, because we know from Unity flight experience exactly how we need the ship to perform, we can size and locate various structural parts more precisely, which in turn saves weight.The second difference is the increased flight rate of a single spaceship. It should go without saying, but a spaceship is more beneficial to the business the more often it is safely flying as opposed to sitting on the ground. Quicker turn times will enable us to grow the business quickly. This highlights another key metric, flights per month. Delta will be capable of flying 8 times per month compared to the once a month for Unity. Coupled with increased revenue per flight, Delta can generate 12x the revenue compared to Unity. We achieved this through thoughtful and precise design and testing of the Delta space ships.Turn time is how much time you spend on the ground between flights and the biggest impact on turn time stems from periodic inspections required to check that the system and structure are performing as desired. A major advancement with Delta is that we are building specific dedicated test articles that supports cycle testing on the ground. One such article is the static test article. This is essentially a Delta ship. It's the major assemblies It's the major assemblies of the spaceship, built as if they were being used in a Delta spaceship, but installed into ground test rigs. We will then pull, push, bend and twist that piece of structure until it breaks, verifying its capabilities compared to computer model predictions. This type of testing is common in aerospace manufacturing, and it allows you to have high confidence in your limits and capabilities.With Unity, we did some of this testing, but because our original prototype didn't always have a test part capable of being broken on the ground, we adopted a strategy of inspecting Unity regularly to validate our performance. A static test article represents a significant investment in time and materials, but the payoff is well worth it. Similar to how modern airliners are maintained, the Delta fleet will have test data to inform the number and frequency of inspections that will be needed with the ability to space these out over the course of its lifetime. While Unity needed an average of 14 days of inspections between flights, the Delta fleet will only need less than a day.Delta spaceships are being designed for easier access to the areas that do require inspection. Knowing specific maintenance tasks required ahead of the design process, we can ensure that parts requiring regular inspection aren't buried deep within the ship and that access panels can be removed and reinstalled quickly without requiring special tools or equipment.Finally, there is a significant difference in the cost to build each spaceship. Unity was a hand-built spaceship. The parts were laid up by hand and assembled piece by piece when our company was vertically integrated, meaning that we did almost everything in house. For Delta, we are leveraging the best practices of modern aerospace manufacturing. We are using a digital twin that models all of the parts electronically and stores all relevant metadata in a common graphical data structure. This process facilitates smoother manufacturing and assembly and has great benefits in test and verification as well as commercial operations and maintenance.We are leveraging aerospace industry expert suppliers, Bell Textron and Qarbon Aerospace to develop, build and assemble Delta's major subassemblies, the wing, fuselage and feather assemblies. These parts will be fully built and integrated with wiring, subsystems and components and delivered to our new Phoenix-based final assembly facility, where Virgin Galactic will combine those elements and perform final ground checkout before starting flight test. Investing in the design and drawing release process upfront, will enable a much smoother and quicker assembly phase. In addition to shorter assembly times, this development approach reduces the variable cost per spaceship dramatically, with an estimated cost per incremental Delta ship in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This is the new way to make spaceships.Addressing the second question I'm often asked about Delta, what gives us the confidence in our schedule to deliver Delta for commercial service in 2026?You can break our schedule down into 3 phases: design; build and assemble; and test. As I've highlighted, Delta is based on the learnings of Unity, and that is the most relevant fact that drives our confidence. In the design phase, we know that Delta needs to fly the same way as Unity. It has the same shape or outer mode line, flies through the same environment and follows a similar path to Space. Thanks to Unity's flights, our designers already have the end, well-defined.In the Build and Assemble phase, I just highlighted the key changes that drive confidence there. The digital models, integrated major sump assemblies and development test equipment that allows us to check components before they go on the ship. On Pages 8 and 9, you can see the continued progress we are making on the buildout of our spaceship factory. In the test phase, we again build off the foundation of Unity. We are not flying into new and unknown territory. We need flight testing. But for Delta, we are looking at the performance of what has changed, not learning new things on each test flight, like was needed for Unity. In the test world, this is more like regression testing as opposed to new envelope testing.Finally, for those with a more detailed interest in how our spaceships are being built, Page 10 shows examples of tools that Qarbon Aerospace is using to build the BMI composite parts. These tools work much like molds that allow us to build and cost effectively replicate parts for multiple spaceships. The carbon fiber parts are laid up into these tools, and then cured in pressurized ovens called Autoclaves that are located at Qarbon's facilities.Page 11 shows the Delta flight deck simulator we have recently installed at our engineering headquarters in Orange County, California. This critical test asset supports the evaluation of our cockpit layout and human control interface, evaluation of flight controls, and updates to pilot procedures and checklists. It has taken a tremendous amount of expertise and experience to arrive at this exciting point in our trajectory. Every flight we have taken, every lesson we have learned, every leap forward we have made, all have brought us here. What we are accomplishing with Delta and the scaling of Virgin Galactic is nothing short of amazing, and I look forward to sharing more details as continued progress is made.Now I'll hand over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Doug Ahrens, for a financial overview. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 12 and our financial results for the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $2.8 million, driven by commercial spaceflights and future astronaut membership fees. Total operating expenses were $117 million compared to $154 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by lower R&D and SG&A expenses. We reported a GAAP net loss of $104 million compared to a net loss of $151 million in the prior year period, with the improvement driven by lower operating expenses and an increase in interest income from our marketable securities. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $84 million in the fourth quarter compared to negative $133 million in the prior year period.Turning to Slide 13. For fiscal year 2023, we generated revenue of $6.8 million, driven by commercial spaceflights and future astronaut membership fees. Total operating expenses were $538 million, compared to $502 million in the prior year. We reported a GAAP net loss of $502 million compared to $500 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was negative $427 million compared to negative $431 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was negative $114 million in the fourth quarter compared to negative $135 million in the same period last year. Our free cash flow was better than guidance due to variation in timing of payments to suppliers. For the year, free cash flow was negative $493 million compared to negative $397 million in the prior year.Moving to Slide 14, our balance sheet remains strong with $982 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In 2023, we generated $484 million in gross proceeds through an at-the-market or ATM equity offering program. We did not utilize the ATM in the fourth quarter.Moving to our projection, revenue for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately $2 million. Forecasted free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of negative $125 million to $135 million. Michael mentioned earlier the strong value being delivered to our customers and he shared we have updated our private astronaut pricing to align with our research pricing at $600,000 per seat. I'd like to now discuss how we view the size of the commercial space travel market that we are pursuing. We've triangulated a few sources of research to help us better understand the Total Addressable Market or TAM, leveraging a 2021 Jefferies report, a 2023 Credit Suisse report, and our own proprietary data. We have estimated a number of individuals that have both the desire to fly to space and the resources to do so.Using conservative assumptions, we believe the TAM for private astronaut space travel is approximately 300,000 individuals growing at an estimated annual rate of 8%. Putting that market opportunity into context, one fully operational spaceport, supporting around 2,000 astronauts per year would represent less than 1% market penetration. This type of market analysis, combined with the tremendous customer feedback we are seeing from the spaceflight experience, shows the clear opportunity to keep expanding our fleet of spaceships and motherships with the goal of adding multiple spaceports around the globe.In the prior earnings call, we stated our ability to achieve positive cash flow with 2 Delta class spaceships. We've allocated sufficient capital to bring them into service. But our growth aspirations do not stop there. We plan to continue to expand our fleet and fill additional spaceports. The onetime capital investment plan for 2024, which includes tooling at suppliers, and the opening of our spaceship assembly factory in Arizona, will give us the manufacturing capacity needed to continue building additional spaceships at relatively low incremental costs.Let's now discuss the economic model behind a fully operational spaceport. We believe the most effective utilization of a spaceport will occur at 300 to 400 flights per year. If we were to assume average ticket pricing of $600,000 for now, we would generate approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of revenue per spaceport annually from spaceflights. The spaceships and motherships are the high return, quick payback assets that are expected to drive the outstanding economics for each spaceport. Because of the attractive economics just described, at some point in the future, we would expect to bring in additional growth capital to acquire additional spaceships and motherships, the revenue-generating assets that increase profits.We forecast the returns on this growth capital, when deployed, to be very attractive and value accretive to the company. For now, however, having recently right-sized the company, we are prudently managing our resources and focusing the organization on good execution to bring our first Delta class spaceships into service.I will now turn the call back over to Michael. Thanks, Doug. To recap the key takeaways from today's call. The bold dream of commercial spaceflight was realized in 2023, as we officially launched our commercial spaceline with 6 flights in 6 months, demonstrating the Virgin Galactic spaceflight system is designed for safety, reliability, and repeatability.Our astronaut journey is delivering an incomparable life experience that is of great value to our customers. We see positive indications for both pricing and the overall potential size of the commercial space travel market. 2024 marks a new phase as we move past our R&D and prototype routes and are now advancing the development of our production spaceships with ground and flight testing expected to commence in 2025, and entry into service expected in 2026. We continue to pursue our high growth business model of creating fully-utilized spaceports with plans to first scale operations at Spaceport America with a fleet of 4 to 5 spaceships, followed by expansion to additional spaceports in compelling locations.With that, we'll turn to questions. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Maybe just to start on CapEx, I mean guiding to $40 million to $45 million in Q1, I think, you spent $18 million in Q4 and $44 million in 2023. How do we think about the ramp there? And how much of that is higher activity? And then also just given accounting with R&D, how much of that is coming over from R&D, just kind of thinking about R&D spend for 2024? Yes. Thanks, Greg. Yes, you've noted the trend in the shift. What's happening here is we've shifted from this heavy R&D phase as we've gone through the nonrecurring engineering into the the building of capital assets. It starts with tooling and the factory and then parts fabrication and so on. So we're seeing a shift because we're moving into this next chapter where we're building these revenue-producing assets. So you're going to see that trend continue into 2024 and in 2025, where you'll see more CapEx than R&D.We don't guide the split specifically, but you will see the majority shifting to CapEx. We have said in the past, and this still stands true that if you look at the total cash spending, we do expect the average spend for '24 and '25 to be lower than it was in 2023, and that's because of this shift that's happened, where we are now moving through the addition of these assets that a lot of this happens in 2024 and then it starts to ramp down because we have these assets in place and now can move into the production of spaceships.So that hopefully gives you some color, Greg. That helps. And just in terms of spaceport, I mean, you sized each spaceport at capacity of 4 to 5 spaceships. And in the past, you've talked about Delta production capacity at 6 per year. So I mean, it seems like you could fill up the first one fairly quickly. Any color around when you would look to add a second spaceport, and any initial conversations, or when those conversations need to happen with a potential location? Sure. We just kind of harking back to the last call. One of the big advancements we've seen from Delta was to be able to turn those ships on a twice a week basis, well, more than our Unity ship, of course, but even stronger than we had originally put forth. And so, therefore, we need, functionally, about half the number of spaceships at every spaceport going forward. So, as you note, the factory capacity that we built when we were thinking these could turn on a weekly basis versus twice a week, gives us, I think, plenty of capacity within the factory to build the ships out.To your specific question on next spaceport generally, that's about a 5-year process. And so 2029 seems to be the right place for a second spaceport. I note there are many places that we could go in the world. We can go to other places in the U.S. We could also functionally double our infrastructure at Spaceport America and kind of run a twin operation there if we so chose. So there's many places we can have that next spaceport come forward, and then ideally, more following from that. But 5 years out from today is about the right target for that. Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Michael and Doug, Delta class has a really nice contribution margin once it's running. I would love your thoughts on upside or downside to the 75% contribution margin on Delta class.And second, in terms of revenue modeling, as we think about the ramp of customer deposit liabilities on the balance sheet, Doug, any thoughts on how we should look to model that?And then third, the GALACTIC 6 experience that we had really showed a lot of differentiation of the product. How are you thinking about competition in your pricing relative to competition and the different kind of experience that you offer as well? Thanks, Oliver. This is Doug. I'll take the first 2 questions and then have Michael comment on the third. So regarding the contribution margin, 75% that we've stated before, that was actually based on a lower ticket price than we're talking now. So that was based on the $450,000 ticket price. And that was a full Delta class ship and a variable cost of around $400,000. So that was giving us a contribution margin of greater than 75%. Now with ticket pricing at $600,000, that contribution margin will expand because the variable cost doesn't change. We are just bringing in more revenue per flight.In terms of the customer deposits, we model those being in the area they are now, which is around $100 million until we reopen ticket sales in the future, and we've talked about that on the call. But until then, it would be fairly constant. But in the future, just when we think about capital planning, we are fulfilling our CapEx requirements and our operational expenditures without any plans to utilize those deposits. Those are set aside. So our CapEx and so on is funded through the other money we have on the balance sheet and any future growth. So that's how we think about customer deposits.Michael on GALACTIC 6? Yes, I'll talk -- I think Oliver, your question is both on competition and relatedly pricing. It's very difficult to compete with us. There's a huge technology and capital moat around human spaceflight, right? That's why it's, of course, previously only been a few governments that could afford to get there. So really, where SpaceX and governments are sending people further out. The only people doing anything in our competitive set is the Blue Origin company. And I don't have privy to their specific pricing anecdotally from the media, as they seem to have been pricing greater than $1 million as a base. So that's, I'd say, the only real kind of comparative from a competitive standpoint.So then I look internally and in anything that is a luxury or consumer offering, you want to look at the price-value relationship, and the value has to be there to drive price. So we have had -- I think, everybody is tracking with us, when we've had very recent openings, right? We've flown, had openings on some of the flights that we've just done. And when that opening comes up, we have basically sold that opening at a market available price. That's been very close to $1 million. And that's probably in line with what you're also seeing elsewhere and when you can fly kind of right now, that's where the market has shown for something right here.So then the question is, well, how is the value at that price? Because we've flown people that have been waiting for 17 years that were at $200,000, and we've flown people that are closer to $1 million. And I can tell you, having spoken with everyone, the value of what we are creating is so extraordinary that the price part of that equation is kind of diminished or minimized as an impact. So we feel that the value is so high. Our price value is good. We feel great that we're delivering enormous value at these recent prices we've been doing.I noted, I think Doug noted too that while we don't have sales open right now, we do maintain some house seats on our own, if we get a referral from our founders or customers, we can sell a few of those seats at the end of the queue. And we've moved those seats to $600,000, in line with our research pricing. I don't expect when we open up sales going forward to be going lower than that, I think the price-value maintains pressure on the price point more towards the upper angle of that. But that's where we sit right now. And again, I just don't think it's easy for people to come into this market, compete with the amount of upfront technology investment and diligence that has to be done. It's a very complicated endeavor. And one follow-up, Michael. The spaceport experience, in many ways felt like being in a movie, what are your thoughts for the community engagement part? And what have been your learning so far from spaceport and what you do there with the guests before and after and also as you think about hospitality more broadly? Thanks, Oliver. The -- you heard me mention, we had a larger number of friends and family and invited guests at the last spaceflight, still, I'd say, small versus what the capacity of that kind of spaceport wants to look like on a flight day. And the more we bring in, the better this experience is for everyone. We're able to take all the groups that come. And on the day before the flight actually break people and give a fairly robust tours of the spaceport itself, meet with leaders within our team, understand the technology, understand the incredible rigor that our maintenance and technical operations, our pilot teams, our mission control teams put into this. And it just builds the momentum and the excitement, the more context we provide people.So that's like 1 day in advance. And obviously, we can program 1 or 2 days in front of that as we choose to going forward. And then, on the day of the flight, having that large group around that has that context just adds energy, as you experienced to everyone that's there. I think, we're just at the tip of the iceberg of what that could become. But at a practical level, we have to get our spaceships built so that we can bring the spaceflights and do that on a multiple times a week basis. And then from there, I think we can add this ancillary -- nontrivial, but ancillary growth on top as we bring more people in.You mentioned hospitality. Obviously, that means people will need some place to stay, some places to eat and likely we'll want to do other things. That's a big part of why, and in this case, the state of New Mexico has been so excited to have us come and get the business scaled because that starts to drive benefits that have multiplier effects throughout the community. So we definitely will pursue growth in those angles. But first things first, let's get the ships built and then we can go after scaling the rest. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. I was hoping I first touch on GALACTIC 6 and the -- it doesn't sound like there was a delay implication from the alignment pin departure for the GALACTIC 7, which is still scheduled for 2Q. Is that correct? And have you already remediated anything with the FAA? I'm tracking this one, obviously, closely. But since we've got Mike here, Mike, I'll throw the question over to you, and nice to hear from you, Myles, by the way. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So Myles, yes, I can speak to this. I've actually been sitting in on our regular status updates to the FAA. So we are making really solid progress. We've done a fair bit of testing on the ground, and that's actually really allowed us to close out most of the actions in the investigation, and we could recreate the circumstances where that pin came free and kind of narrowed down the conditions that could have caused that. So we're in the corrective action phase to kind of enhance the robustness of the retention mechanism out of the discovery phase kind of into the reporting side. So we don't anticipate any impact on GALACTIC 7 at all for quarter 2 and the investigation has been going really well with the FAA in partnership. Okay. And Mike, while I have you, thanks for the outline of sort of the architecture Delta, where it's different, and the testing profile. Can you put a little more meat on the static testing? And I imagine getting over that hump will be pretty critical to defining the fatigue characteristics and getting you to the confidence in those inspection profiles, which basically is the game changing for the economics. But when specifically does that static testing occur? Is it in parallel to the flight testing? Is it basically by the end of '24, you'll have a good sense? Yes, Myles. So I think it's -- that's a really good, deep question. I highlighted the significant benefit of a static test article into inspection definition, but it also clearly validates models, allows you to look for manufacturing process improvements and things like that. So it has a lot of payoffs besides just inspection, having an article that you're able to kind of validate your models on, you can also check out your instrumentation, data gathering systems and validate a lot of other things as well.And so, we'll run those in parallel. We'll have a static test article built up and installed down here in Orange county at our Engineering Design headquarters. So we get close integration with our test and engineering facilities here. And we'll have some of those parts that we want to make sure we clear, before we get to certain milestones in flight test and others that will occur a little bit later on as it relates to lifetime and cycle testing. So not a specific answer for you on exactly when that is up and running, but the article will be up and running in 2024 and ready to do testing. And again, some of that will be subcomponent. But what we're really looking forward to there is the major subassembly testing, which will be later than that. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sam Struhsaker of Trust Securities. On for Mike Ciarmoli this evening. I was just curious if you could give any more detail on sort of the quantity of those referral seats that you guys mentioned, [ that's ] allowing people to enter the queue if you're willing to do that. And then also, I was just hoping for some clarity on -- you said you had these openings that came up on recent flights that you sold at market value. What was the motivation behind kind of selling those as new seats versus pulling in someone from the queue to fill those spots? Sure. The first question, Sam, is there is our -- we don't have sales open. So they are in smaller volumes, single digits, low double digits over the course of time, more in response, as opposed to proactively going out. So that's just kind of there as almost a service to our existing base.The question you had on when we have a seat opening, what have we done? We obviously have had a large number of amazing future astronauts, many with us for 15 years or even a little more. And before we reopened sales back at the $450,000 point, we took the opportunity to move all of those people forward into our queue, into the manifest. So, for instance, I might have signed up at number 50 in line. And, Sam, you were number 51. And if it were for whatever reason I had to drop out, we would have moved everybody up into my space.And so some people moved up quite a bit at that time. And at that time, we communicated with our astronaut, future astronaut base that we were going to do that once. And then if there were openings that came up in the manifest along the way, that we would bring those forward more at a market rate. But we would give kind of first nod within the community. And that's what we've been doing there, is while we're no longer continuing to move people up, we don't move people back either. We are giving that opportunity.And so, we asked to the existing base of future astronauts who would be interested if an opportunity presented itself to fly earlier, and it would be at a premium price if that happened. And that's where we built that list up. And that's where people have been, the people who have flown at those higher rates, at the earlier times have come from our existing base. Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. This is [ Gabby ] on for Kristine. So I was just curious if you could provide some color on if there are any design or manufacturing changes required to either the mothership or spaceship as a result of the pin detachment last month? And if so, does this inform any design changes to the Delta class as you progress through development? Yes, Gabby. So no changes to the design on either the mothership or the spaceship. Again, the pin issue we had posed no safety threat at all during the flight; and actually, other than having fallen away at the end, performed its function. It's there to hold the ships in alignment, while we're both meeting on the ground and while we're flying. So as long as we're attached, it did its job as it should. Clearly, we don't want it to fall away, but the fact that it did, meant it performed its function. So we're looking at a pretty minor change to the existing design just to give it some extra retention capability, but nothing that would be anything of significance to either motherships or spaceships. There are no further questions at this time. That will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.","Virgin Galactic's fourth quarter and full year 2023 Earnings conference call . on the call today are: Michael Colglazier, chief executive officer; Mike Moses, president of our spaceline; Doug Ahrens, chief financial officer . we will open the call for questions following our prepared remarks .",0.0

On Slide 3, you'll see the agenda for today. I'll share several updates about our commercial space line and the progress we're making toward our long-term business objectives.On the immediate horizon is our next spaceflight, Galactic 07, scheduled for June 8. Galactic 07 will be our last commercial flight with VSS Unity. And this will mark an important turning point for Virgin Galactic, and the spaceflight will be a celebratory moment as we reflect on the many successes of our pathfinding first commercial spaceship.The learnings we have built over our last 7 spaceflights have enormously benefited our spaceship designs. In addition, we have also learned a great deal about the performance of our mothership VMS Eve, which has been an incredible asset for the company following the ship's major enhancement program that was completed in 2023.One of the many benefits of using a specialized airplane for our first stage of spaceflight is the frequency of flight operations that can be achieved with an aircraft versus a liquid rocket booster. Using flight and engineering data from Eve's service history, our technical operation teams are developing a targeted maintenance plan, an operations schedule for Eve, and I'm pleased to share that we now expect VMS Eve to support 3 space missions per week, a 50% increase over prior base case estimations. This is fantastic news.We expect Eve and our first 2 Delta ships will be able to execute approximately 125 spaceflights carrying 750-or-so astronauts to space each year. To put that in perspective, Eve and the first 2 Delta ships will bring more people to space in a single year than the total number of astronauts who have ever journeyed to space to date.Economically, that equates to roughly $450 million in annualized revenue within the first 12 months following entry into commercial service. Of course, those numbers are expected to grow substantially as we scale our operations by adding new ships and expand across multiple spaceports. During today's call, I'll ask Doug Ahrens, our Chief Financial Officer, to shed more light on our financial operating model, giving you a sense of what our economics are estimated to look like with the initial rollout of our first 2 Delta ships and in the years to follow.With that, let's get started on Slide 4. At Virgin Galactic, nothing is more exciting than seeing a spaceflight in action and witnessing the incredible impact that the journey to space has on our astronauts and their families. On June 8, we will again watch Unity's soar above the planet from Spaceport America. This time with a blended manifest of research and private astronauts.This will be our seventh commercial flight and our 12th spaceflight overall. A research astronaut on board will conduct several human tended experiments, and we also have several autonomous rack-mounted payloads on board in connection with NASA's flight opportunities program and academic institutions. Three private astronauts will also join this flight, 2 from the U.S. and 1 from Italy.Given the blended nature of this particular manifest, Galactic 07 is expected to realize an average per seat price of over $800,000, the highest of our commercial flights flown to date. The value of our spaceflights for our customers is enormous. And we are seeing ongoing strength in our pricing, which we expect will continue as we introduce the Delta ships and grow the business.When we see Unity fly next month, it will be a very exciting and proud moment. Unity has helped to revolutionize commercial human spaceflight and has served Virgin Galactic incredibly well, demonstrating the safety and repeatability of our spaceflight system while informing the design of our next generation ships. Unity will continue to play a role in training and the ship will reside at Spaceport America to commemorate its historic role in commercial space travel.As you know, Unity reached the point where it was turning monthly, completing 6 spaceflights in 6 months last year, a significant accomplishment for our Pathfinder spaceship. At the same time, we have always known that VMS Eve, a specialized airplane is able to turn much faster.One of the great advantages of our spaceflight system is this combination of carrier airplane and mated spaceship. In addition to providing the benefit of a runway takeoff and landing, the mothership design enables the efficient turnaround capabilities of an aircraft. As we put our mothership through the paces with regular flights and inspections, Eve has performed brilliantly.As I mentioned at the opening, our technical operations team, using flight and engineering data from Eve's service history, are developing a targeted maintenance plan and operations schedule that supports 3 space missions per week, a 50% increase over our prior base case estimations. The third flight per week will prove highly beneficial to our business model when we resume commercial service. With the launch of just our first 2 Delta ships, we expect to operate a robust and meaningful business with positive operating cash flow. This is why we have prioritized the cash we already have on hand to bring these ships into service.On a related note, Eve's impressive flight capacity will also serve us well with our next generation mothership program. As we stated last year, we re-sequenced the next mothership program to better manage our capital and spending levels in the near term, and we are continuing to exercise that optionality.We've been pleased with our development approach to our Delta spaceships, where Virgin Galactic maintains design authority and leverages the manufacturing and engineering expertise of a few key industry partners. We expect to follow a similar approach with our next mothership program, and we will be shifting our engineering talent towards our next mothership design following the conclusion this summer of the bulk of our Delta spaceship design.As we balance our desire for rapid growth, with our spending pace ahead of meaningful revenue, we will target 2028 for delivery of the first of our next-gen motherships. This timing it enables us to manage our existing capital confidently, which in turn sets us up for long-term success. Importantly, our growth strategy remains the same to scale our commercial space travel business first by adding ships to our fleet in New Mexico and then expanding to additional spaceports in excellent locations around the globe.Turning to Slide 5, let's talk about progress and tangible milestones we're hitting within our Delta program. As you can see in the chart on Slide 5, there are multiple phases to our Delta program, beginning with design, then moving to tooling, parts fabrication, subassemblies, final assemblies, and then on to flight test and commercial service. While sequential, these phases have purposeful overlap throughout the development process.Currently, we are working through the latter part of our design phase, which we expect to wrap up this summer. Along the way, as designs of individual parts are completed, we have been releasing those designs to begin development of the tools that will be used in the parts fabrication process. Similarly, as those initial tools are completed and delivered, our partners at Bell and Qarbon are able to start fabricating parts, and they are beginning to accumulate the components that will be necessary for their respective subassemblies.The images on Slide 6 shows some of the tools that have been delivered or are in development, as well as an example of what a finished part looks like within its tooling. This particular part is a door for the landing gear within the wing. Tool delivery and parts fabrication are beginning to accelerate as we work to complete the bulk of the design phase this summer and move more fully into the build phase.Most of you know that Bell is supplying the unique feathering system and flight control surfaces for Delta, while Qarbon is producing the fuselage and wing components. I met recently with teams from both companies and I am excited about the emphasis that they put on quality and performance of these key components while aligning with our overall production schedule.In parallel with design, tooling and parts fabrication, we have been building out the facilities needed for both our test assets and our final assembly factory. The facility in Phoenix that will house our final assembly operation is nearing completion, seen here on Slide 7. We expect to take occupancy of the building this summer, and we'll begin setting up the factory floor for assembly and developing our training tools and processes in preparation for the final assembly stage in the first half of 2025.Also on Slide 7, you can see the mock up of our cabin interior for Delta, which we are using to confirm human factors in addition to fit and finish. We have a host of upgrades we are adding to our Delta cabin interiors, and we're looking forward to revealing the full interior design and functionality later this year.You've heard us talk about our test asset called the Iron Bird, and the design of the full build out of this system is shown on Slide 8. We recently opened a test facility that houses this Iron Bird system, and it's up and running in Irvine near our Southern California headquarters. The Iron Bird allows us to test and verify the operation of dozens of Delta subsystems, including avionics, feather actuation, and pneumatics, on the ground and in parallel to the assembly of our ships. Again, the purpose of this system is to provide the widest possible scope of ground testing prior to performing flight tests, making flight tests more streamlined and efficient.Turning to Slide 9 regarding schedule. Our overall plan remains intact, with commercial service expected to begin with our first 2 Delta ships in 2026. Sharing some color underneath the macro timeline. We have been adapting our detailed schedule to take advantage of opportunities and to react to sub-elements of the plan that need more time for completion. As with most large aerospace programs, we find schedule improvement opportunities while also identifying elements that are extending beyond their originally allotted time durations, and we work to integrate both of these into the overall plan. The key with regard to schedule is to adapt the sequencing and application of resources to ensure the critical path of the program remains on track.At a tactical level, we are realizing schedule improvements in the final assembly timelines as we compare our detailed build plan activities versus our initial estimates. Our final assembly process for Delta is much different and improved versus our prototype work with Unity and Imagine. And we are seeing the benefits of our digital thread approach and manufacturing strategy with Bell and Qarbon.While the build planning has been positive for our schedule, we have had elements within our design phase extend longer. Net-net, the benefits we have found and the time extensions we have realized have balanced out and our overall program schedule remains intact, with scheduled contingencies and buffers still in place to handle unexpected items that will surely arise over the course of the upcoming work.Our team at Virgin Galactic and our partners at Bell and Qarbon are all committed to the success of the program and the collaboration between the groups as we work through the typical ups and downs of a complex program have been great to witness.I'll now turn the call over to Doug, so he can share more detail about the financial operating model and how our first 2 Delta ships have a meaningful impact on our business in the near term, generating strong operating cash flows even before we fully build out our fleet in New Mexico or expand to additional spaceports.Doug, over to you. Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 10. The planned increase in flight cadence for our mothership Eve is a game changer when the first 2 Delta ships enter commercial service. With steady state operations, flying Eve 3 times a week means we have the capacity to conduct approximately 125 flights per year, allowing for potential weather or operational inefficiencies. At that pace, with 6 seats per spaceflight, we plan to fly 750 astronauts to space annually with our first 2 Delta ships.Not only does this enable us to serve the existing ticket holders fairly rapidly, but it also enables us to begin serving new customers at higher price points. Applying the recently announced pricing of $600,000 per seat, within a year after Delta enter service, we expect to be able to achieve a run rate of $450 million annually. This is a sizable business that can be achieved with the mothership we have, plus the addition of the first 2 Delta class spaceships.We have shared with you previously that we expect to see contribution margins above 75% for each spaceflight. This is the margin we project after accounting for the variable costs of each flight, such as the rocket motor, fuel, hospitality expenses for the astronauts, etc. This contribution margin will be more than enough to cover the fixed costs of running the business, leading to meaningful operating cash flow.This is the first stepping stone in our economic growth story, as these profits can be reinvested to further expand our fleet and drive additional growth. At that stage, we plan to build incremental Delta ships at a recurring cost of $50 million to $60 million each. These are highly accretive assets. The costs of our future ships are so low because the designs are already done, the tools already have been built, the supply chain will be in place, and our spaceship assembly factory will be up and running. These are the investments we are making right now and which give us the infrastructure needed to further drive substantial growth.Our intentions are to continue to expand at Spaceport America and then to add more spaceports in other locations around the world. As we said before, we estimate that each operational spaceport can generate over $1 billion of revenue annually.Turning to Slide 11, I want to run through a very high level recap of our financial results for the first quarters. We generated revenue of $2 million, driven by a commercial spaceflight and future astronaut membership fees. Total operating expenses were $113 million compared to $164 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by lower R&D and SG&A expenses partly reflective of our restructuring efforts last year. Free cash flow was negative $126 million in the first quarter, compared to negative $139 million in the same period last year.Turning to Slide 12, our balance sheet remains strong with $867 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the first quarter, we generated $7 million in gross proceeds through an at-the-market or ATM equity offering program. Moving to our projections, revenue for the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately $3.5 million. Forecasted free cash flow for the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of negative $110 million to $120 million.I'll now turn the call back over to Michael. Thanks, Doug. To recap today's call, we are planning to fly the last commercial flight of VSS Unity on June 8, taking a researcher and 3 private astronauts to space and delivering an incomparable and life changing experience to each of them. This will mark our seventh commercial flight and 12th spaceflight in total, again demonstrating that Virgin Galactic spaceflight system is safe, reliable and repeatable with an experience beyond compare.I also shared that we expect our existing mothership will have the capacity to fly up to 3 times a week with the first 2 Delta ships, or upwards of 125 times a year, supporting a strong revenue business in the first stage of Delta operations. We are making important progress with our Delta suppliers and are seeing steady progress with designs, tooling development, initial parts fabrication, and preparations to open our final assembly factory this summer.Our Delta schedule remains on track for commercial service in 2026. At the same time, we remain committed to our long-term, high growth business model of scaling operations at Spaceport America with a fleet of 4 to 5 spaceships, followed by the creation of fully utilized spaceports and continuous operations from multiple locations around the world.With that, we'll turn to questions. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Appreciate the incremental details. Just on the $450 million annual run rate of revenue, it seems like that assumes the $600,000 ticket price. How much backlog of lower tickets are there to kind of cycle through, before you kind of get to that higher price point? Or how should we think about near-term revenue just given some launch pricing? Yes. Greg, this is Doug. Yes, so we have approximately 600 -- a little more over 600 astronauts at the lower price points and then we have some that were sold at $450,000. So one of the important things we noted is at the flight rate of 125 flights a year, we can fly up to 750 astronauts per year. So that will move through our backlog of customers fairly quickly.So what we gave you was our annualized run rate at about 12 months out after we've moved through the backlog we already have. And then we've applied the ticket pricing that we've recently announced of $600,000 because that's what we're projecting at this time. It's worth noting though that we said that this flight coming up, Galactic 07, the average price per seat is over $800,000. So it's showing the pricing leverage we have. So we think it's a fair number to use to say $600,000 for the future for that point in time. And then just to confirm, the first 2 Delta class spaceships rollout at the same time or enter commercial at the same time. And then appreciated the detail around the mothership 2028. How much does that become a pacing item, just given it seems like maybe you'll be able to exceed that from a Delta standpoint in 2027? Greg, it's Michael. So, Eve, which is excellent, still will remain the bottleneck against the capacity of the Delta ships. So, when we bring a second mothership out, at that point, those 2 Delta ships would become the bottleneck. So we'd want to pair the arrival of that new mothership with a fast follow with additional Delta ships, for sure. And we kind of keep that balanced as we grow the fleet up. But with Eve, 3 times a week, the way we can do that allows, some weeks we'll have a back-to-back flight, then there'll be a number where we'll run more than 3 a week. There'll be other weeks where we will run less than 3 a week because we're doing a regularly scheduled maintenance piece.Within that operation, there may be opportunity to go up above where we are, but we feel good with what we're stating today at 125 by the time we factor weather days and rain days and efficiencies that will come out. So that's probably a good gate until we get to 2028, that 125 flights as a kind of planning target for your modeling. And then it really opens up as we add additional motherships. So just a quick follow-up to that. So should we assume -- not assume, the third Delta enter service until 2028 then? Yes, we would match the third Delta shift with the addition of the next mothership. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Michael, the way you're describing it, you're going to actually burn through your backlog of customers reasonably quickly. So I'm curious, what is your thought process on reopening initially the sales window? And also just from a running the business perspective how do you want to run with a backlog such that you can -- you sort of run to a predictable pace as opposed to something else and also provide your flying customers with enough lead time for them to plan around their trips? Right. Myles, consistently, I think it's helpful to have on both the customers side and the business side a 2-year run. And the customer side that first year is really recognizing the journey that this spaceflight is. It's not just the up and down moment by any sense. It is a journey and we will build people through that journey from the moment they sign on. I think once you go past 2 years to 3 years that journey starts to get a little long for people and they are getting antsy. But 2 years, I think is appropriate, and then we'd like to give people in a steady state basis around 12 months of notice. It says okay your flights going to be 12 months from now in that month, so people can start to prepare, schedules and friends and family who will come.So if you look at our existing backlog of customers with us starting in '26, that means within '26 and '27, we should really process through the existing folks. So by the time we get to 2028, especially when we have that next mothership, if we're going to have a 2-year backlog in front of that, we want everybody kind of on board by the beginning of '26. So just backing that up, you'll see us start the sales process within the '25 period. We won't wait till the end of '25 to do that because we'd like to have another years of backlog in place by the time we start '26.And we're balancing getting people on board in time to have, I said, both the journey for them as well as a nice comfortable backlog for us to focus on executing our operations. At the same time, if we try to bring people in too early, I think we lose some of the pricing pressure that we're obviously been demonstrating with these last flights. So we want to keep a balance there so that we maintain the power of pricing that befits the quality of the experience we're delivering, but still allow both our customers and us for planning. So hopefully that 2-year window explains that. That does, yes, that's a perfect explanation. Maybe one on the details of the accounting. CapEx, I know you were looking for $40 million to $50 million in the quarter. It was light, but R&D was heavy. I'm going to guess that that was because you didn't transition fully to capitalizing versus R&D. Is that the way to read it? Right, yes, it's just an accounting convention of when we flip the switch. But you'll see that start to ramp up this year, especially in the second half. So you'll start to see majority CapEx. You will start to exceed OpEx. As we wrap up the design work here, and we're building more tooling, and then parts fabrication happens, you'll see the shift take place. Okay. And sorry, just one last one, which is if you will be cycling through a 1,000 customers a year in '28 and their constituencies, what kind of physical plant improvement and timeline for investment are you going to have to make within Spaceport America on the experiential side? That's a great question. The plant at Spaceport America, for those who haven't been there, we have 1 major hanger that can handle our operations for the mothership and a number of spaceships. As we grow and as we bring in another mothership, we do expect to work with the spaceport in New Mexico and add what we would call kind of a launch hanger. That would be an additional hanger primarily for the mated pair of spaceship and mothership. And that hanger would also be where we do the maintenance on the motherships.So we'll add an additional hangar there. It's not the architectural statement of what's the primary hangar base in New Mexico. That building is not only a hangar, it's our customer operations, it's training, and all those things. So it's an airplane hangar that needs to be built, So that would be 1 of the pieces of infrastructure that's there.The other piece will come in the training facilities that are there. As we start to fly, really even with these 2 Delta ships, and we're flying more than once a week, we will break training out into an additional training facility and use the spaceport and the third floor where we have been doing training, that will really become kind of a launch day focus and will bring a training facility separately. So we have choices about whether to build those out or to rent facilities for that, but we expect those to be in the Las Cruces, New Mexico area as well. So those are the 2, I'm looking over to Doug if there's anything other from a major investment, but an aircraft hangar as we scale and training facilities. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leshock with KeyBanc. I think that you've previously said 2024 is kind of the peak cash burn year in support of Delta. And then looking at your 2Q guided implied somewhere around $130 million quarterly burn rate give or take for 3Q and 4Q each. So it likely would be a step up in the burn sequentially at some point this year if '24 is the peak burn year. So is that still your view? And do you have any line of sight when you expect to see the peak quarterly cash burn just assuming Delta class schedule progresses as expected. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, we do expect the peak burn to be here in 2024. That's still the case. So you'll see a ramp. We haven't guided specifically beyond Q2, but we do see a trend coming for Q3 and Q4 that we would be increasing our spending on CapEx, as I mentioned previously, because we're still going to be going through the tooling completion and moving heavily into parts fabrication. So the peak is still to come, but in this year for Delta. Okay. And then I think you said you're targeting '28 for the second mothership, which should get over 125 flights per year on those first 2 Delta ships. Just wondering if the ongoing legal issues with Boeing have the potential to impact any plans on the mothership front or if you could share any update there? Sure. The very short answer is no. The issues with Boeing are not material and are not going to be impacting how we progress our mothership program. Our position with Boeing is very clear and if you haven't had a chance, there's a very thorough overview of that in the counter suit that we put out. But in short, our positions, we received unacceptable work from Boeing. The intellectual property that was in debate is either owned outright or duly licensed by us and, you know, all the elements of that are laid out in that case.With that said, again, it's not a material piece. It will not be a distraction for us in any way as we move forward with our mothership program. But it's a good read if you want to read the background there. Yes, I did. It was surprising to see for me. Okay. And then I think just lastly for me, previously you allocated a portion of ticket sales to Virtuoso. Did they sell their portion fully? And is that something -- a partnership that you're going to continue to leverage when you open up ticket sales again? Virtuoso has not fully used their allocation. Like us, they've kind of -- we've pulled back on the sales piece until we get closer in. I think the opportunity for companies like Virtuoso where they have a very healthy and active base in particular in adventure travel and high-end travel is a relevant potential channel for us. I clearly will be doing a lot direct. But I do think there's help in -- as this becomes known and normal, we had a huge deal just in this last year of 6 flights in 6 months and that seemed like a huge deal.We're going to show up into the '26 and start operations on a pace of 125 human spaceflights a year. And it's going to be completely different idea of what's going on here. The word will be out, people will be known. And at that place, wide distribution and access to people is sometimes helpful. And so I think we'll continue to test efforts like we've done with Virtuoso, but I do expect the bulk will probably be direct sales. This concludes the Q&A session as well as today's conference.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael. Thanks, Eric. Let's go to Slide 3. Since our Q1 earnings call in May, we made strong advancements on the development of our Delta class spaceships. We will have substantially wrapped up the multiyear design phase of these high-performance ships in Q3 as we pivot the organization's focus to the build and test phases. Designing step function leads and performance and reliability into these production model shifts has required a huge effort by our engineering team. I'm really proud of their work and their progress, which is hard to showcase as design progress mostly takes place within software systems and analytic models. To spotlight the magnitude of their endeavor, we released a video this morning that provides an overview of the Delta spaceship design and the performance characteristics that have been planned for these ships. Watch it. It's great, and it gives you a clear view of the future of private space travel. 

During the second quarter, we've continued to manage the company with tenacious fiscal discipline. We've maintained strength in our balance sheet to provide the resources needed to execute our strategic plan, and we remain on track to launch commercial operations with our first Delta space ships in 2026 as planned. We closed the second quarter with an incredible space light, Galactic 07, marking the completion of Virgin Spaceship Unity's operational phase and the brilliant conclusion of a nearly decade-long development and testing program. The mini space missions flown by this path finding ship built incredible knowledge and expertise for the company. I'd like to start the call by focusing on 2 core assets that we are now leveraging for competitive advantage and growth. First, we've created a customer experience beyond compare. The value perceived by our customers remained off the charts at price points spanning from around $0.5 million to around $1 million. 

Second, we've developed a space flight system and technology that will revolutionize the operating model and economics of human space flight. While the turnaround time between flights of traditional space vehicles has historically been measured in months, Virgin Galactic now has the experience and data needed to target space turn times that are measured in days, which throws open the door to profitable growth and scale. Outstanding product quality that commands a premium price is a huge competitive advantage for any company. We have it, and it will drive the top line of our company's growth. With unprecedented turn times and reusability metrics, our delta ships are planned to disrupt the historic cost structure of human space light and deliver strong profit margins. World-class product quality paired with an industry-leading cost structure is a massive advantage. When combined with the production capability we are currently creating with our Delta class patient program, these assets form the basis of a powerful business model and growth engine for Virgin Galactic. 

There are lots of opinions about Virgin Galactic's business model shared on various social channels and platforms. We find many of those opinions are missing key pieces of information. To improve the quality of information that's readily available to our large retail investor base, we released a video overview of Virgin Galactic business model today, which can be found on our Investor Relations website and various social channels and platforms. It's incredibly important to have our investors tracking with our business strategy and our progress in executing the plan. So today, I've asked our CFO, Doug Ahrens, to share a deep look into our business model, including expectations around variable cost and the degree of fixed cost leverage we expect to see as we grow the size of our fleet. I'll come back on the line to discuss progress being made on our production model spaceships, and I'll talk about the shift in focus that will be occurring in the next month as we wrap up our multiyear design phase and pivot our attention more fully to the build and test phases of the Delta program. Doug will return to discuss financial results for the quarter, and we will then open the call for Q&A. Doug, over to you. Thanks, Michael. While it is obvious to most, it is worth repeating that we are a company operating in a very new industry. We have an innovative business model that is not yet known by many. We believe there is a gap between how the public markets understand our business relative to the value we are creating within the company. To ensure we can realize the benefits of this extremely powerful business model, we scrutinized our allocation of resources and maintain a constant intense focus on our spending choices every day. Today, we want to tie together all the components of our economic model and share that with you. Our experience to date conducting space flights on a monthly basis has validated our assumptions around our operating costs and the economies of scale we expect to achieve as we expand our fleet. Historically, the design and operations of human spacecraft made regular repeatable flight operations with individual space vehicles complex and time-consuming. And therefore, the cost of human space travel was prohibitively high. 

While the space industry typically measures turnaround time between flights of a single vehicle in months, Virgin Galactic's new delta ships are being built to operate with an average turnaround time of just 3 days, an enormous breakthrough that structurally changes the cost of human space light. The design of our space light system enables each spaceship to fly hundreds of customers to space each year, significantly increasing number of people are able to make the journey while also bringing costs down. Turning to Slide 4. Let's take a closer look at the economics of the business. After an initial ramp-up period following the launch of our first 2 Delta class spaceships, we expect to have capacity to deliver approximately 125 space flights per year, with 6 seats per spaceship and at current pricing of $600,000 per seat, this would allow for an annualized revenue of $450 million. 

Turning to Slide 5. As we then expand our fleet by adding another mothership and 2 more space ships, we expect flight capacity to increase to around 275 flights per year, with annual revenue growing to approximately $1 billion. This impressive revenue level is delivered with around 1,650 seats sold per year. With an estimated total addressable market or TAM of 300,000 customers growing at 8% per year, we would still only be fulfilling less than 1% of global demand. This further supports our pricing opportunities as demand is expected to far outstrip supply even as we scale. With substantial unmet demand, we plan to further expand our fleet to build out additional space sports in other parts of the globe. The addition of a fully operational second space port would enable combined revenue of around $2 billion per year at current prices. 

Turning to Slide 6. This table helps illustrate how Virgin Galactic's business grows as the fleet expands over time. Virgin Galactic's business model not only drives significant revenue growth, but is also expected to drive exponential growth in profits. With our initial launch fleet of 2 Delta class ships and one mothership reaches steady state flight operations, we expect adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to exceed $100 million per year. This represents a very healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of around 20% to 25%. As more space ships are added to our fleet, fixed cost leverage allows profits to grow exponentially. By adding another mothership and 2 more spaceships, profits now have the potential to grow up to $0.5 billion annually, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to around 45% to 50%. This estimated margin expansion is due to much of the cost structure of our business remaining fixed, even as frequency of flights increases. 

Profits are expected to increase even further as additional spaceports are developed around the world. As you can see on the chart, with 2 fully utilized spaceports, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be roughly $1 billion per year, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 50% to 55%. The business model of that magnitude of profit growth is extraordinary. It's that profit potential, combined with the tremendous experience of human spaceflight, we are delivering that motivates all of us at Virgin Galactic every day. We are currently focused on building the components of this powerful economic engine. We're investing in the manufacturing capacity for the assembly of spaces. We are building the capability to make additional spaceships as an estimated recurring cost of $50 million to $60 million apiece. As we have said before, we expect a payback period of less than 6 months for incremental vehicles, which is exceptional for sizable capital investments. 

We have built and maintained our balance sheet to realize this profitable business model. We are pleased to announce that we have substantially completed our $400 million at the market or ATM equity offering program. As of the date of this call, we have raised $394 million through this ATM, bolstering the balance sheet and ensuring we have the liquidity needed to bring our first 2 delta class spaceships into service. As we've outlined, with our first 2 delta ships in service, we can generate over $100 million of adjusted EBITDA annually, and we have the resources to get there. But that's not our endgame. But the chart shows the exponential growth and profitability that we estimate will be delivered as we add 2 additional spaceships and additional mothership to our fleet and spaceport America, New Mexico. As shown in the middle column of this chart, these few additional ships are projected to generate up to $500 million adjusted EBITDA per year at current price points as they leverage the fixed costs that will have already been put in place. 

While we forecast our current resources are sufficient to profitably launch our business, we have the option to seek additional growth capital in order to accelerate our profit generation by enabling the faster acquisition of more vehicles. To recap and summarize the business model, the unprecedented value we deliver to our customers enables high margins from spaceflights. We expect this margin will substantially exceed the fixed cost of running our business as we scale. We project high adjusted EBITDA margins for our business model, and those margins are expected to grow exponentially as we add vehicles to our fleet. We are investing capital now to develop the tools, manufacturing capacity and initial spaceships needed to deliver this highly profitable business model. Day in and day out, we maintain our fiscal discipline, scrutinizing our spending in great detail to ensure we are positioned to complete our mission. I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael to share the progress we've been making on our Delta Class Spaceship program. Thanks, Doug. Turning to Slide 7. Progress on our Delta Class Spaceship program was substantial in Q2. Our engineering team has been accelerating the pace of design completion, which has enabled more and more tool fabrication to get underway. In the next month, our teams will begin to pivot from a primary focus on design completion to primary focus on the build and test phases of our production spaceships. The video I mentioned at the start of the call provides an excellent overview of our Delta spaceship design and provides a good way to visually understand the enormous amount of work that has been delivered by our Virgin Galactic engineering team as well as by our key partners at Bell Textron and Carbon Aerospace. While the design phase has been wrapping up, we have already released key tools that will be used to build the parts of our Delta spaceships. 

Here, on Pages 7 and 8, you can see examples of the tools that will be used to build major parts of the fuselage. Most of these parts will be built and assembled in Texas at our partners' facilities, and they will then be shipped to our new final assembly campus in Phoenix. For those who are unfamiliar with aerospace parts fabrication, these images show examples of tools similar to molds that will be used to make the parts of our spaceships. The images of the metallic objects are examples of tools that have already been built. These tools are important assets that can be used time and time again to create the parts needed for our entire fleet of spaceships, which allows us to rapidly expand our spaceship fleet in a cost-effective fashion. Another asset we have completed is our final assembly campus located in Phoenix. We received final certificates of occupancy for our 2 buildings in Phoenix in July, and an advanced team is now developing detailed assembly plans as well as training and rehearsal materials while preparing to receive assembly tools and equipment. You can see an image of the completed buildings on Page 9. 

Our Delta spaceship program remains on track to deliver ships into commercial service in 2026. As I mentioned, we expect to pivot our primary focus to the build and test phases of the Delta spaceship program in Q3, with tool development accelerating in both the third and fourth quarter and parts fabrication ramping up in Q4. We expect to receive major parts and subassemblies into our Phoenix campus in the first half of 2025 with rollout and testing of our first delta ship commencing in the second half of 2025. As we shared before, we plan to be running major systems test with our iron bird testbed and structural test with a static test article in parallel to all these efforts in order to have an efficient integrated vehicle ground testing phase commencing in the second half of '25. We will be sharing updates against all these milestones in the months and quarters ahead, so our investors can track along with our development progress. Doug, I'll hand the call back to you to cover the financial results from the second quarter. Thanks, Michael. Turning to Slide 10. We generated revenue of $4 million driven by the Galactic 07 commercial spaceflight and future astronaut membership fees. Notably, average ticket prices for the Galactic 07 flight were approximately $900,000 per seat. Total operating expenses were $106 million compared to $141 million in the prior year period, driven by both lower R&D and SG&A expenses. Capital expenditures were $34 million compared to $10 million in the prior year period as we ramped up investment in property, plant and equipment related to development of our Delta class fleet. Free cash flow was negative $114 million in the second quarter compared to negative $135 million in the same period last year. 

Turning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet remains strong with $821 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Moving to our projections. Forecasted free cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of negative $115 million to $125 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Michael. Thank you, Doug. I recently hit my 4-year anniversary of Virgin Galactic, having joined the company in the year after it went public. I have never been more excited by both our progress and our potential as the goal of high frequency, highly meaningful and highly profitable human space light is in clear sight. We have built a customer experience that is unparalleled. The value perceived by our customers is off the charts and will drive our top line growth as we expand our fleet. Production model space ships currently in development are game changers in human space flight. The reusability and turn time capabilities being built into the delta ships are planned to deliver high capacity with an industry-leading cost structure, driving solid profitability as we launch and outstanding profitability as we expand our fleet. Q3 will mark a new phase for our Delta spaceship program as we transition from a focus on design to a focus on building and testing. This is exciting, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress. Operator, let's open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Maybe just to start on the 2 spaceport scenario, when do you expect to see any decision being made? How are discussions going? And is there maybe the potential to tie a second space or to any potential growth capital needs? I think we've always said, generally from the time we really get serious. I think that's a 4- to 5-year effort to bring a new spaceport online, by the time you work through all the needs of government, aerospace and depending upon the location, what needs to be done from a facility infrastructure standpoint. So, for us, that wants to generally be happening in '25, although we are actively talking to various entities that are interested in this along the way. So generally, I think it's a 4- to 5-year piece. And I think 25% is the window when you would see us -- probably wanting to talk about something there. And then to your question on is that partnership that would happen most surely with a government entity, I would say, at some level for aerospace. Is there a way to blend that into growth capital. Depending upon the location, the government and the interest there. I think the answer is, yes, that is a possibility. 

Our partnership in Spaceport America is with the state of New Mexico who owns and built that facility and we leased that from them. So, the major investment in that first space port was in the physical plant. Some of the places that we are considering have a lot of their physical plants built out already and there may be other places where we could partner collectively to create a good economic engine for the community in which we enter. So, I think that's a possibility, but I think it's dependent upon the government and the needs that they would have to be what would the specifics of that look like. And then, I appreciate all the data and numbers that you gave. And of course, we always ask for more after you give that, but just thinking about that growth capital on the 2 spaceport. I mean, how do you think about the free cash flow conversion of the company at scale? And how does maybe CapEx play into that, just thinking about the accelerated build of spaceships and just how you can convert that EBITDA to cash. Thanks, Greg. This is Doug. So, we wanted to give you the EBITDA, so you could see what we're generating from the business in terms of operating cash flows. And that's all available to plow back into the business as we see fit. So, we're pleased that, that is a source of capital that we can use to push all back into CapEx if we want or we could scale back if that was the wise choice. But most likely, what we're going to choose to do is invest that because that's how we get more vehicles faster and moves us to the profitable columns as you move to the right. So, we're going to want to invest in those vehicles and bring on new spaceships and motherships as quickly as possible and get to the calls where you see EBITDA expanding shown on the page. And I think to Doug's point, as we invest in additional ships, the cost on those additional ships is coming at a variable basis, right? We will have already completed the upfront cost in the facilities, the upfront cost and the tools, the design will have been done. And so now we're replicating using tools like the examples we showed today, and that gives us new ships at relatively low variable prices and the return on those ships is great. So, anything we do from a CapEx standpoint, I think we're going to look from a ROIC, return on invested capital approach and make sure that we're putting our money to shareholders great use, but I see great return on investment for scaling our ships in our fleet up. And so that would be our primary first choice. Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Hi, Michael and Doug, the addressable market sounds quite attractive. Just what are some of the key assumptions that underpin the 300,000 people at 8% per year? Also, as you mentioned, parts and subassemblies are an important part as we look to next year and the progress you've been making. How are you thinking about the supply chain in the current environment that you're seeing in terms of service and supply chain, and the ability to get the parts and the people that you need? Thanks, Oliver. First, on the TAM estimates. So, whether you think of it as a kind of a cascading filter or a bit of a Venn diagram overlap. We're starting with research on the number of people globally with a net worth of $10 million or above. That particular metric is the one that we expect to see growing at 8% annual growth. So, it's starting there. And then we're filtering that in 2 sets of filters. One is a propensity from -- of people to use a fairly substantial proportion of their net worth on experiences. So, unlike people who may have a lot of net worth and just like to stay at home or invest in other ways. We're definitely filtering for people who prioritize experiential travel in their lives. And then third, a stated interest in space travel, right, and getting a perspective of the earth for space. And so that's kind of the funnel down around there, and that's we package that up with some of our internal understanding with our own team. 

I'll note of our future astronaut group. Probably half are in the $10 million and up range and probably half are less. And I think that just depends on the people who are less prioritize this type of an experience and are willing to put a greater percentage of their available resources towards it. But hopefully, that answers that question. On the supply chain side, we are constantly on top of supply chain issues. So, by no means do I intend to imply we never see an issue or a glitch. On the whole note, we continue to manage them well. So, we have managed the design of these ships ourselves, and we're managing the final assembly for ourselves. I think as you know, we have Bell and Carbon as the primary people that will be creating the major subassemblies there. So, we work with Bell and Carbon for a wider range of vendors to support. Some Bell and Carbon go directly, some we provide as owner-furnished items. And this is in a good way, this is an aerospace program and the aerospace industry is big. There are lots of suppliers, there are lots of availability. 

We are mostly a carbon fiber ship. We have metallics. Those are typical in the aerospace industry, some aluminum, some titanium. And we've been way ahead of ensuring the material orders here that we have the billets, we have the general supplies, and we've been ordering those up early, so it's not to let that get in the way. And then you'll have a situation come up. We had one not too recently where one of the tools as we're refining what you'll hear is the loft of the tools. We're refining the actual shape of what the mold will look like. So, the part will come out correctly. There can be analysis that needs to go in there. And some of our efforts needed to accelerate the analysis that we were doing, and we had to work through the supply chain to be able to make that move at a good pace. We have lots of smaller issues along the way like that. But so far, the major slugs of material, major supply issues we are staying in front of. But it's a week-to-week look and forecast ahead to make sure we remain ahead. Okay. And one follow-up. You've given a lot of clear information on the leverageability of the model as well as the opportunity. The equity value of the stock is pretty modest relative to the opportunity. So, what do you think is more underappreciated in your opinion? It's an open-ended question. I think modest is a gracious term in the way that sentence is phrased Oliver, but thank you. We would agree that the value that is being built into and created by the company is not accurately reflected in the market capitalization value that we currently are seeing. So, what is in the way? Well, what are the risks that I don't think are in the way. I don't think technical risk is the question because we've proved that out with Unity. I don't think it's a safety risk piece, which is what we are demonstrating with all of our flights over the last year. It's not regulatory risk because we've worked through that with our spaceship Unity. And it's not product market fit, not customer risk because that's shown to have great value. So, what's left in that piece is primarily driven by execution risk. Are we going to finish the work that we have and get that done in time and pace and fiscal discipline so as not to create financial risk. And execution risk happens. It's on all manufacturing industries. There's execution risk. How do we handle it? 

We have, first, massive diligence daily across all parts of this program to both make sure we're getting done the work that needed to get done that day, and we're looking forward to make sure that something new isn't on the horizon that needs firefighting. So, that's one. Two, we keep contingency buffer, built within our schedule and our plan. Our teams are not meant to use it, but we also recognize there are unknowns that nobody can fully predict, and we need to have the capacity to absorb those, while also looking for opportunities to improve as well. So, we're managing this very tightly along the way. And personally, if I look at where the market is reacting, I think there's -- must be a heavy weighting into, I think, is less fully informed opinions, and we'll see opinions out of, look, Virgin Galactic is spending money without revenue that must be bad. And while we are in a pre-revenue phase, and we are clearly investing heavy capital in. It's very purposeful because we're building the assets and the infrastructure that will create an incredible company. 

And it's that last part as simple as it sounds, that I don't think is being accurately reflected. So, we have gone to the step of putting out a thoughtful video of our business model. It's 6 minutes. I encourage everybody to watch it, share with your friends. And it lays everything out in succinct fashion. And then let's have the conversation around that. But right now, I believe we're missing some of those important points we're investing for the future, and I think that gets missed perhaps in some of the past. So hopefully, today is a good way to start changing that and getting better balance in information shared. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Good evening, and thanks for the video. You really get the case flow, and I think it was a well-produced overview. Doug, can I focus on Slide 6 for a second. I just want to make sure I understand the economics, particularly the space line operations and SG&A of your initial fleet assumption? Because obviously, if I look at just the first half of this year, you're already annualizing $100 million for space line and $120 million for SG&A. So, how does whatever in those 2 lines change from here to there? Or are you just saying the costs that we're incurring today are going to be the same costs we're going to incur when we're flying 125 flights a year? Yes. Thanks, Myles. So yes, the costs that are in those buckets are very similar to what they are today because what you see growing as we increase the flight rate is the variable costs that go up. So, we bring in the revenue, and then we've got what we showed is variable space like cost, which is rocket motor and the fuel and the hospitality, and all of that, that goes around the flights. But the fixed cost portion is as it's stated, it's fundamentally fixed. The activities in that group varies over time. I mean, right now, they've been working on flying Unity and now we're working on things like getting the factory ready in Phoenix and so on. So, we're -- and we've got people working on Delta programs. That group is still employed and doing different things, and then they shift back into flying. And then you start to see it grow as we add more and more vehicles from there. 

SG&A, also, it's by definition, fundamentally fixed. As we start to fly more, there's no real reason why it would grow more than a modest amount from where we are today in terms of administrative costs. And we've got the sales function is probably the area where you'll see the growth versus the rest of it, which is fairly fixed. So, sales would be the area where we would ramp up over time in that bucket to make sure we have all of the volume that's projected here. But that's really the logic behind it. I know there's an accounting treatment in the R&D line, that part, I guess. The new accounting treatment for the SG&A line because, again, the run rate you have today is $120 million versus that $100 million or so you're targeting. So clearly, something has to go away from what you're doing today within SG&A? Yes, so good observation. So, there's a small portion of this that will get reclassed into R&D or space on operations. We have some kind of functions that are involved in management and so on, in this phase of our operations. But as we shift to flying and we move down the road, you will see some reclassing into those other buckets out of G&A, but not a lot, but the amount you just mentioned. Okay. All right. And then just one quick one. The number of astronauts in the backlog, how stable has that been? I know this maybe 18 months ago, it was $800 million. I think at the end of the year was 750. I think the presentation, the video said approximately 700. Are you curating further the backlog? Is there a little bit of bleed off? What kind of movement are we seeing in the backlog? Mostly you're seeing, I'd say, mostly stability. So, we have been holding the same basic level going through. We flew a number of people over the last year, so that was partly going down. There have been a couple of places where we saw a bigger drop of folks that have come through, but that's pretty stable. Of the folks who have dropped out, the large majority of that have been folks who are very early in the program for various reasons. Some are in a change of life stage. Some may have other issues that have come up, some may have had health issues that have come up. And so, the majority of the people who have stepped away from the program, at least at this stage, have been preponderant. The preponderance of that has been our very early folks. We feel very strong about this group. We stay connected with them. We're working and we go to the various cities where we have large groups of them and give updates on the company. And they're incredibly valuable group of people to us and as a company. 

As we said, we don't have sales open right now. So, we're not actively working to backfill when these open. This still gives us quite a backlog, and we're comfortable with the amount of backlog we have right now. But when we do open up sales, you'll start to see these numbers go up as people kind of come in on the tail end of the line here. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. I wanted to start asking on the free cash flow guidance. I think you previously expected 2024 to be the largest cash burn in support of the Delta class ship. But just given what you've done to date in the 3Q guide, that would imply a 4Q burn of around $135 million, and that's just to be in line with 2023 burn level. So, are you expecting a step-up in cash burn in the fourth quarter, maybe in the $140 million to $150 million range, just assuming that you're still expecting 2024 to be the largest spending year? Thanks, Mike. This is Doug. So yes, we do still expect 2024 to be the largest spending year. It's about flattish to '23, a little higher. We didn't give guidance past Q3, but I can give you some direction that -- as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we do have acceleration of activity going on with the tooling development and parts fabrication. That's a Q3, Q4 activity and trailing into Q1. So, you'll see the kind of local peak could be around the Q4, Q1 time frame. And then you'll start to see things ramp down in Q2, Q3 of 2025. So that's directionally where we see things going. A little lower than the amount you just highlighted, though, not in the level of 150, that kind of number, we're lower than that. Got it. And then any change in how you're thinking about research flights as Delta class starts to ramp? Are you still targeting that 10% or so range of flights slated for research? So, that's the first question. And then secondly, we got to see the research product in action and heard the grade testimonials of some of your customers. Have any more government agencies inquired about research flights now that you've kind of proven the reliability of the offering, given the success of Unity flights? I'll take that one, Mike. The research program and research product that we have has been equally successful, albeit from a different customer lens as our private astronaut place. We typically spend most of our time talking about our private astronauts. But it's very successful because we offer access to a micrography environment that relatively is quite long and quite clean, and at the price point is quite valuable for the price charged. And so, it just kind of wins on every front there. We have had -- I think you probably saw Kelly, Gerard, and a group of researchers have signed on for another research flight. I think you'll see things like that with people who've flown before, we obviously do that with payloads. Lots of our university partners are repeat flyers as they either do new research or use our platform to refine their research before it goes further out to the space station or even beyond. So, the product quality has been very good and the repeat availability of it will be very good. 

Most of our research customers, not all, but most need pretty specific dates. Most of them are government-funded and most government funding requires some specificity of dates. And we're a little far out from getting real specific with our dates, and we know generally there, but the customers need us to be a little more specific. So, as we get closer in, you'll see us also start to ramp up research sales as we also open up private astronaut sales. Now, you asked about 10% I think that's a nice target in the early days. We'll see as we scale this up, right? If you go to Page 6 on this chart, as we start getting to 275, you get to a second spaceport, it's a lot of space flights. I don't have a sense that the market will -- the research market will continue to scale the 10% all the way up. But I definitely think that's the right target in our early periods for sure. I will note, we adjusted our pricing. While we don't have sales open, we do take referrals from existing customers, and as I've always used the term, some house seats that we offer. We've brought those prices into parallel. So, at this point, every seat equivalent, whether it's for a private astronaut, a human researcher or we removed the seat and put a payload rack in, all is at $600,000 on a seat equivalent basis. That's our kind of current off the market price when we really open up sales for the delta ships will reassess our price set again. Then lastly, I appreciate the economics that you provided. Just looking at some of the assumptions, is it 4 spaceships and 2 motherships at Spaceport America before you start to look into expanding into a second space for it. Does that kind of the -- what you need to see before you build a second space court? Is that the expected capacity of a space for in the future? It's not that we need to see that before working on the next phase. We'll definitely start working on the next spaceport even before these delta ships launched in '26. However, it's the smartest place to go first. One thing you'll notice if you start doing the math of ratios of how revenue and contribution margin growing relative to these cost lines growing. And we have a bigger set of leverage as we move from the initial fleet to the expanded fleet, and going from 1 to 2 space points. There are a couple of things behind that. But to the question you're asking, Mike, it's primarily because 2 spaceships and one mothership, that's an imbalance line. It's an underutilized spaceport. We have a lot of our fixed costs in to run baseline operations there, and even in SG&A as one of the earlier questions was talking about that we can fully get leverage on as we add a couple more ships. 

Now this chart shows us with 2 and 4, and then at that point, like moving to an additional space for it. There's -- you've heard us talk about higher than 275 flights in the past. We're trying to be reasonably conservative and not getting too far ahead of what weather will look like when we get to additional spaceports. And so, trying to have a balanced place there. But it may be that it's worth adding a fifth spaceship in each of these things just to have a hot spare ready and being able to pick up additional set of flights along the way. So, you might see us tweak the numbers, but what we have here on the page is where we would like to start each of these base points. This concludes the question-and-answer session. It will also conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.","we will open the call for questions following our prepared remarks . During today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements . these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, and as a result are subject to risks and uncertainties .",1.0
