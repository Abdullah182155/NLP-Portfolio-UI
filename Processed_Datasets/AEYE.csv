Joining us for today's call are AudioEye's CEO, Mr. David Moradi; and CFO, Ms. Kelly Georgevich. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions from the companyâ€™s publishing analysts.
I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay via a link available in the Investor Relations section of the company's site at www.audioeye.com.
Before I turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, the company would like to remind all participants that statements made by AudioEye management during the course of this conference call that are not historical facts are considered to be forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for such forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, confident will and other similar statements of expectation identify forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's press release in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Participants on this call are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect management's belief only as of the date hereof. AudioEye does not undertake any duty to update or correct any forward-looking statements.
Further, management's remarks today will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the company's earnings release posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.audioeye.com.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Moradi. Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us. To begin, we'd like to highlight our strong financial performance and continued focus on efficiencies. We are pleased to announce record revenue of $7.77 million in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with sequential growth in our key performance indicator, annual recurring revenue or ARR, which was $29.6 million up from $29.2 million on December 31, 2022. Gross margins were 78% versus 75% in the year-over-year quarter.Gross profit increased to $6.1 million versus $5.2 million year-over-year, representing a 100% flow-through of additional revenue into gross profit. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year while operating expenses decreased by 8%. Net loss decreased and we achieved a near non-GAAP breakeven versus a $1 million loss in the year-over-year quarter. We were able to achieve near non-GAAP breakeven despite increased R&D investment of approximately $200,000, compared to the first quarter of 2022.
Net cash provided by operating activities improved to $300,000 in the quarter versus net cash used by operating activities of $500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the year-over-year quarter net cash used by operating activities was $1.9 million.
In addition to our positive financial results there are several notable items I'd like to highlight on today's call. As we have said before we believe we are in the early innings of digital accessibility. 97% of websites today remain inaccessible to people with disabilities.
Over the past several years there has been a growing demand for effective accessibility solutions. Demand has increased due to a variety of factors including brand reputation, increased litigation and the ability for companies to generate additional revenue with accessible websites.
AudioEye is a pioneer in digital accessibility and has invented many of the products used in the industry today. We believe that AudioEye has invested more than any other company in the industry into R&D. As a result we have the best product to meet companies wherever they are in their accessibility journey whether they want a comprehensive audit, to understand the scope of the problem, fix issues at the source or want us to fix their site with the most advanced automation and customized JavaScript.
We stand behind our work, when our clients receive demand letters or lawsuits by offering a comprehensive technical and legal analysis, refuting frivolous claims and false positives from online accessibility website scanners. This additional layer of protection helps them reduce or even eliminate their risk exposure.
In March 2023, we successfully defended a customer Babylon Marine, in a precedent ADA case for website accessibility. Babylon had this to say: Before AudioEye, we really didn't know which accessibility vendor was right as there are confusing options out there, including ones that make false promises.
We were confident that AudioEye, could not only solve our accessibility issues but be there as our partner if any issues came up. The AudioEye team, determined, there were no digital accessibility barriers and provided documentation that proved the claims were false.
We appreciate, how AudioEye stepped in to stand behind their solution and customer and how effective they were in resolving the claim. AudioEye was an invaluable partner throughout the entire process."" In most website accessibility lawsuits or demand letters the party receiving the lawsuit will spend money on legal fees, pay a settlement and fix the digital property later.
Most competitors use point-in-time audits or automated-only approaches. Neither work effectively. Many companies want to do the right thing and address digital accessibility, but because of ineffective solutions remain vulnerable to future legal actions, brand risk and subpar customer experiences.
AudioEye utilizes a unique combination of automation technology, including artificial intelligence coupled with industry experts and accessibility compliance and laws to help businesses become and stay compliant. We were pleased to provide clear evidence our solution is effective, while eliminating risk for our customers and making the Internet a better place for people with disabilities.
The next item I'd like to highlight is our AI initiatives, centered on accessibility with members of the Disability Community. We are developing AI models with direct input from people with disabilities to ensure the products and models developed, work in our efforts to eradicate digital accessibility errors at scale. We will have further announcements soon on the specific impact of these initiatives.
Moving on to guidance, we are guiding for sequential revenue growth with revenue of between $7.8 million and $7.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint.
As discussed in the previous earnings call, our results in the first half have been impacted by certain renegotiations. Even with these renegotiations, we are pleased to see sequential revenue and ARR growth.
We continue to expect that, revenue and ARR growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year. With increased R&D investment we continue to expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the second quarter with non-GAAP operating profit in the second half, generating breakeven operating profit for the full year.
We continue to be well capitalized with $5.5 million of cash as of March 31st 2023. We believe the current cash on hand is sufficient to fund operations, and we still expect to generate positive cash flow by the fourth quarter of this year.
I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO, Kelly Georgevich. Kelly? Thank you, David. As just mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter 2023 performance. Q1 2023 marks the 29th straight quarter of record revenue ending Q1 at $7.8 million which was 13% growth year-over-year.
Annual Recurring Revenue or ARR at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $29.6 million a $1.5 million increase from ARR at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Our two revenue channels are continuing to perform well.
As discussed in previous updates, the Partner and Marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners to deploy these same products for their SMB customers.
In the first quarter of 2023 this revenue channel grew 14% year-over-year and represented approximately 56% of revenue and 59% of ARR. We expect to continue to see this channel contribute significantly to our growth in revenue, as we build for further traction and expand with larger partners. The enterprise channel continued to perform well in the quarter growing 11% year-over-year and contributing approximately 44% of revenue and 41% of ARR.
We continue to see longer sales cycles and more price-conscious customers, but overall we are seeing some of our best logo retention rates. Total customer count increased notably in Q1 2023 to approximately 95,000 customers from approximately 74,000 customers at March 31, 2022, and 86,000 customers at December 31, 2022. Both revenue channels contributed towards customer count growth in the quarter with the expansion of platforms as the most material driver of customer count increases.
Gross profit for the first quarter was $6.1 million or about 78% of revenue compared to $5.2 million and 75% of revenue in Q1 of last year. We are pleased to see gross margins continue to increase given the significant investment in our platform including research and development and customer success costs.
We expect gross margin to continue around the 77% to 78% range throughout the remainder of 2023. While revenues increased 13% over the comparable period of prior year operating expense decreased approximately 8% or $700,000 to $8.1 million. This decrease was the result of continued efficiencies in sales and marketing and G&A areas slightly offset by continued investment in R&D.
Our total R&D spend in Q1 2023 was approximately $2.2 million with approximately $475,000 reflected as software development costs in the investing section of the cash flow statement. This total R&D spend is about 29% of our revenue this quarter versus 26% last year and continues to reflect a commitment towards investing in our product and technology to deliver the best product in the market and to ensure companies are protected from risk.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2023 was $2 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.32 per share in the same year-ago period. Total operating loss decreased 44%, or $1.6 million from the comparable period of prior year, thanks to the increase in gross profit as well as strategic and efficient spending in all departments.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net loss was near breakeven at a $53,000 net loss or less than a $0.01 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $1 million, or $0.09 per share in the same year-ago period. The primary adjustments to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q1 2023 were non-cash share-based compensation, litigation, depreciation and amortization. Acquisition costs were also a non-GAAP adjustment in Q1 2022.
Cash usage for the quarter was $1.4 million, which included a $1 million earn-out payment related to the acquisition of the Bureau of Internet Accessibility. The remaining $400,000 of cash burn in the quarter was primarily related to tax payments from employee share-based grants of approximately $250,000 and non-GAAP litigation expenses of approximately $120,000.
With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give instructions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Zach Cummins from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Hi. good afternoon, David and Kelly. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid Q1 results. David just starting with the Partner channel. I mean, a nice jump in new customers added in this quarter. So can you just talk about your progress with partners and how we should think about that progression here in the next few quarters especially as new agreements start to kick in? Hello. Is your line on mute? Yes, I'm guessing, David's line's on mute, but I can jump in here. Overall, we are pleased to see customer count increase and across all channels see that increase. But yes, we are excited about the developments and partnerships overall. As we noted, the biggest driver of those partnership increases, are customer count increases, are the partnership increases from platforms. But yes, making great traction with partners overall and expect that to continue in future quarters. Can you hear me now? Understood. Yes, yes, I can hear you David. Okay. Yes, I was talking for about 15 seconds there. Great. Does that answer your question Zach or do you need more color around that? No, no. I think that's helpful. And I guess David, just building upon it a little bit, I mean obviously, continuing to invest pretty aggressively on the R&D line. Can you talk about some of the opportunities that you see out there that really I guess justifies continuing to invest at this pace into R&D? Yes, we're investing in items that we think are going to have a great payback in the near term. We're going to be adding new products in the near term, that you're going to see and we're investing into our AI capabilities. So that's where the money is going. Got it. And final question just really on the enterprise side of it. I know you mentioned last call, there was a couple of outstanding renewals that were in ongoing conversation. Any sort of update you can provide on either of those situations? Yes. With the -- are you talking about the enterprise side? Yes. Yes, those are still in negotiations. The demand is still there, but there's been large turnover at both of those companies, so we're still in the hunt. We're hopeful, we'll be able to get one of these deals or both of these deals done by the end of the year. It's more a function of a tougher economy. Got it. That's helpful. Well, thanks for taking my questions. And best of luck with the rest of the quarter. Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon guys. David, I'm curious on the sales and marketing efficiencies, have you guys exhausted those efforts at this point or do you think there's still some room for improvement there going forward? Yes. I think, we're pretty exhausted on the efficiencies in sales and marketing. I don't think you'll see more efficiencies there. Yes. Okay, that's fair. And then the second one for me. If we take a step back, you're kind of bumping along here at roughly cash breakeven. Should we assume that moving forward at least in the near term, any incremental cash that you're able to generate you're going to plow right back into sales and marketing to drive revenue? Yes. We are very prudently managing cash and cost overall. We did end Q1 at $5.5 million. Kind of as David mentioned and what plays into it is, we expect the first half to have non-GAAP net loss, but we expect the second half to have non-GAAP profitability. So it is kind of -- does work in line with that. But we do expect, as we mentioned on the call to be cash generating by Q4. And so we are kind of keeping all those factors in mind as we think about the rest of the year. Okay, great. I appreciate that, Kelly. And then last one for me. First congrats on the successful defense. But curious, if there's anything else on the regulatory front that we should be keeping an eye on. Sure. Yes, there is action on the DOJ side. They have something in the works right now on the state and local government, so we're watching that pretty carefully. I appreciate that additional time guys. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. Thank you. David you mentioned that you expect revenues to accelerate meaningfully in the second half. Obviously that would be different than many companies are anticipating at this point. Could you just walk through the logic of how you see that occurring? A good question. When I look at the business outside of the renegotiations, our reseller and platform business have been extremely strong growing at a great clip. So that's where we see the uptick in the second half is really driven by that and an uptick in the enterprise business as well with higher close rate with Michael and his team and what they're doing. So you mentioned that some businesses are seeing additional revenues from having accessibility which for us has always been kind of an interesting dynamic beyond just the litigation. Can you talk as specifically as possible as to what you're hearing in terms of those kinds of numbers? Yeah it's hard to quantify. It could be anywhere from 5% to 10% more revenue potentially. We have a case study on the website I'd invite you to check out but it is hard for us to quantify. Last if I could. On the R&D side I'm curious if you can just give us a picture into how you're thinking of the ROI from some of these investments. And I know some of it is increasing the automation so thus reducing your sort of people-based costs to deal with this. But any sort of detail you can give us on sort of ROI you are targeting from these investments? Yeah. We definitely are considering what the return on investment is for our R&D spend and we do think there is notable investment there. We do see opportunities in front of us that we want to capitalize on and that's why we're funding that effort. In addition to kind of expanding existing features there are additional product sets and products we plan to put out to the market that we're pretty excited about. And so all of that is a factor in what we're investing in for R&D. Okay. Thank you. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moradi for his closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As always, I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call. The conference has now concluded.

Before I turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, the Company would like to remind all participants such statements made by AudioEye management during the course of this conference call, that are not historical facts are considered to be forward-looking statements.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides the safe harbor for such forward-looking statements.

Participants on this call are cautioned not to place under lieu reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's belief only as of the date hereof. AudioEye does not undertake any duty to update or correct any forward-looking statements.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Cheif Executive Officer. Mr. David Moradi. Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. There have been several developments over the last three months, and I'm excited to talk with you about today. But before I do, I want to highlight our solid financial performance and continued focus on efficiencies.
We are pleased to announce record revenue of $7.84 million in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $29.7 million. As discussed previously, our results in the first half of 2023 were impacted by certain contract renegotiations. Despite these renegotiations, we are pleased with sequential revenue and ARR growth and are excited about expected ARR acceleration in the second half.
In the second quarter, gross margins were 77% and gross profit increased to $6 million versus $5.7 million year-over-year, representing a 100% flow-through of additional revenue into gross profit. Continuing to focus on efficiencies, we expect to increase gross margin further in 2024 as we grow revenues. Revenue increased by 4% year-over-year while operating expenses decreased by 3%. Our CFO, Kelly will discuss the financial performance in more detail shortly.
As we have said, we believe we are in the early innings of digital accessibility. 97% of websites today remain inaccessible to people at disabilities despite increased litigation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Last week, the Department of Justice issued a proposed role on website accessibility under Title II of the ADA. The rule would help ensure people with disabilities to have equal access to web content and mobile apps.
The proposed rule will drive more awareness and compliance and we are well positioned as we already work with over 900 government organizations and school districts. As a reminder, the European Accessibility Act previously required all EU member states to adopt logs for companies offering many types of products and services, including websites and e-commerce services to ensure accessibility.
In the EU, companies must provide accessible websites by June of 2025, and the act requires member states to enforce the accessibility requirements. In June, AudioEye shared filings from a collaborative initiative with accessibility experts from the disability community on the effectiveness and impact of generative AI on identifying, fixing and communicating accessibility issues that typically require expert review.
AudioEye's accessibility experts, including those who rely on assisted technology found AI could reduce the time needed to assess and correct the complex accessibility issue such as determining whether a link is clear and accurate by up to 10x. We are currently incorporating AI into our processes and believe there is tremendous potential to increase speed and accuracy in the future.
The North Star for AI is when someone with a disability can't distinguish between an experience and crafted by an accessibility expert or created by an expert trimming AI. That's the only bar that will let anyone claim they solve digital accessibility at scale with AI. And make no mistake, it's a very high bar. While only need it by involving the disability community from day one, getting continuous feedback and actively investing in improving our capabilities over time.
In addition to our findings and initiatives on AI, we recently announced the development and expansion of AudioEye's digital accessibility platform with new enterprise-grade accessibility offerings. The expansion of our product solution includes AudioEye's new accessibility maturity management program and the accessibility health advisers. These program controls use our team of certified experts to assess the Company's current level of accessibility and help define the investments required to make measurable, sustainable progress and accessibility.
Our accessibility maturity management program identifies the people, culture, process and system changes, an organization needs to perform to make accessibility of first-class concern and track progress towards these goals. When new regulations change accessibility guidelines, the health adviser notifies the Company's any changes required to comply. This first-of-its-kind program corresponding tools with the further development of AI automation will be powerful drivers in increasing accessibility at scale.
In addition to our R&D efforts this quarter, I am pleased to confirm that we recently completed the integration of the Bureau of Internet Accessibility, which was acquired in March of '22. We are delighted to have fully integrated BoIA, which will help enable retention and upsells and result in cost savings in the near term. Going forward, we expect the product offering to primarily generate ARR under our subscription model instead of nonrecurring audit revenue.
The impact of the integration of BoIA will reduce third quarter revenue by approximately $200,000 as we transition one-time audit into recurring revenue. Each quarter, we continue to bring on talent and advocates that contribute to AudioEye's success in the future. In July, we were thrilled to announce the addition of forming United States congressman for Arizona's 8 Congressional District Gabby Giffords to our advisory board.
Gabby Giffords is retired United States politician who resigned from Congress in 2012 after sustaining a severe brain injury during annassasination attempt. Today, she helps raise awareness about the facilities. Gabby's influence in the disability community and her passion for change will help AudioEye continue to make great strides in building solutions that close the digital accessibility gap.
Moving on to guidance. We are guiding revenue of between $7.8 million and $7.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, which is flat sequentially. As mentioned, the impact of the integration of BoIA will reduce third quarter revenue by approximately $200,000 as we transition one-time audits into recurring revenue. Business momentum is strengthening, and we anticipate that ARR will increase by approximately $1 million sequentially, representing the fastest growth rate in several quarters.
We expect ARR growth to be driven by an acceleration in our reseller channel and an improvement in our enterprise channel. While the first half of 2023 saw a low single-digit growth rate in ARR as we renegotiate specific contracts, we are pleased to have that process behind us and continue to forecast a return to a higher trajectory in the second half of the year, which we expect will accelerate going forward.
We expect to generate a non-GAAP profit of approximately $100,000 in the third quarter with a further improvement into the fourth quarter. Cash on hand is sufficient to fund our ongoing operations, and we expect to see cash burn decrease going forward. We also expect cash flows to inflect positively by the fourth quarter of the year depending on items such as working capital.
I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO. Kelly. Thank you, David. Q2 2023 marks the 30th straight quarter of record revenue, ending Q2 at $7.84 million, which was 4% growth year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR at the end of the second quarter of 2023 was $29.7 million, a $1 million increase from ARR at the end of the second quarter of 2022.
As David mentioned, we expect ARR growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023, and we anticipate that ARR will increase by approximately $1 million sequentially. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results for Q2 2023, which came within revenue and net loss expectations.
Our two revenue channels are continuing to perform well in a more cost-conscious environment. The Partner and Marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners to deploy these same products for their SMB customers. In the second quarter of 2023, this revenue channel grew 13% year-over-year and represented approximately 56% of revenue and 60% of ARR.
We continue to recognize opportunities for expansion in our existing partners. Overall, we expect to continue to be in this channel contribute significantly to our growth in revenue as we build further traction and expand with larger partners. Our Enterprise revenue channel, which typically consists of our larger customers and organizations made up 44% of revenue and 40% of ARR in the second quarter of 2023.
As mentioned previously, this channel faced additional headwinds in the first half of 2023 with one larger customer contract renegotiations, having an impact on total enterprise revenue in the quarter. Excluding this renegotiation, we continue to grow enterprise ARR year-over-year. We also continue to see great logo retention rates in 2023, with Q2 similar to Q1 2023, showing some of our best logo retention rates to-date.
The total customer count increased notably in Q2 2023 to approximately 104,000 customers from approximately 76,000 customers on June 30, 2022, and 95,000 customers on March 31, 2023. The expansion of platforms was the most material driver of customer count increases. Gross profit for the first quarter was $6 million or about 77% of revenue compared to $5.7 million and 76% of revenue in Q2 of last year.
We are pleased to see the gross margin continue to increase year-over-year given the significant investment in our platform products and customer success. While revenues increased 4% over the comparable period of prior year, operating expenses decreased approximately 3% or $300,000 to $8.1 million.
The decrease was a result of continued efficiencies in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by continued investment in R&D. Our total R&D spend in Q2 2023 was approximately $2.6 million with approximately $526,000 reflected a software development cost in the investing section of the cash flow statement. This total R&D spend is up 33% of our revenue this quarter versus 23% last year.
As David mentioned, the investment in our R&D has allowed us to develop new enterprise-grade technology and programs like our Accessibility Maturity Management Program, Accessibility Health Advisers and new AI driven automation and expert audit.
Net loss in the second quarter of 2023 was $2 million or $0.17 per share compared to $2.6 million or $0.23 per share in the same year ago period. Total net loss decreased 24% or $600,000 in the comparable period of prior year, thanks to the increase in gross profit as well as strategic and efficient spending in all departments.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 net loss was $220,000 or $0.02 per share compared to a net loss of $240,000 or $0.02 per share in the same year ago period. The primary adjustment to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q2 2023 were noncash share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and nonrecurring items. We are pleased to see nonrecurring items decreased substantially in Q2 2023 from the comparable period of prior year.
Cash decreased $1.2 million in the quarter, which was the result of cash outlays for tax payments from employee share-based grants of approximately $200,000, non-GAAP litigation expenses of approximately $200,000, software capitalization costs of $500,000 and $300,000 of net cash used from other operating activities.
With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give instructions. Thank you. We will now take questions from the Company's publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Zack Cummins from B. Riley. Please proceed. David, just starting with the outlook for ARR, I mean, increasing in Q3. I mean can you just talk about some of the factors that are driving that expansion there? Is it mainly just continuing to ramp with some of your partners? Or are we getting a pretty meaningful bump from those renegotiated agreements coming back online here in the second half? Yes. Good question. We expect both our Partner and Enterprise channel to contribute to the growth going forward in ARR. We have our new revenue team ramping up. The pipeline is starting to build -- building a lot of improvement in processes, systems and people. We're seeing great traction in the partner channel as well, and our partners are seeing a lot of success in selling the product. The renegotiation you mentioned, did slow growth earlier this year, but as we move away, those core growth -- the core growth is there, and we expect to accelerate even more -- and I think with the new enterprise products, those are a game changer in the industry as they start to ramp up, we should really start to accelerate. Understood. And can you just talk about the integration with BoIA in terms of transitioning some of that revenue into recurring in nature and kind of what sort of benefit that gives to do that integration? Yes, I'm happy to talk about that a bit back. Yes, we're excited that we are to complete the integration of the BoIA and deliver more value to those customers under our model. Historically, they've been essentially one-time audits that are one-time in revenue, and we see opportunity to up-sell like the same customers and retain customers with our set of products and some of the automation and additional things we can offer to them. It does have a one-time impact in Q3, but we see the value in recurring revenue, both for the customers with the recurring products and automation and also on our end, and ARR tick up from BoIA customers going forward. Got it. And final question for me is really just around the expenses going forward. I mean, company expecting to flip to positive non-GAAP income in Q3 and positive free cash flow in Q4. Are you expecting to see a ramp down in development expenses now that you have some of the AI products and enterprise expanded capabilities out in the market? Or how should we think about investments going forward? Yes, we did invest quite notably in R&D in 2023. We have a really high-performing team and we're excited on the products we're delivering. In the last six months specifically, but over the last couple of years, and we do see more products coming down the pipe. And so,, we're happy with that investment. We do also see a large opportunity to scale up our revenue or especially with the new enterprise products that we're introducing. And so, I think we'd expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing as we generate more profit going forward. Understood. Thanks for taking the question. Best of luck with the rest of the quarter. Our next question comes from George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Please proceed. Thank you David, I want to address the low penetration rate we've seen thus far in terms of compliance and what some of these things we'll do like the NPRM from the Justice Department relative to pursuing a much larger opportunity and then also the EU in terms of how significant that might be in that market? And then how you are attacking those specific markets? Sure. I'm not sure there's going to be a large revenue effect in the near term with the DOJ efforts, but I expect over the longer term, call it, one to two years, you're going to see a meaningful ramp with state and local governments. And I think the DOJ is thinking about the private sector as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they take some action there, which could be very, very meaningful. With EU, they're on track for 2025. It's pretty comprehensive. It covers many websites, except for really the smallest ones. It's a very large TAM here. We estimate the TAM of around $3 billion. And more specifically, how do you go after seeing local governments today? And how might that change -- and on the EU side, how are you positioned to go after opportunities there? Yes, just blocking and tackling with the revenue or and selling -- setting up a sales office over in London, probably first quarter of next year is what we're thinking. But it's just really blocking tackling. We have the product now. So just about going out and getting the business. And lastly, to be clear on the EU when the compliance date is June of '25. My assumption is not everyone is completing that the end of June of '25. Can you just walk through how you anticipate seeing people begin to comply? Like everything in life, some will do it a year early. Some will do it a little bit late. It's all over the Board is what we saw with AODA in Canada. So, it's really just depends on the Company themselves. Our next question comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainright. Please proceed. Just a quick one, guys. The contingent consideration, I saw that move to current assets. Is that paid in cash? Or do you have the option to pay that in stock for shares? The purchase agreement has a cash payment. It's contingent based on 2022 and 2023 performance of the BoIA but it is a cash payment. And the second contingent payments is like a Q2, 2024 time period. Great. I appreciate it. That's it for me, guys. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moradi for closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As always, I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call. Before we conclude today's call, I would like to remind everyone that a recording of today's call will be available for replay via a link available in the Investors section of the Company's website.

Joining us for today's call are AudioEye's CEO, Mr. David Moradi; and CFO, Ms. Kelly Georgevich.
[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay via a link available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.audioeye.com.
Before I turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, the company would like to remind all participants that statements made by AudioEye management during the course of this conference call that are not historical facts are considered to be forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for such forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, confident, will; and other similar statements of expectation identify forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events; and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's press release; in the comments made during this conference call; and in the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Participants on this call are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs only as of the date hereof. AudioEye does not undertake any duty to update or correct any forward-looking statements.
Further, management's remarks today will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the company's earnings release posted in the Investor Relations section of its website at www.audioeye.com.
Now I would like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Moradi.
Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
We've been hard at work and are pleased to deliver several exciting announcements: first, record annual recurring revenue or ARR of $30.5 million, an increase of approximately $800,000 sequentially, representing the largest sequential growth in 6 quarters; second, revenue of $7.84 million, representing the 31st sequential quarter of record revenue; record reported non-GAAP profitability of $300,000 in the third quarter, ahead of expectations of $100,000. Lastly, we remain on track to deliver positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Kelly will discuss the financial performance in more detail shortly.
During the quarter, we released the industry's first digital accessibility index report. The results confirmed that traditional consulting approaches to solving web accessibility have failed and that mostly Internet remains inaccessible for those with disability. As part of the study, AudioEye conducted an automated scan of over 2 million pages across 40,000 websites from companies with over $100 million in annual revenue. More than 3 billion site-specific elements were tested, including images, links and headers. Following the scan, accessibility experts, including members of the disability community, audited the top sites in each industry, revealing which issues are most disruptive to users. Of the 3 billion website elements tested, the findings concluded every page had at least one accessibility error. And the average page had 37 items that failed one of the success criteria of WCAG.
Our study found that the most frequent barriers were related to image accessibility, descriptive links and keyboard accessibility, which significantly impacts people with a disability in the world trying to utilize the Internet. The barriers found were significant: preventing people with disabilities from accomplishing critical tasks that many of us regularly depend on such as online shopping, banking, news archives and job-related activities. AudioEye has the best product in the market to solve digital accessibility at scale, utilizing a unique combination of AI coupled with a scalable approach to leverage human-assisted technology to catch errors that technology alone cannot detect.
Recently, we also shared findings from an analysis of over 900 legal claims from over 100 lawsuits and demand letters. The data is compelling. Customers using AudioEye managed plans are 67% less likely to receive a lawsuit with a valid WCAG issue compared to competitors, offering the highest rates of protection against legal claims in the industry. In addition, while digital accessibility lawsuits increased year-over-year, lawsuits against AudioEye customers are decreasing. In the first half of 2023, lawsuits against AudioEye customers decreased by over 33% compared to the first half of '22 despite an increase in industry-wide lawsuits.
Moving on to guidance. We are guiding revenues between $7.9 million and $8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter will see the final sequential impacts of onetime revenue from the BoIA integration. We expect to generate a sequential increase in non-GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter and remain on track to deliver free cash flow in the quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO.
Kelly? Thank you, David.
Q3 2023 marks the 31st straight quarter of record revenue with $7.84 million, which represents 2% growth over the comparable period of prior year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR at the end of the third quarter of 2023 was $30.5 million, an $800,000 increase from ARR at the end of the second quarter of 2023 and represents an ARR annualized growth rate of 10.8%. We were pleased to see ARR grow at its highest rate in 1.5 years.
Our 2 revenue channels are continuing to deliver solid performance. The Partner and Marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners to deploy these same products for their SMB customers. In the third quarter of 2023, this revenue channel grew 14% year-over-year and represented approximately 59% of revenue and 61% of ARR. Q3 2023 saw the highest growth in ARR for the Partner and Marketplace channel since Q4 of 2020, with growth coming from a variety of sources within this channel. We expect this momentum to continue in the next quarter.
Our Enterprise revenue channel, which [ typically consists ] of our larger customers and organizations, made up 41% of revenue and 39% of ARR in the third quarter of 2023. As mentioned previously, this channel faced additional headwinds in the first half of 2023, with one large customer contract renegotiations having an impact on total Enterprise revenue which we expect to normalize in the first half of 2024.
We have seen early success in the integration of BoIA and selling existing customers an expanded suite of services, so as expected, the conversion of onetime audit revenue to reoccurring (sic) [ recurring ] services did have an approximately $200,000 impact to Q3's 2023 revenue. Our Q4 revenue guidance incorporates a lesser impact to complete this process.
The total customer count increased notably in Q3 2023 to approximately 107,000 customers from approximately 81,000 customers on September 30, 2022, and 104,000 customers on June 30, 2023. Increase in the customer count was the result of customer additions in our Partner and Marketplace channel.
Gross profit for the third quarter was $6.1 million or about 77% of revenue compared to $5.8 million and 75% of revenue in Q3 of last year. We continue to gain efficiency in the delivering of our products and services, which has resulted in lower cost of revenue while revenues increased.
While revenues were relatively consistent with the comparable period of prior year with 2% growth, operating expenses decreased approximately 8% or $600,000 to $7.4 million. This decrease was the result of continued efficiencies in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by continued investments in R&D.
Our total R&D spend in Q3 2023 was approximately $2.4 million, with approximately $500,000 reflected as software development costs in the investing section of the cash flow statement. The total R&D spend is about 31% of our revenue this quarter versus 33% sequentially. We have invested notably in R&D over the last 12 months, improving our software and adding new products. We expect R&D investment as a percent of revenue to continue coming down over the next few quarters.
Net loss in the third quarter of 2023 was $1.4 million or $0.11 per share compared to $2.3 million or $0.20 per share in the same year ago period. Total net loss decreased 41% or $900,000 from the comparable period of prior year, thanks to an increase in gross profit as well as strategic and efficient spending in all departments.
On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net profit was $300,000 or $0.02 per share compared to a net profit of $100,000 and $0.01 per share in the same year ago period. The primary adjustments to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q3 2023 were noncash share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other nonreoccurring (sic) [ nonrecurring ] items.
Cash decreased by $1 million in the quarter, which was a result of cash outlays for tax payments from employee share-based grants of approximately $100,000, non-GAAP litigation expenses of approximately $100,000, software capitalization of $500,000 and $300,000 of net cash used from other operating activities. As David mentioned, we expect to generate free cash flow and build cash in the fourth quarter.
With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give instructions. We will now take questions from the company's publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum. David, I wondered if you could work for a second with us on the DOJ proposed rule. The comment period ended last month, meaning we should get a final rule in the relative near term. I assume, like us, you were actively reading the comments and have a bit of perspective, so I'm just curious what your perspective would be relative to the final rule. And then separate from that, how are you thinking of positioning the business to benefit from that ultimate rule? Yes, as you said -- it's a good question. There was a 60-day comment period. We're really excited about this for Title II. Hopefully, we hear something soon. And we're ramping up, looking at this for the government sector as well in terms of what we're going to do on sales and marketing initiatives, but we think we're going to have some time. Demand probably picks up on this after the rule comes out in [ 1 to 2 years ]. Separate from that, you've talked about building out your sales team over the last couple of quarters. Can you just give us an update on the go-to-market plans and sort of how that feeds into your expectations for 2024? You're talking about the Enterprise sales team, right? Yes. Yes. We expect this process to ramp up over the next few months. We just hired these folks back in July, August. So they take about 6 months to ramp, but we're seeing really good progress, so far. And pipeline is also building, so that gives us a lot of confidence we're going to see good growth into 2024. And I understand you're not giving guidance yet on '24, but good growth in 2024, any perspective on what that might look like? More than '23, '23 to '22. Our next question comes from Zach Cummins with B. Riley FBR. Congrats on the sequential increase in the ARR and strong profitability in this quarter. David, just starting off, I mean, can you talk a little bit more about the current environment, just speaking more so to the selling environment on both the Partner and Marketplace side -- and obviously Enterprise will take a little more time to ramp up in accordance with your sales team. But just curious on your perspective of the overall environment. And what's driving your confidence in continued ARR growth? Yes. The macro environment is a bit tough out there. You're seeing some tightness on enterprise budgets. People are looking to cut costs, but we are seeing good pipeline growth because of our products and positioning. But there are definitely budget and cost pressures. I'm sure you're seeing that as well out there in enterprise SaaS. Got it. And in terms of the, I guess, time line to positive free cash flow, good to see that reaffirmed here in Q4. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the necessary capital to continue to execute upon growth plans moving forward. Say demand really starts to pick up or you execute on the Enterprise side. Just how you're thinking about available or necessary capital you need to run the business. Yes. I can take that, Zach. We do continue to believe that we have sufficient cash on hand to fund ongoing operations. We do expect revenue, with the momentum on the partnership side and expansion on the Enterprise side, to grow and a lot of that to drop to the bottom line. And so we feel good about our cash position and where we stand, especially with the generation expected in Q4 and beyond. Understood. And final question for me is you are now going to have multiple quarters in a row of improving profitability. What's the approach to investing in growth versus continuing to expand margins here in the foreseeable future? Yes, it's a good question. We look at things holistically on the business, decide if we should invest more into sales and marketing, with LTV-to-cap ratios, or more into R&D, but we think that's coming down. Or we buy back stock with cash generation. That's a possibility. Our next question comes from Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright. Just a couple for me. First one, on gross margin. So nice year-over-year expansion, but it looks like it's kind of stalled out here in the kind of just last couple of quarters. Are we at the ceiling here for gross margin, or do you think you have a little bit more room to push higher? We are happy to see gross margin grow year-over-year. I think we have proven we can find efficiencies in cost of revenue. We did that over the last year. As we continue to grow revenue, we expect to continue to see efficiencies. And we do think there is the ability to continue to grow gross margins going forward. Great. Second one for me: You talked about R&D expense coming down a bit over the next few quarters. Is that due to cash constraints? Or is that more intentional and just in terms of what you need to move the business forward? Yes, we've invested a lot in R&D over the past year, really improved the software. And new products are out there, so we expect R&D is in a good place. And investments should come down as a percentage of revenue over the next few quarters, more in line with industry metrics, which would be around 25% [ in SaaS ]. And I'm sorry. You said you were at 31% in the quarter. Is that correct? Correct. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moradi for his closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As always, I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call.

Now I would like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Moradi. Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. Today, I will discuss a few of the accomplishments since joining AudioEye in 2019 and why we are on the strongest trajectory in our history. But first, I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work to get us here.
As the largest investor and shareholder, I initially joined the Board in 2019 as Chair of the Strategic Committee of the Board of Directors to address operating efficiency and strategy. While AudioEye was growing off a small revenue base, operating efficiency needed to improve. Gross margins were in the mid-50s. Adjusted EBITDA margins were in the mid-negative 60s and revenue per employee was in the low $100,000 range. The company is in a much stronger position today. We have tripled revenue and dramatically improved operating efficiency. Gross margins have improved to the high 70s and adjusted EBITDA margins have improved by approximately 80 points to 17% in the fourth quarter. Revenue per employee is approaching $300,000.
These efficiency metrics are now in the top tier of SaaS companies. We are entering 2024 ready to capitalize on all this hard work. Our operating leverage will allow us to drive future revenue growth with only moderate increases in operating expenditures. The fourth quarter was an inflection point. We achieved gross margins of 78% and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million, while generating approximately $900,000 of free cash flow. We delivered solid ARR growth of approximately $700,000 sequentially and we ended the year with 110,000 paying customers, the most of anyone in the digital accessibility industry.
The product development team has accomplished a lot over this time. After building a new platform and migrating all of our customers over, we invested further into products for Enterprise customers. I'm pleased to report that we are seeing this bet pay off with one of the best Enterprise ARR growth quarters to date.
Our balance sheet is strong. As Kelly will discuss, we received a $7 million term loan from SG Partners in November of last year. The term loan did not include any one or other equity dilution. The Board and management remain highly aligned with shareholders. In November, the Board announced a stock buyback of $5 million. As of March 5, we have repurchased 437,000 shares at an average price of $4.87. In addition, under our previous stock buyback announced in June of 2022, we bought 139,000 shares at an average price of $5.44. Combining both programs, we have repurchased approximately 5% of the shares outstanding over the last 2 years at a valuation below 2x revenue for the benefit of long-term shareholders.
Lastly, management and members of the Board have purchased approximately 350,000 shares on the open market over the last 2.5 years. We have also invested substantially in R&D, to our knowledge, the most of anyone in the industry. Our investment in R&D allows us to meet customers wherever they are in their accessibility journey from the smallest businesses to large enterprise customers.
We recently announced a few new products and features. AudioEye's accessibility testing SDK allows developers to identify and quickly address accessibility issues at the source empowering them to implement changes in preproduction environments proactively. Recognizing the need for consistency in issue detection, the SDK employs the same automated test logic utilized by AudioEye's accessibility experts during customer site audits and automated monitoring.
With SSO, we addressed the stringent security requirements of Enterprise clients, providing a deeper level of security and policy adherence. We continue to improve our rules engine and have made ongoing quality improvements to the test suite, incorporating advanced rules that more accurately test the compliance with current legal guidelines, further improving our industry-leading lawsuit protection. Awareness of digital accessibility has grown and private plaintiff attorneys are following record levels of digital accessibility lawsuits under the ADA.
Further, we expect that a significant driver of future demand will come from the regulatory environment. In 2023, the Department of Justice proposed comprehensive accessibility regulations under Title II of the ADA. We expect further development and updates over the course of 2024. Also, several bills and regulations are currently being considered at the State level.
Lastly, the European Accessibility Act requires businesses in the EU to have accessible websites and mobile apps by June of 2025 or face the fine. Approximately 96% to 97% of all websites on the Internet remain inaccessible. It has become clear that the old way of trying to fix issues at the source does not scale and will not solve the problem. Our approach of combining AI with human-assisted technology is the only way to solve this problem at scale.
One of the most respected leaders in digital accessibility, Mike Paciello recently joined AudioEye as Chief Accessibility Officer. He also believes that the old way is not working and a new vision is needed to meet the scale of the problem. Mike is a pioneer of digital accessibility with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in the digital world. Mike brings over 40 years of expertise to this critical role, including offering the first book on web accessibility, founding The Paciello Group, a pioneering accessibility solution provider and co-founding and co-chairing accessibility industry committees to drive advancements in policies and legislation.
As a former co-chair of the United States Federal Access for Telecommunications and Electronics and Information Technology Advisory Committee and recognized by President Bill Clinton for his contribution to the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative, Mike has played a pivotal role in shaping accessibility standards and practices.
Moving on to guidance. For the first quarter, we are guiding for revenue between $8 million and $8.1 million. With social security factors and other beginning of year expenses, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA between $700,000 to $900,000 on adjusted EPS of $0.06 to $0.08 per share. We are entering 2024 with strong business momentum. In addition to continued operating margin improvement, we expect revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year. For 2024, we are guiding for revenue of between $34 million to $34.4 million, with growth rates approaching high teens by the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $3.5 million and $4.5 million and adjusted EPS between $0.29 and $0.38 per share.
I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO, Kelly. Thank you, David. As David discussed, revenue again hit record levels in Q4 2023 with revenue at $7.87 million, a 2% increase from Q4 2022 and a minor increase sequentially from Q3 2023. On a full year basis, in 2023, our revenue grew 5% to $31.3 million from $29.9 million. As we have discussed on previous earnings calls, 2023 was impacted by several contract renegotiations.
Turning to channels. The Partner and Marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners to deploy these same products for their SMB customers. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our Partner and Marketplace channel grew 10% year-over-year and represented approximately 59% of revenue and 60% of ARR. On a full year basis in 2023, this channel's revenue grew 13% from $16 million of revenue in 2022 to $18 million in 2023.
We continue to see expansion of existing customers and additional partners engaging with AudioEye, which continues to fuel growth. AudioEye's Enterprise channel consists of our larger customers and organizations, including those with non-platform custom websites, who generally engage directly with AudioEye's sales personnel for pricing and solutions. Last year, the Enterprise channel was impacted by a large enterprise customer rolling off. However, with the momentum we are seeing in Enterprise growth, we expect to resume year-over-year growth in Q2 2024.
In Q4 2023, the Enterprise channel contributed approximately 41% of revenue and 40% of ARR. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 was $31.2 million, a 7% increase over ARR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. ARR grew approximately $700,000 sequentially and as David mentioned, we expect this growth to accelerate going into 2024.
On December 31, 2023, our customer count was approximately 110,000, an increase from 107,000 customers on September 30, 2023, and an increase of approximately 24,000 customers from December 31, 2022. The increase in customer count was driven by additions in the Partner and Marketplace channel.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $6.2 million or about 78% of revenue compared to $6 million and 77% of revenue in Q4 of last year. For the full year 2023, our gross margins were approximately 78% with gross profit increasing from $22.7 million in 2022 to $24.3 million in 2023.
There are several factors that go into cost of revenue, including web hosting, customer support and other costs directly related to delivering the product. In 2023, we were able to drive these costs down while also earning revenue and adding additional value to our customers. As we continue to implement efficiencies, we believe gross margin has room to expand in future quarters.
While revenues were up 2%, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 16% to $6.7 million from $7.9 million in the same quarter last year. On a full year basis, revenue increased 5%, while operating expenses decreased $2.8 million from $33.1 million in 2022 to $30.3 million in 2023. The annual year-over-year decrease was driven primarily from efficiencies implemented in sales and marketing, which is continuing to produce impressive lead generation with lower investment needed and lower stock compensation and other nonrecurring expenses partially offset by investments in R&D.
In Q4 2023, with major R&D initiatives completed, we were able to gain more efficiencies in R&D. Our total R&D spend in Q4 was approximately $1.7 million with approximately $465,000 reflected as software development costs in the investing section of the cash flow statement. This was down from approximately $2.4 million in Q3 2023. R&D spend for the full year 2023 was $8.9 million, inclusive of $1.9 million reflected as software development costs. The total R&D spend is around 22% of our Q4 and 29% of our full year 2023 revenue compared to 25% of Q4 2022 revenue and 24% of full year 2022 revenue. We feel the current investment in R&D is appropriate for 2024.
Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $500,000 or $0.04 per share compared to a net loss of $1.9 million or $0.17 per share in the same year ago period. On a full year basis, net loss for 2023 was $5.9 million or $0.50 per share compared to a net loss of $10.4 million or $0.91 per share in 2022. This is a dramatic improvement from net loss a few years ago and as a result of both increases in revenue and efficiencies, including technological investment.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we achieved record profitability with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 million or $0.11 per share compared to adjusted EBITDA of $200,000 or $0.01 per share in the same year ago period. On a full year basis, we also produced adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 million or $0.11 per share compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $900,000 or a loss of $0.08 per share in 2022.
The primary adjustments to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q4 2023 and full year 2023 were noncash share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, noncash valuation adjustments to liabilities related to the earnout of the BOIA and other miscellaneous costs. In November 2023, we partnered with SG Credit Partners for a $7 million term loan. We plan to use the proceeds from the loan for share repurchase and to add additional liquidity to our balance sheet.
In Q4 2023, we implemented a share repurchase program of up to $5 million with $1.1 million of shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2023. As David discussed, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we had a significant milestone, positive free cash flow. In the quarter, we generated $900,000 of free cash flow calculated as adjusted EBITDA of $1.32 million less $465,000 of software development costs. We are pleased we are able to achieve this milestone and expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow in 2024. With the addition of the term loan, our balance sheet is well capitalized with $9.2 million of cash as of December 31, 2023.
With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give instructions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum. Congratulations on the results. I just wanted to walk through what you were defining as an accelerating growth throughout the year ahead and just want to understand the factors behind that. Obviously, we do have some easier comps. But I wanted to make sure I was fully appreciating what's driving the acceleration in growth. Yes. When you look at the guidance, it implies revenues are going to ramp as the year unfolds. So as I said on the call, we're expecting high teens revenue growth in the back half with strong EBITDA margins. Also, the sequential growth rate should pick up and compound even higher than the high teens as we get to the second half, compounded ARR is what I'm talking about. And we expect the Enterprise channel and the Partner and Marketplace channel to contribute to this. EU, by the way, is not in these numbers at all because I know you're about to ask that. We are focused on your investment in Europe. But I would say that you've made some CRM changes. You've added analytics, you've added new salespeople. I wondered if you can give us a bigger explanation of sort of what's driving the go-to-market plan? Yes. I think it's just the full product suite we have now with all that R&D investment we've made. We can meet you wherever you are, whether you're a small business or you're a big, large enterprise. We have this breadth of offering, and I think that's a major competitive advantage. And like you said, there's been a lot of optimization in our go-to-market. So we're seeing some record leads there, and we're seeing the most robust pipeline on the enterprise side in our history. Great. Lastly, if I could bring 2 things together, you mentioned a record number of lawsuits that you're seeing under the ADA. We're obviously, we believe, months away from getting a more defined law from the DOJ. What do you think is driving this record number of lawsuits right now? And is there any way you can quantify that? Most sites are inaccessible on the Internet today, only 3% or 4% of sites are accessible. So lawyers find an easy time suing companies and making money off of this, and that's why you're seeing the record ADA lawsuits. It's just wide open here. I mean, the TAM is humongous, and we're in the early innings. So I can't really quantify how big this is going to be, but it's going to be big. The next question will come from Zach Cummins with B. Riley FBR. Congrats on solid results and the building momentum into 2024. David, just starting off, could you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from that Enterprise team? I know it was a big focus for you throughout 2023 to really build up that motion. So just curious on maybe some of the initial payback you're getting from that investment here in recent months. What do you mean in terms of payback, in terms of ARR or... Yes, in terms of just productivity that you're seeing from that team now that they're fully kind of built out and working towards kind of fully ramped up? Yes. Like I said, the pipeline is building. We've optimized a lot. We have record leads. It's not going to stop. That's just going to continue. I can see it in the demo system we use. And so it's just really clicking. So I'm happy to see that. Got it. And when it comes to the step down in R&D expenses that we saw here in Q4, I mean, can you give me a sense of kind of -- is that really just a wind down of some major projects that you've been working on for multiple quarters in the past? Or what's kind of the appropriate way to think of ongoing R&D expense now? Yes. Look, we made a lot of improvements to our product over the last 2 to 3 years. We're continuing to invest to maintain our lead. But we have completed a number of initiatives in the R&D side. So we were able to drive some efficiencies. So you should expect similar levels of R&D going forward. Got it. And final question is really just on the competitive landscape. Obviously, another acquisition of one of your competitors at the end of last year. So just curious if any evolving nature of that competitive landscape and how AudioEye stacks up amongst this consolidation? Yes. Since PE got a face 3 to 4 years ago, there's been a lot of M&A activity. You've seen buyouts, you've seen capital raises. They think the space is going to grow a lot more, that's why they're putting all this money into this. Competitor was recently taken out either way for about 8x revenue, and that was a subscale company, about $12 million to $13 million in revenue. So the space is clearly consolidating. There'll likely be only a handful of players at the end here. So I think it's a good setup. The next question will come from Scott Buck with H.C. Wainright. First, David, I'm curious, the conditions that set up to high teens year-over-year revenue growth in the back half of this year. Could they potentially carry over into 2025? And I guess I'm asking because I'm curious if we could see that only acceleration of revenue in 2024, but then further acceleration in the following year. I think so. We've turned the corner here and nothing is going to stop this train. And so I think you'll see higher growth rates with EU into 2025 and the DOJ's regulation on the state and local government. This train is leaving the station. Great. That's helpful. And then on the guide, it looks like the adjusted EBITDA margin is somewhere around 12% based on the midpoint. What does the EBITDA margin look like on this business at kind of maturity, I guess? Yes. We'd like to see that in the 17% in Q4 2023. If you look at the guide, it does put you at kind of double-digit. We do expect to accelerate revenue in the second half, and so you can assume EBITDA margins would accelerate kind of at similar rates. So we do think there's an opportunity to the 11% in fiscal year and grow further in the second half of 2024. That's helpful, Kelly. And then last one for me, guys. Just on the buyback. Stock's obviously appreciated quite a bit from where your average purchase price was to date. I'm curious how you guys are feeling about the price today. It's still pretty attractive. I can't get into levels with you, but last I checked, it was around 2x revenue or so. So that's still pretty cheap when companies are getting taken out for 8 times. Congrats on the results. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moradi for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thank you for joining us today. As always, I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call.

Joining us today are AudioEye's CEO, Mr. David Moradi and CFO, Ms. Kelly Georgevich. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions from the company's publishing analysts.
I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay via a link available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.audioeye.com.
Before I turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, the company would like to remind all participants that statements made by AudioEye management during the course of this conference call that are not historical facts are considered to be forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for such forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, confidence, will and other similar statements of expectation identify forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports, on Form 10-Q and in its other reportings and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Participants on this call are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs only as of the date hereof. AudioEye does not undertake any duty to update or correct any forward-looking statements. Further, management's remarks today will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliation of the most direct comparable GAAP financial measures to use these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the company's earnings release or otherwise posted in the Investor Relations section of its website at www.audioeye.com.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Moradi. Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. While it's been approximately 6 weeks since our last earnings call, several developments have occurred that we are excited to discuss today. As our last earnings call mentioned, the fourth quarter was a significant inflection point. We generated record adjusted EBITDA and positive free cash flow while generating solid ARR growth. We are pleased to report that this momentum is continuing and driving the increase in our full year guidance, which I will cover later in the call. But first, I'll discuss the changing regulatory landscape, which we expect to impact the business significantly in 2025 and beyond. .
On April 8, the Department of Justice signed a final rule under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. These regulations mandate that state and local government entities ensure their websites and mobile applications are accessible to people with disabilities following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 2.1 AA. The documents published by the Justice Department estimates $17 billion in implementation costs over the first 3 years and $2 billion annually after the initial phase.
The regulation applies to public schools, community colleges, universities, public hospitals and clinics, state and local police departments, courts, election offices and state and local government offices that provide benefits or social services, like food assistance, health insurance, employment services, libraries, transit agencies and a range of other government-related entities.
The new market opportunity under Title II is significant with most public sites not being accessible today. We are uniquely positioned to meet the demand increase with our direct sales team and our reseller channel.
On the reseller side, we are already partnered with the leading SaaS platforms that serve cities, municipalities and [ K-12 ] education website. We estimate that these partners serve over 80,000 websites, which must all become compliant over the next 2 to 3 years. We are currently penetrated only in the single digits today in these resellers.
A scalable approach [indiscernible] is required to meet the significant demand increase. AudioEye continues to improve its best-in-class technology platform, including investments in the latest artificial intelligence and scaled infrastructure to serve billions of end user sessions and millions of potential customers.
In addition to the Justice Department, we are excited about the opportunity in Europe. As discussed last quarter, the European Accessibility Act takes effect in June 2025 and required digital accessibility for websites and mobile app by that date. We are also seeing regulatory developments in additional jurisdictions, including California's AB 1757 proposal. If passed in its current form, it would expand and solidify the requirement that businesses operate in California must have accessible websites and mobile devices. As noted, we are not including any benefit from these upcoming requirements in our guidance for this year, but we expect meaningful demand increases in 2025 and beyond.
Since joining the company in 2019, the customer count has increased from 3,500 to 112,000 and revenues have more than tripled. We are prepared to support this significant demand increase from the public sector. With the final role just announced 2 weeks ago, we are still early in the planning phase, and we will share more about our outlook beyond 2024 as the year progresses.
In the first quarter, we achieved system and organizational controls, our SOC2 Type 1 compliance. This important milestone underscores our commitment to upholding the highest security and data privacy standards. Achieving [indiscernible] Type 1 compliance was a priority for us as we continue to expand our enterprise channel and service large enterprise organizations. SOC2 Type 1 attainment and products rolled out this past year will further support the enterprise channel's growth initiatives.
The Board and management remain highly aligned with shareholders. Over the last 2.5 years, the number of shares outstanding has remained at similar levels while we are continuing to invest and grow. In the current stock buyback, as of April 23, we have repurchased 548,000 shares at an average price of $5.73. In addition, under our previous buyback announced in June 2022, we bought 139,000 shares at an average of [indiscernible]. Combining both programs, we have purchased approximately 6% of common shares outstanding over the last 2 years at a valuation of around 2x revenue for the benefit of long-term shareholders.
Moving on to guidance. We expect quarterly revenues to accelerate throughout the year without significant additional expense resulting in increased operating leverage and free cash flow generation. For the second quarter, we are guiding revenue between $8.4 million and $8.5 million, representing an annualized growth rate of high teens. We also expect to generate adjusted EBITDA between $1.4 million and $1.5 million and adjusted EPS between $0.12 and $0.13.  We are increasing 2024 revenue guidance to between $34.3 million and $34.7 million. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance by approximately $1 million to between $4.5 million and $5.5 million, with adjusted EPS between $0.38 and $0.46 per share. I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO, Kelly? Thank you, David. As David discussed, revenue again hit record levels with Q1 2024 revenue at $8.1 million, marking our 33rd quarter of record revenue. Annual recurring revenue or ARR at the end of the first quarter of 2024 was $32 million, an $800,000 increase from the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 and representing an ARR annualized growth rate of 10%. We expect this growth to accelerate notably as 2024 progresses.
Our [indiscernible] channels are continuing to deliver strong results. The partner and marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners who deploy these same products for their SMB customers. In the first quarter of 2024, this revenue channel grew 9% year-over-year, representing 59% of revenue and around 60% of ARR. We continue to see expansion of existing partners and new partners contracting with AudioEye, which continues to drive growth.
AudioEye's enterprise channel consists of our larger customers and organizations, including those with non-platform websites, we generally engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for pricing and solutions. The enterprise channel grew 4% sequentially, and we expect to resume year-over-year growth in Q2 2024. In the first quarter, the enterprise channel contributed 41% of revenue and around 40% of ARR.
On March 31, 2024, our customer count was approximately 112,000, an increase from 95,000 customers on March 31, 2023, and an increase of approximately 2,000 customers from December 31, 2023. The increase in customer count was driven by additions in the partner and marketplace channels. Gross profit for the first quarter was $6.3 million or 78% of revenue compared to $6.1 million and 78% of revenue in Q1 of last year. We believe the gross margin has room to expand in future quarters.
While revenues increased approximately $300,000 from the first quarter of 2023, operating expenses decreased approximately 14% or $1.2 million to $7 million. The decrease was primarily due to increased efficiencies in sales and marketing, the completion of significant initiatives in R&D and lower G&A expenses. Our total R&D spend in Q1 2024 was approximately $1.8 million, with approximately $490,000 reflected the software development costs in the investing section of the cash flow statement. This was down from approximately $2.2 million in Q1 2023. The total R&D spend is about 22% of our revenue this quarter versus 29% in the comparable period of prior year and consistent with Q4 2023 investment. We continue to believe that current investment in R&D is appropriate for 2024.
Net loss in the first quarter of 2024 was $800,000 or $0.07 per share compared to $2 million and $0.17 per share in the same year ago period. Total net loss decreased by 59% or $1.2 million from the prior year's comparable period, driven by an increase in revenue, strategic and efficient spending in all departments and technological investment. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $920,000 or $0.08 per share, a $1 million improvement year-over-year. The primary adjustments to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q1 2024 for noncash share-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and other nonrecurring items.
Our balance sheet is well capitalized with $7 million of cash as of March 31, 2024. Cash decreased from approximately $2.2 million in the quarter, primarily due to $1.7 million share repurchase. The remaining decrease was primarily due to the timing of customer payments. Free cash flow calculated as $920,000 of adjusted EBITDA, less $490,000 of software development cost was $430,000 in the first quarter. We expect to generate positive free cash flow throughout 2024 with improvements as the year progresses. With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give instructions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum. Very nice results. Congratulations. So we're obviously early relative to both the European and the alternate DOJ opportunities in terms of those going into play. Can you talk about what sort of things you're doing to prep for that? You mentioned resellers specifically, but it's interesting you're increasing your EBITDA guidance inspite of the fact we would expect you might invest a little bit more aggressively into that. So any thoughts? Yes. We're just clicking on all cylinders here with the enterprise and the reseller channel. So it's business as is. I think R&D investment has been a major factor. We have a full product suite to meet the customer wherever they are, a small business or a large enterprise. So the breadth of offering is a major competitive advantage. We're outgrowing the market, I think.
So yes, we're just -- we're clicking along here, business as usual, and I think you're going to see a significant uptick in demand as you go into 2025 with the multitude of regulations coming. You mentioned being positioned with some of the key resellers that will ultimately be taking you to market, particularly, I think, in the U.S. with the DOJ impact. Can you walk through some of the reseller relationships that are key. And how are those typically structured? Are you, in many cases, the key player they are going to market with? Or are they going with multiple partners? Just -- any help there would be great. Yes. Those are exclusive relationships. As I mentioned, our current partners on the government side serve around 80,000 websites. And our penetration rate is in only the single digit. So we think there's a massive opportunity to grow here. We don't see any reason why this is not going to be close to full penetration over the next 2 to 3 years. And you can get the full penetration with our current retailer partners on the government side that's going to dramatically change the current business. Lastly for me. Kelly mentioned additions in the partner and marketplace channel being behind the strength you saw this quarter, can you just give any specificity as to specific partners that drove that new partners? Or new relationships with those partners? I have a lot of... Go ahead, Kelly. We're seeing growth in both expansion of existing resellers, which we continue to see every quarter, and we're -- we think there's additional opportunity there, as David mentioned, but we also are contracting with new resellers. So that growth is coming from both of those buckets, which we're happy to see. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Zach Cummins with B. Riley Securities. Congrats on the solid results. I really just wanted to hone in on the margin leverage that you're seeing in the model here. I mean, can you just talk about maybe the -- what's really the key underlying factor that's driving kind of the upside in terms of the adjusted EBITDA margin that we have, especially exiting this year? Yes. We've been able to prove we can be efficient with capital and scale revenue without increasing expenses, essentially decrease in expenses. As David mentioned, we expect Q2 to have adjusted EBITDA margins of the high teens. And if you look at guidance, we expect that to continue in Q3 and Q4, it's really -- we've been able to figure out the formula and generate that extra revenue without needing those additional expenses. Understood. And David, in terms of incremental investments into the direct channel, I know you have relationships in place with major partners, especially on the public sector side. But any additional investments that you need to make with your direct channel to really take full advantage of the growing demand opportunity? Not right now. We're still formulating the plans. We think we're pretty well balanced between growth and profitability, and it's been a tremendous effort to get to this point to get to high teens EBITDA margin. So we're happy with that. Understood. And final question for me is just around capital allocation. I mean, with the business continuing to generate positive free cash flow. How are you thinking about just investments in the organic business versus maybe even potentially looking at incremental M&A? Yes, we don't really comment on incremental M&A. I'm sure you can understand that. There have been a number of financings in M&A in the space. The latest acquisition of [ user way ] was at 8x ARR. We're going to look at LTV to CAC and increase that potentially more on sales and marketing and R&D, if we see that go favorably. But we think these operating margins are sustainable going forward, and we like them. Our next question comes from Scott Buck with H.C. Wainright. David, you guys have obviously been fairly aggressive in repurchasing shares here so far this year. Curious what your thoughts are on the stock today given the move in shares versus the opportunity you see over the next 12 to 24 months? Yes. It still seems pretty cheap to me. I think last I checked, it was around 4x revenue, and we're approaching Rule of 40 now. And I think we can exceed Rule of 40 as we go into next year. So those companies tend to trade over 10x revenue. Yes. No, that makes sense. And then second 1 for me. It sounds like from the commentary that not only are we looking at accelerating revenue in '24 and likely '25, it looks like you actually set up pretty well already for '26. So this momentum has legs, right? I think this is going to go on for a few years with high growth rates and high EBITDA margins. . At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moradi for his closing remarks. Yes. Thank you for joining us today. As always, I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to AudioEye's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Moradi. Sir, please proceed. Thank you, operator. We are pleased to report that our business momentum is strong. Sequential revenues grew from approximately $8.1 million to $8.5 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 19%. ARR increased sequentially by $1.3 million, an increase of 60% compared to ARR growth of $800,000 in the first quarter. We were able to grow revenues and ARR without adding additional costs with operating expenses roughly flat sequentially.
As a result of revenue growth and prudent expense management, we generated record adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 million, a margin of 17%. Looking at free cash flow, in terms of EBITDA minus CapEx, we generated a record $1 million of free cash flow from operations. We were close to achieving the Rule of 40 in the second quarter and expect to hit the Rule of 40 in the third quarter.
We saw notable growth in both our enterprise and partner and marketplace channels, with both channels contributing equally to revenue growth sequentially. The enterprise channel is growing at the fastest rate in several years due to our investment in R&D and the effective implementation of our go-to-market approach. We are excited to report that this momentum is continuing and driving a further increase in our full year guidance, which I will discuss shortly. I'll now cover a few other notable developments in the quarter.
On our April earnings call, we discussed significant regulatory developments for digital accessibility, including the Department of Justice's final role under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that state and local government entities ensure their websites and mobile applications are accessible, to people with disabilities. The regulation applies to a wide range of state and local government entities, including public schools, community colleges, universities, hospitals and clinics, police departments, libraries and transit agencies. Shortly after the Title II announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services Office for civil rights published a final rule, that bolsters protections for individuals with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
The rule stipulates that web content and mobile applications provided by organizations that received funding from HHS, including hospitals, doctors offices, social services, nursing homes and others are accessible for people at facilities. Like the DOJ Title II rule, the HHS role outlined specific digital accessibility requirements, including adherence to WCAG 2.1, and requires compliance by May 2026 or May 2027, depending on the organization size. To understand the impact of the HHS role, we scanned over 96,000 health care website pages over the United States. The average page had 84 accessibility issues, which is alarming. Approximately 96% of the internet is currently inaccessible to people with disabilities. Title II and HHS represent significant expansion opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to meet the increase in demand with our direct sales team and reseller channel.
Our AI and human assisted technology approach is the only way to address the problem at scale and deliver a solution to millions of websites. Over the last 3 months, we have been working hard to develop strategic initiatives and growth plans with our existing partners, including Finalsite, the market share leader in K-12 schools. The goal is to penetrate all of their installed base over the next 3 years with a comprehensive go-to-market plan. Both of us will contribute significant resources to make this happen. There is a significant opportunity to penetrate other industries under Title II and HHS, which includes state and local government, higher education and the health care industry. We already have a partnership with a dominant platform for cities, towns and municipalities as well as key partnerships in the health care industry.
We expect to create new partnerships in these industries as we execute our go-to-market plan and expect further announcement soon. We are also monitoring demand from the European Accessibility Act in California's AB 1757 legislation. We expect to see further developments on these items over the next few months. Moving on to guidance.
We continue to expect quarterly revenues to increase without significant additional expense, resulting in increased operating leverage and cash flow generation. For the third quarter, we are guiding for revenue between $8.85 million to $8.95 million, representing an annualized growth rate of approximately 20%. We expect to generate adjusted EBITDA between $1.85 billion to $1.95 million and adjusted EPS between $0.15 and $0.16. We expect to become a Rule of 40 company in the third quarter with the potential to increase growth rates and adjusted EBITDA margins in 2025 and beyond.
We are increasing our 2024 revenue guidance to between $34.5 million to $34.8 million. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance from $4.5 million to $5.5 million to $6 million to $6.3 million.
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $0.48 and $0.51 per share, an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint. This represents an increase of around 18% from previous guidance. I'll now turn the call over to AudioEye's CFO, Kelly. Thank you, David. As David discussed, revenue again hit record levels with Q2 2024 revenue at $8.5 million, marking our 34th quarter of record revenue and a 19% annualized growth rate. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was $33.3 million, a $1.3 million increase and a 60% improvement in ARR growth from the first quarter of 2024. Our 2 revenue channels are both showing strong performance with high teen annualized sequential growth rates in both channels. The partner and marketplace channel includes all revenue from our SMB-focused marketplace products and revenue from a variety of partners who deploy the same products for their SMB customers.
In the second quarter of 2024, this revenue channel grew 13% year-over-year, representing 59% of revenue and around 60% of ARR. AudioEye's enterprise channels consist of our larger customers and organizations, including those with non-platform websites who generally engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for pricing and solutions. The enterprise channel grew 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially or 18% annualized. In the second quarter, the enterprise channel contributed 41% revenue and around 40% of ARR. On June 30, 2024, our customer count was approximately 121,000, a 16% increase from 104,000 customers on June 30, 2023, and an increase of approximately 9,000 customers from March 31, 2024. The increase in customer count was driven by additions in both the partner marketplace and enterprise channel. Gross profit [ ticked ] up 1% sequentially and 2% year-over-year to 79% of revenue or $6.7 million compared to $6 million in Q2 of last year. The increase in gross margin was a result of approximately $650,000 of revenue growth year-over-year and a $25,000 decrease in cost of revenue over the same period.
While revenues increased approximately $650,000 from the second quarter of 2023, operating expenses decreased approximately 11% or $900,000 to $7.2 million. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to increased efficiencies in sales and marketing, and the completion of significant initiatives in R&D, partially offset by higher nonrecurring expenses and G&A. Our total R&D spend in Q2 2024 was approximately $1.7 million with approximately $450,000 reflected the software development cost in the investing section of the cash flow statement. This was down approximately $900,000 from $2.6 million in Q2 2023. The total R&D spend is about 20% of our revenue this quarter versus 33% in the comparable period of prior year, and 22% in the first quarter of 2024. We continue to believe the current investment in R&D of around 20% is appropriate for 2024.
Net loss in the second quarter of 2024 was $700,000 or $0.06 per share compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.17 per share in the same year-ago period. Total net loss decreased 63% or $1.2 million from the prior year's comparable period, driven by an increase in revenue, strategic and efficient spending in sales and marketing and technological investment. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA was a record $1.5 million or $0.12 per share, a $1.7 million improvement year-over-year. The primary adjustment to GAAP earnings and EPS for Q2 2024 for noncash share-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and litigation expense. Our balance sheet continues to be well capitalized with $5.1 million of cash as of June 30, 2024.
Cash decreased by approximately $1.9 million in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.4 million final earn-out payment related to the acquisition of the Bureau of Internet Accessibility in March 2022. In the second quarter of 2024, we also repurchased approximately $300,000 in shares and received net proceeds from our at-the-market offering of approximately $650,000. Free cash flow, calculated at $1.5 million of adjusted EBITDA less $450,000 of software development cost was $1 million in the second quarter. We expect free cash flow to continue to increase in the third and fourth quarter of 2024. With that, we open up the call for questions. Operator, please give appropriate instructions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Baldry with ROTH. You've done a really good job sort of growing your adjusted EBITDA pretty fast as revenues have started to grow again even in a sort of a cost containment, or in cutting mode. How do you feel about the existing sort of infrastructure head count in different places if the growth sort of continues to pick up the way it has, when do you feel like you really kind of need to get back to hiring, whether that's in sales or support areas to support the increasing revenue base? Rich, yes, as you can see, the model is pretty scalable. We've made a lot of investments in R&D and the go-to-market. There would be some incremental investments generally to generate and then support new business, but a good amount of incremental revenue, I think, is going to drop straight down. So I don't think we need to invest [ at the time ] more, just mostly on sales and marketing, not the infrastructure. Yes. I wanted to ask specifically about the COGS line because, it's been flat to down even on a sequential basis or pretty steadily for almost last 2 years. What would cause that to start to climb again? Like how fixed can that be as your top line grows? Yes. We've been happy to see gross margin improve now to 79%. We feel pretty good about the efficiencies. We've run through that line. It is a matter of looking at the mix of support and different investments in that line, but we feel pretty good about holding that 79% through 2024, and kind of continuing into 2025. We feel pretty good about our gross margins overall. Got it. And can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet? Your access to capital is obviously a lot better in recent periods now. Does that change sort of, any of your acquisition plans or our willingness to sort of invest in the business on a more accelerated basis. How comfortable do you feel with the debt levels where they're at? Would you prefer basically just wipe them out asap? And then move forward from there? Just help us think about that a little bit. Yes, we feel pretty good. Kelly, can get into the ATM a little bit. I don't think we really need money, that's the good news. We're cash flow generative. Kelly will get into the ATM a little bit, though. Yes, we did open up an ATM for a relatively small amount compared to our market cap with the $7 million. We do like to have that debt there and be opportunistic about potentially raising capital to pay down our debt and reduce our interest expense. And maybe just a few seconds on, how you do view acquisition potential, now that you've got a much larger market cap to sort of deal with? We don't really discuss M&A. We're always looking around, but we're not going to discuss it on this call. Our next question comes from the line of Zach Cummins with B. Riley Securities. David, first one for me is, can you just talk about the progress you're seeing in the enterprise channel there? And really what sort of momentum are you expecting to see there in the coming quarters as you've really started to regain traction with that segment returning to year-over-year growth? Sure. Yes, it's been pretty good. We've made a lot of investments there in R&D, which really gives us a full product suite to beat the competition. We've also made a lot of investments in our go-to-market, and we're seeing record leads, strong conversions. The pipelines continue to grow. So it's really clicking. I think we're outgrowing the market generally by 2x to 3x right now. Got it. And my follow-up question is really just around your partnerships. I think on the prior call, you mentioned that just within your current partners, you had access to 80,000 websites, that would be really great targets under the new regulation. Can you talk about -- obviously, you've made more inroads with Finalsite, but can you talk about some of the work that you're doing on that side to really accelerate momentum within that partner channel? Yes, you saw the press release, we're both super excited about the opportunity and penetrating their entire customer base. Both of us are going to have a huge focus on it, deploy resources and really -- the opportunity for Title II is huge, and we're in a great spot [ with the ] dominant platform in K-12. So we're really excited about that one, and more to come on the other ones. So stay tuned. Our next question comes from the line of George Sutton with Craig Hallum Capital Group. This is James on for George. Nice results. As a follow-up to the Finalsite commentary. Can you provide some more detail on sort of what those resources are you might be contributing, quantify any incremental costs? And then how should we kind of think about operating expense growth or operating leverage over the next couple of years as you target some of these mandated opportunities? Yes, we're not really getting into the details of that, the confidential contract. But I would figure marketing resources and awareness campaigns, co-marketing, but I can't really get into all the details that we're going to do. What was the second part of your question? Just sort of how to think about operating leverage, operating expense growth over the next couple of years? Sort of as you target these mandate opportunities. Just because since you're kind of going indirectly, I'd assume there wouldn't be a lot of incremental expense as you sort of add to your customers. Yes. I think we feel pretty good with where we're at. I've already made the investments, like I said, in R&D. Model is scalable. So we feel good about the investing, a little bit on sales and marketing in the future potentially. But like I said before, I think that's -- it's a scalable model with potential to really increase margins. Sounds good. And then just also kind of curious on any initial interactions you maybe have with some of the constituents that are going to be impacted by the mandate? Constituents? I'm trying to understand that. Just basically people that would be impacted by the mandate to any government agencies? Anybody that's... Yes, yes, we're seeing a lot of government leads come in, more than ever. So we're having a lot of conversations at the moment. Those deals aren't all closing, but we're having a lot of conversations. So they're very aware of it. I think it's going to start to tick up into 2025 from a demand standpoint. We don't have this in our numbers for this year at all. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainright. David as a bit of a follow-up to last question. I'm curious, historically, have you seen customers be proactive in addressing these mandates? Or typically, does it take more of a push past the mandate date? Whether that's DOJ lawsuits or whatnot to really get people moving in the right direction. We don't have a lot of experience with this, so I can't really tell you. There's a lot of mandates happening at the moment with the EU, Title II and HHS now. So we'll have to see how that plays out. My guess, is in 2025, it's going to really start to pick up. Right. Okay. Okay. So that's fair. And then in terms of capital allocation, as you guys build cash through the remainder of the year, and into next with positive free cash flow. How are you thinking about allocation? I mean, do you start piling more into marketing at that point to further accelerate growth? Or just what are your thoughts there? Yes. We like it being profitable. Look at the LTV to cash increases, we'd look to potentially spend more on sales and marketing there, but that would really have to tick up. But we like growing off free cash flow. So expect that to continue. Okay. And then last thing, I know you guys repurchased some shares during the quarter. Stock's obviously moved in your favor. How are you feeling about the repurchase today? And what's left on that authorization? Yes. We are buying the stock pretty cheap, like, I don't know, 2x to 3x revenue, and it's a lot higher, so I don't know if we're going to be buying back anymore. And we have an ATM out there so, I don't think so, on the buyback side. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr.  Moradi for his closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. I want to thank our employees, partners and investors for their continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next call.
