With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As a growing global brand, we are making significant progress in 2018. We’re expanding our distribution channels and increasing product availability through existing channels to bring greater visibility for our portfolio, our premium fitness beverages, all while continuing to accelerate topline revenue. With innovative products and compelling packaging, we’re reaching more and more consumers each and every day.
Our strategy of positioning Celsius, as a global beverage leader for health-minded consumers remains our top priority. We achieved a number of successes during the first quarter of 2018 including doubling revenue all while maintaining our gross profit margins. We continue to leverage our supply chain to gain efficiencies and our maximizing our market investments.
In addition, we had a strong launches in the quarter of new products and multiple international markets and further expansion and new and existing retailers in North America. As a Celsius brand gains greater visibility globally, we continue to step up our efforts to meet the demands with the development of new products that we believe will continue to raise the bar and meet the demands for today’s consumers.
And North America, we continue to build out our presence and traditional retail, recently expanding into two divisions of global food retailer Ahold Delhaize securing availability in availability in Food Lion and Hannaford. Ahold Delhaize operates in 23 states from Georgia to Maine and also includes banners Stop & Shop, Giant Landover and multiple other banners including an e-commerce presence. Food Lion which is the dominant grocery chain in the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic regions has more than 1,100 stores. And Hannaford has nearly 190 stores in five states throughout New England. The relationship is off to a solid start. We have already restarted to receive reorders.
In addition to landing Ahold Delhaize in North America, we secured a huge win with the entry into the drug channel through giant retailer, giant CVS. Our original line will soon be available in three flavors initially, sparkling orange, sparkling watermelon and non-carbonated raspberry also a green tea are going to be located in 550 CVS stores nationwide, of importance is regarding the placement. Our products will have a high visibility and the front checkout coolers where consumers can grab a single-serve Celsius while they enter and while they’re checking out.
Through this channel, our brand will reach a vast new audience that health-minded consumers. This is a great synergy between our great tasting fitness drink and CVS’s commitment to health and well being. We’re confident our offerings will be successful with the initial placements and look forward to the opportunity to expand to their total network of over 9,600 locations.
The addition of CVS as a new channel partner follows on the heels of expansion, continued expansion in 7-Eleven with two of our new HEAT flavors, which are now available for purchase by franchisees and corporate 7-Eleven locations nationwide.
Our Strawberry Dragon Fruit flavors offer to 7-Eleven under the retailers first, best and only program, which allows the national retailer an opportunity to sell a flavor, which is not yet available to other convenience retailers. This brings our full product line up in the national plan agreement 7-Eleven to SKUs PlantOGram in energy set, which is an amazing cup muffin that achievement by our sales organization and shows you demand of our proper our products.
CELSIUS HEAT now has placement across more than 22 distribution centers nationally, major distributors and wholesalers are stocking our second product line in our portfolio. So convenience retailers will be able to purchase CELSIUS HEAT as well as our original line creating an opportunity for synergy in efficiencies within the ranks of our sales team. Allowing for our expanding portfolio to flow through our existing distribution networks into the current and new retail partner shelves.
This additional placement of the CELSIUS HEAT line will add incremental and brings true innovation to the retailer’s energy and functional product sets. Rounding on our domestic achievements in the first quarter, we established a dedicated focused team to capitalize on vending opportunities. As we launched a healthy vending initiative to-date we are currently in over 2,500 vending machines with an identified opportunity for an additional placement Celsius at over 18,000 locations. Based on initial expectations and success, we believe it will be a significant expansion throughout 2018 with our targeted team.
The North American sales team led by Jon McKillop, our Senior Vice President of Sales are setting the stage and capitalizing on the changes taking place in retail today, as retailers are rapidly updating their shelves for healthier options for today’s health-minded consumer. In Europe, we are having phenomenal success particularly in the Nordic region where we successfully began distribution of our products in Norway through our Nordic distribution partner Qifeng Food.
Expansion within the region leverages the operations of our existing distribution in network, as well as the brand equity have already established in Sweden. We have plans to enter additional distribution channels, including online, specialty, convenience and grocery in the coming months, as we continue to leverage our assets and resources.
In Finland and Sweden, we introduced our branch-chained amino acids BCAA drink, an extension to our core line that targets both high-performance athletes and fitness enthusiasts. The launch entails three flavors Passionfruit, Wild Strawberry and a first for Celsius products a decaffeinated Elderberry version of our brands.
Initial sales reports confirm we are off to a strong start with each of these initiatives. These initiatives – this innovative Celsius BCAA Recovery Drink is a perfect pairing to our proprietary meta-plus land line and together the two or a three and post fitness solution for any consumer and for the Celsius Holdings portfolio this new edition furthers our mission to create science based proprietary and innovative offerings.
In Asia, our investments in sales, marketings’ and distributions particularly in China are driving tremendous progress towards increasing reach to a broader audience of consumers and leveraging brand awareness. With China, being one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world striking early in the region with an experienced in country distributor like Qifeng Food has been a key driver of our growth to date in country and creating foundation for building our global brand with strong future financial performance. Our initial area of focus in China has been Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen with expansion in 35 cities across 14 provinces.
Since our initial local production in September of 2017, we have gained over 13,000 locations with approximately 7,000 key accounts, which include a variety of marquee retailers including FamilyMart, Metro, Lawson, PetroChina, 7-Eleven and others. We are firmly committed to building on our success to further grow our brand and increase placements of our products in China, where initial feedback has shown great success.
Celsius branded products and our unique flavors have been recognized as innovative leaders and their respective beverage categories since our inception. With nearly two dozen global awards, the industry continues to recognize the value of our products and impact we're having on the industry. These awards extend to the product itself and to its compelling packaging we used to attract consumers.
Most recently our CELSIUS HEAT product line was selected for more than 100 entries are from around the world for its Best Packaging and Label Design at the 2018 InnoBev Global Soft Drinks Awards. The packaging, which was designed by our highly creative in-house innovative team. Appropriately positions our brand in a fitness and energy drink category and differentiates our products from other brands in the category.
In addition to reference to my recent appointment as CEO, I'm honored to leave this company. We're also currently in an active search for a CFO to join our team as our fiftieth member. We are a lean organization capitalizing on today's health environment trends. We are building an innovative portfolio of products. Our brand is resonating with today’s consumers and it's getting considerable momentum. Our future has never looked brighter.
I’ll now turn the call over to Vanessa Walker, Executive Vice President of Marketing & Innovation for her prepared remarks. Vanessa? Thanks, John. And on behalf of the entire company I’d like to congratulate you once again on being named Chief Executive Officer. We're looking forward to many exciting wins in the days ahead. As John indicated, we continue to gain brand awareness among consumers, who are veering away from sugary soda and traditional sugary energy globally. We have tremendous momentum, winning new retailer store shelves as we are out in front of the trends. With a proven functional beverage, we are capitalizing on the shift on in consumer thinking, regarding their own consumption trend as they evolve across the globe.
To begin the Q1 marketing recap, I'll mention in April, we were recognized for becoming one of the top performing growth stocks within the beverage segment, we were named a top eight click on the 2018 beverage stock watch list by Industry Analytics Inc. an independent investment research firm. Our corporate marketing initiative in March included participation in the ROTH Conference held annually in Dana Point, California. This conference was a successful one, as we met with many new potential investors and analysts, who are interested in learning more about our organization.
Aside from a sampling booth for every [indiscernible] John will given the opportunity to speak to a room of conference attendees and his 20 minute presentation was well received by the financially minded portfolio managers. We heard resoundingly greater brand awareness among this year's conference attendees, including personal stories of conversion to the brand more so than any conference in recent memory. We will continue to attend these corporate marketing conferences, including the upcoming B. Riley event in Santa Monica, May 23 through to 24.
By way of press, we generated corporate news the several press releases in the first quarter including our best received release. Simultaneously announcing our expansion into CVS and also two divisions of global conglomerate, Ahold Delhaize, both Food Lion and Hannaford. This release generated over 83 million impressions with the company, including a pick up of analyst coverage by both Maxim and Ladenburg Thalmann. Another release generating significant interest for the launch announcement of the newly created BCAA post workout recovery drink throughout the Nordic region. This line produced three flavors, one of which is the first decaffeinated Celsius and Elderberry SKU.
Following the strategic plan, the line extension launches first in the fitness channel then phase two will rollout into the mass market in both Sweden and in Finland. In addition to the incredible trust pickup surrounding the brand expansion, the brand earned media coverage and trade publications with our achievement attaining National Presenting Sponsor status for the 2018 Tough Mudder series. The presenting sponsorship, we are further increasing brand awareness in North America tapping into an extensive Mudder pan base. The Mudder Nation is more than 3 million strong and also focused on improving one’s self through facing tough obstacle challenges.
The series which includes 100 events in over 33 cities is a U.S. partnership to date. However, the Tough Mudder organization is active in nine countries to a potential expansion of this partnership is possible. The reaction to our joint partnership announcement was well received given the nature of our mutual fitness target audiences and this story was featured in several beverage publications franchises including BevNET, Beverage Insights and beverage industry.
From a consumer standpoint the Q1 launch of the Tough Mudder event series met sampling activation in New Orleans, Sacramento, Phoenix and Miami. Florida was on hands and see the start as Miami events opting all to participate in the obstacles including the Celsius branded Mount Everest wall challenge climbing edition. Consumers were surprised as he spent the day on the course with the Celsius team and the resulting publicity was explosive with over 6 million video views shares and other forms of social engagement as well as print and TV news coverage on local and syndicated affiliates in several cities.
With the Tough Mudder activation beginning in Q1 the brand marketing team had their hands full. However, additional events allowing the brand to reach other audiences within the targeted demographic Celsius play. Some of the consumer event highlights were sponsorship of the annual South Beach Model Volleyball Tournament in Miami Beach and sampling runners that retailer sprouts marathon in Oakland, California.
In addition to consumer events the marketing initiatives at this stage in the brand they see the penetration include heavy feeding at the trade level. This year Q1 the team attended multiple high profile industry franchisees selling in trade shows. And within the fitness channels we debuted our trade show that the well attended event The Arnold in Columbus, Ohio where estimates of crowd were reaching 70,000 for the weekend.
As I’ve been sampling and selling at events and trade shows we’re reaffirming the product message concerning our position as a lifestyle fitness strength with consumers globally in both print and media. Through all three areas Europe, Asia and North America there are synergies and best methods being identified to duplicate means and transfer knowledge regarding brand ambassador programs, digital marking and other tactics designed to amplify the brand across all countries.
From an onsite perspective marketing within the fitness channel has included heavy in-club demos with branded sampling programs for all lines especially the newest two in both the U.S. and Sweden and a recently created cooler and sensor program has helped place coolers in more than 100 high traffic locations in the U.S. alone ensuring the cool can at Celsius is always available. Additional merchandising expansion techniques are planned by product line for every channel of trade.
Two new flavors of the CELSIUS HEAT line debuted at the Annual Arnold in Ohio the flavors were passionately accepted by many millennials who instantly took to Instagram to post can that our latest creations Apple Jack’d and Orangesicle. These flavors round up the line to seven SKUs, which is significant as eight SKUs to get the single row across the cooler door in most standard sized cold placement in the fitness, club and direct channel.
Also in Q1 the launch of HEAT at retailer 7-Eleven who will carry both the number one best seller Cherry lime and the more recently added Strawberry Dragon Fruit, which as John mentioned earlier will be listed as a first best and only feature item giving the change SKU exclusivity for a period among their competitors in the convenience channel.
Both CELSIUS HEAT and the Nordic BCAA line extensions are similarly positioned to drive efficiencies within our selling organization and also through our distribution customers capitalizing on gaining sales and share a shelf at end user customers. These adjacent offering will allow in multiple transaction sale across several channels of trade. Following a best method for Celsius new item launches both HEAT and the BCAA line launch in health and wellness channels then having core consumer awareness building better for you credibility in momentum in trade the second launch phase occurs with expansion into the traditional or mass channel the trade.
With the first quarter behind us the intro of the new SKUs and the preparations for Tough Mudder presenting sponsorship we are full scheme ahead focusing on the launch for major retailer CVS. Our digital team has been preparing as digital will be an important marketing tool reaching widespread consumers shopping in the initial 500 CVS locations or to spread throughout the U.S.
From a digital marketing standpoint the China launch campaign included QR codes on every can and data has been collected through vCheck, which gives us access to key consumer insights and provides an opportunity for future to a conversation with these new Celsius consumers in China. Bloggers and influencers will continue to be a key digital method of communication in all countries as we turn universal global trends regarding health and wellness into messages relating to our core consumers in their own language.
A look at head for the Q2 initiative is the open application event with brand ambassador or CELSIUS Lifer program. As with the Swedish business model a critical factor for earlier success with the Celsius brand throughout Sweden with the recruitment and deployment of an army of brand ambassadors who lived a healthy best lifestyle. Following the Swedish best method of similarly designed program will begin in May throughout the U.S. This new Lifer program will be a large U.S. endeavor as key learnings have been shaped the way we will go about recruiting and on-boarding a team of passionate ambassadors throughout the nation. more to come on this initiative in the second quarter.
Additionally in the second quarter we will discuss the launch of Kiwi Guava our newest SKU, which has made it to shelf within the month of April. The second quarter story will be relate in greater detail as Q2 unfolds. The Kiwi Guava SKU was created to target the newest group of fitness forward and health conscious individuals the emerging millennial Hispanic, who has a generation are changing the way the Hispanic households shop and considers food and nutrition.
With our eye ever on the millennial consumer, which is the largest age group in population by numbers across the globe, we study the recent rock survey of over 1,000 millennial. The survey found the younger consumers make their way into the gym as a priority. But most millennial consumers stating they visit the gym, two to three times per week and also they indicated, they are likely to spend on quality, healthy foods and beverages, as a much higher portion of their disposable income to those in the next closest age group. We are encouraged by their desire to spend on food and beverage and to allocate funds to spend against new flavors of their favorite brands.
Thank you. This concludes the marketing portion. I'm turning it back over to you, John. Thank you, Vanessa. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was record $12.1 million, compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The more than 100% increase was primarily attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in pricing, which remain consistent. By geography, North America sales were up 96%, due to double-digit growth in existing accounts and new distribution expansion.
Sales also increased in Europe, a 118%, mainly as a results of the launch of our new BCA line extension mentioned earlier, as well as, timing reorders in our core line in the Nordics. And in Asia, sales increased a 100%, due to the initial launch of our products in China.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $2.4 million or 100% and in line with increases in revenue. Gross profits grew to $4.8 million and gross profit margins for the period grew to 39.5% of revenues, compared to $2.4 million or 39.7% of revenues for the corresponding period last year.
The improvement in gross profit was driven almost entirely by higher revenues and a diligent management of existing account, promotional allowances and managing cost of goods. The two basis point decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increases in new account promotional activities compared to the prior year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2018 were $5.6 million, compared to $2.2 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017, an increase of 160%. This increase is due primarily to increases in investments and human resources and increased marketing programs in North America as mentioned by the Vanessa, as well as initial support – to support the initial launch of our products in China.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ending 31, 2018 were $2 million, compared to $2.1 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017, a decrease of 3%. The decrease was primarily due to savings and human resources which were offset by timing – also timing one-time charges in the prior year as well as increases in insurance, professional fees and additional investments in research and development.
Net loss to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $3 million or $0.06 per share basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.05 per share basic and diluted for the corresponding period last year. Net loss attributable to common stockholders is inclusive of preferred dividends.
For the three months ending March 31, 2018, the net loss included preferred dividends of $83,000 approximately, and a three months ending March 31, 2017, the net loss included preferred dividends approximately $90,000. The savings in preferred dividends is associated with the conversion of our preferred D shares to common in the period.
Operating expenses for the first quarter included non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation which totaled $779,000 compared to $786,000 last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 excluding one-time charges with a negative $2 million, compared to approximately $322,000 for the corresponding period in 2017, which is inclusive of $2.2 million of net investments related to the company's product launch in China.
Excluding net – Asian market investments, southeast delivered approximately $161,000 in first quarter 2018’s positive adjusted EBITDA. We believe information containing adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP financial measure enhances the overall understanding of our financial performance and a reconciliation of our GAAP results as non-GAAP measure has been included in our earnings release.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2018, the company had cash of approximately $10 million and working capital approximately $18.5 million. This compares $14.2 million in cash and $20.6 million working capital as of December 31, 2017. We believe our cash – current cash balance is sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the next 12 months. Cash used in operations for the first three months of 2018 totaled $4.3 million, compared to $861,000 used in the first three months of 2017.
We executed well during the first quarter. We are building momentum and expanding our reach of products and creating a solid foundation for future growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may open the call for questions. Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question. Hi everyone, I want to say first congratulations on really strong growth in Q1, and John congratulations to you on your appointment as permanent CEO. Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate that. Really excited to continue to lead this organization and continue to deliver prudent results. So maybe we can start with I guess your latest sense on how sell-through’s have been trending in the U.S. And then maybe you can give us a little more what we should look for around the launch in CVS, which I think is starting this month, if I heard you correctly and then anything around the grocers that you also launched with. Just as we’re thinking about the P&L, there is any of that in Q1 or if most of that’s falling into Q2. Okay, great. Initial sell-through has been, as I mentioned in regards to we’re starting to receive and continue to receive a lot of Nielsen data, also getting some good data points coming from our existing customers. And all sell-through information that we are receiving is extremely positive. Some of the new business that we brought in, in regards to Food Lion, we just recently got our sell-through data, which we’ve been in Food Lion now commencing almost three – over three months. The sell-through data continues to show good momentum.
These – the buyer is pleased with our initial movements, which continues to increase on a weekly basis. So we are building a good consumer base and we’re seeing that a lot of our existing accounts and that is really reflected in our numbers where we continue to see strong double-digit growth rates in all channels of where we’re operating.
In addition to CVS, we did receive a pipe order for the 550 stores, as you mentioned it should be growing out over really this month and over the next several weeks as we go through their supply chain. It is a direct account. And we are located in those premium locations, in those front and checkout cooler, so really excited about that opportunity. We do not have initial data points at this point coming from CVS. But we look forward to getting those. We can share those hopefully, next time on our call. Okay, great. And then as far as HEAT and 7-Eleven, any update there on the new flavors how they are doing. Yes. Our two new flavors in 7-Eleven, we continue to get reorders from Mclean. We have not received an updated scan data report from 7-Eleven, but based on the reorders we’re receiving as well as we attended several FOH franchise trade shows throughout the quarter as Vanessa indicated. And those shows were extremely successful on getting the brand out in front of the franchise owners. And from what we hear from the franchise owners everyone is extremely pleased with our movement. Okay, great. And then any data you can give us on the BCA launch in the Nordic countries, just wondering if we have any data there to speak to. And it’s a little premature at this point. We did have the initial orders. We have gone to production – our second production with those lines. We do have a actual planned review meeting with our partners coming up this month will be able to get additional insight into the operations and some of the data points that they’re seeing. But initial feedback is positive. They’re gaining shelf space and some great displays in the hyper market. So they are very excited about the three new flavors. Okay, great. And then turning to China, just wondering I guess what the key focus initiatives are there in the near-term or over that said a next couple of quarters you’ve gotten on the shelf there. What are kind of the next steps? Sure. We just tremendous production really when you look at it in the fourth quarter. It was late September, when we had that first local production. Q1 after coming out of Chinese New Year was really to continue to scale from the really the traditional retail into key accounts, which we’ve been able to secure over 7,000 locations in key accounts. We look forward to continuing to penetrate those key accounts in those markets, we look forward to continually increasing that we have the execution of Qifeng.
Initial feedback has been extremely positive on our take rates, the execution we’re seeing our placement is being placed right next to the Red Bull in the yellow can out of Thailand. So the placement seems very strong and very good placement in execution by Qifeng sub-distributors. Vanessa and I will be traveling over there next month. We will be conducting our quarterly review meeting and look forward to further plans. But initial feedback has been very positive as we entered really summer beverage season, which were excited about. But we are monitoring very closely on the investments we’re making in market. Okay, great. All good to hear. Thanks for taking my question and let someone else jump in. Thank you, Jeff. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with the Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. I would like to also echo the congratulations John on being named permanent CEO. Thank you. Thank you very much and I appreciate all your support. And I just wanted to follow-up on two pretty large contracts. I know the CVS stores starting with 550; they have over 8,000 stores if not more than that. Can you talk about how you see that opportunity evolving and then just a follow-up question 7-Eleven? Sure, absolutely. CVS is a great opportunity for our brand to health and wellness space, our products we build very confident, our products will perform well with our initial flavors – our three flavors going in. 5,500 is a start, we look to go back right after midsummer is when to reviews take place. And we look forward to further – gaining further distribution and expansion three CVS. We feel our product positioning is in line with CVS’s health and wellness position, as well. And it’s a very comparable product. And in addition to CVS that really opens the opportunity for the whole drug channel, which is really the overarching opportunity we’re going after. So this is just the beginning and we’re just getting started in this channel. Okay, great. And then 7-Eleven, you have to HEAT products in there. 7-Eleven – there’s the corporate 7-Eleven that can give you an entrée or sort of like a hunting license. But most of the 7-Eleven have the ability to determine what goes in their store. So can you talk a little bit about the strategy of approaching that opportunity and how do you go about trying to penetrate the 7-Eleven opportunity in an expeditious manner other than going store to store. Yes. It is a great opportunity for us, it is – it has been a challenge for us over the last several years since we’ve been with them now for over three years. We’re working very diligently to continue to expand. As the brand continues to build momentum and the marketing continues to take hold that is making it easier for us to gain distribution. As well as we’ve made this journey with them with their core – really key franchisees and corporate support.
So you’ll see us in the southeast where we have almost a 90% ACV in the southeast and we’re seeing some of these other markets start to increase at an increasing rate. We’re doing a variety of tactics, which include targeted teams, our targeted teams will blitz markets, we also are supporting the FOA franchisee organization trade shows as well as their annual trade shows. And then we’re also doing some targeted marketing initiatives to those locations.
So it’s a multi-level approach that it is – that we continue to work on. And we still have a lot of work ahead of us overall we’re roughly around I think right around 50%, a little over 50% when you look at the total population on the 7-Eleven. So a lot of room to continue to build upon and we are focused to continue to build upon this opportunity. Okay. And then just a last question on China. I know you have a slightly different packaging there. Can you talk about how the marketing and promotional events are being received in China? The marketing promotional event is working very well. We feel we have a – as you mentioned a very unique packaging country, it is popping on the shelves in regards to their overall energy sets and the overall products on-shelf. So we’re very excited about that. We also are using technology in China to really leverage the Celsius brand as well. So regard to marketing programs, its traditional trade, traditional advertising as well as digital sampling hands in cans. But one thing we’re doing that’s unique is we have a QR code tied to our – under our taps which is a promotional program where you can win a lot of different activities. You can win fitness equipment, you can win an instant rebate and it’s all tied to a WeChat account.
It allows us also to data capture understand who’s consuming our product, who is our consumer and then we’re able to retarget them. So there’s a lot of great insight in some of the marketing activities that we’re doing which we’re excited about. So are executing, we’re just in really the first quarter was the first quarter as we continue to roll out these marketing initiatives as we move into really summer beverage season. And ultimately close distribution, we need to continue to execute, we need to continue to close those key accounts and further expand our penetration to really see the benefits of some of the overall arching marketing programs as they take hold over the summer beverage season. Okay. Great. I’ll hop back in the queue. Thanks, John. Thank you very much Anthony. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. HI, John and Vanessa. This is actually Destiny on for Jeff. How are you? Fine. Excellent, Destiny. How are you today? I’m great. Thank you. Both of my questions have been answered, I just have a couple follow-up. For the BCAA that was launched in Finland and Sweden, could we essentially see a similar product and maybe the U.S. or the Asian markets, as my continuing on that part, you said that, you now have a pre-workout and then post-workout beverage. Are you seeing other gap, where maybe an additional product could fill? Yes. Thank you, Destiny. There is a lot of opportunity out there, with our product and position and really, when you look at overarching strategy is to – really build out our portfolio of really proven proprietary or innovative products in your category and when you look at the BCAA post recovery initial launch rolling out in the Nordics, it was a great pairing for products we have high ACV in markets. We have a great brand presence and it was very complementary. So we're very excited about some of the initiatives on innovation. In regards to innovation, we're looking at a variety of other opportunities as they come to us and some are self created internally. Then we'll roll those out at the right time in regards to overarching strategy. I don't know, Vanessa, you want to mention any additional topics on regards to that. Yes, I think in basis to your question, I think one of the finer points mentioned is that we have implemented a plan for innovation and six pages if you will, its key innovation. In a way to evaluate, people are knocking on our door. Maybe we want to good on the path of bringing people in and discussing ideas with people and do want to innovate from internally. And does it look like new innovation et cetera. So there is plans in place, in fact, John and I just met regarding the topic this morning.
So we always keeping our eye on the millennials, as we mentioned. Keeping pace with the trends, understanding how to look forward and understanding with the core mission of our portfolio as John just mentioned. So with regard to your question on the BCAA’s in other country is possible. We're evaluating and part of our launch plan for innovation is that final step, which is follow-up in a valuation. There after a tactical launch, we will continue to follow-up and evaluate whether there is launch in the product. I met our criteria for success and it is something of we would consider moving forward with in other regions, the U.S., Asia, et cetera. Okay, great. Thank you. My last question, it has little bit more to do with the ambassador’s program. That you mentioned, I'm just curious, what’s type of criteria you could be doing book for when picking those people, is it like a social media presence or like biolines of the brands and things like that? Could you provide little more color? Thank you. Excellent. Thank you, Destiny. I'll turn it over to Vanessa. Thanks, John. Yes. So our initial criteria was, everyone has to be over 21 years of age. The other criteria that we were looking for was social platforms. Are they living a good lifestyle? Do they reflect the brand? Followers, and also geography, we were a nationwide brand. And we're going to continue to scale and expand nationally into multiple channels at multiple retailers. We want to far and wide reach for the brand ambassadors. And we're also asking for enthusiastic people who are bringing a sense of credibility with them, when they come to the brand. So they can help us to passionately grow fan-base. Are they are personal trainer? Does that person have reach? Are they sport enthusiasts in some way? Are they in shape model? Corporate Executives that the weekend warriors. So we're looking for a diverse group of people and we are considering their social media platforms and how willing they will be to engage in the brands. That's really our criteria at this time. Okay. Got it. Thanks, again. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you. Our first quarter result demonstrates our products are gaining momentum as we were capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends. Our active healthy lifestyle position as a global position with mass appeal, we're building upon our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices.

Now, turning to our second quarter.  We further advanced our distribution and expansion strategy across all of our regions, in number of large retailers, convenience stores, and new channels of distribution were brought online, both domestically and internationally, further increasing our availability and visibility for our portfolio of premium fitness beverages.
With innovative products and compelling packaging, we have reached more and more consumers each and every day.  Our target sales strategies are bringing Celsius to new channels, increasing product availability and our targeted marketing strategies are introducing new customers who are embracing and enjoying our great tasting, proven fitness drinks.  Our strategy of positioning Celsius as a global beverage leader for health minded consumers remains our top priority. 
Domestically, Celsius continues to gain great acceptance.  Revenue increased nearly 30% to a record $8.5 million in the second quarter where we continue to see strong growth in existing accounts, despite a temporary production delay, which caused a significant shift of nearly $1.3 million in sales from the second quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2019. 
We managed through these timing delays and production and delivery of our product has stabilized.  In addition, domestically, we were focused on ensuring we can support our explosive growth in the U.S. market as we continue to optimize our supply chain with multiple co-factors. 
We are extremely encouraged by the number of new high quality customers we added to our domestic lineup, including Target, CVS, Food Lion, Hannafords, Menards, Wawa, Circle K, as well as many others.  We also had notable expansion in adding over 300 new Planet Fitness locations, further penetrating the fitness channel and we expanded our CELSIUS HEAT to over 25% of all 7-11s nationwide, where our core line is in approximately 50% of national distribution today.
We also rolled out a healthy vending micro-market initiative with a focused dedicated team where we are seeing great opportunity targeting at work location and healthy vending opportunities in this growing channel. 
We've entered this new channel with great success and are seeing extremely high velocity rates at these at work locations.  We are very excited about the future of this channel, which further aligns with our strategy of continuing to target health-minded consumers where they live, work, and play. 
And our military channel.  All 3 of our product varieties are now sold in more than 800 exchanges worldwide, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.  Total growth through this channel is now up to 50,000 units per week at the end of the second quarter where just over a year ago, units were running an average about 10,000 units per week in the same period. 
Our expansion and target further establishes a nationwide platform for widespread availability.  Initially, we launched and gained authorization for 3 SKUs, Sparkling Orange, Peach Mango, and Sparkling Watermelon in more than 1,000 locations of the 1,900 Target stores on the ambient energy shelf in the second quarter where the restarts started to take place.
As the resets took place, we have received reorders.  We have received positive feedback and strong consumer demand, and we now expect to add additional flavors in the back half of 2018.  Our relationship with Target is a clear sign of the change in consumer demand at shopping patterns, in the grocery and mass channel energy set continue to shift.
Retail buyers are seeking brands that drive traffic and increase sales.  Many buyers are carving out new, healthy meets functional energy sets.  We are capitalizing on this evolving trend.  To that end, our IRI [indiscernible] data as of July 15 validates the demand for our products and with retailers that are adding Celsius to the product lines, the convenience store market had over a 42% growth over the trailing 12 months.  We were outpacing the category by 12.5x with only a 10% ACV. 
These results demonstrate our products are in demand and we are being accepted by today's health minded consumer.  In addition, the momentum demonstrates our product had mass appeal.  In the Nordic region, the month of May was the best sales month our partners had since first entering the region.  The quarter, however, was impacted by orders of Celsius due to timing of flavor launches and a reduction of inventory levels as they transition to a refreshed new look and feel.
We are on track for a solid third quarter as production delivery has returned to more normalized levels.  We are encouraged by the near term prospect of adding several new retailers to expand our distribution in Finland and Norway in the back half of 2018, which will further our penetration in those markets. 
In China, we had a highly successful selling season by our primary distributor.  Due to timing of retailer resets, the channel fill will flow mostly to the third quarter and the second quarter distribution was still primarily from inventory sold to our partner in March of the first quarter.  Supporting this growth, we have received reorders and have already fulfilled orders for the first quarter to our distribution partners. 
In China, we have nearly doubled the number of stores since last quarter to more than 25,000 locations and we added over 11,000 key accounts.  We are now in 45 cities supported by 147 sub-distributors, including key accounts such as Circle K, Lawsons, [indiscernible] RT Mart, Vanguard, Metro, Century Mark, and Alibaba's new Hema supermarkets in Beijing. 
We are also selling well on jd.com and Tmall.  Our marketing activities during the quarter in China included sampling, digital, and events targeting consumers living and active healthy lifestyle, driving trial and interaction. 
Some of the events included X-Mudder, an event series in China similar to Tough Mudder, our U.S. partner. In China, we have a distinct advantage.  We are producing in country, sourcing all materials locally, and we are supported by local investors and partners.  With operations localized, we're able to reduce the impact of tariffs, have a competitive price innovative product, able to gain mass appeal with local partners are able to leverage their experience and networks to increase our speed to market, capitalizing on today's health minded consumer with our trend forward fitness beverage. 
We are driving tremendous progress across all of our regions of our business, reaching a broader audience with more products through an increased number of distribution channels.  We're very optimistic about our future and the direction we are headed. 
In addition to the incremental momentum and expansion, we are also very active, engaging consumers in driving awareness and trial.  Our Tough Mudder sponsorship is in full spring in the U.S.  During the second quarter, we toured Miami, Texas, Philly, Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, and Boston.  And on average, we sampled over 25,000 to 30,000 people each and every weekend while touring these cities and also through our guerilla sampling events, which continue to cross the U.S.
In addition to consumer sampling, the team also sampled heavily in the trade, attending several events and trade shows targeting vending, colleges and universities, health and fitness, and retail partners.  Our digital team continues to leverage our assets and our increasing engagement on all social platforms.  In addition, we launched our CELSIUS LIFERS Brand Ambassador program with great success, receiving great interest and support for the program. 
We currently have a team of over 300 passionate ambassadors throughout the nations signed up for the program and many are being on-boarded -- more are being on-boarded as we speak.  This is going to increase our reach, engagement, and influence. 
Additionally, in the second quarter, our newest flavor to our core line, a great tasting kiwi guava, was well received, and made it to the shelves of many retail outlets in the second quarter, including 7-11 and many fitness locations.  In addition, the new flavor gained interest from many of our customers for its crisp taste, great flavor, and it's perfect and refreshing for the hot summer days. 
Also in the quarter, we finalized and introduced in July two new flavors for our convenient on the go powdered sticks.  The two new flavors, combined with our clinically proven functional formula, adds coconut and cranberry lemon flavor to our existing power lineup of orange, and berries.  These new flavors are available online as well as fitness locations and other fine retailers and adds additional points of availability.  Our delicious on the go stick, loved by Celsius fans, allows consumers to enjoy Celsius anywhere. 
We are a lean organization capitalizing on today's health and wellness trend, with our innovative portfolio of products with mass appeal.  Our brand is resonating with today's consumer and has gained considerable momentum.  Our future has never looked brighter.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks.  Edwin? Thank you, John.  Total revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $9.3 million compared to $10.2 million in the second quarter of 2017.  The 9% shortfall was mainly attributable to the timing of sales, as John discussed earlier. 
Looking now at the results by geography.  North America sales were up a robust 29% year-over-year due to growth in existing accounts and new distribution expansion.  In Europe, the normalizing of inventories translated to a 78% slowdown in sales, as our customer reduced orders in the second quarter of 2018.  And in Asia, sales decreased due to the timing of orders and the application of promotional discounts provided interest in the quarter. 
Although gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 reflected a decline of $585,000 or 13% to $4 million, our margins remain very healthy at 42.8% of revenue.  This compares to $4.6 million of gross profit in Q2 2017, which also delivered healthy profitability of 44.6%.  The decline in gross profit dollars was the result of lower volume, while profitability was affected by the slotting fees and other similar charges in the international markets.
Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 were $4.1 million compared to $2.4 million for Q2 in 2017, an increase of 72%.  The increase is primarily due to investments in marketing programs to continue to build our brand, and employee investments in order to have a solid infrastructure for growth. 
General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were $3.1 million compared to $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 93%.  The increase was primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $945,000 related to the settlement of a territorial dispute with a former distributor and an increase of approximately $600,000 for recognition of option expense, as well as a slight increase in research and development costs of $67,000, which were partially offset by savings in other areas of approximately $120,000. 
Net loss to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $3 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share compared to a net income of $380,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share for the corresponding period last year. 

Net loss and net income attributable to common stockholders includes preferred stock dividends.  For the second quarter of 2018, the net loss included preferred dividends of approximately $43,000 and for the second quarter of 2017, the net loss included preferred dividends of approximately $91,000.  The savings in preferred dividends is associated with a conversion of our preferred D shares to common stock during the period. 
Operating expenses for the second quarter reflected noncash charges, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, for a total of approximately $1.2 million compared to $585,000 for Q2 2017. 

Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was a negative $2.1 million compared to a positive $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2017.  Now, by excluding other one-time charges and the net investment in Asia, we obtained non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA results, which are very close to breakeven and a negative $261,000 in the second quarter of 2018, which is comparable to a positive $1.1 million for the corresponding period in 2017.
We believe that the information reflects the adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP financial aspects enhances the overall understanding of our performance.  To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release. 
Now, turning to our year to date results.  For the first 6 months of 2018, revenues increased a robust 32% to $21.4 million as a result of excellent growth in North American sales of 45%.  Similarly, Asia reflected a strong increase of approximately $1.3 million, which were partially offset by a decline of 30% in European sales of $1.4 million.  The decline in European sales mainly pertains to the timing of reorders on our core Celsius line, which was partially offset by the launch of our BCAA CELSIUS line in Northern Europe. 
The increase in total revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.  Gross profit for the first 6 months of 2018 increased by a solid 26% to $8.7 million, delivering a strong gross profit margin of 41% compared to $6.9 million a year ago, which also delivered a healthy 42.8% gross profit margin.  The increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increases in revenue, while gross margin profitability was affected by incremental promotional allowances and slotting charges.
Operating expenses for the first 6 months of 2018 increased 77% to $14.9 million, up from $8.3 million in the prior year.  This increase was driven by investment in sales and marketing initiatives of $5.2 million and a $1.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses. 
Regarding other expenses, there was a decline of 7.5% to $80,000 in the first 6 months of 2018 compared to $87,000 in the first 6 months of 2017 as a result of lower interest expense.  The company's net loss attributed to common stockholders for the first 6 months of 2018 was $6.4 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.6 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the comparable period in 2017.
Operating expenses for the first 6 months of 2018 included noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation totaling approximately $1.9 million compared to $1.6 million last year.  Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2018 was a loss of $4.2 million compared to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $47,000 in the year ago period.
By adjusting or other nonrecurring charges and investments in Asia we once again obtained very good results close to break even, reflecting a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2018 of a negative $120,000 compared to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $805,000 for the comparable period last year.
Now, turning to our companies.  As of June 30, 2018, the company has cash of approximately $8.5 million and working capital of approximately $16.3 million.  This compares with $14.2 million in cash and $20.6 million of working capital as of December 31, 2017.  We believe our current cash balance is sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the next 12 months.  Cash used in operations for the first 6 months of 2018 totaled $5.8 million compared to $2.7 million in the first 6 months of 2017.  The increase in use of cash in 2018 is mainly related to the net loss from operations, as the net use of cash related to operational assets and liabilities was actually $1.2 million lower in 2018 than in 2017. 
That concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, you may open the call for questions.  Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. So maybe you can give us a little better understanding.  In domestic, it seems that demand temporarily outstripped supply and you had about, I think, $1 million or $1.3 million I think you said in orders that shifted into Q3.  Was that - how much of that I guess was because you were filling the channel for Target and CVS?  And then also, can you tell us more about the sell-throughs at CVS.  I think you said there was a reset there in terms of where they had the products in the stores. 
Also, is CVS rolling to more stores?  Are they adding more flavors?  So just trying to get a sense of that and then maybe just where you stand now in terms of inventory and production capacity.  Do you think the stock outs are behind you now?  We can start with those. A: Sure.  Thank you, Jeff.  Appreciate the questions.  In regards to the delayed shipment of about $1.3 million, we had some temporary really production delays in regards to working with one of our largest co-packers that set us back several weeks.  Unfortunately, we did have - we weren’t fully out of stock on all of our SKUs but we did have about 2.5 weeks of out of stocks on timing of shipments to certain customers throughout our channels.  The accumulation of those that crossed over from the last week in the quarter to the first week of the third quarter, the total was $1.3 million, which has now shipped in the third quarter.
In regards to the procurement of the product and the production, as you recall, over the last several quarters and years, we've continued to work on solidifying really our production.  We are now running product at multiple co-packers.  We feel that our inventory has stabilized.  We have plans in place to continue to execute and we have our co-packers back online.  We actually added another co-packer online in the third quarter.  So we feel we have a sufficient amount of supply.  We're continuing to build more inventory as we continue to move forward.

But at this time point in time, we are shipping orders and we have sufficient inventory for growth.  When you look at your question in regards to CVS, as you recall, we went into -- in the first quarter, early second quarter, we entered 550 open-air front checkout coolers at CVS.  We have received reorders, strong reorders from CVS, and we are extremely optimistic as we continue to partner with them.
As we mentioned before last call that there would be a review taking place somewhere around September for the resets coming.  So based on the momentum and volume of reorders we're receiving from the CVS locations, we're very excited about the opportunity. 
In Target, we were authorized with 3 SKUs, as I stated, in 1,000 stores.  So through the quarter, the second quarter, we were going through that process with reorders.  The great news that we were very excited, as well as Targets, when the product hit the shelf, in regards to the reorders we are receiving.  So we're very excited about the momentum there and we stated earlier in the call that we are very optimistic on gaining additional SKUs of additional placement in the back half of this year due to the initial success of the product.  So we're really excited about that partnership at Target and we look forward to a very prosperous future as we move forward with that. Okay, well, those sounds like great launches.  And then maybe if we can shift a little bit to the Nordic region, if you can help us understand better what was behind the decline in the Nordic region.  I know you mentioned a couple of elements there with new flavor launches and so forth.
But I think you also said that in May you had a really strong month.  So was trying to parse those out.  Maybe just touch on the sell-throughs, how sell-throughs have been in that region and it sounds like maybe there's a disconnect between the sell-throughs and the orders you’ve received in Q2.  And then maybe just give us a sense of what you're expecting in Q3 from that region. A: Thank you, Jeff.  Out of the Nordics, when we look at the Nordics, we're talking about Sweden, we're talking about Finland, and Norway as the opportunity there with our strategic distribution partner.  When you look at the prior quarter, in 2017 to 2018, there was a variety of new SKU launches, which took place in that quarter recycling those.  In addition, we mentioned our distribution partner is bringing investments down to more of a more manageable volume.
So as a result of that, and they're going through this transition of a new packaging refresh, of a new look and feel.  We are very confident that these orders will be more normalized as we move forward.  We already have orders in place that are under production as we speak for the third quarter.  So it was really a timing in regards to replenishment orders with our customer in the Nordics.
In regards to May, I stated May was a great sales month.  Speaking with our distribution partner over there, their sell-through in the month of May was very strong.  They had a variety of programs where they had pallet drops in a variety of the co-op location and they were very motivated for the May momentum.  So we expect this to be a timing as we move forward and get back to more normalized levels. 
The other positive news that's coming out of the Nordics in regards to Finland and Norway is we're getting information that we're further expansion into the co-op locations in those outlets.  There's a great opportunity as resets take place in the back half of 2018, early 2019.  We'll be able to gain additional national distribution with the other key accounts in the market. And then just one more for me.  I China, I think you said you're now in about 25,000 doors, which is great.  You’ve increased the door count a lot there.  Can you give us a sense of how the sell-throughs are trending there?  Maybe what you expect in terms of the trajectory of your business there in the near term? A: Absolutely.  In regard to China, and you look at the quarter, the second quarter, we had a considerable amount of product that shipped in March.  So in addition to that, our team anticipated the resets taking place earlier in the second quarter than they did post-Chinese New Year.  A lot of the retail resets were taking place on key accounts further back towards the back end of the quarter.  And as a result of that, we lost several, really several weeks of sell-through opportunity. 
But at the end of the quarter, as you mentioned and stated on the call, we were in over 25,000 locations and 11,000 key accounts, which is really key to our success there.  We are in some monumental accounts.  The sell through has been extremely positive in these accounts when we're seeing the initial take rates, which we've been in there about four to really several weeks now.
So we are getting reorders.  We have a reorder in July that we produced and have sold to our master distributor, and we're gearing up for another order to come in for August any day now.  So the product is turning and we're gaining more feedback, more ground data to understand further how Celsius is performing.  But we are getting great placement in the stores and we're seeing some great execution by our distribution partners. Our next question comes from Jeff Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Hi, Edwin and John.  This is actually Bethany on for Jeff.  Can you hear me okay? A: Yes, we can, Bethany.  Thank you. Okay, great.  So I just had a couple questions.  I think I'd like to start with any trends within the fitness energy drink segment, including flavors?  I know that you had introduced a coconut one because coconut water had become so popular.  Are you seeing any other trends similar to that one? A: That’s a great question.  We had a variety of great momentum in the second quarter with our flavors and one of the big interests in our flavor, which was one of our new flavors, was the kiwi guava.  We got excellent feedback, excellent distribution from our distribution partners.  It was really embraced by the fitness channel as well and we got a substantial off take in regards to that product turning and we expect that kiwi guava flavor to gain additional authorizations in our key accounts as we continue to move forward for the next planogram reset. 
When you look at, as you mentioned, our coconut, which is our powder product, we just launched it in July, as well as our cranberry lemon, which is a great flavor.  It really is an excellent product.  Everyone loves it and that is just now rolling in through really the fitness channel. Okay, got it.  And then also, I think you mentioned that you had expanded into about 300 Planet Fitness locations.  Did that include the HEAT line and your original line or are you aiming more towards one or the other? A: When you look at our HEAT line, our HEAT line initially launched in the fitness channel and we look at the distribution of the heat line currently.  It is mainly in the fitness channel and we do have SKUs authorized nationally at 7-11 where we have about 25% ACV distribution throughout the nation today.  Our teams are focused on expanding that because we do have national authorization with those two SKUs. 
But specifically speaking to Planet Fitness, you're going to see a combination of our original line as well as our CELSIUS HEAT line in those Planet Fitness locations, as well as through all the fitness channels.  You'll see a combination of our core line as well as the Celsius heat.  And both lines are performing extremely well in that fitness channel. I also was wondering if you could talk a tiny bit about the vending micro-market initiative.  Could you add a little more color on that? A: Absolutely.  The vending micro-market opportunity is extremely exciting for us.  When we look at how Celsius goes to market, we're targeting consumers where they live, work, and play.  And this is full encompassing.  So the micro-market, we have a dedicated team focused on the opportunity and really, addition to micro-markets, it's healthy vending as well as colleges and universities as well.
And the micro-markets, which we started to roll into that channel in the second quarter, which is really at work locations, we're seeing an extremely high off-tick in regards to the number of sales running through on a weekly basis out of these micro-markets.  It is a great opportunity for us.  So you're going to see us at your at-work location.  You'll see us at your health club.  You'll see us in your vitamin specialty store.  You'll see us in your drug channel.  You'll see us in your mass channel and you'll also be able to purchase this online.
So we're available for consumers.  We're going to continue to expand that distribution.  That is a major focus, which aligns nicely with our marketing strategies, as well that continue to target consumers where they live, work, and play. And last, I wanted to ask one more related to your online presence.  I remember last quarter, you had started the Ambassador program, and I guess you said you had about 300 with more onboarding by the minute.  I'm curious, can you track clicks from your Ambassador's posts to your website?  And if so, are you seeing any additional volumes from those clicks? A: That's a good question.  We have very passionate fans of the brand.  We have on boarded over 300 and more as we're speaking.  We are seeing more social engagement.  We do have some additional software we use to be able to track the engagement that's out there, not only on our sites, but other third party sites as well.  And we're seeing increases in the overall engagement. 
So this program is really a great opportunity for us to really continue to attract our core fans, to really spread Celsius.  People are very vocal.  They're excited.  It is a great product.  It's an experiential product and this platform allows them to get additional benefits for being a fan of the brand.  So we're really excited about that and it's all incremental. Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. I was just wondering, John, if you could just go a little bit more into what the situation with the Nordic distribution partner.  Just trying to understand if it was partly timing or other factors there and the same with China.  That one seems like it's more timing. A: Sure.  Thank you, Anthony.  The Nordic partner, when you look at the overall revenues, I think you get a clear picture.  When you look at the quarterly run rate on revenues in 2017, they had large revenue orders in Q2 and Q3 with some of the new flavors that they brought onboard and it's taking some time for those flavors to cycle through and get inventories down to more normalized levels.
So that's one thing they are focused on, our partners are focused on improving their working capital.  So they are bringing investments down to really a more manageable just-in-time system, which we've been working with them and that's something we've been working on for some time now, really bringing on those two additional co-packers.  So we've been working on a variety of different synergies on trying to be able to provide them orders in a more timely manner so that it improves their working capital needs.
We have received orders for the third quarter.  We have produced orders for July.  We have orders in August and September.  Actually, we have an order in-house for October as well.  So it is moving towards more normalized levels as they work through that inventory.  Plus, they had a repackaging and a refresh that they were going through really cycling down some of their inventory levels. 
When you look at China, you are correct, it is truly a timing issue there in regards to the recognition of revenue because when we produce the product, just like in the Nordics and just like in China, we're selling full production runs to our master distributor.  So a lot of those orders in China took place late in the quarter, and as a result of those resets really taking place later in the quarter that affected the sell-through.  And as a result, we did not get reorders in the quarter, but we do have orders in-house for July and we should be getting another order momentarily for August production as well. You have two co-packers that are back online, which should enable better just-in-time inventory; correct? A: Well, that's in the Nordics.  We have two co-packers in the Nordics, one in Holland and one in Germany that we had, we brought online for some time, and we're really working with our partner to streamline a lot of that inventory and the flow of that inventory as well.  And then they're bringing down their inventory levels for additional working capital. That's what I meant.  I flipped back to the Nordic.  Okay, and then I don't know if you provided an update on 7-11.  But if you could just talk about how that rollout is going. 
Absolutely.  I mentioned on the call, 7-11 is a great opportunity for us.  We are focused on 7-11.  We are right around on really our core line, we're right around a 50% ACV at 7-11.  We are coming through the national wholesaler network at McLane, but we've been able to maintain our position.  We're seeing increases each and every month on the increase in really ACV as we go forward, as well as the volume per outlet. 
So we're really optimistic and very excited about that partnership.  It continues to forget this relationship.  We are attending a lot of the FOA franchise association meetings to gain additional distribution.  It is a continual work in process because 7-11 is a franchise owned really retailer.  So we have to go door by door in order to sell additional distribution.  So we're doing a variety of different tactics to continue to grow within 7-11.  We're in about 50% of our core line, 25% with our CELSIUS HEAT line, and a tremendous amount of opportunity as we continue to grow and increase our ACV.
And that's just going to take time.  It's going to take effort and we're focused on it.  With these stores continuing to perform well and sales increasing a monthly, quarterly basis as we continue to build the brand base, these other retailers are going to - the other stores will come online.  Very optimistic about that and they are a great partner for us. Just two last quick ones.  Vending machines, I know that that's a relatively new opportunity for you.  But can you talk about the traction there? A: The traction there has been very successful.  We currently have 2 team members that are truly focused on this initiative.  We are in -- I'll have updated numbers on the next call.  In the third quarter, I can provide further detailed numbers on our update, how many hypermarkets, micro-markets we are in, as well as additional vending machines.
But initially throughout the quarter, we feel confident we gained in excess of about 1,000 vending machines and micro-market locations.  So those at work and healthy vending machines.  And the opportunity is exponential out there.  There is a great opportunity for us and the turns we're seeing at these at work locations and in these healthy vending machines is extremely positive. Then just the last question.  There was, it looks like, a $1 million legal settlement with a former distributor.  Can you just refresh our memory on what that was about and is that completely resolved now? A: We did have a legal dispute, territorial dispute with a distributor that we had ongoing in the LA Court System for some time.  It was last year it was filed.  We've gone through the process.  With time, effort, we moved through settlement to move forward.  We have great opportunities in our business to continue to grow and that settlement is behind us and we are focused on growing the business. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [ Richard Tilley ],  a private investor.  Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon, gentlemen.  My name is [ Richard Tilley ].  I'm a stockholder for 11 years, having bought my first Celsius stock in June of 2007.  Now, I buy my Celsius product at the Harris Teeter store in Southern Pines, North Carolina.  So my comments can only be related to what products they carry.  The first is the Celsius can that has a black top.  My flavors I like are watermelon and grape.  They also carry the HEAT product and finally, they carry other products with an aluminum top.
Can you tell me why there's such a drastic difference in the taste between the black top Celsius and the aluminum top Celsius can?  I'm anxious to hear what you have to say because there is a dramatic difference in taste. A: Thank you, [ Richard ].  First off, I truly appreciate your long-term commitment as a shareholder to this company and I can assure you the management team and employers are working very hard and diligently each and every day. 
To answer your question at Harris Teeter, the black top cans in our core line are sparkling, are all of our sparkling flavors.  It's a differentiation to our products.  The aluminum tops [indiscernible] cans on our core line is our non-carb, which is a Raspberry Acai and a Peach Mango Green Tea.  So those are our two tea flavors in the core line.
We also have, in Harris Teeter, our naturally sweetened lime, the naturally caffeinated lime, which is sweetened with stevia and erythritol. So there will be some flavor profile differences from our core line to our natural line that contain -- that naturally sweetened line that contains the stevia and erythritol.
But I will assure you, our natural line, which has just entered Harris Teeter, is doing extremely well in the natural channel and Sprouts and Fresh Market.  And we are seeing a lot of demand for that product as well. Our next question comes from [ Diane Nagy ], a private investor. Yes, I'm a long-term investor as well and my first question is how do you see the tariffs affecting the bottom line for the coming quarters? A: Thank you, [ Diane ].  I appreciate you joining the call and thank you for your long-term support.  In regards to the tariffs in China, I touched on that briefly on the call.  And one thing that sets us apart, which is very different than a lot of other companies that are importing into China.  We are not importing into China.  We are actually producing locally.  So it's local production, locally sourced raw materials.  We have a local team and we have an entity structure where we have a local company that's registered in Beijing. 
So we are not affected by the tariffs today because we are not importing products into China. I see.  The other question I have is a practical one.  I'm wondering you don't seek cheaper quarters.  The quarters you are in right now are pretty expensive and I think that would help the bottom line if you were to seek more reasonable rent. A: Our goal has been to continue to grow this business as effectively and efficiently as we can as a management team, and I can assure you, each and every one of our employees are dedicated to that, driving topline revenue growth, improving gross profit, and ultimately improving the bottom line.  We are very diligent on all of our expenditures where we gained additional quotes and we pushed vendors and suppliers to gain the best price for Celsius. 
As we continue to grow in scale, we will be able to gain additional efficiencies throughout our supply chain and throughout our [indiscernible] marketing and SG&A expenses.  And we continue to focus on that.  ON a year to date basis, taking out one-time charges and the investments that were made in Asia, we are at a close to breakeven and reinvesting those dollars into marketing with considerable investments in North America, where we're seeing strong topline revenue growth.  I hope that answers your question on that.  We're very diligent on controlling and monitoring expenses. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session.  At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing comments. A: Thank you.  Our underlying second quarter results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum, s we are capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends.  Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal.  We are building up on our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices.  I'm very proud of our dedicated team and I thank our investors for their continued support.  Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CELSIUS and have a great day.

During the third quarter, we achieved new record volume levels, and we further increased our footprint with increased distribution and expansion in a multiple other regions across multiple channels.
Expanding our reach and availability. Our focus and targeted investments in sales and marketing provided returns in the form of increased sales volumes, increased brand awareness and increased availability of our products as we continue to maintain premium pricing. These record volume level demonstrates our products are in demand, and our growing consumer base has never been stronger.
For the third quarter, revenue increased 54% to a record $16.6 million. North America revenues increased 92% to a record $11.4 million, and international revenues increased 7%, driven by reorders in Asia, which were partially offset by a 15% decrease in European revenues, mainly as a result of our Swedish distribution partner returning to more normalized ordering patterns as they have optimized their inventory levels and are cycling new flavor launches when compared to the prior year.
North America growth was driven from reorders from new accounts such as Target, CVS and Wawa, which we began sell-through during the quarter.
In addition, we experienced strong growth from existing accounts as a result of the expansion in our consumer base and demand for our products. Our production has returned to more normalized traditional levels, following the challenges we face during the second quarter as we continue to add additional co-packers to alleviate bottlenecks and lay the foundation for accelerated growth.
Third quarter reflects strong demand as we continue to capitalize on today's global health and wellness trends, targeting active health-minded consumers. These growing trends are present in every market, and the continued solid execution of our strategy to increase demand through a diversity of channels and geographic location continues to drive significant results.
Most notably, we significantly expanded our presence in China with broader distribution to the modern trade through our previously established partner, Qifeng Food Technology, a national wholesale distributor of food and beverages. As you may recall, we began our partnership with Qifeng Food's more than a year ago when we initially entered China market with placements in small select channels across Tier 1 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen as well as more than 30 other small markets across 14 provinces. The majority of our placements were in smaller, less mainstream retailers, albeit the consumer response was overwhelmingly positive. With their network of distributors, national expertise and proven ability to execute operationally, Qifeng Foods has successfully placed CELSIUS in more than 45 cities across 33,000 locations across China, including 15,000 key accounts.
Achieving broader distribution with larger retailers in China is a significant milestone in our efforts to increase product availability internationally. And we are positioning CELSIUS as a global beverage leader for active health-minded consumers.
With our investment of more than $8 million in the Asian markets to date, we have established a local infrastructure, including distribution, sales, marketing and operational logistics that will support exponential growth as we continue to strengthen our foothold in the region.
As we look into 2019, we are exploring further opportunities to partner with local influential strategic partners to further leverage our established operations, local infrastructure and local subsidiaries as well as further leveraging our existing local established networks to capitalize on today's health and wellness trends in the region, driving further availability and awareness for CELSIUS.
Domestically, we have impressive gains in new distribution with placements on the energy drink shelves in Target, a key national retailer, broadening our national footprint.
Additionally, our convenience store channel expansion continues with notable retailers such as Wawa, 7-Eleven, Sunoco, Circle K along with many others where we're seeing excellent product acceptance. Celsius also saw a key expansion during the quarter at CVS, which provides significant opportunity for future growth and national exposure.
With Target, initial placements included 3 SKUs; Sparkling Orange, Peach Mango and Sparkling Watermelon in single-serve 12-ounce cans now in more than over 1,000 of the over 1,800 location Target stores throughout the nation.
Achieving placements at such a high profile, esteemed retailer as Target, our brand -- takes our brand recognition to the next level.
Target's focus on health-minded conscious millennials strategically aligns with one of our top audiences we are aiming to reach. The initial launch exceeded our expectations, and the buyer is already making plans to add additional flavors.
In addition, during the quarter, we drove continued momentum in existing accounts, which was one of the key drivers of our growth in North America during the third quarter.
Domestic sales was a record $11.4 million, which was up 92% year-over-year as a direct result of the work we are doing to increase brand awareness through our strategic investments in sales and marketing.
We remain at record levels of production, and this, coupled with our strong network of distributors, puts us in the prime position for a strong finish in 2018.
We continue to focus on optimizing our routes to market in key regions with strong partners, where we have ongoing discussions with major distribution networks, which we are looking to leverage in 2019 as we continue to expand our footprint and availability.
In addition, during the quarter, we continued to target consumers with a live, work and play, and our CELSIUS Original's core line was added over 5,000 vending machines in micromarkets of national refreshment solution providers, leading a new wave of healthy energy via the vending channel. Placement in the vending channel provides additional exposure to new customers while allowing customers to try a single-serve cold can of CELSIUS. Opportunities in this channel are showing significant upside. Initial feedback has been extremely positive, and we are exceeding our partner's expectations in both micromarkets and glass front vending.
With a dedicated team focused on growing this channel, we view vending as a key channel for future sales growth. It is yet another avenue for reaching consumers with a live, work and play. Our products are perfect for the vending channel, who are demanding healthier energy options at work, on the go and on campus.
As previously mentioned, the increases in North America and Asia were partially offset by a 15% decrease in European revenues, mainly as a result of our Swedish distribution partner returning to more normalized ordering patterns and as they have optimized their inventory levels and are cycling new flavors when compared to the prior year, although our distribution partner continued to see positive sales growth.
We remain encouraged by the near-term prospect of adding several new key retailers to expand our distribution in Finland and Norway this year, which we believe will further our penetration and availability in those markets. Our military channel continues to exceed our distributors' and buyers' expectations. They are currently selling over 16,000 units per week, and the forward sales trajectory continues to trend upward for this channel.
Demand for healthy, functional energy sets remain robust. Our SPINS IRI data as of September 9, 2018, provides definitive proof and points that demand for our products in particular in the line of -- is in line with market trends. The convenience channel market has growth of over 5.8% over the past 12 months, which compares to our growth with CELSIUS at a 41.8% growth rate in the same market. We are outpacing the category growth in the convenience channel by a measure of 7.
We remain highly active with our sales and marketing initiatives, including programs during the quarter such as Tough Mudder, a series of competitive events for a range of athletic performances from beginner to the elite, with courses engineered for teamwork, where we attended over 18 events during the quarter and sampled over 75,000 health-minded consumers. Our marketing activities are in full swing with multiple events each and every weekend, with demonstrations and weekly guerilla sampling programs taking place between events.
Through our targeted guerilla sampling events, we sampled over 150,000 consumers this year and growing. In addition, our team attended multiple consumer and trade events including Mr. Olympia in Vegas, where we sampled an additional 12,000 health-minded consumers.
Sequentially, to the end of the quarter, we added an additional Executive Vice President of Marketing, Matt Kahn, to serve for the company and lead our marketing initiatives. He brings over 20 years of marketing experience to Celsius, having served a majority of his career in the beverage industry for companies with great brands such as Coca-Cola, glacéau vitaminwater, smartwater, Powerade and Heineken as well. And he has a proven track record of building brands, driving innovation and motivating teams to deliver exceptional results. And he has an impressive outlook for our future. We're excited for him to join our team.
The momentum of our business is continuing to accelerate with significant progress being made to expand distribution, increase brand awareness through our targeted and proactive marketing campaigns and management of production and cost of goods, all against a backdrop of increased consumer demand.
We are encouraged by our progress we are making and energized by the opportunity before us. I look forward to providing you further additional updates as we head towards a strong 2018 finish.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was a record $16.6 million compared to $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, which translates to a significant increase of 54%.
By geography, North American sales were up a robust 92% year-over-year from $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 to $11.4 million in the third quarter of this year. This increase was mainly due to growth in existing accounts and distribution expansion.
In Asia, sales also increased considerably from $362,000 in the year ago quarter to $1.4 million in the current period, an increase of 273% due primarily to the recent modern trade launch that John discussed.
The strengthening of North American and Asian sales was partially offset by a slight decrease of -- in revenue of 3% pertaining to other international regions and a 50% decrease in revenue in Europe as a result of our principal European distributor lowering their inventory levels, timing delays regarding launch of new flavors and discontinuation of certain other flavors. The net increase in revenues was driven by higher sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Gross profit dollars for the third quarter of 2018 increased by a healthy 47% to $6.9 million, up from $4.7 million in the year ago quarter. In contrast, gross profit margin slightly decreased to 41.5% in 2018 when compared to the prior year results of 43.3%. The increase in gross profit dollars was mainly attributable to increase in sales volume, while the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to increases in promotional allowances, slotting charges and increase in production and repackaging costs.
Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, were $8.7 million compared to $4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 84%. The increase is due primarily to marketing investments to continue to build our brand, particularly in the China market and investments in employee costs.
Regarding general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018, they amounted to $2.3 million compared to $1.6 million for the year ago quarter, an increase of 47%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $552,000 when compared to Q3 for 2017 as well as increases in employee costs of $129,000 and increase in professional fees of $91,000, which were partially offset by savings of $44,000 in other administrative areas.
Net loss to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $4.2 million or $0.08 per share compared to $1.7 million or $0.04 per share for the corresponding period last year. These losses included preferred dividends of approximately $44,000 for the third quarter of 2018 and $92,000 for the third quarter of 2017.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 included noncash charges, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, for a total of $1.3 million compared to $734,000 for the third quarter of 2017. As such, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2018 was a loss of $2.9 million, which included $5.1 million related to investments in our product launch in China and distribution expansion in Hong Kong. Excluding the investment in Asia, adjusted EBITDA was a positive $2.2 million, a significant improvement year-over-year compared to $1.1 million in 2017.
We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our year-to-date results. For the first 9 months of 2018, revenues increased a solid 40% from $27 million to $37.9 million in this year. The increase was a result of strong growth in North American sales revenue of $10.6 million when compared to the same period for 2017. Revenue from Asia and other markets also reflected an increase of approximately $2.4 million when compared to the same period in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our European revenue of 23%. Here again, the increase -- the net increase in revenues was driven by additional sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Gross profit dollars for the first 9 months of 2018 increased by a solid 34% from $11.6 million to $15.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018. Gross profit margins decreased to 41.2% in 2018 from 43% for the same period in 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increases in sales volume, while the decrease in gross profit margin is mainly related to increases in promotional allowances, slotting charges and increase in production and repacking costs.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $9.2 million during the first 9 months of 2018 to $18.4 million when compared to $9.3 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to marketing program investments including China investment of $8.1 million as well as increases in human resources investments in both marketing and the sales areas.
General and administrative expenses for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, were approximately $7.4 million, an increase of $2.2 million from $5.3 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in general and administrative costs is mainly related to the increase in stock-based compensation, the settlement of a territorial dispute with a distributor and an increase in research and development costs, which were partially offset by savings in other areas.
Below the operating line, other expenses, which mainly relate to interest expense, were basically flat year-over-year at $123,000 for the first 9 months of 2018 compared to $122,000 for the first 9 months of 2017. The net loss attributed to common stockholders for the first 9 months of 2018 was $10.5 million or a loss of $0.21 per share compared to a net loss of $3.3 million or $0.08 per share for the year-ago period.
Operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2018 included noncash charges for depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation totaling approximately $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million in the 9 months of 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2018 was a negative $6 million, which included $8.1 million of expenses related to a product launch in Asia and onetime expenses mainly pertaining to a settlement of a lawsuit with a former distributor of approximately $1 million. Excluding the Asia investment and onetime charges, we delivered a positive non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million for the 9 months of 2018.
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018, the company had cash of $5.3 million and working capital of $16.3 million. This compares to $14.2 million in cash and working capital of $20.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
We continue to have good turns in our working capital with good margins. As such, we continue to believe that our current cash balance and the results of operations will deliver sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next 12 months.
Cash used in operations for the first 9 months of 2018 totaled $9 million. The use of cash in 2018 is mainly related to increased operational losses, driven by high levels of investment in product launches and marketing initiatives primarily in Asia.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. John, can you speak a little bit more about the domestic sell-through trends? Maybe delve into the rollout with CVS and Target, and I guess how those are going, and how the door count might evolve in the future there? Yes, absolutely, Jeff. For the quarter, we saw great sell-through. Fairly all of our channels are showing extremely strong sell-through, and Target and CVS has been a great opportunity for us this year in 2018, where we initially launched, as we call it, a smaller test last quarter in regards to about 500 stores. Target has expanded us further. We're in over 1,000 stores today. There is a lot of opportunity to continue to scale in 2019. We see Target as a great partner for us, a great national footprint to capitalize on. And we're getting great interest and seeing good takeaways on the product. So we see Target as a great long-term partner. We had very strong sell-through throughout the quarter, and the same goes with CVS. CVS, we're in 500 -- about 550 locations and growing. We do have buyer resets coming up. We've gone through the year-end reviews, and it looks extremely positive to continue to partner with them towards the -- really towards 2019 as we look to move forward. And we're also actively speaking with other vendors in that drug channel as well, where we see great opportunity, really targeting that health-minded consumer. Okay, great. And then I know you added marketing talent recently. Just wondering any early thoughts on how you might evolve your marketing plans? Yes. We did bring on Matt Kahn to the marketing team. He has over 20 years of experience, as I previously stated. He is a great addition to the team. He has a proven track record of building brands, driving innovation and really motivating teams to deliver exceptional results. So we'd look -- you won't see anything drastic, any changes. We have a firm foundation that has been laid. Vanessa Walker, just thank her for her services and dedication to the company. We have a great foundation that has been laid to build upon. So you're going to see more from us as we continue to scale along. In 2019, you're going to see more consumer activation, more trade activation as well. But we're not going to move away from our core. We are targeting consumers, health-minded consumers with a live, work and play through a variety of initiatives from social media to key ambassador and influencer programs as well as events and guerilla sampling plans through 2019. Okay, great. And then if I could squeeze in one more. I think in your prepared comments, you said production is normalizing. Given the increased volumes you're running, maybe you can speak to how your co-packer setup is evolving and how that should benefit you going forward. Yes. As we continue to grow in scale, co-packer availability out in the North America has been challenging. There’s a lot of growth in the sleek can business where we are operating and producing at these co-packers throughout the country. Currently, we're operating at 4 co-packers. We are in talks currently with 4 other co-packers for 2019 as we continue to build out the supply chain. At this point, we are bringing inventory levels back up to more normalized levels to really support the growth as we look to continue this momentum into 2019. There is availability out there. You're starting to see we have -- there is some talk about cans being -- having supply issues, but we have good relationships with our can manufacturer, and we have not been affected with that. We have been working with them very closely as well. They were just in the office 2 weeks ago, and they are committed to partnering with Celsius and ACV, tremendous upside. So really working solidifying those relationships with our partners and suppliers as this is a joint effort as we build this brand together. So we see great opportunity and availability for 2019 to support the growth that we're seeing and the interest and the demand that's being -- that has been creating. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. This is actually Destiny on for Jeff. I had a few questions. Could you explain a bit more some of the strategic partners you're evaluating in China? What areas do you think they would be in and things like that? Sure. We currently -- as we continue to scale throughout China, we are looking to leverage -- further leverage our strategic networks as the last 2 rounds of financing brought in influential strategic investors that are located in China. We’re also talking to a variety of other strategic investors that we would be able to leverage further to really drive Celsius further, quicker and to a broader audience. We're talking a variety of different strategics, which are also within retail segment as well as with -- that can help also with advertising as well. So I don't have any further information I can share at this point, but we are talking to a variety of local strategic investors to help us penetrate further into the market. Okay, got it. And then it sounds like you're having some great success or early success with the vending channels. Do you think you'll be able to replicate that in China as well? Or is there really no interest there? And then I have follow-up on the vending channel. Yes, absolutely. That's -- we are replicating our same strategy in North America as well as in the Nordics as well in China. We see great opportunity in healthy vending in micromarkets within office buildings. And that's been a great success for us. We initially rolled that out and partner with Vistar as well as Canteen and several other large national vending wholesalers. And the initial rollout started in the second quarter, and it's really turned out very successful in the third quarter. And we see that continuing to build throughout 2019. We see great opportunities, and we're working at -- we see the same opportunities as well in Hong Kong, we're seeing a lot of office buildings as well. Cold availability, and there's nothing best than a healthier -- a healthy CELSIUS -- a Celsius energy drink next to healthier products in these healthier vending alternatives. Okay, got it. And then I also believe that I've read that all the original products are available to be implemented into a vending machine. How are your distributors determining which ones to put in? Does it go by geography or based on demand, things like that? We have a -- well, we have a standard planograms that are set up. You will see variances out there in the marketplace based on the operator that's managing those vending machines. So you will see inconsistencies throughout the market around different flavor availability, but you will see a lot -- mainly our core flavors that we're pushing this time of the year, entering summer. We have Kiwi Guava as a new great flavor with great acceptance, Raspberry Acai, and the Orange is a great flavor as well, as well as all our other favors that we offer. But all favors -- you are correct that all flavors are available through the vending. It does get limited on the number of slots of availability, so you will see a variance out there in the marketplace. Right. Okay. And then I thought I know or I heard that you also mentioned premium pricing. So what types of pricing trends are you seeing as compared to last year, even last quarter? Well, what we are doing are maintaining our pricing. We're driving strong revenue growth maintaining our gross profit margins, and we are not discounting price. We are driving our premium pricing in the marketplace, and this growth is not coming from discounting products. I think that's what we are trying to clarify early -- in the earlier comments, that this growth is organic growth from consumers, from reorders, on a great trajectory, and it's not driven by discounted products. This is sustained growth. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. So I just want to understand the launch in China and how much more money is going in there. Because the sales and marketing expense for the quarter was a lot more than we were looking for. Was that mostly due to the investments in China? Or is there something else there? Yes. During the quarter with the investments in China, that probably is higher than you anticipated, we did do a lot of activation in the quarter as we are entering the planograms for resets or the planogram discussions as they -- as all the retailers are planning out 2019. So there was a lot of activation that took place during the quarter as we're setting the stage in China for 2019 as we continue discussions with these key accounts to further deepen the penetration within the market. And John, I think -- or Edwin, I think I missed the number for how much was invested specifically in China. It was a combination of people and marketing, I guess, you said. What was the increased expense? Because I heard one number but I didn't know how -- maybe what time, just for people... Yes, you're talking -- for the year-to-date, it was $8 million, about $8.1 million of investment in China. That's what I heard, year-to-date. And for the quarter, how much was it? For the quarter, it was about $5.1 million. For this quarter, it was $5.1 million, okay. That wasn't just in sales and marketing. You have sales and marketing and then there were some other investments in the quarter, right, in China? That's correct. We had sales -- obviously, we invested in North America. We had a variety of activation going on. As mentioned, we were very active in the third quarter in North America at a variety of trade shows, consumer events, Tough Mudder events. We handed out thousands -- hundreds of thousands of cans, a lot of activation and getting great feedback with the targeted marketing. And so just as we go forward though, this was more of a -- based on all the things you just mentioned, John, it was more of an anomaly for this quarter than it is in the go-forward expectation, correct? That would be correct. Yes, okay. And then I don't know if I missed it, but did you give an update on 7-Eleven? Just briefly touched on 7-Eleven. 7-Eleven is doing extremely well. We are seeing good turns. We're partnered with McLane. And things are moving along very nicely with 7-Eleven. We see them as a great partner. They allow us to have national broad distribution. We're using them as a great example of what's -- how Celsius tend to perform within the convenience channel. And that's allowed us to expand this year throughout Wawa, further expansion within racetrack, our QT and Circle K as well in key regions. Okay. And then just in Norway. Are those timing issues, inventory issues, all of that, is that pretty much resolved right now? Or is there still some lingering issues there? In the Nordics, we're starting to see that inventory move to more normalized levels. We mentioned that last quarter that we would see more normalized. This quarter we saw it being more normalized. We will still see and experience historical, I guess, there would be seasonality effects, but we do see normalized level of revenues or inventories on their side. The product is still growing in the market, and we are very confident to continue to move forward with further expansion. As you mentioned, Norway and Finland are good opportunities. We continue to move further into those grocery outlets as well as hypermarkets within the region. Okay. And then just lastly on SKU expansion. I know you said you have 3 brands in 1,000 of the 1,800 Target stores. When for most of these stores are the resets going to take place where maybe you can get additional SKUs into whether be it CVS or Target or... Yes. Traditionally, the meetings take place in the back half of the year, so a lot of meetings have already taken place, and some are still taking place as we speak. And a lot -- and the retailers usually will update their sets, their planograms usually towards the back half of Q1 to Q2, you'll start to see some resets taking place. So we feel very confident to further expand in all of our channels with the momentum that we're experiencing currently. Our next question comes from the line of [ Jerry David ], a private investor. John, I just wanted to make a couple of comments. First, congratulations to you and the entire team. Hitting that $16.6 million top line revenue is absolutely critical in the beverage industry. And I'm so excited about you hitting that number because all the beverage companies are really being measured on that. So congratulations on that and the tremendous growth. And also the investment in China, it's just -- to me, it's a just going to be -- it's a golden egg there waiting, and you guys are just doing a great job there with your alignments and so forth in China. And the last thing I will comment is Matt Kahn, what a great pick you got there. He is a great guy with a great background, and I can see him really taking -- helping take Celsius to the next level. But I just want to congratulate you on such a great job to you and the rest of the team. Thank you, [ Jerry ]. We truly have a very strong and dedicated and passionate team, a focused team. And we look forward to continuing to drive further success. Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [ Peter Chisel ] with [ Via Productions ]. So what I really wanted to kind of just touch base on was the China expansion. And as of the last earnings call, at that time, to my understanding, the product was located in 25,000 locations at that time. So over the last quarter here, the revenue of $1.4 million, I was kind of crunching the numbers real quick, when I look that, about $60 in product per location. Is that a number that we are aiming for? Is that above what we're looking for or below? Where does that fall? Excellent question. We're not really using same-store sales data. We have not done that in the past. A lot of those stores came on late in the quarter. We are in about 127 subdistributors that are servicing those locations and about 15,000 key accounts. So the 25,000 was through the quarter, and then we closed that additional accounts towards the back half of the quarter. Okay. And then just in regards to kind of future revenue and cash. What are you anticipating that the continued investment in China and the additional locations that we'll be adding would in turn result with revenue growth in the future? We're looking to move our investment into more normalized levels as we move forward. To be further in line, we have the investment in the initial year of launch, which was this year. And we're looking for -- as we moved through Q4 and then towards 2019, we're looking for more normalized P&L. There will still be investments, but they'll be more normalized. We have reached the end of our Q&A session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our third quarter result demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum. We are capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. I am very proud of our dedicated team, and I thank our investors for their continued support.
On December 5 and 6, management will be available and will be presenting at LD Micro. We look forward to seeing many of you there. Thank you everyone for your interest in Celsius, and have a great day. Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

With that, I'd like turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared comments. John. Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was an exceptional year for the company, as we expanded our distribution channels and increased our product availability through existing channels to gain greater visibility for a portfolio of premium fitness beverages, all while accelerating our top line revenue growth.
With innovative products and compelling packaging, we are reaching more and more consumers each and every day. Our strategy in positioning CELSIUS as a global beverage leader for health-minded consumers remains our top priority.
We continued our expansion further into traditional retail with great success and we positioned the company for future growth with expanded roles within our ranks. In addition, we brought on high performance individuals with diverse background and experience. Jon McKillop was promoted to Executive Vice President of North America sales; and Edwin Negron was appointed as Chief Financial Officer in July of 2018; and Matt Kahn joined the company as our Executive Vice President of Marketing in October.
On top of these additions, we further transformed the organization to support our growth in all departments, which will allow us to pursue our growth initiatives and strengthen our financial performance.
CELSIUS 2018 performance sets a new record for our portfolio with extraordinary gains in our efforts to increase distribution, expand availability of our products reaching more consumers and increasing our brand awareness and we continue to target health mining consumers where they live, work and play.
Throughout the year we achieved a steady stream of new high profile, marquee, domestic retail and distribution partners with the addition of Target, Food Lion, Hannaford and CBS, as well as continued expansion with existing accounts such as 7-Eleven, Race Tracks, Sprouts, Harris Teeter and many others.
At the same time our dedicated sales team drove a 62% annual growth rate in North America sales. All channels of trade including health and fitness, grocery, the expansion into drugs, mass, military, vending and online sales drove sustained revenue growth throughout the year. As we drove increased velocities in existing accounts and expanded our distribution, reaching more consumers and positioning CELSIUS for continued growth into 2019.
In Europe we experienced a decrease in revenue of 17% for the year, as a result of timing of promotional programs, new flavor launches and our partner strategic reduction of inventory carrying levels. However we are optimistic about our partner’s ability to stabilize our revenues and are intrigued with our pipeline of planned innovation into 2019.
In January 2019 we lost a great new tasting flavor, Peach Buy [ph], which has quickly become a top selling flavor in the region. With a strong pipeline of planned innovation supported by key targeted marketing programs, we are well positioned to expand and capture more market share in the region.
In Asia revenues increased to $4.3 million for the full year 2018 with expansion in Hong Kong and continued focus building consumer awareness and trial in the region. And in addition in China we expanded over 47,000 locations in 63 cities with regional distribution through our partnership with Qifeng Food Technology. Our strategic investment in the region for 2018 totaled approximately $7.2 million, which established a foundation for our brand to continue to build upon.
In China during the year we established infrastructure, operations, sales and marketing to continue our commercialization efforts in the region. With additional investments necessary to reach optimal commercialization levels in China, we looked at several alternative solutions and structures to continue our expansion in the region.
After extensive analysis and review, subsequent to year end we announced our plans to restructure our business model in China. To continue to capitalize on growing demand in the region, while putting a financial structure in place that allows us to recapture more than $10 million we have invested in startup and commercialization efforts.
The agreement represents a significant milestone for our partnership, which will create mutual benefits for our organizations and enables CELSIUS to continue to expand its commercialization efforts in China, while significantly mitigating our risks and eliminating the need for additional direct investments, which will allow us to focus our working capital on North America and other emerging markets. In the region, we laid a pathway for continued growth in 2019 and beyond and will provide additional details later in the call.
For the full year 2018, revenue increased 45%, to an annual record of $52.6 million. North America revenues increased 62% to $38.9 million and international revenues increased 13% to $13.7 million for the year.
North America growth was driven by orders from new retail partners such as Target, CVS, all while both exceeding our internal expectations and new grocery and convenience store accounts such as Food Lion and Circle K. At the same time we also experienced a growth across as previously mentioned, all of our existing accounts and channels, including 7-Eleven, Sunoco, Race Track, and many others, as our base of consumers continues to widen and macro level demand for functional healthy fitness board, energy drinks continues to build momentum and is disrupting the traditional energy category.
Functional beverages are expected to emerge as one if not the fastest growing categories in the beverage industry, specifically functional and energy drinks are in high demand. Busier lifestyles and a focus on health and wellness are driving the need for convenient alternatives that give consumers a way to manage their wellbeing while they are on the go.
Consumers are increasingly seeking beverages that help them achieve their health and fitness and wellness goals, with a strong demand as a backdrop, our proven ability to onboard new distribution partners, identify new channels and optimize routes to ensure product availability have all been instrumental to our success. Today we have over four active co-packers in North America, two in Europe and two in Asia, with more identified which will continue to support our growth.
As an example, additional growth volumes in the military channel continue to exceed expectations and our reaching a $5 million, 52 week retail sales run rate and continued to grow. The dedicated team of professionals and our fitness channel are also delivering higher volumes, with further expansion in key accounts such as 24 Hour Fitness, Gold's Gym, Planet Fitness, Smoothie Kings and many others.
Our newest channel of focus in North America is our Vending channel, which we launched in the later part of 2017. This channel is demonstrating that significant upside potential in 2019 with expansion in more than over 10,000 locations nationwide through a dedicated team specifically focus to grow this channel.
To-date CELSIUS has been added to Vending Machines and micromarkets of refreshment solution providers, which include Accent Foods, Canteen, First Class Vending, Five Star Food Service, Southern Refreshment and CELSIUS is available for distribution throughout the United States in the vending channel through Vistar. We see a lot of opportunity in this channel as we reach new targets such as corporate work environments, universities and travel centers.
Specific to CELSIUS our SPINS IRI as of December 30, 2019 indicates strong momentum in the convenience channel, where CELSIUS is growing over 36% over the past 52 weeks, when compared to the convenience channel growth of overall 6% for the same period.
We are outpacing the category growth in the convenience channel by a measure of 6.2x with only a 10.2% ACV, All-acclaimed Cumulated Volume and we see massive opportunities as we continue to expand and further our reach in this category.
Subsequent to year-end we add a number of marquee accounts to our North American distribution network, including new placements at over 250 DICK’S Sporting Goods stores nationwide and further expansion in CVS, Target and many of our existing national partners.
In addition, we have further been building out our national distribution network with agreements from a number of new network partners associated with Anheuser-Busch InBev, Keurig Dr. Pepper, PepsiCo and MillerCoors network partners, which will further strengthen our distribution and availability into 2019.
In China as previously mentioned, we significantly expanded our presence in 2018 with broader distribution through our existing partnership with Qifeng Foods Technology, a national wholesale distributor of food and beverages.
Qifeng Food Technology was originally our partner when we initially launched in China and since that time they have been instrumental in our success and growth in the region. Through their expertise, relationships, network of distribution partners, CELSIUS is now available in over 63 cities and 47,000 locations across China.
We have invested more than $10 million in Asia markets to-date to establish a local infrastructure that includes distribution, sales, marketing and operational logistics to support the current business and to accept specified growth in the region, which we believe has a great opportunity for the future.
Earlier this year in January of 2019, as mentioned earlier we signed a definitive agreement to establish a royalty licensing agreement and repayment of investment agreement which Qifeng Food Technology, in order to create a risk mitigated method of moving forward in China and continuing to capture market share.
Under the agreement Qifeng Food Technology is granted the exclusive licensing rights to manufacture, market and commercialized CELSIUS branded products in China. In exchange we will receive a fixed licensing fee of $6.9 million over the next five year term, before transitioning to a volume base royalty fee.
The initial royalty fee which is fixed is based on discounting initial anticipated volumes by 50%. In addition to the initial fixed royalty, Qifeng Foods Technology will repay through a capital loans the amount invested in China over the five year initial term.
We believe the strategic move creates a stronger, collaborative relationship between the two companies and offers such as availability, means to capitalize on the tremendous demand in the region and extract additional value for our shareholders.
The increase in North America and Asia revenues for 2018 were partially offset by a 17% decline in European revenues as previously mentioned. This was primarily due to the result of timing of promotional programs, a reduction of inventory caring values by our distribution partner.
Our optimism about the opportunities in the region is reinforced by continued expansion in Norway and Finland and new innovation being introduced in Sweden. We are continuing to pursue the addition of several new key retailers to expand our distribution in the region and anticipate our Nordic revenues to return to more normalized levels in 2019.
Now moving to a recent complaint filed in the Federal District Court in the District of Nevada buy ROCKSTAR Energy. As an organization we continue to expand and CELSIUS continues to gain momentum. Other brands like ROCKSTAR will lose shelf space as a result of our success.
Today we are gaining eye-level placements in many retailers across the country and are outselling many of the SKUs of other much larger brands. With that said, CELSIUS is replacing the slower moving items from these other brands as these ones dominant brands are not aligned or positioned with today's health-minded consumers.
In addition, many envy our structure function claims which are backed by science, as well as our health board functional fitness position, which is aligned with today's health-minded consumer and is disrupting the category.
On December 18, 2018 Rockstar Inc, ROCKSTAR Energy owner filed a frivolous suit against CELSIUS. Rockstar complains and alleges false advertising, violation of trade practices and unfair competition. We find this lawsuit meritless, and we will vigorously fight this unfound lawsuit.
Moving to our sales and marketing investments in 2018, we increased our investments on sales and marketing programs with targeted and proactive campaigns to support our momentum. In addition we further strengthened our sales, marketing and operational departments, all while driving record revenues and delivering a positive net, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excluding our Asia investments.
Our team is focused on driving profitable growth and building shareholder value. Our targeted digital and social marketing platforms are nurturing an active lifestyle community to reinforce engagement and raise awareness of our brands.
Simultaneously we remain active with events and programs such as Tough Mudder, a series of competitive events for a range of athletic ability. We attended over 32 weekly events and key markets in 2018 and provided more than 153,000 samples to tens of thousands of health-minded consumers across the country, where we received rave reviews and expanded our community.
In addition, we conducted over 63 targeted griller marketing programs, where we sampled and interacted with over 95,000 consumers. We also executed over 1,100 targeted demos at key retailers and attended over 66 consumer, large consumer and trade events, including Health and Wellness Expose, Mr. Olympia, Europa again, 7-Eleven experience, NACK’s just to name a few.
Our marketing programs for 2019 include an increase of targeted, digital, social media and influencer marketing campaigns, as well as expansion and sampling programs across the country in targeted markets.
In addition, we have increased our consumer and trade events while we partner with Tough Mudder again in 2019, driving trial, awareness and increasing our household penetration. In addition, we have a great pipeline of planned innovative flavors, a new product scheduled for 2019, creating further opportunities for synergy and efficiencies within the ranks of our sales team, allowing for our expanded portfolio to flow through our existing distribution channels and to current and new retail partner shelves, adding incremental, true innovation to retailers energy and functional products sets. These new additions further our mission to create science based proprietary and innovative offerings.
All-in-all, 2018 was an extremely successful year. We have laid a solid foundation for the future with a proven model for expansion and growth and I look forward to speaking with you about additional accomplishments as they occur throughout 2019.
We are a lean organization, capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends, with our innovative portfolio of fitness forward products, which is positioned to disrupt the energy category. Our brand is resonating with today's health-minding consumer and is gaining considerable momentum. Our future has never looked brighter.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negrón-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin. Thank you, John. Starting with the quarterly results, total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $14.7 million, up 62% compared to $9.1 million in the year ago quarter. By geography, North American sales were up a robust 63% year-over-year to a record $10.9 million, up 63% compared to $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by growth in excess of 50% across each of our domestic channels. These results are a reflection of the continued momentum in existing accounts and the partnering with new distributors, thereby increasing our distribution network, making our products available to additional consumers.
In Asia, sales also increased by an exponential 367% from $435,000 in the year ago quarter to $1.6 million in the current period. Mainly due to the investment and good traction that has been obtained in the region throughout 2018.
In Europe, revenue increased 9% in the fourth quarter to $2.1 million as a direct result of new flavor launches in the region which are being well accepted by consumers. Across the board the increases in revenue were driven by higher sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by a robust 43% to $5.5 million, up from $3.8 million in the year ago quarter. In contrast, gross profit margin decreased from 41.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 37.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars was mainly attributable to the increase in sales volume, while the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to increases in promotional allowances with your accounts, lower margin and sales in Asia, and increases in freight and production costs in North America. All these aspects are being addressed to maximize our profitability in 2019.
Selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to $2.8 million. This translates to a significant decrease of $4.5 million when compared to $7.3 million in the year ago quarter. The 62% decrease was primarily due to reduction in the China marketing investment of approximately $5 million when compared to Q4, 2017, which was partially offset by increased spending in other areas such as broker costs of $200,000, storage and distribution costs of an additional $200,000 and employee costs of $50,000.
General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $3 million compared to $1.6 million in the year ago quarter, a various of 87%. The increase was mainly due to the stock based compensation expense of $1.2 million or an increase of $585,000 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an increase in administrative costs of $370,000, an increase of $305,000 pertaining to employee costs and an increase of $150,000 pertaining to research and development costs.
Net loss to common stock holders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was approximately $893,000 or $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $5.3 million or $0.12 per share for the corresponding period last year. The losses included preferred dividends of approximately $44,000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $92,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 included non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation expense and a loss on debt extinguishment for a total of $1.6 million compared to $606,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.
As such, adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $785,000. Additionally our results included $250,000 of one time charges, as well as a federal impact of $900,000 related to the reconciliation of the investments in China. Excluding these aspects, net non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $135,000 or 20% of the prior year amount of $705,000.
We believe this information in comparisons of adjusted and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true performance. To that effect the reconciliation of our gap results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our full year results. For 2018 revenues increased significantly by 45% from $36.2 million to $52.6 million this year. The increase was a result of a strong year-over-year growth in North American sales of 62%, delivering revenue of $38.9 million.
Revenues from Asia also experienced a dramatic increase of 438% year-over-year to $4.3 million. The increases in revenue North America and Asia were partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in European revenue of 17% due to the timing of new flavor launches, the discontinuation of some flavors and normalization of inventory levels.
Gross profit for the full year increased by 37% from $15.4 million for 2017 to $21.1 million for 2018. The gross profit margins reflected a contraction from 42.7% for 2017 to 40% for 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increases in sales volume, while the decrease in gross profit margin is mainly related to increases in freight, production costs and new account acquisition costs.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by 28% from $16.6 million for 2017 to $21.2 million for 2018. The increase is mainly due to marketing program investments, particularly in the China market which accounted for $7.2 million of total marketing costs, as well as investments in employee resources, broker costs and storage and distribution costs.
General and administrative expenses for 2018 were $10.5 million, an increase of 52% compared to $6.9 million for 2017. The increase in G&A expenses was mainly due to the stock based compensation expense of $1.7 million, the settlement of a lawsuit with a former distributor of $1 million, and increases in several other areas such as research and development costs, employee costs and professional fees.
Below the operating line other expenses were up from $161,000 in 2017, which was mainly related to interest expense to $566,000 for 2018. For the 2018 period interest expense amounted to $175,000. As such the bulk of the increase in other expenses of approximately $392,000 was mainly related to a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $377,000. The net loss available to common stockholders for 2018 was $11.4 million or a loss of $0.23 per share compared to a net loss of $8.6 million or $0.19 per share for 2017.
Operating expenses for the full year 2018 included non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation and loss on debt extinguishment totaling approximately $4.7 million compared to $2.6 million for the full year 2017. As such adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 was a negative $6.3 million. Additionally our results included one-time expenses of $1.3 million, mainly related to the settlement of a lawsuit with a former distributor of $1 million.
Similarly our 2018 results also reflect $7.2 million of expenses related to our net China investment. Excluding the China investment and one-time charges, we delivered a positive non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million for the full year 2018.
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018 the company had cash of $7.7 million and working capital of $20.2 million. This compares to $14.2 million in cash and working capital of $20.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilize $5.5 million of cash of which $1 million was related to the settlement of the lawsuit.
Later in the fourth quarter we entered into convertible loan agreements for the issuance of an aggregate of $10 million in principle of unsecured convertible notes due in December 2020. The principal amount of one of these loans is $5 million and replaces an existing $3.5 million credit facility netting incremental proceeds of $1.5 million.
Two additional loans with principal amounts of $3 million and $2 million represent new cap. We are using the aggregate net proceeds of $6.5 million for working capital purposes in support of the ongoing expansion of our operations. The additional capital provides us with sufficient resources to execute our current ‘19 operating plans. We continue to believe that our current cash balance and the results of our operations will deliver sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next 12 months.
Cash used in operations for the full year 2018 totaled $11.6 million. The use of cash in 2018 is mainly related to operational losses driven by high levels of investments in China and marketing initiatives in North America, as well as high levels of working capital required to support our incremental business volume.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone. Let me say first congratulations on the growth and improvement in metrics for both Q4 and the year. Thank you, Jeff. I appreciate that. We are really at a really solid fourth quarter and 2018 was a milestone year for the company. Can you speak more about what you are seeing with Target, CVS and the convenience store John. I am just wondering about sell-throughs there. I know you touched on some things in your prepared comments, maybe you touched on door account plans, adding new SKU’s, those sorts of things, what's been happening in the trends there. Sure. Thank you, Jeff. Target has been a great success for you have been watching. We started off in 2018 with a test in five stores, our 500 stores. We have now expanded that to almost 1,200 stores in Target. Started off with two SKU’s, now we’re up to three SKU’s and hopefully soon you'll be seeing a fourth SKU.
The sell through rate has been – everyone's been very pleased with the sell-through rate. Initial expectations internally – with the heated internal expectations at Target as well as our own you know we are still working through the supply chain. We are going through the warehouse, through Target, which as a result the product is selling a lot quicker than they can keep it on the shelf. So we do see some out of stocks frequently throughout the country over the last several months and our team has been working with the supply chain to make sure we have ample product on the shelf.
So the good news is we are seeing up increases in turns and as we continue to build out our national distribution network, we’ll be able to use some DST partners to keep those shelves fully stocked. So the sell through at Target has been positive and we look to further expand with them into 2019. We see Target as a great partner for us.
CVS has been a great account. As you recall, we started a test with them as well at 500 healthier, better for you coolers that they had as an initial test. CVS today for 2019, we further expanded. By the end of 2018 we're in over 1,000 stores with three SKU’s and we have been authorized nationwide for 2019. So we're in the process of going through the fulfillment process through their DC's to expand to all locations. So we see great success in the drug channel, especially with CVS and the other marquee banners as well which we are actively talking to. So between the mass channel at Target and the drug channel, just a lot of exponential growth there, the opportunities. Okay, that's great to hear. And then as a follow up to that, maybe you can update us a little bit more on how things are going, adding the domestic co-packers. I think you are working on some of those or speaking to some of those, and then maybe you can just speak a little bit more about some of the advantages of adding a new distribution partners and what do you expect to gain from those relationships in 2019 and beyond? Absolutely! Just to go back to your initial question with regards to following up on the convenience channel and that really ties in to our new distribution partners. So I’ll answer the beginning, the end part of that part of your question first.
We see great opportunity with the new partners and the opportunity in the convenience channel. Keep in mind we're currently at about at 10% ACV, seeing extremely good growth rates and getting a lot of interest from other marquee banners. We further expanded in Circle K. We see great opportunities with them in 2019. Qifeng is another customer we’re working with and we see great opportunity there, and we're – just a lot of interest for this category.
There's really a renaissance taking place right now in the energy category. You are seeing a lot of – and as health and wellness trends continue to take hold, you are seeing these fitness functional energy products really gaining the opportunities that it's never have been able to accomplish and there's a migration taking place for healthier alternatives in the category. Just like the Sugary Soda CSD category was affected many years ago from sparkling waters, you are seeing that in the energy category today and that's where we see great opportunities in the convenience channel.
Now how we're going to leverage the convenience is through our new distribution partners. Over the last three to six months we've been able to close key contracts and solidify distribution partners throughout the country with some of the largest strategic supply partners in the United States.
We’ve closed several Anheuser-Busch network partners, Keuring Dr. Pepper network partners, as well as the independent Pepsi bottlers as well and we're seeing tremendous opportunities. That is going to make sure we say stop in this channel. This channel is very competitive. We need to make sure that we have feet on the street that’s be able to keep those shelves stocked, because we are turning and we're turning at a really high growth rate. As I mentioned on the call, we're out turning a lot of the competitors of much larger brands.
So by closing these additional GST network partners, it's going to not only provide additional availability, additional points of distribution in this channel, but most importantly make sure we stay stocked and maintain our position on the shelf.
In regards to the co-packers, we have been adding co-packers throughout Q3 and Q4. We currently have four co-packers currently active and we have three additional co-packers that are going through our quality assurance process and supplier onboarding processes.
So we feel at this stage we are ready for beverage season. We’ve increased our inventories in the first quarter, as well as coming towards the end of Q4 and we feel we will have ample supply, we're building strong partnerships with our suppliers. So we feel we are well positioned for this summer. Okay, great. And then one more quick, hopefully a quick one if I could squeeze it in. Just wondering, do you feel like the Nordic area is as normalizer is normalizing now. I think the segment was a little stronger in Q4. I think you mentioned it was actually up or yield was up. So just wondering kind of what your thoughts are on that? Yeah, we feel the Nordic business is going to turn to more normalized levels and we are down for the year 17%. A lot of that came with Q2 revenues – Q1, Q2 revenues in 2018. We just launched the new flavor in the region called Peach Buy, which has allowed us to further increase our market share and is been one of the most successful flavors in the region over the last several years. So we're very optimistic about the opportunities that we have in the market. We also have a lot of new flavor innovation coming in the market in 2019 and we feel optimistic about that. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions and continued success. Thank you, Jeff. I appreciate it. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi John and Edward. Can you hear me okay? Yes Jeffery. Yes, thank you. Good morning. So could you talk a little bit about the LA-veet deal and locations, distribution as far as graphic locations and impact that may have upon the costs of goods and some of the packaging expenses. Could you just repeat the front end of that question briefly, I'm sorry. The LA-veet deal for the powder cups. Power cups, oh yeah. We in regards to the LA-veet opportunity, we see this as a great opportunity with our LA-veet on the go, really at work locations. LA-veet is really bringing CELSIUS to a new channel further expanding our at-work initiative through the vending channel. With LA-veet these are really sparkling water, healthier beverages, that LA-veet mission is to bring to the office space.
So they are very much aligned with our mission as well and we see that as a great fit. We launched with our first flavor labor which was our Orange, Orange Powder product. We are working with them on additional innovation for 2019. They are vigorously placing a lot of machines throughout the country with key corporations. So it’s another opportunity for individuals to enjoy CELSIUS. So we see it as a great opportunity for us, bringing us into a new channel for incremental revenue. Okay, got it. Can you talk about some of the anticipated marketing partnerships or the new ones that we should look for in the coming year? Yes, we will have new partnerships coming onboard. We've been very busy as an organization over the last three, six months. Matcon has put together an extremely aggressive plan for 2019. You'll see we are partnering with Tough Mudder again and 2019 which is about to get started here in the next few weeks, really excited about that partnership.
We're going to be further activation with Tough Mudder. We are also working on tying that in to key retail partners. So we are activating the trade, which is so critical at this stage of the company.
You’ll see additional opportunities, additional really marking properties that we will bring to the table. In addition, we’re also integrating an influencer program, further driving that further and expanding upon that and further activating digital social activations.
So it is a full encompassing marketing plan you'll see rolling out. More to come on that, as we continue to progress, but we are going to continue with our mission to continue to target consumers with a lid work and play. We want to be a part of everyone's like, looking to live a healthy, active lifestyle. Okay, got it. And one more if I may, Edwin can you talk a little bit about margins, occur margins and maybe talk about the impact that additional co-packers may have going forward and are there any margin hits in nature from the fourth quarter they you expected to get back during 2019? Sure, very well, thank you. Very good question. Absolutely one of the things that John and I have been evaluating sees, excuse me is a tradeoff as it relates to expanding our co-packers, because we have experienced a little bit of additional costs as it relates to some of those co-packers. But again, we want to guarantee that we have sufficient inventory levels of service you know the summer season at this point.
We did have some onetime charges, not much regarding some excess and obsolescence inventory. But again we are keeping a very good eye on that and our freight costs had been made sure that in 2019 we will maximize our margins going forward. Okay, got it. And no forward looking guidance on any metrics for ‘19 at this point. No, not at this point Jeff, no. Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice quarter. Thank you, Anthony. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Hey guys how are you. Very well thanks. I just wanted to focus on, a little bit first on the China investment and then go forward with some of the questions that I have. So on China it looks like it was a negative million. Is that because as you said it’s reconciliation of the investment there. Did they already pay $950,000 in the fourth quarter to recoup some of the investment you've made in China? No, no they have not. This pertains basically to the reconciliation and excuse me, the vouching that we’ve been doing as it relates to the accrued expenses that we have done, but no it has not translated into, let’s call it any cash flow. Okay, I see, I see. And has the deal officially closed or is it still waiting final approval signatures and all that. Anthony, this is John. We had – we executed a definitive agreement as of January 1, 2019. We're going through the final reconciliation and we'll have the loan, capital loan finalized by the end of this month. So we are come to mutually agreed upon terms. We are looking at approximately in excess of $10 million on the capital loan to be repaid over the five year term, but that will be finalized by the end of this month or sooner. Okay, great. And then gross margin, now that you are going to be out of China, you know in terms of the direct investment there. I know there is royalty there, but should the gross margin for the rest of the business start to move back up or is this gross margin in the high 30s is more appropriate for 2019. That's a good question. As we grow in scale we're bringing on some marquee accounts. With the marquee accounts comes the slotting, as well as additional promotional activity, really which is required to really if you want to call it set, you know set the account to make sure you are getting the off-tics and the pull through.
So on these early stages with the these new marquee accounts, we are taking a lesser margin as a result of increased promotional activity, and keep in mind slotting and promotions are a direct offset against revenue. So although our kind of run rates, optimal run rate margins will be much higher as we continue to scale on the second year, we will have some margin contraction on these new accounts. So you are looking at a blended margin.
I think if you look at historically where we finished the year for 2018, we should be somewhere around that target. It seems more than achievable at this point. Also as we gain further momentum, we’ll be as Edwin mentioned, be able to leverage these new co-packers coming onboard to drive additional efficiencies in the cost of goods.
We are also exceeding some freight savings, kind of heading into the New Year versus what we experienced in Q4. Q4 freight rates were extremely high on a per pallet basis, but they have leveled off and actually decreased slightly. So I think a good range is to look at the full year margin for 2018. Okay, no, that's helpful John. Just in terms of inventory, it looks like that almost doubled here. Was that some of the newest SKU’s coming online or what was that? Sure, Edward would you like to answer that. Absolutely! Yes. Thank you. Yes, basically again we're getting ready for the summer season and that's why you see our inventory levels have increased and if you look you know prospectively, we think that that going forward is going to be the right level of inventory so we can service our accounts and avoid out of stocks. So we feel comfortable with that. Okay, and then lastly in terms of competition, you know just based on data we've been able to gather because this is probably held. You know Bang looks like they are approximately $500 million in revenue if we can figure that out correctly. How do you look at yourselves in terms of positioning against Bang and, you know what are your strategies in 2019 to sort of counter their growth? Yeah Anthony, that’s a great question and VPX has done a great job and they are capitalizing on these new trends. As I mentioned earlier, there is a renaissance happening in the energy category and is being disrupted today and it's happening rapidly. You can see that would – Bang’s success over the last, you know six months, last year as well. They've been gaining a tremendous amount of traction and so is CELSIUS.
We see Bang as a complementary. Their target consumers is 18 to 24, ours is 24 to 36. We are more female. We have 50% female 50% male when you look at our demographics and we complement each other nicely as this new category is really evolving. And Rodney Sacks on Monster. Monster mentioned on the last earnings called about the new category being this performance energy category. And it's not just a new category, that's going to be really the new energy category overall and you are seeing these early indications of the transformation of this category, just like the CSD category was disrupted as well.
So we see great opportunities and also bring our partners that are coming on board, you know further partnerships with Target and CVS, the AV Network, you know EDP and the PepsiCo partners, this is happening extremely rapidly. As John, let me just follow up on the network. So you are signing up some of these independent distributors that are part of Anheuser-Busch, Keuring Dr. Pepper. I’m just curious is – what do you see as the synergies there or the benefit of being part of those networks? Is it more than just having those distributors? What additional benefit is it that they're part of these larger companies. Yeah, it's critical in our business and the beverage business. You know we’ve built up to this point. We've been very reliant on the wholesale network and direct to retail leveraging, really the supply chains of our customers.
You know unfortunately as an example on Target where a lot of – you know we've seen out of stocks considerably, because the product is moving so quickly, by levering these DST partnerships these individuals are in the store each and every week, sometimes multiple times in a given week. Not only will we have proper shelf tags, merchandising and POS, we’ll also maintain our presence and make sure we're in stock.
I will tell you going through the warehouse, we see a lot of inconsistencies; price tags are not, when we are on promotion the deal tags are not. So we’ll be able to gain and leverage really is the power of the people that you get from the DSD market, and then also they also go into many other local areas, independence in their region. So not only are we picking up the people power, we're also picking up additional distribution within those communities. So it’s the additional touch points per week, it’s not critical but much more important as you move forward to try to make sure that everything is set up correctly. Like you said, I didn’t realize that a lot of times things, if you're not there often enough they are not tagged right or just the wrong promotion and all that. So having these networks there that are more frequent touch points makes a difference. That is correct. Okay, great. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Paul Johnson a Private Investor. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good morning and congratulations on the year. I wanted to understand, you mentioned CVS and Target. Can you talk a little bit about the Delhaize Group, Food Lion and Hannaford first of all, how they’ve done? Yeah, sure. Thank you Paul for calling in. The Delhaize Group is going well, whereas in Food Lion we are getting orders, we are growing with them. There is a lot of further opportunity to scale within Food Lion.
We are also running some programs and coming up in the second quarter to continue to support that and we have some trade marketing programs scheduled as well. So we think it's met our internal expectations and we are working further to optimize the Food Lion opportunity, which is a massive opportunity. Our goal is to really get cold availability in these locations. Right now we're in the dry shelf, in the aisle. So we are looking for additional placements within the store to gain additional optic.
Hannaford's has gone very well. That is supported by our distributor Polar [ph] in the region. Sales are moving very well, increasing. We stated before at several conferences in regards to our historical growth rate and looking at our SPINS data as well, we are growing about 30%, 36% organically. So we are seeing those types of growth rates and Hannaford's as well.
We do have an individual on the ground there, we are setting up displays and you'll see more activation with them in 2019. So we feel that the Delhaize partnership is going well and there's a lot of opportunity. We are just in the infancy stages of that you know really and capturing the share of that account. Great, and regarding the strong relationship with CVS, does that sort of preclude us from also getting some meaningful penetration of Walgreens? No, I believe it helps us. If anything, it helps us. So it does not preclude us at all. Okay, and regarding just more about the competitive threat, obviously there's nothing. I mean even though the recipe for the CELSIUS strength is complicated, there is as nothing proprietary about the ingredients certainly. What precludes some of the larger competitors essentially knocking us off? You know, that is a good question. We don't have a patent, it is a trade secret. It’s been a trade secret from the beginning. You know our founders originally went down that path as a trade secret not to disclose the formula. You know it can be reformulated based on you know – I’m sure scientists can reformulate the product.
We do have a competitive advantage with our position and the fan base and the consumers that we have built and the momentum behind us, but we're just like any products and a lot of other brands, you know it could be replicated. It’s very difficult.
The one thing that makes us very unique is we have the science, over six clinical studies published in peer reviewed sports nutrition journals, and in addition the product, the company has already been reviewed by the NAD and a class action lawsuit on our structure function claims has taken place in 2010 where the company prevailed.
So we have a lot of additional really value and additional science behind the product that would be very hard to replicate. Keep in mind Coca-Cola and Nestle created Enviga back in 2009 and were shut down because they did not really do the proper research, they didn't have the proper studies beyond the product. So we feel we are very – in a very good position to continue to capitalize on the market today and really capitalize our share and be really the renaissance in the energy category, targeting those health-mining consumers. Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And just in terms of you talked a little bit about the margins in a similar way on the cash burn. I know you Edwin said that you don't expect to have additional cash needs for 2019, but I think you had said that last year and you did do the offering; you did raise money by the shareholders. So are we fairly confident that for 2019 there won’t be further dilution. Yes, thank. Yes, our current plans reflect that we will have sufficient funding or cash flow from our operations. But nevertheless you know we always have your plan A, plan B, plan C where we can identify you know areas where we can generate more cash as it relates to perhaps you know reducing a little bit of our working capital and some cost savings areas as well. So I think we are well positioned to have sufficient cash flow for the next 12 months to operate the business. And I’ll just add Paul as well. I mean when you look at 2017, ex the Asia investment. In 2017 we generate $2.6 million, almost $2.7 million in positive EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA when you back out those Asian investments, and then 2018 on a full year you are looking at about $2.2 million in positive adjusted EBITDA. So we are very focused as an organization on driving profitable growth. So as Edward mentioned we do have levers that we can pull in the event we have some timing, but you know at this point we do have sufficient capital to run this business profitably today. Got it. And just one other question which may be a little bit random, but because you speak to a lot of analysts and shareholders John, any sort of speculation as to why there is such an incredibly high short interest level. I know the float is small, but any theories on that, because it’s a little perplexing. Yeah, I agree with you Paul. Unfortunately I have no control over that. From what we can tell, we have spoken with NASDAQ representatives trying to identify you know maybe who the investor is, but you know it's hard to understand that.
We don't understand that, but what we can say is that it seems like the short interest has been there when we first were really brought on the Russell 2000 and 3000, and it's kind of hovered in a range. So maybe it has to do with the index funds that are on the other side of the 2000 and 3000. But that’s all we really know at this point and we are really focused on driving results. There is a great opportunity in front of us and we are executing as an organization. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks Paul. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our fourth quarter and annual results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum. As we are capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends, our active, healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We are building upon our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices.
2018 proved we have a winning product and a very large market that consumers love. Our mission is to get CELSIUS to more consumers profitably. I am very proud of our dedicated team, as without them our tremendous achievements in 2018 and significant opportunities we see in the coming year would not be possible. In addition, I’d like to thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team.
On a final note, our management team will be presenting at three upcoming Investor conferences: The first being the ROTH Capital Conference on March 17 and 18 in Southern California. In addition we’ll be at the B. Riley FBR Conference in Hollywood, California on May 22 and 23. And the company will attend the Jeffries Consumer conference in Nantucket through June 17 through the 19. We look forward to seeing many of you at these upcoming conferences.
Thank you everyone for your interest in CELSIUS and have a great day! Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue with Hayden IR. Thank you. Mr. Donahue, you may begin. Thank you and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Edwin Negron, Chief Financial Officer.

We encourage you to review in full our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared comments. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2019 is off to a strong start as we execute our strategy of positioning Celsius as a global beverage leader for health-minded consumers. In the quarter, we made significant progress on important drivers of growth for our business, launching with new customers as well as major national expansion with both Target and CVS, increased distribution and kicked off new marketing programs aimed at building our brand awareness. This progress in conjunction with the accomplishments and achievements in 2018 fueled a 41% increase in North America revenues.
Another important accomplishment on the international distribution front this quarter was the finalization of our China royalty agreement, which will allow us to recoup our $12.2 million investment and which positions Celsius to further grow our market share in this important market at a risk-adjusted basis.
This quarter, we have once again demonstrated our ability to enter new channels, on board new distribution partners and optimize our routes ensuring product availability. Top line performance in the first quarter was driven by continued expansion in North America. In this geography, we announced new high-profile launches and expansions with leading national retailers, including Target, CVS, Rite Aid, Food Lion and DICK'S Sporting Goods. In addition, we made further progress in the fitness, military and vending channels in North America. National rollouts with both Target and CVS are a direct outcome of the accelerating market demand for our portfolio.
After a successful test where we saw strong sell-through, Target has now increased the number of flavors to 3 SKUs, Sparkling Watermelon, Kiwi Guava and Orange as well as non-carbonated Green Tea Peach Mango to over 1,200 of their 1,800 domestic locations. And in April, we will be expanding to over 1,500 locations. Our national expansion in CVS, our first entry into the drug channel, where we tested initially with 550 stores. We are now have expanded to over 7,500 stores nationwide with three flavors in the cold door. Both these expansions are underway. Celsius further expands their domestic presence in national drug retail footprint with the addition of Rite Aid during the quarter, where we are currently placed in over 2,300 of their 3,000 stores. Together with CVS and Rite Aid, we now have approximately 11,000 domestic retail locations in the drug channel, representing a significant new opportunity for us to increase our product availability and greater visibility for our portfolio of premium fitness beverages. Additionally, significant opportunities remain with other key drugstore chains in the channel.
I'm also pleased to announce that we secured additional distribution agreements with partners, including Anheuser-Busch, Keurig Dr. Pepper and MillerCoors independent network partners. These new distribution agreements further expand our availability into new regions and will allow us to maintain our shelf presence in key retailers, where we are out selling the warehouse replenishment systems.
In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we signed one of the strongest and most transformative agreements to date, announcing a new distribution agreement with Big Geyser, which will significantly increase our presence in the massive New York City metropolitan area. Big Geyser has been instrumental in building numerous brands over the years. And it's New York's largest independent non-alcoholic beverage distributor serving over 20,000 locations in the market. We are eager to partner with them and build out New York City together, where we already have seen greater brand acceptance in the health, vitamin specialty and fitness channels.
Functional beverages have emerged as one, if not the fastest-growing categories in the beverage industry. Busier lifestyles and a focus on health and wellness are driving the need for convenient alternatives that give consumers a way to manage their well-being while they're on the go. Consumers are increasingly seeking beverage that help them achieve their health and wellness goals.
Celsius is positioned not only at the forefront of this global trend, but also has the ability to benefit across more channels than any other beverage company, including over big-box retail, convenience, grocery, drug store channel, fitness, health and wellness, vitamins specialty, sporting goods, military and healthy vending. Stemming from this opportunity, we have also, for the first time, been recognized by leading industry sell side research analysts and included in both their industry reports as well as in updated reports on larger competitors, such as Monster, which they cover, where Celsius has been referenced as both an industry threat and a competitor to the growing segment.
We are outpacing the category growth in the convenience channel by a measure of 4.3 times, and we see massive opportunity as we continue to expand and further our reach in the category. Per the latest SPINS 52-week ending March 24, 2019 convenience scan data brand CELSIUS grew 38.4% over the prior year and is ranked one of the top 15th brands in the category with only an ACV up 10.8%, that's all accumulated volume, which validates the strong demand for our portfolio. Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in all channels of trade. The military channel continues to perform well. We are very optimistic about further expansion in the channel. Also our dedicated team of professionals and our fitness channel have also delivered higher volumes in key accounts as 24 Hour, Gold's Gym, Planet Fitness, Movie King and many others.
Our vending channel, which is just barely over a year old, is positioned to deliver strong growth in 2019 with expansion to over 10,000 locations nationwide through a dedicated team especially focused on this channel. To date, CELSIUS has been added to the vending machines in micro markets of refreshments solution providers, which include Ac Food, Canteen, First Class Vending, 4 Star service group, Southern Refreshment, and CELSIUS is available for distribution throughout the United States in the vending channel through Vistar. This channel offers significant opportunity and reach, targeting new customers, new consumers, such as work, at-work location environments, universities and travel centers.
Lastly, our e-commerce channel continues to deliver exceptional performance as we continue through our sales efforts targeting consumers where they live, work and play. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded our CELSIUS portfolio lined up with a great tasting sparkling Fuji Apple Pear. This delicious refreshing flavor is perfect for our lineup as we further position the brand as a proven of function healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks out there today. Fuji Apple Pear broadens our appeal and reach, and has quickly become a top-selling flavor in the fitness channel during the first quarter where we initially launched it. We anticipate national roll out and expansion with this new flavor, Fuji Apple Pear, in key retailers on the next planogram resets.
I'd like to thank our dedicated sales team in North America for their ongoing success in expanding our channels of trade, including health and fitness, grocery, broadening our expansion into the drug store, mass merchant, military and vending, as well as increasing the number of SKUs in each channel of trade. I'd also like to acknowledge the success of our team in Europe, where they grew sales at 20% during the quarter from the prior year. New flavors launched in European market have been very well received, leading to channel growth and expansion, and turning around the decline we have previously seen in the region. In January 2019, we launched a new great tasting flavor called Peach Vibe, which has quickly become a top-selling flavor in the region. We have a strong pipeline of planned innovation, supported by key targeted marketing programs to expand and capture more market share in the European market.
In Asia in March, we closed a definitive agreement to establish a royalty licensing and repayment of an invested agreement with Qifeng Food Technology. This creates a risk mitigated method to advance our business in China and grow our share in this important market. Under the agreement, Qifeng Food Technology has exclusive rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. In exchange, we will receive a licensing fee roughly approximately $6.9 million over the next 5 years, at which point it will transition to a volume-based royalty fee.
The initial royalty fee is based on discounting initial anticipated volumes by 50%. In addition to the fixed royalty fees, Qifeng Technology will repay the $12.2 million of invested capital over the initial 5-year term. Through this agreement, we have created a stronger collaborative relationship between the companies to capitalize on the considerable opportunity and consumer demand in the region. Last year, we significantly expanded our presence in China through our existing partnership with Qifeng Foods Technology, who has been instrumental in our success and growth in the region. Through their experience, relationships and network of distribution partners, Celsius is now available in over 63 cities and over 65,000 locations across China.
Moving to our marketing and brand development initiatives. We announced our first partnership in the esports field with Echo Fox, a premier esports organization and media company who signed Celsius as its official performance energy drink sponsor. Echo fitness is home to some of the world's top esports athletes and field teams across a variety of titles. The organization's focus on player development, competitive achievement and effective training practices aligns with our brand mission to provide functional healthy fitness drinks to a new generation of athletes. Fierce competition has motivated players to adopt strict physical and mental training regimes to stay sharp, and Celsius will help them achieve their peak performance.
Marketing activities uptake continually remain active with local demos, events and programs. During the quarter, we executed over 500 targeted demos at key retailers and attended large consumer and trade events, including health and wellness expos, Arnold Classic, Europa Games, 7-11 Experience and Expo West, just to name a few.
Our marketing programs for net 2019 include an increase in targeted digital social media, and influencer marketing programs and campaigns, as well as expansion of our sampling programs across the country in targeted markets. Starting in April, we remain active with events and programs such as Tough Mudder, a series of competitive events for a range of athletic ability. We will be attending over 23 cities and we'll be providing samples to over 200,000 health-minded consumers across the country further expanding our community. In addition, we will be conducting targeted guerilla programs in key markets and interacting with consumers.
Continued focus on key drivers of growth led to record growth in the first quarter. Revenue grew 20% to $14.5 million, led by domestic growth of 41% to a record $11.4 million during the quarter. International revenues decreased by approximately $900,000 to $3.1 million for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, we had growth in Europe and turned around declining sales in the region, which was, however, offset by a $1.3 million revenue reduction from China as we transition to a royalty licensing model. Consumer demand is very strong in China and we are pleased to shift to this model in the region that allows us to focus our working capital in North America and other emerging markets. We are leveraging our growth drivers, while remaining a lean and performance-driven organization, capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends. Our innovative portfolio of fitness board products is increasingly well positioned to disrupt the energy category. Our brand is resonating with today's health-minded consumer and is gaining considerable momentum. I'm excited for our prospects in 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, revenue was approximately $14.5 million. A considerable increase of $2.4 million or 20% from $12.1 million for the same period last year. The revenue increase of 20% was basically attributable to continuous strong growth of 41% in North American revenues driven by double-digit expansion in existing accounts as well as new distribution. European sales achieved a solid 20% growth, mainly as a result of the launch of new flavors that have been very well accepted in the market.
Asian revenues reflect a change in business model and therefore show a considerable reduction of approximately $1.3 million when compared to the prior year results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019. The total increase in revenues from 2018 to 2019 was mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. Excluding the China results, revenue from continuing operations reflected an increase of 35% during the first quarter of 2019.
For the first three months ended March 31, 2019, gross profit increased by approximately $960,000 or 20% from $4.8 million in 2018 to $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2019. Gross profit margins remain in line at 39.5% for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars is mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019 were approximately $3.6 million, a decrease of approximately $2 million or 36% from $5.6 million in the same period in 2018. The decrease is mainly due to the change in business model in China, which does not required direct marketing investments. The actual reduction in marketing investments amounted to $2.8 million, which was partially offset by increases in sales expenses of $385,000, storage and distribution expenses of $186,000 and increases in headcount investments of $250,000.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019 were approximately $2.6 million, an increase of $620,000 or 31% from $2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to stock option expense, which accounted for 95% of the variance or $588,000. There were increases in other administrative expenses of approximately $103,000, mainly related to insurance expense, professional fees and depreciation, which were partially offset by savings in R&D costs of approximately $18,000 and lower compensation expenses of $53,000 as the prior year results included their retirement compensation for the prior CEO.
Total other income increased by approximately $12.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, mainly related to the recognition of the note receivable from our China distributor. As per the agreement, we will receive the net investment made into China over the next 5 years. Additionally, we will also receive interest income, which amounted to approximately $90,000 for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019.
As a result of the above, for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, Celsius had net income of approximately $11.7 million to common shareholders or $0.20 per share based on a weighted average of 57,155,445 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, we had a net loss of approximately $2.8 million and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of approximately $83,000, a net loss available to common shareholders of $2.9 million or $0.06 per share based on a weighted average of 47,449,553 shares outstanding.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had cash of approximately 2.8 and $7.7 million , respectively, and working capital of approximately 23.8 and $19.6 million , respectively. Cash used in operations during the 3 months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 total approximately 6.8 and $4.3 million , respectively, reflecting investments in inventory, prepayments and deposits, as well as the settlement of marketing expenses related to the China change in business model.
As such, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately a positive $878,000 compared to a loss of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. In arriving to our adjusted EBITDA results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019, we included favorable adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $107,000, net interest expense of approximately $30,000 and also backed out the gain of $12.2 million related to the note receivable from China. As such, our net non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $717,000 higher than the 2018 results. Using this apples-to-apples comparison, adjusted EBITDA increased over 400%, a significant improvement year-over-year when compared to the first quarter of 2018. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on the strong results. John, I wonder if you can speak a little bit more about what your new distributor in New York area can mean for your business in that region. And maybe you could update us on the latest trends in business at Target and CVS? I know you had really successful roll out there. And then any other major customer that you feel is worth highlighting? Sure. Thank you, Jeff. In regards to the Big Geyser announcement, we're very excited about that opportunity in the New York City metropolitan area. Big Geyser has been instrumental on building brands from vitaminwater by several others in the area. Just really a great team there, dedicated team, and focus and aggressive. They have a very focused sales organization. And we've actually started to kick off -- next week is the official kick off with them. We're really excited. I mean, the challenge we had in New York, we've had limited distribution except outside of the vitamin specialty and health clubs. And although we have authorization in 7-11 and CVS and Target, due to the other DSD brands, we are really having a difficult time keeping product on the shelf, given our ability to use the -- really the only route to market in that region is through the wholesalers and/or through the warehouse of those existing retailers. So we're expecting a great opportunity. Edwin and I were up in New York.
We do spend some time up there speaking with investors and I will tell you that everyone is aware of Celsius, Barry's Bootcamp, Equinox, 24 Hour, Gold's Gym and -- want to buy the product and look forward to having it more available throughout the city, so perfect demographic for us as well and we're really excited about that. In regards to Target, I did make some comments on Target and CVS during the prepared remarks. Target is going very well. We have been expanded into 1,500 stores starting in really towards the end of April, May. So we've now expanded. If you recall, we started off with 500 store test and moved to 1,200 and now we're expanding even further, with 1,500. Now I know, last quarter when we had our earnings call, there were questions about out of stocks. We're still seeing out of stocks at Target.
Their replenishment systems are having a really hard difficulty keeping up with the movement and the momentum. So, we're actually talking to them currently about looking at other alternatives at moving some regions to a DSD model where we have a DSD presence and coverage. So that is another exciting avenue to give to these new -- and offer to these new DSD partners we're bringing on board, so really excited about Target. We're going to add another flavor and we're talking to them on gaining cold availability as well towards the back half of the year. So we see Target as a great partner for Celsius. CVS has been a great partnership as well. Still early. We're still early with both of these retailers and partners, but we are rolling out nationally in CVS. You'll find 3 flavors and hopefully a store near you shortly, if it's not already on the shelf. Initial feedback has been extremely positive. Last month and in the end of March, we did really a sampling at the headquarter where we sampled over 25 CVS corporate employees and they said, we're one of the most liked brands that have ever been sampled at the headquarters. So really getting a headquarter support behind us, which is key, and we're excited about that offering.
This is just the beginning with the 3 flavors in all stores. We're looking for a really a long-term partnership. And then also with Rite Aid now with national distribution about over 2,000 locations of their 3,000 really has opened the door to really put Celsius in the drug channel in a big way. We are talking with Walgreens as well, and we look forward to partnering with them. But lot of opportunity in this new emerging channel for brand CELSIUS in 2019. And regards to new customers, we did mention at the end of 2019's earnings call, we did have marquee accounts, we would be naming and we have named a few already up to this point. We do have several more, we will be announcing over the next several months as we roll them out, and that's going to be in the convenience channel as well as the grocery channel. So, we are bringing on additional accounts. I think the key is when you look at our overall volumes as well, Jeff, is that it was great to see and we continue to see that SPINS IRI data showing that strong 38% growth, an off-tick coming from the register. So, we're really excited about the momentum we have built and the opportunity that lies ahead. Okay. Good to hear. And then could you update us on the co-packer picture. What you have set up there? And I guess how the revised set-up should benefit you during the peak selling season? Yes, one thing we're monitoring very closely. Our inventories are up, probably about the highest they've been. That's strategically done to make sure that we can fill the pipe orders and support these new customers coming on board. This is -- right around this time last year is when we started to see a really big pickup as well heading into beverage season. So, we are preparing for that as well. We have solidified our relationships, we had several Refresco in the office, not only a couple of months ago, they were here again. We're building a really strong relationship with Refresco. We do have 4 co-packers that are active. We feel, at this stage, we have an ample supply of product we're going to be able to deliver for 2019 and we're building out our co-packer network for 2020 and beyond. Okay, great. And then, anything else you can give us on the Nordic region. The European region, obviously, saw a good turnaround there, which is better than we're expecting. And then maybe just touch on outside the Nordic region, any plans or any strategy that you can offer on other parts of Europe? Sure. Thank you. Regards the Nordics, they did had a really good first quarter, as we mentioned. They had a new launch with a flavor called Peach Vibe, which was really successful. It seems to be the overall downturn we saw in 2017 and 2018 has stabilized. We're working with them really closely to continue to make sure we stabilize that Nordic operations and protect our that revenue that's there. So we're working with them closely. We're really focused at this point on North American expansion. There's opportunities throughout Europe, but with the limited resources we have -- as I mentioned, we're a really lean team. There's so much opportunity right now in North America with the expansions that's going place. We are very much focused on North America. We do have -- through our Nordic partner, there is activities and store expansion going on, taking place in Finland and Norway. But outside of that, at this point, we are really focused on North America. China, we talked about really the change in the business model to a royalty-based model. So that does free up additional resources as well and capital. And during the first quarter, we added over $800,000 positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. So we are very excited about that, going back truly driving profitable top line revenue growth. Yes. It's great to see the improvement in EBITDA as well. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll take the rest offline. Continue to success. Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John could you talk about the powder packs out there now. How many flavors are out there and what's your current distribution channels on those? Thank you, Jeff. Yes -- we've been experimenting with a variety of new flavors. We actually have a new flavors in the pipeline for our powder products as well. We're going through testing through our innovation meetings and innovation team. We do have two flavors that we launched in late 2018. The cranberry lemon and a coconut which is really great flavors. Main distribution outside of the orange and the wild berry is it's mainly in the health vitamin specialty channel as well as health clubs, and it's been doing very well.
We got some -- Matt and his team has some very interesting marketing programs around that, further integrating it into smoothies, that's being a big opportunity with us. It actually is doing very well at Smoothie King as well. So we're working with them in conjunction on getting the brand out there more because there's a lot more to do with our powder products; they're great on the go; great flavor. And we do have plans for that on the [indiscernible], but we're very much focused on the RTDs where the big opportunity right now on the RTD is driving about 85% of our revenue is the overall arching focus and then also bringing in those powder products as additional points of disruption. Okay. I got it. And can you talk a little bit about international and how we should think about on your modeling for international for the year, ex-China. I know that this quarter was very solid. Q2 is a super easy comp off last year's $0.77 million for the second quarter. How should we kind of think about modeling the full year on the international side? Yes, I think on a full year on the international side, I think you have to break it out by China and then Europe. Obviously, the China will be more in line with the royalty model, as we continue to ramp volumes as we progress through the launch cycle, as we continue to expand in China. Europe, we've stated prior and within our European market really about stabilization within the region and we anticipate that move to more normalized levels as we stated in the past. We do have a strong presence with ACV there. We don't see a tremendous amount of expansion at this point. We're using all of our capital resources for North America, so more of a stabilization. Okay, got it. And then a couple of housekeeping items. The jump in shares from Q4 to Q1, share counts up to 57.1 million, what was that from? That was mainly associated with the conversion of the preferred shares at the end of 2018. I'll let Edwin -- move the call over to Edwin. Yes, correct. Yes, basically related to, as John just mentioned, conversion of preferred stock to common stock to the tune of about 6 million shares. So that was basically of the main jump there. Okay, I got it... That was Carl DeSantis preferred shares. So now that really cleans up the cap table on the balance sheet. There is no more preferred stock on the balance sheet. So that fairly cleans up that component. Got it. And Edwin, so you've got the 12.27 on the gain for Q1. So, we shouldn't see any further gains from the note or we should see some positive interest on that going forward, is that right. How should we are modeled that over the balance of this year and going forward? Correct, correct. Yes. We booked a gain now, which is a biggest portion, obviously, as it relates to booking the note receivable. And then going forward, as John mentioned, we're going to have royalty revenue and then some interest income in the range, I would say, of about $90,000 in that range. Keep it in mind that it's denominated in local currency in China local currency. So there's going to be some variations or translation effects, but we expect that the interest would be in the range of $90,000 to $95,000 on a quarterly basis. Got it. Okay and then lastly for me, could you are talking a little bit about the margins out there. I know that you said that they're being driven mainly from volumes, so how should we look going forward? Should we see some improvement, modest improvement, as volumes increase, is that a good way to think about it? Sure. Yes. We're looking to have some improvement in margins. As John mentioned, we are partnering with co-packers and leveraging that. So also when we see those benefits flow through. The fact is well that -- some volume increases are expected as well. We are hoping to be in that same range, 39% to low-40s going forward. And I think just to jump in there as well, some of the improvements that we're making, that is more of a long term, that's the long term. In the short term, as Edwin mentioned, I mean we're probably going to be right around that range. We do have these new customers coming on board, especially these new DSD partners where we have launch plans and initiatives to gain immediate shelf space for the product. So we are doing a little bit heavier promotions in the beginning of these relationships to make sure that we're able to get the product shelf appropriately as well as incentive, and those run through the top line revenue number, therefore affecting our gross profit margin. But we are very much focused on improving margins and driving those levers for, again, further efficiencies on an optimal run rate, but we're probably be on the lower end of those ranges as we're going through this growth cycle with some new accounts and distribution coming on board. Okay. Perfect. Great quarter, guys. Thanks for the update. Thank you, Jeffrey. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you? Good Morning. Good morning. Okay. So just a couple of questions on China. So the volume at least in the first quarter, if you want to also give the sales. What was the unit volume, was that up or down versus first quarter '18? We haven't really spoken about unit volumes, Anthony, in the past, but overall volume, as Edwin mentioned, revenues were up as a basis of volume, so volumes were up very much in line with overall pricing. We're running at the same overall discounts and allowances as we had in Q1 in the prior year. So the revenue growth we are driving is really driven by -- is the overall volume that you're seeing, especially in North America. The decrease in revenue that you're seeing on a consolidated basis is really to $1.3 million from China that we recognized in 2018 Q1 versus this year we're only recognizing the royalty component. Got it. Okay. And then on the Geyser contract, obviously, that's a big contract. You mentioned John that that's starting. Can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the roll out. Obviously 20,000 locations is a huge opportunity, but how do you expect that roll out to play out in 2019? We have several key employees that are going to be working specifically with Big Geyser in the region. Our first phase of roll out is really to go after the key accounts. So that's going to be the grocery channel, where we already have authorizations, the drug channel, and 7-11. There is a lot of 7-11s throughout the city, so that's going to be a major focus for us to gain that shelf presence in those key accounts. And then from that point, we will backfill the other accounts as well as independents represent a large portion of that number as well. So, it's a combination. It's going to be a journey. Overnight we are not authorized in 20,000 locations. So we're tackling the key accounts first and then we'll be moving through the rest of the account list very strategically, doing route rights, leveraging really empowering and motivating their sales team to further drive Celsius and gain us that shelves presence. Just as a follow up on that. John, I've heard the Geyser that they are a pretty tough negotiator. Is it safe to say that the gross margin on that is going to be a little bit less than your corporate gross margin but worth it based on the potential sales volume. We anticipate our margin to be very much consistent with other distributors. Our overall net margin that we have there, they actually called us through the process. So this is a very mutual benefit, mutual relationship and a really good partnership. So I think we're going to see -- you're not going to see margin deterioration because of Big Geyser by any means. This is a really good opportunity for both companies and we see a great opportunities that lie ahead. Okay, excellent. Thanks very much. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks very much, Anthony. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the continued top line momentum. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you, Aaron. So, first, I just want to dig a little bit deeper in terms of your market share. Given your ACV still pretty low, can you just give us some color in terms of what your in-store market share is for those stores that you've been in for 12 months. And then, again, how much adding the number of SKUs that a store has can really help to boost that market share? Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Aaron. You are correct. Our overall market share ACV at this stage is low. It's on the lower end, single digits in any of the channels that we look at today. And keep in mind, we're on a journey. Celsius was born in the diet nutrition, sports nutrition, coming from vitamins specialty, and really just started this journey really 3 years ago with the initial placements at 7-11 with 2 SKUs. And so we're just now moving out into really new channels for Celsius. If you look at the drug channel is something new for 2019, the mass merchants is new for 2019. So we don't have those type of data points at this phase. Where we do have data points is coming from the SPINS data in regards to the convenience channel where we see that ACV. Last time we reported the ACV number was at the end of the year and we're at a 10.3 ACV.
So we have increased the ACV in that convenience channel to 10.8 and we also are sustaining and seeing those increased year-over-year growth rates in the high-30%, 38%, 39% growth rate. So those are really good indicators about how the product is turning. And when you go back and you look at that billboard effect, as you mentioned, adding additional flavors, how does that impact the overall off take of the product. We've been able to -- through a variety of data analytics and also monitoring sell-through in key accounts, by adding an additional SKU of Celsius, going from 2 to 3 not only adds one-third, it actually will almost double sales as you add that billboard. So we noticed several accounts where we're authorized with two, moving that to a four level -- 4 SKUs, we actually quadruple sales in those accounts. So we are very much focused on gaining additional placements in these key accounts. And that's where the DSD strategy comes in, building this national DSD network is very key. That will allow us to gain additional shelf presence and really fight for that shelf space that Celsius warrants and we need to demand. So it's early in the stage to really get a true indicator on the household penetration, which is low and the market share in each one. We are at the early phases, but we are seeing great early indicators as we continue through our journey. Thank you, Aaron. For your question. We really appreciate... That's really helpful. And just one more if I could. Could you just talk about the overall competitive dynamics and how those are evolving. We've seen some of your competitors come out with new products. I think Dr. Pepper came out with a zero calorie energy. We also seen Amazon come out with their own brand of energy drink, which is obviously a big channel for you guys. So can you just talk a little about how the competitive dynamics have been evolving and how that's been helping with your conversations or impact any conversations you've been having with potential retailers to put your products in? Absolutely, Aaron. That's a great question. And that's truly what's been opening the door for Celsius. When you look at what's happening in the overall category and not only in the energy category, but in really all categories in food and beverage, we just saw -- we're seeing innovation really leading the way the category is going. And energy, people are looking for better for you healthier alternatives and that is allowing Celsius to get placed and gain that placement with our healthy functional position and really our fitness forward position has allowed us to open doors. Competition has been continuing to increase. As you mentioned, Amazon's coming out with products, we have Monster Reign has launched a fitness forward product, we have Bang, that's a company that's out there, doing very well, hasn't been able to gain a considerable amount of shelf space, we have C4.
There's a lot of other players out there really going after this space. But Celsius have this authenticity really coming in being born and steeped in science, born in the diet nutrition, sports nutrition channel which is allowing us to take this journey and allowing the placements. Retailers today are more open than they ever been to shelf Celsius. And the reason is because this category is evolving, it's growing. The subcategory is emerging with a performance energy, fitness energy category, which is opening the doors for Celsius like CELSIUS HEAT to compete as well. So it's very exciting time in the category for the opportunities here and we are capitalizing on all these trends which is gaining additional shelf space and also bringing us to key DSD partners that are going to further bring Celsius to retails and further gain our presence in distribution with partners like Big Geyser, independent Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi and Keurig Dr. Pepper partner. So just a really exciting time. Great to hear and best of luck. Thanks for the questions. Thank you very much, Aaron. That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. Thank you, everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our first quarter results demonstrates our products are getting considerable momentum. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared comments. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our first half results for 2019 are highlighted by record revenues of $30.6 million. An increase of more than 40% over the first half of last year as we executed our strategy of positioning Celsius as a global beverage leader for health-minded consumers.
During the quarter, we made significant progress on our North America expansion with household name retailers such as Target CVS, Rite Aid, Food Lion, and 7-Eleven where further expanded our distribution presence. In addition, we continue to add new premier distribution partners like Big Geyser in New York, and we are further penetrating Anheuser-Busch, Keurig Dr. Pepper, and Pepsi independent bottler networks. We continue to deploy best practices with targeted marketing campaigns and are building our brand's awareness and trial.
Once again we have demonstrated our ability to enter new channels, onboard new distribution partners, and optimize our routes to market ensuring product availability all while continuing to focus on controlling cost, optimizing efficiencies, and maximizing the returns on our investments. In Europe, we continue to drive market share with targeted marketing campaigns and unabated on trend flavor launches.
And in Asia, we have completed the alignment of our China business operations. Each of these accomplishments are contributing to meaningful improvements in our financial results with revenue growth across all geographies, improving operational margins, and more efficient use of our working capital. And just as important, our gross margins remain in excess of 40% as we drive growth on higher volumes.
Domestically in the second quarter, we signed a new distribution agreement with Big Geyser, New York's largest independent non-alcoholic beverage distributor serving the five boroughs of New York City and counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Putnam. Big Geyser serves more than 20,000 locations in the massive New York City metropolitan area and has been instrumental in building numerous brands.
Starting in the third quarter, Big Geyser will be our preferred distributor to service all 7-Elevens in the territory which will significantly increase our New York City market presence. Also, on the expansion front, during the second quarter we launched placement with premier convenient store chain QuikTrip under the agreement Celsius is to be located on the top shelf of the energy door with full shelf authorized in market except for Arizona where we have a half shelf. The convenient store channel continues to represent the largest energy drink market in the country with more than $9 billion in annual sales.
The latest SPINS third party data as of July 14, 2019 shows Celsius is growing at a 38.6% year-over-year increase for our portfolio in the energy convenient channel compared to an impressive 9.4% overall growth in the energy drink category while Celsius is holding a 10.9% ACV, all accumulated volume. Industry-backed third party data continues to validate our positioning as a healthy functional fitness drink that's resonating with today's health-minded consumer.
We are confident that Celsius will continue to drive these sales metrics even higher as we continue to increase our ACV distribution in the channel through additional launches with national retail chains and distribution partners. This third party data shows and warranted that Celsius warrants additional shelf space. And our team is working hard on executing.
Our pursuit towards a national distribution network now includes more than 50 regional direct store delivery, DSS, partners. Many of which are premier distributors. Expanding to a national distribution direct store delivery network will increase our in-store experience, our in-store presence, the execution in the trade and it will expand our availability and will eliminate the out of stocks we are currently seeing at Target and CBS and many other retailers across the country as Celsius is outselling the retailer's internal replenishment systems.
We expect to achieve a full coverage across the country in the next 12 to 15 months if not sooner. We're rapidly leveraging our new regional distribution partners creating significant opportunities to further build upon our core across all markets trade especially in the convenience channel where we are significantly outpacing many established competitors in the sales growth metrics.
We continue to garner significant interest from the best distributors in the country further supporting our momentum and broadening our retail availability and accessibility of our portfolio. We have experienced the most significant expansion within the independent Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network which has increased from six distribution partners within the wholesale networks to 23 partners since February of this year.
In addition we have expanded within the MillerCoors Pepsi and Dr. Pepper, Keurig Dr. Pepper affiliated wholesalers. With the accelerated expansion, we are very excited to now have approximately over 1500 wholesale sales representatives now selling Celsius nationwide on our behalf. Through our dedicated innovation team, we continue to expand our portfolio with on trend delicious flavors in the quarter, we launched our newest flavor the 9th SKU, a great tasting sparkling Fuji Apple Pear in the fitness and specialty channels within GNC with a mandatory 1800 locations and authorizations and all sets.
In addition Fuji Apple Pear is now also available at select 7/11s and through Amazon. Across the country and the fitness channel, national distributors, Ropa Sports and Foods are now carrying Celsius and the new flavor in top tier fitness retailers nationwide.
At Golds Gym 24 hour Crunch Fitness, Export Fitness Smoothie King, Equinox via Earth Par in shape fitness and Las Vegas Athletic Club will now be selling Celsius quickly become one of the top selling flavors. In addition to great tasting line extensions, our innovation team has been working on developing offerings starting targeting new verticals and adjacent categories which are opposed to expand our usage occasion and further increase our portfolios breadth.
The team has been working on a plan launched in the back half of this year which we're very excited about and as we get closer to the launch date, we will be providing additional details. Our mission, which we are delivering on is become a global leader of a branded portfolio which is proprietary, innovative, clinically proven and ask for significant health benefits and these new offerings will build upon our mission expanding our reach and portfolio breadth.
In Europe and the Nordics, revenues grew nearly 70% in the second quarter as new flavor introductions earlier in the year continue to gain momentum. Our Sparkling Peach Five and Sparkling Passion Fruit have been a great addition to the portfolio and continue to exceed expectations. In addition we launched a new line a Celsius unlimited new tropics line with a great tasting grapefruit breeze and a strawberry breeze flavor profile. This new tropics line extension expands our usage occasion with a lower caffeinated offering and is developed with [indiscernible] turmeric [ph], Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 and antioxidants. In addition the line improves mental focus. We are very encouraged by the traction of the new line and the momentum of our core portfolio in the region.
In Asia, the execution of a royalty licensing agreement in China at the beginning of the year provides us with a vehicle to recoup our $12.2 million in prior years in country investment while still reaching the critical and enormous market.
As a reminder in March we closed the definitive agreement to establish a royalty licensing and repayment on invested capital agreement with Qifeng Food Technology our local distributor and partner in the China market. This created a risk mitigated method to advance our business in China and grow our share in the important market.
Under the agreement Qifeng Food Technology has exclusive rights to manufacturer, market and commercializes Celsius branded products in China. In exchange we will be receiving a licensing royalty fee of $6.9 million over the next five years at which point it will transition to a volume based royalty fee structure on the six year. Through this agreement, we have created a strong collaborative relationship between the companies to capitalize on the considerable opportunity and consumer demand in the region.
Qifeng Foods has been instrumental in our success and growth in the market through their experience, relationships and network of distribution partners, Celsius is now available in over 63 cities and over 65,000 locations across China with four flavors Raspberry Acai, Cola, Orange and recently launched Cucumber line.
In Hong Kong, we continue to expand our consumer base driving trial and awareness in the region and during the quarter, we further expand into Southeast Asia into Malaysia with an initial launch and distribution expansion and up to 2007/11s with our Sparkling Orange and Peach Mango green tea. We're very excited about the opportunities in the market.
Functional beverages have emerged as one if not the fastest growing category in the beverage industry. Busier lifestyles and a focus on health and wellness are driving the need for convenient alternatives that give consumers a way to manage their well-being while they're on the go. We are uniquely positioned at the forefront of this global health and wellness trend with a strategy that will enable us to capitalize on today's health minding consumer seeking beverages that will help them achieve their health, fitness and wellness goals.
In support of our growth, we continue to develop and roll out targeted marketing initiatives that highlight and reinforce our brand recognition, emphasize the functionality of our beverages and target specific targeted markets and audiences effectively.
During the quarter we executed targeted marketing programs at key retailers and attended large consumer and trade events including Europa Expo in Dallas, Europa Games in Florida and the Arnold Classic in Ohio. During the second quarter, we were named as the official energy drink partner to Echo Fox, a premier e-sports organization and media company, Echo Fox is home to some of the world's top e-sports athletes and field teams across a variety of titles including Legend League of Legends. The organization focuses on player development, competitive achievement and effective training practices aligned directly with our mission to provide functional healthy fitness drinks to a new generation of athletes.
It is estimated that esports reached 335 million people worldwide in 2017 and is predicted to grow to over 600 million consumers by 2023. This signing represents our first venture in the esports arena. We also remain active with Tough Mudder a series of competitive events for a targeted athletic ability.
Through these relationships we are in the process of providing samples to more than 200,000 health minding consumers in 23 cities across the U.S. reaching new markets and new consumers and in other regions as well we continue to target active lifestyle fitness activities and events.
In addition, we are conducting guerrilla marketing sampling activities in key markets, and interacting with consumers, where they live, work and play. Staying the course and remaining focused on expanding our distribution relationships while going deeper with existing accounts have been our key to our success in 2019. We remain committed to this strategy and our increasingly optimistic about our prospects as our products continue to gain considerable momentum.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. For the three months ended June 30, 2019. Revenue was $16.1 million, a significant increase of $6.8 million or 73% when compared to $9.3 million for the same period last year. The revenue increase of 73% was the result of increased sales across all geographies including strong growth of 69% in North American revenue driven by double-digit growth in existing accounts and new distribution expansion.
Revenue in Europe grew a solid 64% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the launch of new flavors. Revenue growth in Asia is the net result of the traction we're gaining in the regions outside China which was partially offset by the change in our business model to a royalty and license fee agreement in China which was completed at the start of 2019.
In line with our historical trend, the overall increase in revenues from 2018 to 2019 was mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $2.8 million or 70% to $6.9 million for the second quarter of 2019 up from $4 million in the year-ago quarter.
Profit margins remain mostly unchanged and within our expected range at 42.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 42.8% for the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars is mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $5.6 million an increase of $1.5 million or 37% up from $4.1 million for the same period in 2018.
The increase is mainly due to costs for tradeshow activities in support of our expanded distribution network as well as investment in marketing activities and Employee Resources which were partially offset by no direct marketing investments being incurred in China as
result of the change in our business model.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $2.4 million, a decrease of $708,000 or 23% compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an accrual in the second quarter of 2018 of $944,000 pertaining to the settlement of a territorial dispute with a former distributor.
Excluding this impact on a more comparative basis, general and administrative expenses increased by $237,000 due to increases in legal fees, insurance, rent and employee costs. Total other expense increased by $303,000 to $345,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $42,000 for the same period last year. The increase is mainly related to the amortization of discounts on those payables of $93,000 and a loss of $220,000 related to China assets that will not be realized. Partially offset by a reduction of interest expense in the amount of $10,000. The net results for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was a loss to common shareholders of $1.5 million or $0.03 per basic and dilutive share based on a weighted average of 57,336,117 shares outstanding.
In comparison for the three months ended June 30, 2018 the company reported a net loss of $3.3 million and after giving effect to preferred stock dividend of $43,000 a net loss available to common shareholders of $3.4 million or $0.07 based on weighted average of 51,003,803 shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was a loss of $15,000. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2019 includes favorable adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $110,000. Net interest expense of $31,000, stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and a loss of $220,000 related to China assets that will not be realized.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 amounted to a loss of $2.1 million which included the onetime expense of $1 million pertaining to the settlement of a territorial dispute with the former distributor and the net investment in Asia of $834,000. As such, the adjusted net non-GAAP EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was a loss of $261,000 which is comparable to the $15,000 loss for 2019. Since we did not have any one timers or Asian investment in this quarter, we believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, the reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our year-to-date results, for the first-half of 2019, revenues increased by 43% to $30.6 million, up from $21.4 million in the first-half of 2018. The increase of 43% was attributable in large part to 55% growth in revenue from U.S. domestic sales primarily attributable to double-digit growth in existing accounts and new distribution expansion.
Europe delivered 30% growth in sales, which was driven in large part by the launch of new flavors. The increases in North America and Europe were marginally offset by a decline in Asia as a result of the change in our business model. Most of the year-to-date decline was experienced in the first quarter, because as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, sales in Asia were actually up in the second quarter.
Gross Profit increased by $3.9 million, or 44% to $12.6 million in the first-half of 2019 compared to $8.7 million for the first six months of 2018. Gross profit margins increased to 41.1% for the first-half of 2019 compared to 40.9% for the first-half of 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increases in sales volume.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 6% to $9.2 million for the first six months of 2019 when compared to $9.7 million for the first six months of 2018. The decrease is mainly due to the change in business model in China, which does not require direct marketing investments. On a comparable basis, marketing spent was down to by $2.8 million, which is partially offset by increases in other sales expenses, including incremental spending in trade show activities to support our expanded distribution network, incremental stores and distribution costs and incremental employee and broker costs.
General and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2019 were $5.1 million, a slight decrease of 2% when compared to $5.2 million for the first six months and the June 30, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to an accrual of $945,000 in the prior year period that pertains to the settlement of a territorial dispute with a former distributor. Excluding this impact, General and Administrative Expenses increased by $857,000, basically, as a result of incremental stock option expense of $504,000 as well as modest increases in legal costs, insurance, rent and employee costs.
Below the operating line, other income was up significantly to $11.9 million for the first six months of 2019 when compared to $80,000 of other expenses in the prior year period. This increase is basically the result of the gain related to the note receivable from our China distributor that was signed at the beginning of this year.
As a reminder, for the licensing agreement, we will be receiving the net investment we have made in China over a five-year period. As a result of the above, for the first six months of 2019, the company had net income of $10.2 million or $0.18 per share, based on a weighted average of 57,267,622 shares, and after adding back interest expense on convertible notes of $243,000 and the amortization on discount on notes payables of $179,000 a day looted net income available to shareholders of $10.6 million or $0.17 per share, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 61,817,621.
Operating expenses for the first-half of 2019 included non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation of $2.7 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same charges for the first six months of 2018. Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA for the first six months of 2019 was a positive $863,000 since it includes the $12 million gain from the note receivable from our China distributor, which compares to a loss of $120,000 in the year ago period. By excluding the one-time charges of $1.1 million incurred in the first-half of 2018, which mainly pertain to the settlement of a dispute with a former distributor, and the net investment in Asia of $3 million, the adjusted net non-GAAP EBITDA for the first-half of 2018 was a loss of $120,000, which is also comparable to the $863,000 gain since we did not have any one-timers or Asia investment in this period.
As of June 30, we had cash of $4.8 million, compared to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we had working capital of $23.2 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $19.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash used in operations for the first six months ended June 30, 2019 was $4.5 million, compared to $5.8 million for the first six months of 2018. The use of cash during the current period reflects investments in prepayments and deposits, as well as the settlement of accrued expenses pertaining to the change in the China business model, which were partially offset by a reduction in inventories.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you, sir. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jeffrey Cohen of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Hi, John and Edwin. How are you? Excellent, Jeff. Good morning. Good morning. Very well. Hopefully you can hear me okay. So I guess three questions I wanted to drill into a little bit. So can you talk about any other sizes or flavors for North America coming or what's kind of your thinking there? And can you give us also a little color on the power packs. Do you expect that you're going to see sort of uptick in the power packs, or any plans to bring on more flavors or lines such as the [indiscernible] to North America? Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. In regards to flavor innovation, that seems to be working very nicely for us as well. It brings excitement to the retailers in some of our established accounts. We will bring, and we do have plans. Our innovation team does have plans for additional skew innovation; as well we'll be conducting some rationalization. Right now our kiwi-guava has really moved to our number one position on flavor in many accounts across the country. So these flavor combinations seem to be working very well at retail. And our Fuji Apple Pear on its initial rollout has been extremely, really recepted well by, not only by buyers, but also from consumers. So our goal is to continue to stay on trend with innovative flavors. And we are cognizant of the churns as well that's required, really monitoring the market. And we will be first to market.
In regards to the power product, most recently we've seen a great increase in sales online as well as through the finished channel with our powder products. And we do have plans as well to bring innovative flavors to that line. We're very optimistic about it. You see a lot of other usage occasions, Celsius On-the-Go with its powder offering. So you could take that anywhere on the plane when you travel. And also we're noticing a lot of our influencers and brand ambassadors are taking the product and adding it to smoothies, so it's another opportunity for us to further leverage the Celsius brand into other mediums, so very excited to have that line there.
And then in regards to the nootropics lines, as I mentioned, we do have a planned launch this year in the back-half, which will expand us to additional verticals and adjacencies within our categories. And the nootropics line that was initially launched in 7-Eleven really expands our offering. It's a lower caffeinated product, and allows -- really goes after a much wider consumer and an additional usage occasion for the brand. So I think as we look forward you will see additional offerings, brand innovation coming through Celsius here. That's great. Okay, and then second question, any studies or clinical work out there that you're aware of that's being conducted in any geography? We do not have any active studies currently taking place currently, but it is something that we are always are exploring as well as we look at additional lines -- bring additional lines out, and additional innovation to the table. It is one thing, Celsius is science based science backed, and we're going to continue with that trend, but we don't have any ongoing studies active today. Okay. And then thirdly, could you talk a little bit about seasonality for the upcoming quarter in the back-half of the year, and just kind of walk us through and remind us of 2018 Q2 and the Q3, and kind of any bigger picture trends that one would anticipate? Yes, I think when you look at it; the trends for Celsius are phenomenal. When you look at our most recent, as I mentioned, our SPINS data, which is third-party registered scan data, had Celsius continuing to build momentum each and every quarter over the last, go back several years. We're maintaining our most recent on a 52-week basis shows we're turning up the register over 38.6%, so truly outpacing the category. And the category continues to expand toward healthier, better-for-you options. So we see a lot of opportunity. Traditionally, in the beverage industry there is seasonality that takes place in beverage season, as it's called, during the summer months. We are affected by that, but it is being offset by new retailer listings that are taking place.
So, although our baseline business and existing accounts are affected by that seasonality in beverage season during the summer months, it is offset due to the new distribution and expansion we're receiving with many retailers. So, looking at on a go-forward basis, I think looking at past history and continuing to move forward with some of our growth metrics, it's something that definitely should be looked at. When you're looking at Q2 and 2018, we did have $1.2 million net on our North America, which moved from Q2 2018 to -- or Q3 2018 due to timing of production. But that was a timing, so -- but we do have considerable momentum, as you can see with our Q2 results. Perfect. Okay, thanks for taking the questions. And those are for me. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Van Sinderen of B. Riley. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. And let me say, congratulations on the terrific growth and strong Q2 metrics. John, you're getting really your shelf space that you didn't have previously. Can you speak to that evolution, what's driving that, and maybe some of the recent highlights? Yes. Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. There is considerable momentum taking place and really disruption in the energy category. The traditional energy drinks you're seeing a transformation. If you look at a lot of the SPINS data, third-party data, a lot of these brands, Full Throttle, NOS, Rockstar, they're seeing decreases. Consumers want healthy, better-for-you options. And just last night, on Monster's earnings call, Rodney Sacks indicated and really clarified what's happening in the energy drinks category as well. There's really a real transformation taking place, and retailers are reacting now to add additional shelf space to this category of performance energy.
And Rodney indicated that brands like Celsius will be gaining additional shelf spaces as retailers are updating their sets to really align with today's health-minded consumers looking for some better-for-you choices, so we're seeing a lot of momentum ahead of us. As you're seeing out there, further expansion and existing accounts. And we have a lot of meetings taking place right now over the next several months, as we were preparing for category review meetings for all of these retailers. So, we are very optimistic. Our team is very optimistic for 2020 and the back half of this year as we continue to expand, and that is a prime reason really why we're seeing these DSD partners today taking us on.
You're seeing Anheuser-Busch, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Pepsi distributors, these premier distributors taking on Celsius as they see the opportunity as well, so as well as Big Geyser taking us on in New York City. So there is definitely a transformation happening in the energy drink category, and you're seeing that in the great growth as well. More consumers are coming to that category because it's growing it at 9.4%. So we are well positioned for the future. Good to hear. On the build out of the DST network, which regions are left to go, kind of lower left to go after, I guess. And based on your plan this year, where should we expect the biggest impact in DST added in the second-half? maybe you can just speak to that? Yes, our biggest, when you look at our DST coverage, our biggest coverage right now is in the southeast, we do have a couple of boys, which we're working on filling to have full DSD coverage. So we will be able to cover particular zones from some of our retailers, i.e. 711, CVS and target. Once we are able to build out and cover these warehouses that are currently servicing many of these retailers through the replenishment systems, we will be able, we're working with the buyers and we'll be able to look these retailers over to this DSD really model, which that will allow us to gain additional ACD distribution and better execution in the trade, keeping us in stock and keeping us on the shelves. So right now when you're seeing, you're seeing, we have a good presence in the -- in the southeast, also the Texas regions as well, Michigan, New York, we were up in the New England market, we have that covered as well, California, Vegas.
And we do have considerable voids as we look to really turn over a lot of these retailers. And that's what the team is working on right now. So there's a lot of runway ahead. When you're looking at additional DSD expansion, we're about 50 right now with these key premier distributors. And we're going to continue to expand on that. So really looking forward to the runway ahead, and then the partnership that we're forging, we're seeing great momentum and great excitement with these new partners, just servicing the independence, not activating the traditional retailers today. Okay, great. And then one more on international if I could, the Nordic business is turning around and it would seem that you have a major opportunity to expand in other regions of Europe. Can you touch on that potential? And maybe how you're thinking about approaching growth and some of those regions that are newer to you? Yes, I think, there's a lot of opportunity for us, the capitalizing on these global health and wellness trends. I think the key is expanding, which we are focused on profitable growth. So it's very key on that model, there is opportunity to further expand throughout Europe coming out of that Nordics with that with the good presence and awareness that we have. The next phase, we're still activating Finland and Norway, we're about to gain additional listings there with some of the key marquee retailers in country and then further penetrating throughout the Nordics would be the aggression. Also Spain, we're speaking with an opportunity in Spain, as well as Germany as well. So there is a lot of opportunities going ahead, but we want to make sure the model is correct on the expansion. Terrific. Thanks for taking my questions and continued success. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. Good morning Anthony. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the marketing spend. I -- we expected it to take up and it did and I know you're sponsoring more of these tough motor type events and so forth. Is that expected to continue at that level, continue to grow as we move into the back half of the year, and then what events specifically have you increased spending on and what where have you put your marketing dollars? I think in regards to our spend, we've stated before we're driving. Our goal is to drive profitable growth. We're working hard and towards that path. We're focused on driving additional gross profit dollars and EBITDA dollars into marketing to continue to drive top line revenue to capitalize what's taking place right now and the energy drink category. So we're reinvesting our additional EBITDA dollars in marketing, sales initiative, we just hired a round of additional sales reps to help us manage key sales reps in key regions to help manage the DSD. We're also investing in particular verticals; the food service business is a great opportunity. We've seen tremendous growth over the last several years there. We're expanding in that area. So in regards to direct marketing, we did have a lot of tough motor activation. We also did a lot of grower and demo sampling, which drove up additional costs, and also online, targeted advertising. So those types of activities will continue, but so I think we know we are in line Q3 is going to be an active, an active quarter as well. But we're very cognizant on continuing to grow at that at close to break-even level reinvesting our dollars. Okay. And then just on the distribution, expansion. Obviously, you announced a number of agreements. Can you tell us a little bit about what the end customer what, what, in terms of the pipeline? What's the opportunity, as you expand your distribution? What are some of the new customers you think are in the pipeline for this year, next year that could really move the needle for you? Yes, I mean we have a great roster currently of existing accounts, existing retailers, when you look at where we are. One thing that company has been very good at, through our, through this process is really optimizing those retailers. So just on our existing retailer list, we have so much opportunity still available to maximize these partners as an example. When we first went into sprouts, we started on the dry show. We continue to show results, we went to the cold cooler, the cold cooler starts, you have more, more velocity, higher velocity rates, where we're able to expand and really grow that account to the point where they moved us to the front checkout coolers, further increasing the velocity numbers.
So as an example, when you look at some of a really our national accounts like Target, we currently have three SKUs in the energy set on the dry shelf. There're further opportunities to add additional SKUs and also gain cold availability, and then check out front check out cooler. So we're working on the same trajectory, and really, really grooming and really activating our retail partners. Also in the convenience store channel, we talked about CVS with the 500-store test. Nationwide and roll out for better in the energy door with three SKUs and all locations, that role has been completed, we have additional opportunities to expand or expand our portfolio to 2, 4, 5, 6 and full shelf execution where we know when we increase additional SKUs the velocity numbers not just increased by one SKU, they increase on a multiplier effect, which is great, so, a lot of opportunity to further leverage CDS, and gain also from checkout and really maximize that.
The other opportunity we have is in Rite Aid, where we just received notification that we have been one of the top selling beverages in the GNC cooler set that they have for better for you beverages. We just received the green light that we will now be added to the energy door. So that will further expand the opportunity at Rite Aid. And then we can go and further expand with SKUs and optimize that retailer. So, some new retailers that we see a lot of opportunity that we're targeting, as Walgreens and Duane Reade in New York City, there's a lot of opportunity in there. Also, the convenience channel dominates the energy drink category. So we're working very hard to continue to increase our ACV and the energy drink category. We're only at 10.9 today. So there's a lot of runway ahead of us. Speedway is a great account where we're talking to then there's so many others that we're actively talking to as well. Okay, great. Just lastly, obviously there's a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of noise about CBD. You know, you're an energy company. But is there an opportunity to maybe have a recovery drink based on CBD. And you know, if so, what would that look like in terms of timeline, in terms of planning for your portfolio going forward? Absolutely. Our innovation team, we're looking at adjacent categories, different additional verticals. CBD is definitely something we've been working on for some time, we do have a CBD product in our portfolio ready, we are watching the regulations. And, as the government goes through the process, the galleries are being able to sell the CBDs and our existing routes to market. Whatever we bring the market, we want to be able to drive efficiencies and leverage our sales organization and our routes to market. So we do have a product ready, but we need to make sure that when we bring it to market, we're able to maximize the opportunity and our relationships and routes to market. So we are watching closely. We don't have a definitive timeline today, but we will be ready. Okay. Excellent, guys. Thanks. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Anthony. There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our second quarter results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum. We're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends. And the transformation taking place in today's energy drink category. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We are building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio and strategy and a large, rapidly growing market that consumers want. Our mission is to get Celsius to more consumers for profitably. I'm very proud of our dedicated team, as without them our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible. In addition, I thank our investors for their continued support and competence in our team.
On a final note, our management team will be presenting at the upcoming B. Riley FBR Consumer Conference in New York City on October 3, and we look forward to seeing many of you at this upcoming conference. Thank you everyone for your interest in Celsius and have a great day. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Cameron Donahue of Hayden IR. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Edwin Negron, Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and instructions will be given at that time. The company filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC and issued a press release today. All materials are available on the company's website at celsiusholdingsinc.com under the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, before I turn the call over to John, the audio replay will be available later today.
Please also be aware that this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of today, November 7, 2019. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. Except to the extent as required by applicable law, Celsius Holdings undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our safe harbor disclosures contained in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared comments. John? Thank you, Cameron, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2019 financial results reflect the outstanding work our team is doing to drive higher volumes through deeper placements in existing and new accounts as well as leveraging our infrastructure to improve profitability, all while demand for Celsius continues to rise. We're capitalizing on the accelerated macro industry trends for healthy, better-for-you products that are driven by the growing demand by health-minded consumers looking for healthier alternatives to conventional products. We're seeing great demand for the Celsius portfolio and are outpacing many larger, more established brands as we position ourselves as a leader in functional energy drinks through our health and fitness routes providing proven functional energy, differentiating ourselves from the competition.
As we continue our expansion further in traditional retail, we're seeing higher velocity rates and greater consumer acceptance in each step we take, which is further increasing our optimism. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. For the third quarter of 2019, we delivered a record $20.4 million in revenue with double-digit revenue growth of more than 20% with a positive net income on approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share. Our record third quarter revenue came in versus a comparable period in 2018 where we had a $1.3 million in sales slip from the second quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2018 in North America, as well as approximately $1.35 million in Asia sales, which only totaled $200,000 from non-China sales in 2019 due to the shift in a royalty model being initiated in the beginning of 2019. Excluding those items, we saw exceptional revenue growth of 45% for the third quarter.
North America sales reached a new record of approximately $16.8 million for the quarter. And excluding the $1.3 million shift in sales in 2018, revenues grew 66% for the quarter in 2019 versus the prior year on a normalized basis. Year-to-date revenue growth totaled 52% for the first 9 months of 2019, which demonstrates the demand for our portfolio and our ability to execute and drive profitable growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Func Food Group, our Nordic distribution partner, which is not included in our third quarter results as the transaction took place on October 24 in the fourth quarter. We are extremely excited about the transaction and the upside opportunity this provides Celsius and our shareholders going forward. We welcome the Func Food team to our family. And after Edwin reviews the financial results for the quarter, I will be providing additional details on the acquisition.
Our revenue for the first 9 months of 2019 totaled $51 million, which is close to outpacing our full year revenue in 2018 of $52.6 million. Clearly we are on track for another record-setting year. We remain steadfast in our strategy to position Celsius as a global leader for health-minded consumers, and in doing so continue to expand our presence, increase volume and elevate our brand. Through our focus and drive, we are gaining brand love and acceptance from more and more consumers each and every day as our passion for living better and living fit is motivating to all. This motivation is gaining interest from some of the largest retailers in the country looking to update their planograms to align with today's health-minded consumer. And we anticipate Celsius will continue to gain availability heading into and through 2020.
Our pursuit towards a national distribution network now includes and totals more than 70 regional direct store delivery, DSD partners, many of which are premier beverage distributors. Expanding to a national distribution direct store delivery network is designed to increase our in-store presence, and designed to improve our execution in the trade and expand our availability and enables us to [ do ] stronger inventory management in retail stores reducing the out of stocks with our high velocity brand. We expect to achieve majority coverage across the United States in the next 12 months, if not sooner, which is to be a best-in-class accomplishment within a highly competitive beverage industry. We are rapidly leveraging our new regional delivery distribution partners, creating significant opportunities to further build out across all markets of trade, especially in the convenience channel, where we are significantly outpacing many established competitors in the sales growth metrics.
According to most recent SPINS data, third-party data in the convenience channel, shelf-stable energy and functional beverage data set for the prior 52 weeks ending September 8, 2019, shows Celsius is growing at a 41.1% growth rate versus the prior year, which is outpacing the category growth by 4.3x with only an 11.9% ACV, which is all accumulated volume, indicating that Celsius has a long growth runway ahead as we further expand in the convenience channel and continue to outpace competitors. We have experienced the most significant expansion in the distribution network within the independent Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network, which has increased from 6 distribution partners within the wholesaler network to 31 since February.
In addition, we have expanded within the MillerCoors, Pepsi and Keurig Dr. Pepper affiliated wholesalers. With the accelerated expansion, we are very excited to now have approximately 2,500 wholesale sales representatives now selling Celsius nationwide on our behalf. In the first half of this year, we signed a distribution agreement with Big Geyser, New York's largest independent nonalcoholic beverage distributor serving the 5 boroughs of New York City and the counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Putnam. Big Geyser serves more than 20,000 locations in the massive New York City metropolitan market and has been instrumental in building numerous brands.
Starting in the third quarter of 2019, Big Geyser will be our -- is our preferred distribution partner servicing all 7-Elevens in the territory, which will significantly increase our distribution in the New York market. And in addition, we are in the process of transitioning Target stores over to Big Geyser in the territory, which will further increase our availability and velocities. As we build out our DSD network, we will continue to transition accounts over to this preferred route to market, which will further increase our in-store presence and velocities at retail. Subsequent to quarter end, we signed a national authorization with Foodbuy, a business unit of Compass Group North America and the largest foodservice procurement and supply chain solution organization in North America with over 85,000 unique customer locations.
Celsius branded drinks are now available nationwide across all Compass Group North America business units. The new channel adds incremental market opportunities for us, which include hospitals, airports, college campuses, restaurants and casinos, among others, and further adds to our momentum in the foodservice channel. In addition in the vending channel, we are now available through over 400 vending suppliers who cover over 10,000 micro markets and thousands of healthy vending units throughout the United States. The convenience channel continues to be and represent the largest opportunity of energy drink sales in the country with more than $9 billion in annual sales.
Industry-backed third-party data continues to validate our position as a healthy functional fitness drink that's resonating with today's consumer. As stated, this third-party SPINS data at September 8, 2019, shows Celsius is growing at a 41.1% year-over-year increase for our portfolio in the convenience channel, outpacing competitors in the category. This demonstrates Celsius warrants additional shelf space, and we are leveraging this data with buyers who are currently working on planogram resets for 2020.
Most recently and earlier this year, we launched placements with premier convenience store chain QuikTrip and look forward to further partnering in 2020. In addition, we recently expanded distribution to additional 3,300 convenience stores where placements will start to take place throughout the third quarter and will continue through the fourth quarter with most recent expansion including Circle K in the Southeast, [ Myers ] Convenience, Flying J and Pilot as well as additional regional chains with more to coming onboard throughout 2020.
We continue to expand our portfolio with delicious flavors. Just subsequent to quarter end, in the third quarter, we launched our newest flavor, Grapefruit Melon Green Tea, at the 2019 National Association of Convenience Stores shows in Atlanta on October 2 through the 4th. This is the largest convenience store show in the country. At the show, we received great reviews and interest as our noncarbonated green tea offerings, which are attractive to new consumers entering the energy drink category and looking for noncarbonated offerings. As the energy drink category continues to evolve and gain broader appeal, it's attracting new consumers wanting more out of their beverage, and noncarbonated offerings are gaining interest from retailers looking to attract these new consumers into the category.
The addition of the new flavor highlights the continued growth of our proven functional beverages and demand for healthier energy drinks offering vitamins, without sugar and calories found in traditional energy drinks. The fruit forward noncarbonated green tea flavor is an on-trend addition to our current green tea flavors that we believe will continue to appeal to a broader base of energy drink consumers. The strengthening of our green tea as a flavor profile is a refreshing way to highlight the green tea that is already one of our key ingredients in our proprietary MetaPlus formula.
This launch came on the heels of the second quarter launch of our ninth flavor, great-tasting Sparkling Fuji Apple Pear, which we launched in the fitness and vitamin specialty channels and throughout GNC with a mandatory 1,800 locations approved and authorization across all sets. In addition, Fuji Apple Pear is now also available at select 7-Elevens and throughout Amazon and is gaining distribution throughout many retailers in the country as well as across the fitness channel, where we gained distribution in top-tier fitness retailers nationwide, including the likes of Gold's Gym, 24-Hour, Crunch Fitness, Xsport Fitness, Smoothie King, YouFit, Equinox via Earthbar as well as In-Shape Fitness and many others, are now selling sparkling Fuji Apple Pear, which has become one of the top-selling flavors at many locations.
In addition to the great-tasting flavor line extensions, our innovation team is working on developing offerings targeting new verticals in adjacent categories, which will further increase the breadth of our portfolio. Our mission is to become a global leader of a branded portfolio which is proprietary, clinically proven and are innovative in its category and offer significant health benefits. During the third quarter, we further expanded our portfolio to include an innovative branched chain amino acid BCAA functional beverage that fuels muscle recovery. The BCAA product line was initially launched in the fitness channel and further establishes the company as a leading innovator in the functional beverage market.
Celsius BCAA Recovery drink debuted in September at the renowned 2019 Mr. Olympia before a premier demographic of athletic trainers, bodybuilders, endurance athletes and gym-goers. The Mr. Olympia is the world's most prestigious fitness industry showcase event, an international bodybuilding competition that is held annually by the International Federation of Bodybuilding & Fitness. Our new BCAA Recovery line is an extension of our strategy to introduce innovative beverages for today's health-minded consumer, which comes in 3 great flavors and has been highly accepted by retail partners, and initial reorders have been strong. And we anticipate this new line to add meaningful growth in 2020.
In North America, we have increased the number of retail locations where our products are available by 57% in 2019, to over 60,000 locations nationwide. Our expansion into household name retailers such as Target and CVS have greatly increased product availability, while our relationship with Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery store chain, has significantly expanded to include over 1,100 locations nationwide. Kroger will initially carry between 4 and 7 flavors of Celsius, depending on the region's location of the store. Exponential growth across all channels of trade continues to accelerate in North America.
In Europe, revenues for the third quarter were down 11%, coming in at approximately $3.4 million and slightly down to flat for the first 9 months of 2019 due to timing of new flavor launches, promotional programs and timing of orders. Please keep in mind, these revenues are derived from Celsius sales to our Nordic partner and are not sales from our Nordic partner to retail locations and consumers, i.e., sell-in or sell-through data. In addition, these figures are not consolidated as the Func Food Group acquisition took place post quarter-end on October 24.
During the quarter, our partners saw great demand for the Celsius portfolio with the launch of 2 new great flavors, Peach Vibe and Frozen Berry, which have been in high demand. We are very optimistic of the team's focus, execution and plans for 2020 as they continue to expand into new channels of trade and further increase market share throughout the Nordics. After Edwin reviews our financial results, I'll be providing additional details on the acquisition of the Func Food Group.
Earlier this year, we completed the realignment of our China business operations with the signing of a royalty agreement, which has further reduced our in-country early market brand awareness investments and reduced our use of working capital, while still providing us with the opportunity to extend the reach of our products and grow revenue through a license and royalty model. As such, higher sales with consistent gross margins and lower expenses related to China were the primary drivers of us delivering positive net income in the third quarter of this year.
In addition to capturing licensing and royalty revenue by serving the enormous China market, the agreement also provides us with a vehicle to recoup $12.2 million of market investments we made in prior years over a 5-year period, where our counterparty, Qifeng Foods, has exclusive rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius-branded products in China. Through this agreement, we have created a collaborative relationship that will serve to benefit for each of us as we strive to capitalize on the considerable consumer demand in the region. Qifeng Foods has relationships and a network of distribution partners that brings our 4 flavors of Celsius to 63 cities and over 65,000 locations across China.
Moving to marketing and supporting our growth in North America, we launched our first national guerrilla marketing tour featuring various interactive fitness activities, including outdoor classes hosted by popular instructors from around the nation, as well as competitive activities to inspire attendees and influencers to find what motivates them to live an active lifestyle. The Live Fit Tour officially kicked off in New York City on September 7 with a Celsius branded fitness event in Union Square. We are bringing our Celsius Live Fit Tour to 12 cities around the country, including Boston, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and others with a goal of inspiring and creating movement, which energizes each city with approximately 300,000 samples to be distributed along the way.
Along with the tour, we will be stopping at various retailers, distributors, local events, fitness partners like Planet Fitness, Gold's Gym, 24-Hour and others, and this program overlays over our distribution and is designed to build consumer awareness and activate the trade and retail partners in key markets through various media platforms. We also remain very active with Tough Mudder, a series of competitive events with a range of athletic ability. Through this relationship, we are in the process of samplings to more than 200,000 health-minded consumers in 23 cities across the country reaching new markets and new communities.
In addition, we are conducting targeted marketing guerrilla campaigns in key markets and interacting with consumers where they live, work and play, all through a variety of media platforms. We remain committed to our strategy of expanding our distribution network through high-quality distribution partnerships and going deeper and broader with existing accounts and leveraging our infrastructure to optimize returns and profitability. I look forward to speaking with you again when we report our results for the full year of 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, revenue was a robust $20.4 million, which translates to an increase of $3.8 million or 23% when compared to $16.6 million for the same period last year. The 23% increase was driven by continued strong growth in North American revenue of 48%, mainly related to double-digit growth in both existing accounts and distribution expansion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in European revenue of 11%, due to product availability aspects which have since been remediated.
Asian revenues reflect a change in our business model in China to a royalty and license fee arrangement. Although revenue was lower in Asia, there was also a corresponding decrease in expenses, which significantly contributed to improving our profitability in the third quarter. As has been our historical trend, the overall increase in revenues was primarily due to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Gross profit for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $1.7 million or 26% to $8.6 million, up from $6.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales volume and revenue. Gross profit margin for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 also reflected an improvement at 42.2% compared to 41.5% for the same period in 2018.
Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 were $4.9 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 43%, from $8.7 million in the same period in 2018. The decrease is mainly due to lower marketing expenses of $5.1 million related to the change in our business model in China, which now does not require any direct marketing investment. This decrease was partially offset by investments of $1.3 million in other marketing initiatives, trade activities and higher broker commissions and storage and distribution costs in order to support our higher business volume.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, were $2.2 million, a decrease of $93,000 or 4% when compared to $2.3 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower stock option expense of $253,000 and a decrease in other administrative expenses of $33,000, which were partially offset by increases in expenses related to the acquisition of our Nordics distributor of $145,000 and increases in other general and administrative expenses amounting to $48,000 when compared to the same period last year.
Total other expenses amounted to $543,000 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, up from $43,000 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018. The increase is primarily the result of interest expense of $109,000 and the amortization of discounts on notes payable of $528,000, which was partially offset by interest income related to the receivable from our China distributor of $96,000.
The net result for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 was net income to common shareholders of $961,000, or $0.02 per basic share based on a weighted average of 59,307,404 shares outstanding and after adding back interest expense on convertible notes of $105,000, an amortization on discount on notes payable of $528,000, a dilutive (sic) [ diluted ] net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 million or $0.03 per share based on a weighted average of 62,532,510 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of stock options of 992,693 shares and the dilutive effect of the convertible notes of 2,232,412 shares.
In comparison, for the 3 months ended September 30, 2018, the company reported a net loss of $4.2 million, inclusive of a preferred stock dividend of $44,000 or a loss of $0.08 per basic and dilutive shares based on a weighted average of 51,098,575 shares outstanding. The year-over-year increase in share count was primarily the result of the conversion of preferred stock to common stock at the end of 2018 and the capital raise and the conversion of notes payable to common stock in the current year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $2.4 million compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2018, a significant improvement over last year. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 includes favorable adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $549,000, net interest expense of $12,500, stock-based compensation expense of $900,000 and the impact of a translation loss on the note receivable from China of $1,900.
Additionally, for the third quarter of 2019, our net non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA amounted to $2.6 million, which also compares favorably to the 2018 results of $2.2 million, which excluded the impact of the investments in Asia of $5 million. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures have been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our year-to-date results. For the first 9 months of 2019, revenues increased 35% to $51 million, up from $37.9 million in the first 9 months of 2018. The increase was the result of a strong year-over-year growth in North American sales of 52% which, similar to the quarter, was driven by double-digit growth in existing accounts and distribution expansion. In Europe, the revenue increase of 7% was driven in large part by the launch of new flavors, which have been very well accepted in the market.
Increases in North America and in Europe were partially offset by a decline in Asian revenues related to the change in our business model. Gross profit increased by $5.6 million or 36% to $21.2 million in the first 9 months of 2019 compared to $15.6 million for the first 9 months of 2018. Gross profit margin increased by 38 basis points to 41.6% for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to 41.2% in the year-ago period. The increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increases in sales volume.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 24% to $14.1 million for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to $18.4 million for the first 9 months of 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in marketing expenditures in China as a result of the change in our business model in that country, which no longer requires direct marketing investments. This reduction basically amounted to $8.1 million.
Excluding the China impact and on a more comparable basis, marketing spend was up $3.8 million, mainly related to increases in marketing investments of $506,000, support to our distributors and investment in trade activities of $1.8 million, higher broker commissions of $350,000, investments in selling and marketing employees of $350,000, and higher storage and distribution costs of $1.1 million. These increases are related to higher business volume during the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period last year.
General and administrative expenses for the first 9 months of 2019 were $7.2 million, a slight decrease of 2.4% compared to $7.4 million for the year-ago period. The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of an accrual of $945,000 in the prior year that pertained to the settlement of a territorial dispute with a former distributor.
Excluding this impact, general and administrative expenses increased by $764,000, primarily as a result of a $250,000 increase in stock option expense, $145,000 related to the acquisition of our Nordics distributor, as well as investments in employee costs to support our continued growth and increases in professional fees, insurance and other similar administrative costs, which translated to a total increase of $361,000 in these areas when compared to the 9-month period ended in September 30, 2018.
Below the operating line, other income was $11.3 million for the first 9 months of 2019 compared to other expense of $123,000 in the prior year period, basically as a result of the note receivable from our China distributor that was signed at the beginning of this year. Under the terms of this agreement, we will obtain the net investment we had previously made in China.
As a result of the above, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, net income to common shareholders was $11.1 million or $0.19 per basic share based on a weighted average of 58,023,685 shares outstanding and after adding back the interest expense on convertible notes of $348,000 and amortization on discount on notes payable of $707,000, a dilutive net income available to common shareholders of $12.2 million or $0.20 per share based on a weighted average of 62,050,032 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of the stock options of 1,223,700 shares and the dilutive effect of the convertible notes of 2,802,647 shares.
In comparison, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018, we had a net loss of approximately $10.4 million and after giving effect to the preferred stock dividends of approximately $169,000 a net loss available to common shareholders of $10.5 million or a loss of $0.21 per basic and diluted shares based on a weighted average of 49,675,624 shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2019 was $3.3 million, which compares to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $7.1 million in the year-ago period, also a considerable improvement over prior year results. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019 includes favorable adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $770,000, net interest expense of $72,000, stock-based compensation of $3.3 million, and the gain on the note receivable from China, net of translation gain and losses, which amounted to $12.1 million as of the end of the quarter.
Additionally, our net non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019 amounted to $3.4 million, which also compares favorably to the 2018 results of $2.1 million, which excluded the impact of the investments in Asia of $8 million. As of September 30, 2019 we had cash of $20.5 million compared to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2018. We had working capital of $37.9 million as of September 30, 2019, compared to $19.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash used in operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $966,000 compared to $9 million for the first 9 months of 2018.
I will now turn the call back to John to provide some additional details on the Func Foods acquisition. Thank you, Edwin. In Europe and subsequent to quarter end, we completed our acquisition of Func Food, our Nordic partner, who is a wellness company that markets and distributes beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods under the brands Celsius, FAST Sports Nutrition, CocoVi and FitFarm, which represents a comprehensive portfolio of well-being products which promotes active and healthy lifestyles, for approximately $24.2 million, which comprise of about $14.8 million in cash and $9.4 million with the assumption of outstanding restructured debt. This is an important next step in our strategy to build a global dominant brand and solidify our position in the Nordics where Celsius has a dominant presence in Sweden, while opening new distribution platforms for the rest of Europe.
At the same time, this transaction provides us with the ability to bring an entirely new yet complementary product offering to consumers through the innovative FAST protein bar business. The acquisition, which was valued at a significantly below our revenue multiple of approximately 1x incremental revenue and approximately increases revenue on an annualized basis by over $25 million, provides immediate accretion and will improve our cash flows and present incremental opportunities to expand our footprint throughout Europe. This strategic acquisition provides us with additional scale and is expected to provide a meaningful increase in our top line with the expected pro forma consolidated revenue run rate of approximately $100 million, while enabling us to maintain our historical solid gross profit margins, extracting significant operational efficiencies that will allow us to reinvest for future growth.
Please keep in mind that consolidated revenues will start as of October 24 and will not be included into our -- will be included in our Q4 financial results post the acquisition date. Expansion opportunities throughout Europe include many new markets, which we will strategically expand through key distribution partners and retail partners. We see great opportunities to leverage our existing relationships with A.S. Watson, who owns several large retail chains throughout Europe. As an example, in Germany, A.S. Watson owns Rothmans (sic) [ Rossmann ], the largest -- the second largest drugstore chain in Germany with over 3,800 locations. In addition, the team has ongoing discussions with several other new markets, but our focus is to drive profitable growth by leveraging existing partnerships and relationships throughout Europe.
In the U.S., we see opportunities to leverage the innovative FAST snack bars portfolio and are in the process of establishing a manufacturer partnership to initially launch the brand in the fitness channel throughout 2020, and we have already received great interest from our retailers and partners about the brand. We have great confidence in the Func Food management team, as over the last 12 months they have demonstrated their ability to capitalize on market opportunities, and have established effective marketing tactics which are driving market share and growth.
Over the last 24 months, the team has been strapped with working capital demands by being over-leveraged, which has put significant pressure on the business. This acquisition provides the necessary capital for the team to focus on market opportunities, growth and operational efficiencies to capitalize on the growing demands of the Celsius and FAST portfolio. The division will be led by Robin Lybeck, our Managing Director of Europe. The existing CEO of Func Food Group has over 15 years of background in various sales and leadership roles and management roles in the beverage industry with such companies as Coca-Cola and Carlsberg.
In addition, the management team will include Thorsten Brandt, our Marketing Director of Southeast Europe, who has a strong marketing background from Coca-Cola and has served as the Head of Energy & Functional Beverages for Western Europe at Coke and has been with the company for over 3 years. In addition, our finance team will be led by Jussi Koskela who has been with Func Food and has prior working relationships and experience with OP, which is the largest financial institution bank in Finland. Through this acquisition, we are gaining critical access to expand in European markets with a well-established operationally infrastructure and unique marketing platform.
In addition, it provides us with the ability to bring an entirely new yet complementary product offering to consumers with the FAST protein snack portfolio. This transaction puts Celsius in 2 of the fastest-growing categories in food and beverage, the energy category and the growing protein snack category with 2 complementary brands. In addition, the acquisition solidifies our position in the Nordics and provides additional scale and meaningful increases in our top line revenue, which enables us to maintain our historical gross profit margins and extract the significant operational efficiencies that will allow us to continue to reinvest for growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Company. First, let me say congratulations on the strong metrics, the Func acquisition and all the progress you're making as a brand and a company. Looks like your cash flow is about $3 million through the quarter. Can you just touch on cash generation? And would you expect to generate cash going forward? And just to clarify, the cash we see on the balance sheet, that is after the Func acquisition, correct? Correct. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, absolutely. The cash that you see there, the $20.5 million that we ended up with, is after the acquisition. And you're absolutely correct. We generated approximately $3.5 million of cash in Q3. And to answer your question, yes, the expectation as we continue to grow, depending on our working capital needs, is that we will continue to generate some cash flow. But again, it's going to depend on the investment that we make in terms of working capital. Yes, just a further point. Thank you, Edwin, as well. If you look, there is an escrow portion on the balance sheet as long term. The auditors, we put that earmarked, the funds in escrow for the acquisition. The additional capital, when you look at the cash generated, we kept inventory fairly tight throughout the quarter as well. We actually just went into large production runs in October, November and December. We'll be running fairly heavily heading into the back half of the year as we're seeing -- historically seeing great demand coming in Q1 and Q2. We have a lot of new retailers coming on board as well. So we're excited about that, making sure we have ample supply. So we will be putting some of that capital to work within the business in our working capital needs. Okay. And then just to follow up on that. You mentioned adding new retailers, and obviously you've added a lot of retail doors and dramatically improved the shelf space and positioning in a number of retailers. On the retailers you mentioned that are new, we -- I know some of those may be tests. We've been seeing the product in some new places. Maybe you could just elaborate on that, where we might start to see the product appear? What other retailers might be out there for you to get into? Yes. Over the last, call it, late 2018, if you recall, we started to do some tests in retailers in 2018 and then we announced in Q1 Target expansion as well as CVS. We currently are testing in a variety of retailers. You'll probably see us in particular retailers in given markets. We have not disclosed those. One thing we're seeing right now is there's a lot of transformation taking place in the energy category that we talked about, with consumers looking for healthy, better-for-you options. Consumers react first, retailers react second, and we're getting a lot of interest as buyers right now, as we speak, we're in the midst of buyer season, are going through really category rationalizations in their category sets, looking at what they should bring in for 2020. And we are one of those top picks on those item when you look at it, given our data -- our third-party data showed strong growth. We are on trend with our healthy better-for-you offerings, and we have the data to validate it. So we're really excited about the position we're at and well positioned for 2020 to really capitalize on the evolution of the energy drink category. Okay, great. And then I know you talked a little bit about the progress you're making in building out the DSD network. Can you just touch on any, I guess, improvement you might be seeing in stock-outs, given that your product seems to pretty much fly off the shelves? And as part of that, what do you think are the next key milestones in building the DSD network? And I guess, when we should see -- I think you mentioned Target converting to DSD -- when something like that will happen? Yes. It's going to happen. We've been working with the buyers at Target as well as CVS. We actually, through 2020, have received authorization. We will be flipping from a direct store delivery model versus our current warehouse model as we solidify these regions within each key market. So there is an inherent problem keeping up with a high-velocity demand as the buyer initially put us in through a warehouse fulfillment option at CVS and Target, and the product is getting a lot of velocity -- higher velocity. We're working with the replenishment buyers. But what really fixes this and really get -- be able to leverage this is moving to a DSD network. We anticipate about a 40% lift in some of these outlets, in some of these retail markets, moving to this route to market.
Now we're up to over 70. We started the year with 3 -- about 6, if you go back looking at -- in February when we announced bringing on some Anheuser-Busch strategic distribution partners. Today, we're up to over 70 with the likes of MillerCoors. We're really going to the best DSD partners in each market to solidify these, to really cover these DMAs. So New York City is our first. We have flipped over 7-Eleven to Big Geyser, and we're working on flipping Target in November over to Big Geyser. Our next market looks like it would be the Arizona market where we have full coverage and also in the Michigan market. And we're working on the Southeast market as well in those regions.
So we're making progress. We have a lot of interest. It takes time to build the DSD market. What we're doing is a major initiative. There's a lot of brands that don't even get to this point. We are confident on our ability to have a DSD network over the next 12 months due to the interest that we're receiving from some of these larger houses. What we have seen is moving through the holidays like July -- 4th of July weekend, moving into some of these busier holidays, it's really opened windows to bring new partners into their DSD networks, into their distributors. So we're heading into the holiday here working very vigorously, but we'll probably -- we'll continue to make progress as we continue to move on. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. So just follow up with Jeff's line of questions. So on the DSD network, what percent there do you feel like you're at? I mean is it -- does it feel like you're 1/3 the way there, to where you'd like to be over the coming year or 2 or halfway there? I'll say we're about 1/3. We anticipate we'll need about 250 to 300 distributors to get our national coverage. We do have a very methodical mapped out process on where we have holes and where we need to bring distributors onboard to flip over these regions, so -- to make sure we're covering these DMAs and these warehouses. So we're going to see continual progression into 2020. And the team is working really hard, and everyone is focused on this. Okay, got it. And then a couple questions regarding Func as far as, firstly, how do things look on once you close it all, the $9.4 million of debt? I guess, Edwin, what do you expect is the quarterly cost to carry the debt? I guess, the closing date is still scheduled for, or was October 24. Is that right? Yes. It actually closed at -- on October 25. And yes, looking at that, I think -- what was it, the quarterly was going to be something like $200,000 or $300,000 in terms of the interest. So yes, we're looking at that. We have good cash to probably service that, and we have several other alternatives going down the road to then see if we can obtain some long-term financing given that we don't have any -- basically, we have a very clean balance sheet and basically no debt aside from that. Got it. And then, John, could you talk a little bit about the FAST portfolio? I know that you kind of pushed off on the protein snack portfolios, and it sounded like it would be a while. And what I'm hearing now is that, no, it's not going to be a while. And could you walk us through time lines on that? And when we expect to see introductions in North America and what channels we'd expect to see in 2020? Yes. I think we do see opportunity with the FAST portfolio, mainly in the protein snack bar category. We are looking for a profitable launch and being very methodical in our approach to bringing it to North America. We will be testing throughout 2020, like we start on online initiatives and through the fitness channel as we build out a consumer base and a community for the brand. As we all know, going into retail is very expensive. And we want to make sure we have built up consumer demand before we enter our retail partners. But some vitamin specialty retail partners, you will likely see it in 2020. But it will be more of a methodical approach, making sure we maintain our EBITDA and our focus. And the Celsius portfolio is our main focus. Yes. Okay. Got it. And then 1 more question, if I may. Could you talk a little bit about any trends or recent activity from online channels as far as what you saw from Q3 and how that may look for Q4? Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Actually, our online activity is limited to where we launched in New York City and now has gone to Hollywood, and then we're out in LA markets and now we're in San Diego. We're seeing a lot of activity just within the Google Analytics, as well as what's taking place on online at walmart.com and amazon.com as well as others. So Amazon sales have been extremely strong. They have continued to be extremely strong over the last, really, call it 3 to 4 years. We always had a good presence. We have a high continuity rate, which is great. And we actually are even aligning further with an internal team to further expand our digital and online presence with all of our retail partners now moving to digital offerings. When you look at shopping apps, that's a untapped channel for us. We're going to go -- and go after that in 2020 to really leverage these new mediums of how consumers are shopping and purchasing products. So we're really excited about what we're seeing in online. It remains a great channel for us. And it's exciting times for the company. I think that shows you as well is what we're building within the consumer base and the community. And as the brand continues to get further strength and more awareness and a further household penetration, it's great to see those numbers continue to increase each and every week. So we're excited about that. Our next question is from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. So yes, so just on Func Foods, just the acquisition closed on the 25th. I think if we took out the Celsius revenue, the annual revenue for Func Foods last year was around $24 million, $25 million, if I'm correct. I'm just wondering what the run rate is now on a quarterly basis. And should we expect that to start to grow here in the fourth quarter? Yes. Thank you, Anthony. Yes, that is correct. We will start to see that grow in the fourth quarter. I mentioned the new -- 2 new launches that we had, which was our Peach Vibe and Frozen Berry, was flawless execution, getting a lot of demand, so much demand that they actually sold out of the initial runs of both those flavors. So good momentum on the ground. Right now, they are heading into the holiday season, which is traditionally a slower time in retail where you have a lot of novelties on the retail floors. So it will be in line with historical trends that the Func Food organization has had, but we will start to see the consolidated revenue. They saw about -- right around a 20% lift last quarter. So that was really great to see that in the Celsius portfolio, and there's a lot of opportunities to further grow new channels of trade.
Up until this point, it really only focused on the hypermarkets, very little distribution in convenience. We know the energy drink category performs extremely well in the convenience channel. We are testing right now in Norway at 7-Eleven, and that will be really the first entry into 7-Eleven in the Nordics. So really excited about that opportunity. And then they just expanded into a Finland -- one of the main retailers in Finland in the energy category. So really excited about initial feedback, and the acceptance of Peach Vibe has been really phenomenal. So you're looking at about a $25 million increase conservatively for -- at the consolidated level as it is today. And then I do -- we do feel there is additional opportunities for further growth. We're not really providing forward guidance on what that growth is, but there is upside potential that is embedded in the numbers. Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on international sales. I know there was -- as you changed the China model to the royalty model, that impacted international sales. If you stripped out that piece of the business and just looked at the remainder of international sales, how would you gauge that in general? Well, Asia was about $2.7 million last year. So if you strip that out, then you're talking about -- we're -- in this year, we generated about $630,000 in Asia. And then we had some other sales of about $160,000. So all in all, I mean we're growing from that perspective if you back out the China impact. Okay, okay. But that -- backing out the China impact, that remains a small business, but the opportunity, particularly with Func Foods, is significant to grow that internationally, right? Yes. I think that means a lot of opportunity with Func Food. There's no question about it. In Asia, there's still opportunities in Asia. We do have our team in Hong Kong. It has been going through -- the retail market there has been troubling just due to the environment they're operating in. We do feel there is opportunities there to continue to grow. And then we did launch in Malaysia. And currently really through the quarter, we were gaining distribution through over 2,000 7-Elevens, so additionally getting seeded in that market. So there is very much [ those ] opportunities for international growth, very focused and disciplined. And North America is as well as the team's main focus because of the opportunity we have here. When you take out some of the onetime charges, you look at a normalized growth rate, North America is growing at a 67% growth rate. And if you just look at North America's sales over the last 4 quarters, we're starting to see quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. So really great fundamentals and great growth rates we're seeing within each channel. Okay. And just to follow up, John. Just on -- you've launched some new flavors, some new brands and so forth. Are there any in your portfolio, as you're launching some of these new flavors, that are saying, ""Hey, you know what, this is a flavor that maybe we discontinue and focus on the flavors that are working."" And then just as a follow-up, is there any marketing campaigns, new ones planned for the remainder of this year or the first quarter of next year? Excellent. Yes. You're always looking at flavor SKU rationalization. There is certain flavors within the portfolio, obviously, that are turning at a lower velocity rate than others. Right now, our #1 flavor on a per point basis is Kiwi Guava. That flavor is performing extremely well. We do have Cola -- we have flavors like Cola, which is more of a traditional flavor that's been out there for some time. It does have -- what's great about some of our flavors and some of our relationships with our co-packers, we can conduct smaller runs. And with our online offerings through Amazon, walmart.com and several other offerings, as long as we're meeting the velocity rates to really provide reorders and able to turn the product due to these other avenues and alternative channels -- we have such a great following behind the Cola product that there's a -- it does really great. It tastes great. Maybe it's not for everyone on the flavor profile, but we do have a specific fan base for that product. So when you look at a lower velocity item, that would be 1 of the flavors. But at this point, we're not looking to discontinue any flavors just because we are meeting all the hurdle rates and demands for the products.
So when you look at other areas we're focused on, we want to be innovative within each category. We want to bring -- continue to bring innovative flavors out, and we will be on-trend with our fruit forward position. And as for marketing programs, we have a slew of marketing activities planned for 2020 which we're really excited about. I think you initially saw that with the Live Fit Tour, really interactive, experiential sampling, and what we do at Tough Mudder. We're also looking at other properties. Another thing is, is currently further building out our community with the social digital media influencers and really getting that to a 360 integration with consumers in retail. And a big initiative for us is trade marketing, which -- now that we have DSD partners coming onboard, I don't know if anyone has been to any of the Krogers in Texas and other markets. But we are getting 100-case stack displays. We're looking to really build experiential displays in 2020, further driving awareness and trial. Our next question is from Gerry Khermouch with Beverage Insights. I joined the call a little bit late because KDP ran late. So if you covered this, my apologies. But HEAT seems to line up pretty well with the fitness energy leader, Bang. And I'm just kind of wondering what role you envision for that particular subline? Excellent. Thank you, Gerry. The HEAT portfolio -- we had some experience -- really some very tough competition heading into really the second quarter this year. As you know, REIGN launched with the BOGO and Bang with VPX was also doing heavy discounts. So we do see the HEAT portfolio as a major player in the performance energy category. We're getting interest from many retailers there. And it is definitely a major -- going to be a major contributor in our portfolio going forward as well. So there has been a lot of competition in that 16-ounce category. And we expect that the competitive set to continue to be very competitive heading into 2020. But we do have -- with our differentiated offering, we do feel there's a great place for the Celsius HEAT in our portfolio and in retail buyer shelf space. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to John Fieldly for a closing comment. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, everyone. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our products are gaining considerable momentum as we're capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends and the changes taking place in the energy category. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio and strategy and a large, rapidly growing market that consumers want. And our mission is to bring Celsius to more consumers profitably. I'm very proud of our dedicated team, as without them our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible. In addition, I thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Celsius, and have a great day. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.","Celsius Holdings third quarter 2019 Earnings conference call is being recorded . the call will open to your questions and instructions will be given at that time . this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of today, November 7, 2019 .",0.0

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared comments. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2019 was another outstanding year for Celsius as we further expanded our distribution network, adding new relationships with channel partners and expanded its existing accounts, extended our portfolio of products through our commitment to innovation, gained greater brand recognition and visibility and restructured our business model in China.
Each of these initiatives are in support of our relentless commitment to building a solid infrastructure that positions Celsius as a global beverage leader and supports long-term growth and increasing returns for our shareholders.
The macro trends across the industry continue to accelerate as more consumers seek healthier alternatives, less sugar, functional beverages versus conventional beverages.
In the energy drink category, one of the fastest-growing in the beverage category, it grew approximately 8% in North America through 2019, and is anticipated by Euromonitor to be an $85 billion category globally by 2025.
In sync with each increasing demand, we are now reaching more consumers at more distribution ports than ever before. We set a new sales record in 2019, with over $75 million in revenue, an increase of 43% over last year, and our North America revenues grew 53% to approximately $60 million in revenue. This growth was driven by higher volumes and higher retail velocity rates across all channels of trade.
Throughout 2019, we set new quarterly record in top line revenue and our financial performance and finished the year with four quarters of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth with the fourth quarter of 2019 topping $24 million in revenue. We are truly gaining considerable momentum.
The energy drink market remains robust, and we are well positioned to continue to gain share. Back on September 27, 2019, beverage industry analyst, Bonnie Herzog, of Wells Fargo at that time, now at Goldman Sachs, commented, the fitness performance energy subcategory is now going mainstream, suggesting there’s even more potential disruption across the category than we previously expected, and also mentioned, there’s still a long runway of growth across broader energy as new consumers enter the category.
She is absolutely right. We see a massive opportunity with seismic shifts taking place in the energy category for functional, better for you offerings. And with our proven functional health and wellness fitness position, we are gaining broad mass appeal. We have never been more optimistic about our future.
Focusing in on our geographies, as I mentioned, in North America, revenues increased 53% to $60 million annually, with growth derived from all channels of trade, including health and wellness, retail, vending and online.
And in Europe, European revenues increased 56% year-over-year as a result of strong new flavor launches, optimized in-store execution and two full months of fully consolidated revenues post the acquisition of Func Food Group in November and December. And as expected, our revenue in Asia was down year-over-year due to the strategic shift in our business model in China to a royalty licensing model, which began in the beginning of 2019.
Through an agreement with our long-standing partner, Qifeng Food Technology, we established an operating model that leverages the experienced team and established infrastructure and mitigates our risks. We have eliminated the need for future capital injections by Celsius in China and created a vehicle to recapture our previous invested - investment through fixed repayments.
Asia remains an important piece of our growth strategy, and we believe the structure will accelerate our ability to capture market share in this rapidly growing China market.
Shifting our approach positions us to receive nearly $7 million in initial minimum royalty fees and allows us to recoup more than $12 million of previously invested capital over the initial 5 years of the contract. This structure will be incremental to our cash flows throughout and financial results throughout 2020.
From a strategic standpoint, we completed an acquisition of Func Food Group, a Nordic wellness company. The acquisition, which was immediate accretive provides significant opportunity. We first began a relationship with Func Food Group in 2016, when they acquired our former distributor and assumed distribution of Celsius in the Nordics.
This acquisition was an important step in our strategy to build a global dominant brand as it further solidifies our position as one of the best-selling fitness drinks in Sweden with an approximate 10% market share and opens a new distribution platform for the rest of Europe.
Through this transaction, we gained an additional revenue stream with entirely new yet complementary product offering, Func Food innovative FAST Sports Nutrition line and a number of operational synergies that we have already begun to capture.
On the North America distribution front, we remain focused on building our national distribution network, which now includes more than 100 regional direct store delivery partners, which is a 100% increase from July 2019, many of which are premier beverage distributors, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Monster, MillerCoors, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Pepsi independent distributors.
We expanded our availability to more than 65,000 locations across the United States, an increase in our store count by over 62% compared to the beginning of 2019. Through these relationships, we not only expanded availability, but it’s also been a catalyst to increase our retail sales velocity, reducing our out of stock situations and improving inventory management at point of sale.
We are making great progress and plan to have majority coverage in many metropolitan markets across the United States by summer, which will reinforce our platform from continued growth.
In the first half of 2019, we signed a distribution agreement with Big Geyser, New York’s largest independent non-alcoholic distributor serving the 5 boroughs of New York City and the countries of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Putnam. Big Geyser serves more than 20,000 locations and the massive New York City metropolitan market.
And beginning in the third quarter, we successfully transitioned 7-Eleven and Target locations over to our preferred distribution partner in a territory, significantly increasing our distribution in the New York City market.
As we continue to build out our direct store delivery network, we’ll continue to transition additional key accounts over as we did with Big Geyser, which, we believe, will further increase our in-store presence and velocity rates at retail, where we are already seeing a 40% lift in sales in existing accounts through this model.
In addition, we have added a number of marquee accounts in North America network in 2019, including just to name a few, QuikTrip, Stop & Shop, and expanded in many of our existing accounts, including CVS, Rite Aid, Target, 7-Eleven, DICK’S Sporting Goods, Kroger, Gold’s Gym, 24-Hour Anytime Fitness and many, many others.
More recently, we signed a national authorization agreement with Foodbuy, a business unit of Compass Group North America. Foodbuy is the largest food service, procurement and supply chain solution organization in North America with over 85,000 unique customer locations.
Our beverages are now available nationwide across all Compass divisions North America business units. This new channel adds incremental market opportunities for us, which will include hospitals, airports, college campuses, restaurants and casinos, among others.
And this momentum will continue throughout 2020 with the most recent announcement, new retail partner, Walmart, where we have been planogramming into over 1,500 locations in the beverage set throughout North America and see significant opportunity.
In the grocery and mass market channel, the highlight was the expansion with Kroger, the largest grocery store chain in the United States with more than 1,100 locations nationwide under that banner. Our first placements with Kroger were in the second quarter of 2019, and the product is now available across all of its stores, including both the beverage aisles and sports nutrition sets. With the expansion, Celsius is now available in more than 7,000 grocery stores nationwide.
SPINS based brand performance in the grocery MULO channel over the past 52 weeks through December 2019 demonstrates tremendous momentum in this channel with a growth rate of over 110% in the past year. We are well positioned to drive further growth and maximize our distribution and retail partners driving increased velocity rates and availability throughout 2020.
In convenience channel, in 2019, we launched placements with QuikTrip, an $11 billion enterprise with more than 800 stores in 11 states and expanded with other convenience chains, including Circle K, Meijer’s Convenience, Flying J-Pilot, further expansion in 7-Eleven, RaceTrac and others.
Our network of convenience storage continues to grow and will continue to grow throughout 2020 as we continue to gain interest for more convenience retail partners. We anticipate that more convenience retailers will be allocating more placements to Celsius in 2020 based on changes in consumer preferences and the momentum we are gaining in existing accounts in this channel.
We see a massive opportunity in the convenience channel. In this channel, the most recent SPINS data for the prior 52 weeks ending December 29, 2019 shows Celsius is growing faster than the category at a 44.5% growth rate versus the prior year with an ACV or all accumulated volume of 12.2%. This indicates we have a long runway ahead.
In the vending channel and micro markets, we are now available through more than 600 vending and micro market operators, covering more than 10,000 micro markets and thousands of healthy vending units throughout the United States. Through 2019, we saw an increase in the strong growth in the channel, fueled by strong purchases by both Canteen and Compass Group.
We see continued growth opportunities in this channel as we gain further placements at - in at-work locations, restaurants, hotels, hospitalities as well as colleges and universities.
Most recently, we gained placements through OTG and are now available in retail locations in 9 major airports in the United States, including JFK in New York as well as others. This channel continues to represent a large opportunity for energy drink sales in the country, and we plan to capture a significant portion of this opportunity.
On the portfolio innovation front, continuous innovation has been a cornerstone of our business from the beginning, which is driven by our cross-functional teams. And in 2019, we exhibited our industry leadership with the launch of innovative flavors, which are trend forward and aligned with today’s health-minded consumer. Each of our trend forward innovative flavor launches have been extremely well received, affirming our connection to consumers’ taste and preferences.
Subsequent to year-end, we unveiled our latest addition refreshing exotic Jackfruit, the latest flavor, which is available in our new heat - CELSIUS HEAT packaging, a tropical taste with a burst of sweetness and a tangy twist.
Further expanding our product portfolio, we also celebrated successful launch of a new innovative line of beverages, our branch-chained amino acid BCAA functional beverages that fuels muscle recovery. The line was initially launched in the fitness channel as a response to demand within the fitness community for healthy energy offerings that support work - post workout. Addition, it further expands our usage occasions. Our BCAA products are a strong complement to our existing lineup of fitness beverages.
Our innovations team is diligently working on new offerings where they’re focused on new verticals and adjacent categories to increase the breadth of our portfolio, all while leveraging our delicious innovation flavors combinations, further building upon the premium great-tasting functional portfolio.
In addition, we expanded - in addition to expanding distribution and the introduction of new products, we stepped up our efforts to increase brand awareness in 2019, further building upon our brand equity and driving our premium position in the energy category.
We’re creating meaningful and emotional connections with consumers online and off-line. One of our integrated programs included the launch of our first national guerilla marketing tour, our Live Fit Tour, featuring various integrated fitness activities, including outdoor classes hosted by popular local instructors and ambassadors from several nationwide fitness chains as well as competitive activities.
We made our way across the United States with stops in key cities. As a result of these efforts, we reached tens of thousands of new consumers in high energy settings, most conductive to the consumption of our products in a cost-effective way.
In addition, we connected with consumers where they live, work and play. Through a variety of programs, we expanded our community and created meaningful connections. In 2020, we will continue to drive our awareness through meaningful and emotional connections with consumers and continue to leverage today’s trends to build upon our global iconic Celsius brand.
Our strategy remains consistent. Striving for consistent, continuous value creation with continual focus on strengthening our core, building our communities and expanding our distribution networks through high-quality partnerships, further optimizing existing accounts and leveraging our infrastructure to drive continued growth and improved profitability.
It is an exciting time in our industry as seismic shifts are taking place in food and beverage, and consumers are demanding more from their beverages. We see continued momentum with our portfolio to capitalize on these trends to drive a premium leadership position with our Celsius portfolio. I look forward to discussing progress throughout 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, revenue was a record high $24.1 million, an increase of $9.4 million or 64% compared to $14.7 million for the same period last year. The overall increase in revenues was basically due to increases in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Breaking the 64% increase down by geography. In North America, continued strong growth drove an increase of $6.1 million to a record $17.1 million, mainly related to double-digit growth in both existing accounts and distribution expansion.
The European markets also increased by $4.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The Asian markets reflect the change in our China business model to a royalty and license fee arrangement, effective January 1, 2019.
Asian revenue amounted to $212,000 compared to $1.6 million in the year ago period. However, in Asia, there was also a corresponding decrease in expenses, which significantly contributed to improving our profitability in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Revenue from all other areas was $32,000. The total increase in revenues pertains to additional sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. Gross profit increased by $4.6 million or 85% to $10.1 million from $5.4 million for the same quarter in 2018.
Gross profit margin for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, was 41.9%, which compares favorably to 37.1% for the 2018 quarter. The increase in gross profit dollars is mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Selling and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, were $7 million, an increase of $4.2 million or 152% from $2.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. The increase is mainly due to higher marketing investments of $1.6 million as the prior year amount reflected a reduction of $900,000 related to the settlement of marketing charges with our China distributor for 2019.
This quarter reflects increases of $1.3 million related to sales and marketing employee investments and $1.3 million of incremental charges pertaining to trade, marketing activities and distribution costs, as these results now include the impact of the European business integration as of the date of the acquisition on October 25, 2019.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, were $4.4 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 43% from $3.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisition costs amounting to $434,000.
Additionally, stock option expense increased by $287,000 when compared to the same period last year. Employee costs increased by $196,000, and depreciation and amortization also increased $110,000, as well as all other administrative costs which reflected an increase of $287,000 since they now reflect the European expenses incurred in these areas as of the date of the acquisition.
Below the operating profit line, total other income amounted to $150,000 for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, which represents a fluctuation of $593,000 from other expenses incurred in the amount of $443,000 for the same period in 2018. The variance is mainly the result of the gain in the note receivable from China of $410,000, which is denominated in the Chinese currency.
Additionally, there were lower financial amortization costs of $273,000, which were partially offset by higher net interest expense of $60,000 and an increase in other miscellaneous expenses of $30,000.
As a result of the above, for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, the company had a net loss available to common stockholders of $1.1 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted shares compared to a net loss of $893,000 or $0.02 for basic and diluted shares in the year ago period.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the net Asia investment for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $607,000 compared to $136,000 in the fourth quarter of 2018. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures have been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our full year results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue was approximately $75.1 million, a robust increase of $22.5 million or 43% from $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This significant revenue growth was mainly associated with the results of the North American region, which delivered an increase of $20.8 million over last year or an increase of 53%.
The European region provided $14.5 million of revenue, an increase of $5.2 million or 56%. Asian revenues for 2019 reflect the change in our China business model to royalty and license fee arrangement, effective January 1, 2019. Asia revenue decreased to $841,000 in 2019, compared to $4.3 million in 2018 as a result of this change.
Revenues from all other regions amounted to $191,000, which was aligned with prior year results. The total increase in revenues from the 2018 period to the 2019 period was basically attributable to an increase in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Gross profit increased by $10.2 million or 49% to $31.3 million from $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit margins totaled 42% and 40% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
This increase in gross margin profitability is mainly related to reductions in product repackaging costs, freight costs and the favorable impact of the consolidation of the European business. The increase in gross profit margins contributed an incremental profitability of $1.2 million for the 2019 year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $21.1 million, a decrease of basically $100,000 or 0.5% from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This apparent decrease is mainly due to the change in our China business model to a royalty and licensing framework, effective January 1, 2019, which no longer requires direct marketing investments by Celsius.
Excluding this impact, which amounted to a $7.2 million reduction for 2019, our investment in marketing activities actually increased by $1.3 million or 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. These figures now include the marketing investments that are performed in our European business as of October 25, 2019.
Additionally, our support to distributors and investment in trade activities were $2.3 million higher for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 than for the same period last year. Furthermore, investments related to sales and marketing personnel, which now include the European business as of the date of the acquisition were $1.7 million higher for 2019 than for the same period last year.
Also, broker commissions and storage and distribution costs were $1.8 million higher during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 than for the same period last year due to increases in our business volume and the integration of our European operations as of the date of the acquisition.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $11.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 11% from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to higher stock-based compensation of $540,000 and $580,000 related to acquisition costs.
Additionally, there were incremental expenses of $452,000 pertaining to employee costs, $250,000 pertaining to higher professional services, $150,000 of depreciation and amortization and $130,000 pertaining to other administrative costs as these expenses also include the impact of the European business integration as of the date of the acquisition.
Below the operating line, total other income increased by $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.4 million from a loss of $565,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly as a result of the recognition of the gain pertaining to the agreement executed with our China distributor as part of the change in the business model, which includes a reimbursement of the investment made by the company in the China market during the 2017 and 2018 years. This has been recorded as a corresponding note receivable from our China distributor on the balance sheet, which is payable over a 5-year period.
The net result for the full year 2019 was net income to common shareholders of approximately $10 million or $0.16 per basic and diluted shares compared to a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.23 per basic and diluted shares for 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the net Asia investment for the full year 2019 was $4 million, which compares to $2.2 million in 2018. Again, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
As of December 31, 2019, the company had cash of $23.1 million compared to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The company also had working capital of $24.8 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $19.6 million as of December 31, 2018.
Cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled approximately $1 million, reflecting the net adjusted economic profitability from operations of $3.7 million and an increase in accounts payable of $2.6 million, which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses as well as decreases in other liabilities for a total use of cash in these areas of $5.3 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed. Hi, John and Edwin. How are you? Excellent. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning. Thank you. So I’ll keep it just to a few questions. Talk about the DSDs a little bit and the velocities as a benefit? As far as going to DSD, you talked about 100 partners. What’s left? Do you feel like you’re 70% there, 80% there? What’s left as far as DSD and channels and getting more efficiency there? Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. On the DSD front, direct store delivery, you’re correct, we are - as I stated, we’re at 100, strong at the moment. As we’re reporting, we do have a variety of additional - a few dozen additional distributors coming on board, and we’re in discussions right now with many.
Right now at 100, we’re probably right around 35% over key markets covered in North America. We do feel we’ll have most of the markets covered by summer key markets, where we will be able to start really flipping key accounts over to this preferred method. We started to do it, as I mentioned, in New York City with Big Geyser. 7-Eleven is now serviced by Big Geyser. Target is serviced by Big Geyser. And CVS will be switched over momentarily. So also, we’re in talks with Rite Aid to flip them over as well.
So this is going to continue to happen as we get these key DMAs covered. And we already have three key markets covered, where we’re working with the key accounts right now to flip those over by summer.
So the velocity rates we’re seeing when we flip to DSD model just is a great -- just is a better in-store execution, signage, making sure we’re in stock. We’re seeing velocity rates increase from our current existing rate that we’re seeing in existing accounts, which the growth has been roughly around 30% to 35% in existing accounts, we’re actually seeing a 40% lift in that as well. So definitely the velocity rates will continue to increase as we move towards more direct store delivery, key accounts going over to this model. Okay, got it. Perfect. And then second question, you talked a little bit about Func Foods and, in particular, the FAST line out of Helsinki, Finland as far as the protein bars and some of the other products coming to North America, do you still expect that in 2020? And when will we see some placements? Yeah. The FAST portfolio, which we acquired through the acquisition, we - it’s a great tasting, innovative protein snack portfolio, which is highly complementary to our current Celsius portfolio. We do see opportunities, not only further expanding within Sweden and Norway, where we already have existing distribution with Celsius, but other markets as well throughout Europe.
We are looking to start a very methodical launch of the FAST portfolio in 2020 with initially rolling out with online and starting to see it in a few retail partners. Once again, we’re very focused on the Celsius portfolio with a massive momentum we have, but we do see the FAST portfolio as a complementary offering. We are going to be very methodical on that. We’re very cognizant of resources, limited resources as well, as well as the investments required when launching new brands within retail. So we’re very methodical on approach. We will start to test it in 2020 as a complementary offering, which has a lot of synergistic benefits. Got it. And then lastly for me, and I guess, for Edwin. You did call out some of the one-timers as far as the G&A line and the S&M line. So could you give us a little more flavor as far as normalization as far as what we see? I know that we had the European business integration.
But I’m just trying to get a sense of the sales and marketing, you talked about the $21.2 million to $21.1 million on an annual change. So it’s something we should think about increasing toward the 20% range? Or is that more like the 40% range for the upcoming year and the same for G&A? Thanks. Sure. Yes, very good question. Absolutely. We’re still kind of evaluating, bettering our arms around the European business. But to answer your question, yes, we’re seeing or we’re estimating around an increase of 20% in the OpEx lines, and obviously, it’s going to depend as well as it relates to the marketing investment that we also have on the European business side. But yes, I would think 20% to 25% would be something reasonable. Perfect. Okay. That’s it from me. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed. Good morning, everyone. Can you speak more about what drove the addition of Walmart? How the initial rollout will go? And what could the revenue potential be with Walmart? I know it’s early, but even if just order of magnitude, your thinking around that? Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Great question. I mean, just as an example, I just want to -- just - I think it’s easy - I think it’s also good to talk about the mass channel MULO data as well, and we kind of did mention that we’re seeing over 100% growth in the MULO channel.
And also - I think it’s important to also point about what happened and transpired at Target, where we initially launched in Target in late 2018 with 2 flavors and a limited number of stores and continue that evolution for further expansion. Through every reset, we were able to add additional stores as well as additional flavors to now we’re chain-wide with 5 flavors.
So I think you’re going to see that same momentum in Walmart. The Walmart, those 1,500 stores, half of those stores are currently serviced by key DSD partners in given markets, the other half is going direct through the warehouse until we build out the DMAs, we’ll be flipping those over to DSD.
Where the DSD partners really serviced Walmart first before the warehouse clubs, we’re able to get that through their supply chain going direct to Walmart, but the initial feedback has been extremely positive, where we have landed within Walmart. And there’s already talks about adding additional flavors at the next reset.
So we think Walmart is going to be a massive opportunity. Right now just like in Target, we’re starting off on the dry shelf in the energy set, but there is so much more additional opportunities to further expand and also leverage some of their federal, state locations as well through Murphy’s Oil and so forth.
So we see this as a massive opportunity. It’s growing with the account, it’s managing your key accounts and leveraging the Celsius portfolio within those with multiple points of disruption and educating consumers over there as well.
So I have always talked about all creatures of habit and it takes time to activate these key accounts. We’re in the process of doing it. And on walmart.com, we’ve been doing extremely well as well. We’ve been targeting and leveraging a lot of the Walmart pickups, their at-home deliveries and really integrating into the account as we do with all of our key accounts.
So we see massive opportunity. To provide you a specific number, not in a position to do that today. But I will say the opportunity is extremely promising, and the initial momentum has been overwhelmingly positive. Okay. Great to hear. And then could you speak more about the drivers of your strong international growth and give us a little more color on how the Func integration is going? And any synergies you’re seeing there? Yes, the international growth has really been driving this year, really driving from that Nordic revenue with our now acquired Func Food Group partner, and they actually are on track to exceed a 10% market share in Sweden within the energy category. They’re building considerable momentum with some of their new innovative flavors, that they have had excellent in-store execution and really leveraging our model that we’ve talked about over the years, it’s activating consumers online through - and also leveraging them offline through an experiential marketing activity. That has been very successful on the ground and integrating everything into a 360 approach driving back to retail. So that’s been extremely successful.
In Finland, they further expanded in SOK and also the other key retailers there. We saw further expansion in 2019 in Norway through 7-Eleven. The test was very successful. They rolled this out to all the 7-Elevens within the country. And we’re also in the number two - gaining authorization right now in the number two petrol retailer in country.
So things are going very well, very well much embedded in health and wellness in gyms and health clubs and making further expansion into mainstream retail. Some of the synergies we already have implemented is cross - really cross-functional teams, leveraging key insights and leveraging best practices through our cross-functional teams on sales and marketing initiatives to really leverage that.
And there has been some synergies. Also, we’ve seen some synergies within the G&A side. We’ve already started to implement cost-saving initiatives as well through improving logistics, also cost of goods. We saw savings in insurance and audit cost and IT.
So we’re really looking at all aspects of this as we continue to go through to really drive the best ROI and the best benefit from this acquisition. In addition, you’re also seeing just much opportunity for us for that platform for European growth, but we’re already talking to some new market partners and new distributors in given market where we’ll be able to leverage throughout 2020 and beyond. Okay, great. And then if I could just squeeze 1 more in. Any new planned key marketing initiatives you can touch on for 2020? We have a variety of key marketing initiatives planned. We just re-launched, really bringing back and continuation of the Live Fit Tour we launched in 2019 with great success, we’re going to continue that journey with the Live Fit Tour, bringing that to key markets around the country and leveraging that online, offline experience in motion and connecting with consumers on an emotional level.
Also some key initiatives has been with our tropical flamingo flavor launch in the Nordics, that was a great success as well. And you’re also going to continue to see a lot of social digital activation, influencer marketing, really driving our community and further broadening our reach. Thanks and best of luck for 2020. Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Anthony. Good morning. So just - I hate to ask this question, but I guess, it’s sort of on the top of mind of everyone. So COVID-19, in terms of your production, is there any concern about that going forward? And then in terms of sales, what’s the best way you can categorize as we speak now anyway, what you see as the potential impact, if any, right now? Yes. Excellent. Anthony, we’ve been watching coronavirus for - since December when it first was initially spotted in Wuhan, due to our team on the ground that’s based out at Hong Kong, our partner, Qifeng with employees all through Mainland China. We’ve been keeping a close eye on it going back to December, and pre really the Chinese New Year.
And it’s something that, internally, we have been really planning for working closely with our suppliers all around the world. And we had increased inventories, increased raw materials. We looked at we - what we do very frequently is really analyze our supply chain, making sure we’re driving efficiencies, number one, but also making sure we have backup suppliers.
So we feel very confident in the position where we currently are. All our suppliers have indicated there will not be any supply disruptions momentarily as the current position is. Obviously, things are changing rapidly. So we’re keeping an eye on it. But we - at this point, we do not have any concerns. We are keeping inventories up and our raw materials up and feel we’re in a good position to weather a storm over the next several months, if needed, and working closely with all suppliers.
In regards to the sales impact, that’s a little bit unknown at this point in our - as we sit here and look ahead. Because the momentum we have experienced in Q1, we have not seen any slowdown and momentum has continued in a very solid fashion as we entered 2020.
So we’re still seeing same-store sales increase. We’re seeing distribution expand and we’re set to have another record quarter for the company in Q1 2020. So we feel we’re well positioned. How that transpires into Q2 and beyond is unknown. We have had a lot of our conferences. And a lot of our marketing initiatives, where we market at trade conferences, as we all know, have been canceled, which has the potential to have ramifications. But at this point, we have not seen any impact in our business, but that’s not to say there will be an impact in the second quarter potentially. Okay. Now, that’s helpful, John. And then obviously, PepsiCo purchased Rockstar Energy for about $3.9 billion. How do you think that changes the competitive landscape for Celsius? Yes, it’s quite interesting. That’s been a rumor for some time now, as well as the rumor is that maybe Bang moves to the distribution network as a distribution partner. You’re hearing that in some of the trade magazines within the industry.
Quite frankly, it’s - we see it as a great opportunity. And we see it as a great opportunity for a number of reasons. On prior calls, I’ve talked about the partnership within a 24-Hour Fitness, where we actually have been authorized in the Pepsi coolers through that chain. Also, we see a lot of synergies and benefits, working with their independent Pepsi distributors who are in several. They are very interested in carrying Celsius.
So now that Pepsi has acquired Rockstar, this really allows us further opportunity for new distributors within the Pepsi system because Rockstar had an exclusive agreement that they could be the only energy drink. So we feel this is an opportunity. It’s going to open up more doors for us.
Also, in the event Bang does move over to the Pepsi bottlers or distribution system, that’s going to open up further distributors for us and opportunities through additional Anheuser-Busch distributors and many others. So we actually see this as a great benefit that we’re going to leverage over the next several months, and it’s a great opportunity for us. And then lastly, John, just on pricing, it seems that this category is able to continue to be able to garner premium pricing. Has that changed at all? Or is that still the case as you come out with new brand - new flavors, new versions of your product? And then sort of talk about the plan going forward in terms of brand extensions? Okay, excellent. In regards to pricing architecture, you’re absolutely right. There’s a great opportunity in the new age performance energy category for premiumization to develop. Celsius is that premium offering. When Bang and REIGN were initially locked back in August when Bang - when REIGN launched, they were doing significant buy 1 get 1 free, if you recall, with steep discounts.
Celsius maintained a - really a premium pricing. We did not discount at that same level and we saw existing stores - sales continue to grow. So that really shows you the price elasticity on the Celsius portfolio, really being able to build a premium position in the category.
So we are very excited about that being a premium player in the category. We think that - we feel that’s going to continue to grow. You are going to see value brands come into the category, mid-tier price brands, and you’re going to have premium players within the category that are driving the overall category growth. So we feel pricing remains strong, and there is additional opportunities to take pricing up in the future as well.
As for our plans on innovative flavors and really line expenses into adjacent categories, we have a cross-functional innovation team on a global platform. You will see additional really line extensions from us. We’re going to continue to leverage our BCAA Recovery offering. You’re also going to see a lot of innovative flavors coming from Celsius. We are on the forefront of connecting with consumers.
Our last several flavor launches has been spot on to exactly what the consumer wants and demands, and we have a variety of innovative flavors coming to market in 2020 and beyond, that will continue to drive that momentum into the category. And we’re very excited where we stand and the position. Thanks, John. Appreciate it. Excellent. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you. We now have a follow-up question from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed. Well, I’ve just a couple more I want to circle around with. Any commentary as far as placement growths and overall growth for the BCAA line out there? Thank you, Jeff. In relation to the Celsius branch-chained amino acid recovery line, it launched in the late really September 2019. We’re keeping it at this point in vitamin specialty. We’re keeping vitamin specialty special with this line. We’re building more brand awareness around the line before we bring it to mass retail.
We see massive opportunities right now with our core line as we continue to grow and scale with that. We will bring our lines to mainstream and to mass, but at the right time.
As you all know, this space is very competitive, especially in the energy category, and we want to make sure when we’re moving our products out, it has the right velocity and right brand awareness to be successful, making sure we already had generated trial and have brand awareness to truly leverage the power of retail. Got it. And then for the fourth quarter, the top line was very much higher than what we had, extremely strong. Is demand outstripping the seasonality or at least did it in the fourth quarter? Because it seems like historically, you’ve had more of a seasonality through Q3 and then probably secondary Q2? Yeah, it does seem, when you look at our sales 4 quarters, our quarter-over-quarter growth, we are building momentum. And historically the business is very seasonal. I think you - as we continue to grow, we will see that, but the brand is really gaining momentum. We’re seeing velocities continue to increase and new distribution coming on board.
And then also, you also have the European consolidated revenue impact as well. We had November and December, a fully consolidated revenue. If you just look at North America, we did have quarter-over-quarter growth, four consecutive quarters in North America. But it’s - and I think that’s going to continue as we move into 2020. We’re just seeing really solid momentum.
But the underlying business, it just does have the opportunity to be seasonal, although we’re currently not seeing that due to the growth of the brand and the brand momentum. Okay. And when you talk about the momentum, and previously mentioned that you’re set for a record Q1, you’re referring to Q1 year-over-year over Q1 2019 or related to Q4 of 2019 into Q1 of 2020? Yes, Q4 was the biggest - Q4 2019 was the largest quarter in company history, and we anticipate to have another largest quarter in company history in Q1 2020. I got it. That’s tremendous. Okay. Thanks for taking the follow up. You got it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Thank you, Sherry. Thank you, everyone. On behalf of the company, I’d like to thank everyone for their interest today. Our 2019 results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum. We are capitalizing on today’s global health and wellness trends and the changes taking place in today’s energy drink category.
Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We’re building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio and strategy in a rapidly growing market that consumers want.
Our mission at Celsius is to continue to grow Celsius and bring it to new customers profitably. I’m proud to our dedicated team, as without them, our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible. In addition, I thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Celsius, and have a great day. Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.","Celsius Holdings, Inc’s fourth quarter and full year 2019 Earnings call is being recorded . a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation . the call will open to your questions and instructions will be given .",0.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue with Hayden IR. Thank you, Mr. Donohue, you may begin. Thank you, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Edwin Negron, Chief Financial Officer.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. First, our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been impacted by COVID-19. And I want to thank all of our Celsius team members and partners for their dedication, efforts, and support. We are incredibly proud of our team who have maintained the integrity of our operations and performance. The macro environment during the first quarter of 2020 was unlike any other we have seen in recent history, challenging organizations to respond in new and creative ways to manage and grow their business.
At Celsius, we rose above the challenges and set another new sales record, with quarterly revenue of $28.2 million, an increase of 95% over last year. North America revenue was up 70% and Europe was up exponentially, due in part to our accretive acquisition of Func Food Group late in 2019 and Asia was up as well. Consumer demand in the beverage industry continues to trend toward the pursuit of healthier alternatives versus conventional beverages. Although consumer traffic and purchasing patterns have been severely disrupted, traditional shopping habits gave way to tremendous increases in online ordering, curbside pickup, pantry purchasing while consumers complied with the stay at home orders. To meet consumer demand, we secured additional distribution agreements with partners in our primary U.S. networks including Anheuser-Busch InBev, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Monster, MillerCoors distributors, which further expanded availability to new regions.
We are continuing our quest to build a national distribution network, which now includes more than 100 regional DSD or direct store delivery partners. Our DSD partners also provide us with additional routes to market for incremental points of growth. In addition, we transition Target and 7-Eleven from the wholesale network to our DSD partner Big Geyser, in New York metropolitan area and saw volumes more than doubled. Across the board, in the U.S. market, stores that we have transitioned to the DSD network saw an average 40% increase in sales volume on top of our 30% same-store sales growth rate. We are planning for more -- planning on more accounts transitioning to DSD partners and the DSD network throughout 2020 as we continue our pursuit of reaching more consumers at more points of distribution.
With the recent news of Bang Energy transitioning to the PepsiCo distribution network, this event has further opened up additional opportunities for Celsius to gain additional distribution partners as we continue to expand our -- to a national network. During the quarter, we launched nationwide availability of our product at more than 1500 store locations through Walmart, the country's largest retailer. Early data from the retail channel indicate strong reception by its consumers and we expect additional flavors to be added in the next reset. In addition, we implemented and launched within Walmart, about 50% split between DSD and going direct through their warehouse and further expect to transition over these existing Walmart's to the DSD network through the back half of 2020 as we gain additional coverage.
In addition at Target, one of our key retail partners, we expanded our product assortment to five flavors nationwide with the addition of great tasting Grapefruit Melon Green Tea. We introduced our newest flavor, refreshing and exotic Jackfruit, a tropical taste with a burst of sweetness and a tangy twist available in our new CELSIUS HEAT packaging. The standout packaging and label redesign, position the brand as highly credible and sets the stage for the next phase of growth. Its digital effects reinforces our branch structure and function claims, which are clinically proven and a clear differentiator among brands in the performance energy category while appealing to a broader audience.
Clearly, our momentum continues in the first quarter despite an extremely volatile and uncertain business environment brought to us by the COVID-19 virus. Our success in the first quarter was driven by several key factors that are unique to Celsius and give us a strong competitive advantage. We have an extremely strong brands, a diverse and growing network of retailers, distributors, and partners and a strong balance sheet that enables us to rise above challenges that many companies are facing amid the COVID pandemic.
As early as late December we began increasing product and raw material inventories in anticipation of resets with major retailers that were planned for the March and April timeframe. The strength of our balance sheet enabled us to continue to build inventories during the quarter despite the demand as the buyer situation unfolded, while other brands were impacted. We were very well positioned in the first quarter when the grocery, mass channel, and drug channel partners increased orders outside of their normal ordering patterns as shelves were emptied as a result of consumer pantry purchasing.
Our supply chains return to more normal levels with shelves adequately stocked, our throughput remained steady. And due to our decision around inventory management and a higher level of support, we were able to provide our retailers, distributors and partners. In addition, also being located in Hurricane Alley in South Florida, we were well positioned, we continue to see operation plans in place, making our transition to many of our workers who are now working from home very seamless.
Critical to our growth plans is our marketing strategy that creates meaningful and emotional connections with consumers. Up until the COVID virus pandemic, a significant component of our marketing strategy primarily consisted of live integrated programs that reached a critical mass of consumers at large gatherings. Our Live Fit Tour, for example, integrated fitness and competitive activities where we reached tens of thousands of new consumers in high energy settings.
With the stay at home orders, large gatherings of people at events came to a hard stop. And we were challenged to quickly pivot our marketing strategies and find innovative ways to get in front of consumers. As a small nimble organization, we quickly shifted our marketing resources from experiential [indiscernible] offline activation to online programs. That enable consumer connections and create a [indiscernible] experience. One example was in April, where we launched a SWEAT WITH CELSIUS, a virtual work out platform that is live streamed on our Instagram account. With the gyms and fitness centers closed across the country, we used Instagram platform to facilitate consumer connections through at home workouts. The program consisted of three weekly workouts hosted by well-known local fitness trainers located throughout the country.
The different workouts offer followers a chance to try new workouts, release stress and maintain a sense of normalcy, the workouts require minimal to no equipment and can be modified for all fitness levels. In addition to SWEAT WITH CELSIUS, we also partnered nationally with Barry's, a leader in the fitness space and it's AT HOME LIVE Instagram Series were Celsius is profiled as the official energy drink powering Barry's AT HOME streaming workouts. The partnership is helping communities come together and continue to LIVE FIT even outside of the gym.
We are also deploying more online campaigns to deliver 10s of millions of additional impressions too highly targeted audiences such as with our sponsorship of the energy aisle within Instacart, a leading home grocery delivery service. In addition, we are leveraging walmart.com, target.com, bodybuilding.com and Amazon as we continue to gain momentum. Most recently, we were able to get data from stake line, which tracks energy drink sales on Amazon in the United States.
And for the 13 weeks ending April 11, 2020 sales in dollars in the energy drink category within Amazon versus the same period a year ago indicated Celsius sales growth of 118.2% and it's share increased 2% within the category to 11.4, which further demonstrates the momentum we are building in the category with Celsius. Celsius was ranked the third largest brand in the category behind Monster and Red Bull.
While our highly talented marketing team quickly shifts our approach from offline to online, we fully expect to pivot just rapidly back to offline as gyms begin to reopen and consumer gatherings and events are given the green light. This may look slightly different than it did before the virus perhaps with more outdoor workouts and smaller gatherings, we were already planning and positioning for activation in the second half of 2020 when we are given the signal.
In Europe, we further integrated the Func Food Group in our operations and are seeing great benefits and see additional future synergistic opportunities. In addition, the team further improved their operational performance through improved focus and execution, which we are very pleased with. Celsius, it was reported was among the fastest growing energy drinks in the Sweden market during the first quarter, per Nielsen scan data. During the quarter, the team successfully launched a great tasting tropical flamingo flavor with great success, leveraging superior in-store execution and targeted experiential marketing programs, which drove strong performance for Celsius in the market, despite the impact of COVID.
Our first quarter was a strong start to the year. We remain focused on driving profitable growth by expanding and increasing our distribution networks, nurturing relationships with new and existing accounts and engaging consumers through a variety of creative mediums. We are very -- we are successfully growing in an industry that is rapidly changing and quickly adapting to changes in the broader market. While it's difficult to predict, what if any impact macroeconomic shocks will have on our business over the next few quarters, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our momentum over the long term and capitalize on the growing consumer demand for healthy functional beverages.
As we enter the second quarter, we are seeing growth in April orders and in North America, we have seen growth of approximately 38% over the prior year, which provides us further confidence on our ability to maintain our momentum in the category. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the uncertainties resulted from COVID outbreak may have unforeseen and unexpected impacts on the results of operations.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks, Edwin? Thank you, John. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 revenue was a record high, $28.2 million, an increase of $13.7 million or 95% compared to $14.5 million for the same period last year. The overall increase in revenues was due to increases in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
By geography, the 95% revenue increase was attributable to continued strong growth of 70% in North America, reflecting double-digit growth from both existing accounts and new distribution expansion including expansion at world-class retailers. Consequently, North American revenue delivered a record $19.4 million for the quarter or an $8 million increase when compared to the prior year quarter.
Revenue from the European markets was $8.5 million or an increase of $5.5 million compared to the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the full impact of consolidating the results of our European operations. Asian revenue totaled $268,000 compared to $53,000 in the year ago period. Asian results for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 are now comparable, both periods reflect the change in our China business model to a royalty and license fee arrangement effective January 1, 2019. Revenue from all other areas amounted to $57,000.
Gross profit increased by $7.3 million or [127%] to $13 million in the first quarter of 2020, up from $5.7 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margin for the first three months ended March 31, 2020 was 46.1%, which compares favorably to 39.5% for the 2019 quarter. The increase in gross profit margin and dollars reflect the impact of the consolidation of the European operations and the result of the increase in sales volumes across all geographies, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The increase in gross profit margin translated to an incremental $1.9 million of profitability in this quarter.
Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $7.5 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 108% from $3.6 million for the same quarter in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the impact of the consolidation of the operations of our Nordics partner, which was not reflected in the 2019 results. Consequently, marketing expenses increased $1.6 million or 132% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses reflect the increases related to the consolidation of the European operations. Specifically, employee cost increased $1.5 million or 114% from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter, and also reflect investments in human resources to properly service our markets.
Moreover, due to the increase in business volume, our support to distributors and investment in trade activities increased by $353,000 and our storage and distribution costs also increased by $486,000.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $4.2 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 62% compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operations of our Nordics partner. As such, administrative expenses reflected an increase of $1.1 million, which included an addition of $221,000 to our bad debt reserve in order to cover potential collectability risks associated with the COVID-19 situation. Employee costs for three months ended March 31, 2020 reflected an increase of $302,000 or 47%, not only related to the consolidation of our European business, but also reflecting investment in resources in order to properly support our higher business volume. All other increases for general and administrative expenses amounted to $232,000 when compared to the prior year quarter.
Below the operating profit line, total other expenses were $702,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which reflects an increase of $12.9 million when compared to the prior year results, which included a gain of $12.2 million related to the recognition of note receivable in connection with the change in our China business model at the beginning of 2019. Furthermore, the results for the 2020 quarter include amortization expenses of $310,000, total net interest expense of $273,000, foreign exchange losses of $78,000 and all other items amount to a net expense of $41,500. As a result of all this activity, the company had net income of $546,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted shares for the first quarter of 2020 compared to net income in the year ago quarter of [$11.7] million or $0.19 per diluted shares, which included the $12.2 million gain on the recognition of the note receivable. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 million compared to $878,000 for the first quarter of 2019.
We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
As of March 31, 2020 the company had cash of $19.1 million compared to $23.1 million as of December 31, 2019. The company also had working capital of $27.4 million as of March 31, 2020 compared to $24.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Cash used by operations during the three months ended March 31, 2020 totaled $3.8 million, reflecting an increase in working capital use mainly related to an increase in inventory of $5.5 million to support our business growth and as a precautionary measure to minimize any potential disruptions in the supply chain regarding the COVID-19 situation.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Bain with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question. Great, thank you. And congratulations on a great first quarter. I'm hoping you could opine further on the broader functional energy segment activity and potential repercussions for Celsius, you kind of touched on in the prepared remarks, but when we look at the moves by Pepsi such as acquiring Rockstar and becoming distributor for Bang, away from one of your partners Anheuser, all this seems to leave more and more holes for distributors in the segment.
I guess the question is, is segment activity potentially shifting distribution conversations to a larger, more acute deals in the wake of kind of the industry trend? Actually Dave, thank you for the question. When you look at it there is a lot of opportunity here, especially what transpired, most recently during the quarter and I touched on it briefly in the prepared remarks in regards to Bang providing that notification and moving out of an independent network, which comprised mostly Anheuser-Busch distributors to 100% Pepsi. So we're already seeing those transitions taking place right now in markets where Bang was self-distributing and we're hearing word over the next, really 60 days there'll be making the transition from the other distributors over to Pepsi. So there is a lot of disruption where there is disruption there is opportunity.
Switching networks has always been very disruptive for brands. So we are very eager to take advantage of the disruption in the marketplace. So there has been a lot of changes in the -- and out -- even within what's going on within brands when you look at what's taking place with Bang, but also with COVID-19, which has also affected a tremendous amount of channels, being one in the energy drink category the convenience channel, has been extremely effected with traffic and also fitness and foodservice.
So there is a lot of changes taking place right now. We feel we're in a good position, we're already up to 100 distributors and the ones we were talking with and had conversations ongoing and dialog, it was really a challenge because Bang had exclusivity in a lot of contracts that were in place with these distributors. But now that has opened we have discussions ongoing. We feel we're in a really good spot. Some of the distributors that are releasing Bang are very excited for the opportunity to work with Celsius. And we think we're like well positioned on the other side of this to capitalize on the health and wellness trends that are here today, not going away. Great. Now it sounds like it's opened up some things and you mentioned disruption as a competitor switches major distribution. Alternatively, do you think that Pepsi may add a little bit to be more promotional here with Bang? I think so. I think you're going to see a lot of activities and promotional activities happening in summer beverage season. We're already talking with many key retailers to be included in those programs and really the July August timeframe retailers want to get consumers back into store, they're looking for new innovation, they're looking for special pricing, promotions to drive traffic back into retail.
And we've been through this whole process with our repivoting our teams to work on online to partner with our retailers on online activation customer pickups, those type of things, we feel we built a really good relationships, to be included in some of those programs. As an example, we're working with CBS and Target right now, as well as 7-Eleven on some really big off shelf programs to drive additional awareness of Celsius and to take advantage of the opportunities on partnering with these retailers.
So you're going to see a lot of pricing opportunities and promotional activity once we head into summer beverage season, which it seems to be aligned with many retailers, but I think the category overall on pricing remains strong and we have a premium position in the category that is not going to change. We are driving a premium position as this category continues to grow and evolve that is better for you, functional performance energy category that every retailer in the country is looking to expand on. And Celsius is a major component of that category. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. So great read out, I will keep my questions to four, five. So can you talk about the spike in European volume specifically outside of the Nordics, where are you seeing that tremendous growth from? Sure. When you look at the European volume, you're seeing that the full quarter of revenue recognition, due to the --with the acquisition of the accretive nature. So we did see good revenue growth within the Nordics as I mentioned Sweden was one. Within Sweden, Celsius was one of the fastest growing energy drink brands in the -- during the quarter according to the Nielsen. The other markets, mainly where the sales are derived from is Norway and Finland. And keep in mind that market was very challenged during the quarter due to the lock downs that which took place. So really the growth was pretty much all driven by the Swedish market, the Swedish market has taken a different approach versus other markets and countries around the world. So that's why we're just finding much of the growth there. Got it. And could you talk about the introduction of the Peach Vibe limited edition, and besides online where is that being sold? Just announced our Peach Vibe, our newest flavor, bring excitement to many retailers. Just rolling out right now, we'll have it authorized in many retailers around the country over the next several months as planogram's get reset. Right now, it's available on Amazon and other retailers and soon to be to a fine retailer near you. Perfect, got it. And can you talk about the closing of Func? And any update as far as snacks and bars in North America? Yes, I think the acquisition has gone extremely well. We have a really good team over there, we've been working cross functionally within organization, sales -- and a lot of initiatives, a lot of collaboration. And there's further synergistic opportunities as we continue to scale. We're working on renegotiating contracts, warehouses, suppliers, a lot of good things, work from [indiscernible] and margin as well as we grow. We had looked at bringing over the fast protein bar line in North America. Due to the COVID situation we have delayed that some. We're currently still evaluating that and we'll have more to share with you in the quarters to come. Okay, got it. And then lastly, I think for you, Edwin, can you talk about the inventory and the inventory build? It looks like your comments were about $5.5 million in increase. So where does that lie and how does that relate to the number of counters you're using at least domestically? And is it specific to region or territory or product line? Yes, thank you. Very good question. Absolutely, yes. The increase of $5 million, $5.5 million and yes mainly here in the U.S. that translates, just to give you some perspective to about 130 days of inventory. And what we did is make sure that we increase our inventories, so that if there is any disruption in the supply chain that we were able to address it. So from that perspective, it was something that we plan for, strategic move, we wanted to make sure coming into the summer selling season that we had good levels of inventory and obviously not have any disruptions. So, yes, absolutely it was something that we did knowingly. And then obviously when you look at inventory levels, we have to look not only at the historic demand but also plan for the future demand as well. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question. You mentioned Walmart as roughly 50% DSD at this point, I believe. Can you give us more color on what you're seeing at that retailer? Maybe touch on converting to more DSD there, how that is expected to go? Then maybe give us a sense, latest sense of how your business is trending with Target and where you are with DSDs there? Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Jeff. We are working with every single one of our key retailers to flip them over and move them over from a wholesaler direct model over to the DSD partners. Just due to the velocity, we're seeing better in-stocks, better placements, better execution, Celsius is just turning at such a high rate we really need that additional touchpoints at retail. So at Walmart we have -- the stores are being serviced by DSD and we're seeing great results there.
We're seeing it in coolers, in addition to the dry shops and seeing good rotation in velocity. The other stores that are going through the warehouse. They're not serviced as well. We're seeing out of stocks and poor execution in retail, so we're supplementing that in certain markets with merchandisers. But what we are also doing is working on flipping those over to the DSD as we build out these territories. So we've been working very closely with the buyers and we feel confident in the back half of this year, we'll have more Walmart's really moved over to this preferred route to market.
And the same thing with Target right now. The Targets in the New York metropolitan market are serviced by Big Geyser. We're seeing great velocity there moving from warehouse over to DSD. And we are working with them diligently on flipping over key markets. We already have five markets identified where we have coverage. We're going to be flipping those over in the next few months as we rotate warehouses, and we're also working on other key markets, especially with the Bang news and our further progression on signing up distributors for a national DSD network. So also, we have a big program kicking off with them as I alluded to earlier with Jeff's question, in regards there is some big promotional activity that is planned in July with Target.
So that will drive additional volume, placements, execution and move -- allow us to move quicker over to the DSD model where we're seeing great momentum. Target's a great account for us, we're already up to five flavors and we're looking to be a big player in their energy drink category at Target. Okay, great. And then I know it's early, but any color you can give us on what you're seeing in some of the regions in the U.S. that are starting to reopen and then what are you anticipating in your businesses more as the country reopens? With everything going on, it's very uncertain as we talked about, it's hard to say what the future holds. With the current environment and some countries open and closed and you're seeing the gym channel come back. Starting to see some businesses reopening, restaurants in key markets, it's really hard to say in the current environment.
I will say, which we said publicly that orders in April were up 38%, but it's really a week by week situation many CPG companies and other companies are pulling estimates and forecasts. We don't provide guidance, but we do feel based on initial results in April, we are still maintaining good momentum. What the future holds is to be determined, but we do feel in the overall broader energy drink category, we're in a really good position with everything that's taking place in the macro environment for healthy better for you functional beverages and what's taking place in the energy category. Okay and then just one more follow-up if I could add to that. Any more color you can give us on how you're evolving marketing plans for the near term and how you are thinking about flexing as plans -- as plans for the U.S. to reopen. Yes, I mean we've really through the first quarter we really reengineered, a lot of our all the sales and marketing teams to realign them to current opportunities. That's one thing that's great about being a nimble organization. We repositioned our fitness team, and repositioned our foodservice team to help out retail during the pantry loading and they were further working on integration on online integrated programs with our key regional grocery stores, mass market merchants and vitamin specialty stores, which are still open as well.
So a lot of integration. It's going to be a lot of social media, e-commerce, I touched on the most recent data point we got, Celsius is the third largest brand on Amazon in the energy drink category that's amazing achievement for our team. It just shows you the momentum we have, we need to further leverage that and move into other segments as well, continue to drive momentum, but we're going to continue to provide emotional engagements with our consumers and continue to build out our fan base and our communities, which is so critical and key to our long-term success. And then, we'll continue to move to back into some online activation, as the markets permit being very cautious and safe through the process, but our goal is to help people live healthy better lifestyle and we want to be there to support them. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up a little bit John on the Amazon point you made number three in terms of energy drinks on Amazon. Can you talk about this quarter specifically whether you were -- you believe you were positively impacted due to COVID-19 for this -- for this quarter on your total online? And if you could just tell us what the growth was online or at Amazon for the quarter? Yes, our online -- thank you Anthony, the online business has over the years has been a very strong area of growth for Celsius even going back the last five years, six years, if you look at the overall internal online business that we've been able to generate. Yes, there were spikes in our online sales as really shopping pattern shifts, but it was, it was great to see that the tide lifted with Celsius at the same velocity rates as some of the other. And we outpaced the growth in many other brands including Monster and Red Bull.
So the growth has been strong what was great to see lot of brands also we're seeing some products are an impulse buy. What we've been able to see with really the fitness channel closing, convenience and foodservice we saw a lot of volume transition over to other channels and Celsius is part of a daily routine. I think that's very critical for the opportunity we have here. We're not just an impulse buy, we're part of a daily lifestyle. That's what we've been building over the last several years, that's what we are continuing to build and that shows you the opportunity we have. Okay. Then just one last follow-up on the COVID-19. I mean, obviously there has been some positive benefits that you've seen from that. Can you talk a little bit about the, just the positives and negatives and if your prepared, in terms of down the road, any supply chain interruption, what sort of contingency plans do you have, if you the supply chain gets constrained at some point? I mean positive, I don't think there's really many positives, this is terrible situation we're all in that we need to help everyone, it's heartbreaking what's going on with small businesses -- taking place I think communities. We pivoted and pivoted as quickly as we can, we have samplings and demos that we were doing that we weren't able to do so we pivoted and supported to hear us around the country where Celsius as given out thousands of cases to over 450 hospitals around the country. We pivoted to help consumers and to help small businesses, trainers personal trainers to give them a platform to hopefully they can build and scale their consumer base and their client base with our SWEAT WITH CELSIUS campaigns and repositioned our sales organizations.
As Edward mentioned on inventory, starting in January, we really has set contingency plans up in each department going from accounting, to operations, to sales, to marketing, and constantly reviewing those and altering those as we're going through this process.
So contingency plans in place. We've implemented we've increased inventories throughout the whole quarter. We've also placed blanket purchase orders for further out periods than we've ever had before, to make sure we have a sufficient supply. We expanded the co-packer networks. So we have availability at multiple co-packers in case there is a situation where our co-packer had to go down for several weeks, which we've heard stories about those.
There's just been a lot that the company has done in the organization as we continue to pivot and shift through the current environment. But I do think the company and the employees have reacted really well and been very nimble. Has it been stressful for many? Absolutely. Transitioning many to work from home, it went seamlessly, but it has been difficult, it's not as seamless as working as a cohesive organization as we've done. But in this -- considering the circumstances and the results the team has been able to put up, they've done an amazing job. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of David Bain with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks. If I could just quickly shift back to the distributor relationships and industry dynamics. It just seems like if -- it seems like the options for these distributors are becoming more limited finding a functional energy category company with [indiscernible] growth anywhere near like a Celsius. Just looking at the historical partnerships, though, we found that a lot of them a lot of the distributors would look to take a position in the company itself. Just any kind of thoughts on these types of partnership structures and then also any considerations on aligning more with one major player versus more bifurcated or fragmented distribution structure? Thank you, Dave. There is a lot of relationships out there. We're working on a variety of them we're going to do what's best for our shareholders and best for the organization, investor, the company, for Celsius to drive to Number 1. That's our goal. We're reviewing a variety of opportunities, we're looking at distributors making sure we are with and aligned with the best distributor possible for that market to drive the best velocity and opportunity. So not going to get into specifics on contract negotiations with given distributors, but we are very much aligned with shareholders interest going to do what's best to put Celsius in the best position possible as we continue to maximize the opportunity we have at hand. Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Boyd with Next Mark Capital. Please proceed with your question. Real quick, if you can just help us a little bit, and forgive me if this is a fairly a naive question, but what percentage of your sales are from bricks and mortar retail versus online right now? We -- historically we used to disclose that information, to be quite honest with you, it's a little fragmented because many of our retail partners are all offering online services. So we've expanded when you look at online we're on walmart.com, we are on Amazon.com, we are on bodybuilding.com, vitaminshoppe.com. There is -- there is many, many.com business is out there. We have a team dedicated to leveraging our retail partners through at pickup services, we're leveraging Instacart, there is so many different mediums now to drive online purchases and home delivery. I don't want to take out one customer, if you're calling online Amazon or Walmart.com, we do not sell direct, we partner with our retail partners on our online business. So there online businesses is our online business. So specifically, I can't really answer that question, because it is -- it is a broader component. Okay. I hear you on that. Let me let me go to the heart of this, not as in thinking about the impact of you flipping over to the DFDs, maybe another way to come at it would be, what percentage of your retail doors are currently serviced by DSDs? You've talked about the number in the past. And then the number today I think you've [indiscernible] over 100, but if you can help us just sort of how far are we on this shift right now and how quickly would that change, say over the next 12 to 24 months? Yes, I mean, right now we're at, at the end of the year, we announced roughly approximately 65,000 locations in North America. And today, less than 10% of those doors are serviced by DSD. So the opportunity is massive, the key is all about covering this particular DMAs of the warehouses that are serviced by these key accounts and that's what we've been integrating and working on. And many of these retailers will be flipping over in the back half of this year to this preferred method. But I would say approximately right now you're probably looking at about 10% with DSD coverage. Okay, very helpful. And that 40% lift that you commented on with the stores in New York, has that been consistent across other geographic markets? It has. Actually in certain areas it's been even higher. So probably the 40% lift versus going direct to these key accounts seems like a good benchmark on top of the 30% growth rate we've been seeing in existing accounts. So there is a great opportunity by having the DSD coverage because you're getting that sales person in the store on a frequent rotation to make sure the product in stock is properly priced and is available and taking advantage of additional points of disruption and a given outlet and it's all about placements and trade activation. Really good to hear. Last one from me. Your comment about April orders up 38% year-over-year. Given that we're now an environment where we're starting to see additional states with reopening plans and we understand it's going to be gradual, but as we move forward here, is it fair to assume that is a low mark for the month. I know that's just the first month, but would you -- is it fair to assume we continue, we see those monthly sales growing from here? Yes, I'm not going to talk about future on what I don't know, I mean there's a lot of questions there. How quickly this traffic return to normal in some of these channels. So I can't really comment on that. There are no further questions in the queue, I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company we like to thank everyone for their continued interest. Our results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum as we are capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends. We are building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio and strategy and a rapidly growing market that consumers want.
Our mission is to get Celsius to more consumers profitably. I'm very proud of our dedicated team, as without them our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible.
In addition, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. We wish everyone well. Please stay safe in this current environment. Thank you for your interest and have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.","Celsius Holdings, Inc. first quarter 2020 earnings conference call is being recorded . a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation . the call will open to your questions and instructions will be given at that time .",1.0

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and undoubtedly posed challenges to all of our stakeholders. While the path forward remains uncertain, we remain encouraged by our momentum and the dedication and perseverance of our employees, partners and customers. These extraordinary times present challenges to all of us. And our condolences go out to all those who have been affected by this pandemic.
The health and safety of our employees, customers, consumers and partners remain our top priority, and we continue to monitor the environment and implement contingency plans to mitigate risks through our business.
Despite these disruptions, our second quarter performance again demonstrates the momentum we are building in the marketplace and the efforts from our team to reach more consumers through wider distribution, improve margins through cost and operational improvements and increase our brand recognition globally. We set another record quarter with over $30 million in revenue, an increase of 86% over the second quarter of last year, and delivered another quarter of profitable growth of approximately $1.6 million in GAAP net income.
Consumer demand for our functional beverages remained strong. And the most recent reported United States SPINS data for the 52 weeks ending July 12, 2020, confirms that we have significantly outpaced the category across multiple channels, which includes a 46.5% growth in the convenience channel, outpacing the category growth rate by 11.6x. And in MULO, our growth is at over 99%.
In addition, in accordance, the Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States for the 13 weeks ended April 11, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy drink category by Amazon, including energy shots, grew 80.8% versus the same period a year ago. And sales -- Celsius sales increased 118% and our share increased to 11.4% of the category, which puts Celsius as the third largest energy drink brand on Amazon just behind Monster Energy at 34.8% share at an 88.8% growth and Red Bull share at 14.9%, growing at 86.7% growth.
As we entered the second quarter, traffic and purchasing patterns were severely disrupted. And online ordering patterns, pantry purchasing and curbside pickup became more prevalent in response to the stay-at-home orders and consumer lifestyle shifts. During the second quarter, we began to see impacts in several of our distribution channels, mainly in our health club specialty vending and food service channels.
Our health club vitamin specialty channels, which historically represented approximately 20% to 25% of our United States revenue, were predominantly shut down during the quarter.
We have always believed that we have a different consumer base, not just an expanded age bracket and not just a 50% female demographic, but that our consumers are reoccurring regularly consuming Celsius as part of a daily lifestyle. With these 2 channels shut down, our consumers shifted their purchasing patterns of Celsius to other channels: to online and grocery, where we see the largest incremental increases, which not only replace the sales in these channels, but also showed record growth, further reinforcing the opportunity we have at Celsius. Celsius is more than just an impulse purchase. We are part of a daily lifestyle aligned for today's health-minded consumer.
During the quarter, we made significant progress on further building out our distribution network as our pursuit for a national network to service our key accounts. We secured additional distribution partners with Anheuser-Busch InBev, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Molson/MillerCoors independent network partners, which further expanded our availability of products to new regions.
Our national distribution network now includes more than 135 regional direct store delivery partners, up from just over 100 direct store delivery partners when we last spoke to you in May. And we have plans for several additional partners in the second half of 2020, where we will have the majority of major metropolitan markets covered by the DSD model in the United States.
In addition, during the quarter, we further transitioned over targeting 7-Eleven locations from the wholesaler direct route-to-market to our DSD partner, Big Geyser in the New York metropolitan market, where we saw volumes more than double in these key accounts. We plan to transition over additional regions to our DSD network throughout the remainder of the back half of this year and into 2021, which will even take Celsius to more points distribution and more than double our organic growth rate in these top accounts.
We also launched our newest flavor, Peach Vibe, a refreshing exotic summer flavor, which was very well received. Upon launch, Peach Vibe was ranked as the #1 new release in the energy drink category on Amazon. And we anticipate that this new flavor will be a meaningful addition to our portfolio as customers and consumers and retailer planogram resets take place in the back half of this year and into 2021.
In the retail space, our U.S. door count now exceeds 75,000 locations nationally, which is up by more than 10,000 since the end of 2018. We expect this number to grow even further in the second half of 2020 as retailers execute planogram resets, which were delayed in the first half of this year.
From an operational perspective, we continue to refine our contingency plans around production and remain nimble with our sales and marketing initiatives as COVID situation continues to unfold. Our teams are prepared to pivot and adapt quickly to capitalize on opportunities as consumer shopping patterns and behaviors flex with the changes in the environment. Most importantly, we have a culture that embraces flexibility in the midst of uncertainty.
In Europe, we continue to capture incremental benefits and synergies from the full integration of Funk Food Group, a Nordic wellness company, into our operations. This business was immediately accretive to earnings and is an important step in our strategy to build a global dynamic brand.
As in the United States, our Europe operations were impacted by COVID and saw -- mainly saw decreases in the FAST protein snack portfolio as consumer shopping patterns and habits changed to comfort foods. This trend started to take place in the beginning of the second quarter. And towards the end of the second quarter, we started to see changes going back and seeing growth in the category. We expect the category to fully rebound in the back half of this year and into 2021. These decreases were partially offset by increases in sales of Celsius in the region, where we continue to see great opportunities and momentum.
As with Europe and the United States, China and APAC were impacted as well where the COVID-19 recovery continues, where we are seeing and regaining momentum over the summer. In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market where our distributor covers over 76 cities and now has over 60,000 points of distribution as of the end of the second quarter. And in Malaysia, where we maintain a direct relationship with a local distributor, we maintain approximately about 2,000 7-Elevens with plans to reenter the gym, vitamin specialty channels and other retailers as the recovery continues throughout the summer.
As with Europe and the United States, we see great opportunity to capitalize on the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings and we see tremendous opportunities and enormous -- in the enormous market of Asia.
On the marketing front, we continue to prioritize with meaningful and emotional connections through robust marketing programs that drive wide, integrated programs and competitive activities, even while consumers are at home. On social media, we now have more than 100,000 Instagram followers who actively engage by sharing home workouts and videos that feature our products.
In addition, with gyms closed, we created a SWEAT WITH CELSIUS live workout program, which takes place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and I encourage all of you to attend. We are partnering with local certified trainers to provide a variety of workouts for every fitness level, which allows us to further connect with our community in a meaningful way.
In addition, we pivoted our planned sampling programs during the quarter to target first responder locations during the quarter, where we handed out and dropped off thousands of cases of Celsius to over 550 hospitals and first responder locations, supporting the front lines through this pandemic.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth by expanding and increasing our distribution networks, nurturing relationships with new and existing accounts and engaging consumers through a variety of creative mediums. In an industry that is rapidly changing, we are growing exponentially and adapting quickly to grab market share. The momentum we are creating reinforces our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability prospects of our business.
Heading into the third quarter of 2020, we remain optimistic and are seeing sales orders through July in the United States exceeding over a 50% growth rate versus prior year.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, revenue was a record high $30 million, an increase of $13.9 million or 86% compared to $16.1 million for the same period last year. The overall increase in revenues was due to increases in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
By geography, the 86% revenue increase was attributable to continued strong growth of 44% in North America related to double-digit growth from both existing accounts and new distribution, including expansion at world-class retailers. Consequently, North American revenue delivered a record $20.8 million for the quarter, a $6.4 million increase when compared to the prior year quarter.
Revenue from the European markets was $8.8 million or an increase of $7.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the full impact of consolidating the results of our European operations. Asian revenue totaled $326,000 compared to $381,000 in the year-ago period. The modest decline in Asia was primarily a result of currency fluctuations and the impact of the current health crisis. Revenue from all other areas amounted to $107,000, which doubled compared to the quarter a year ago.
Gross profit increased by $6.1 million or 88% to $13 million in the second quarter of 2020, up from $6.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin for the first 3 months ended June 30, 2020, was 43.3%, which compares favorably to 42.6% for the 2019 quarter. The increase in gross profit margin and dollars reflects the impact of the consolidation of the European operations and the result of the increase in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing. The increase in gross profit margin translated to an incremental profitability of $210,000 in this quarter.
Selling and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, were $7.8 million, an increase of $2.2 million or 39% from $5.6 million for the same quarter in 2019. The increase is mainly due to the impact of the consolidation of the operations of our Nordics partner, which was not reflected in the 2019 results. Consequently, marketing expenses increased by $930,000 or 40% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses reflected the increases related to the consolidation of the European operations and currency fluctuations.
Specifically, employee costs increased $1.2 million or 80% from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter and also reflect investments in human resources to properly service our markets. In addition, our support to distributors, investment in trade activity and storage and distribution costs increased by $185,000 mainly related to the increase in business volume year-over-year.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, were $3.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 50% compared to $2.4 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operations of our Nordics partner and currency fluctuations.
As such, administrative expenses were $1 million, an increase of $404,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Employee costs for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, increased by $442,000 or 66% not only related to the consolidation of our European business, but also reflecting investment in resources to support our higher business volume. All other increases for general and administrative expenses amounted to $280,000 when compared to the prior year quarter.
Below the operating profit line, total other income was $67,000 for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, compared to total other expenses of $345,000 for the same period in 2019. The delta between the 2 periods of $412,000 was a result of a favorable impact from realized foreign currency transactions of $187,000, a gain on lease cancellations of $152,000, lower net interest expense of $31,000 and a favorable impact of currency fluctuations regarding the investment repayment from China of $342,000.
These favorable impacts were partially offset mainly by higher amortization of intangibles and financial instruments of $310,000. As a result of this activity, the company had net income of $1.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $1.5 million or a loss of $0.03 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $15,000 for the second quarter of 2019. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to our year-to-date results. For the first 6 months of 2020, revenues increased by a solid 90% to $58.2 million, up from $30.6 million for the 6 months of 2019. The increase was the result of a strong year-over-year growth in North American sales of 56%, which similar to the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in existing accounts and distribution expansion. In Europe, the revenue increase of over 300%, largely reflects the full financial impact of the consolidation of the results of operations of our European distribution partner.
Revenues in the Asian markets for the first 6 months of 2020 increased 37% to $594,000. This increase was driven by higher sales volume in the first 3 months, which was partially eroded by foreign currency fluctuations and weaker market conditions as a result of the current global health crisis.
Gross profit increased by $13.4 million or 106% to $26 million for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to $12.6 million for the first 6 months of 2019. Gross profit margin increased by 360 basis points to 44.7% for the 6 months of 2020 compared to 41.1% in the year-ago period. This increase delivered incremental profitability of $2.1 million.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by 67% to $15.4 million for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to $9.2 million for the first 6 months of 2019. The increase is mainly due to the consolidation of the operating results of Funk Food. The increase also reflects higher marketing expenses, employee costs and other commercial expenses to support our distributors in light of the higher sales volumes compared to the year-ago period.
General and administrative expenses for the first 6 months of 2020 were $7.9 million, an increase of 55% compared to $5.1 million for the year-ago period. The increase reflects the consolidation of Funk Food operations, which were not present in the 2019 results as well as additional resources in order to have the proper infrastructure for business growth.
Additionally, administrative expenses included an additional $221,000 related to an increase to our bad debt reserve to cover potential collectibility risk associated with the current health crisis.
Below the operating line, the total other expenses were $635,000 for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to total other income of $11.8 million in the prior year period. The prior year results included $12.1 million in other income for the recognition of the note receivable from our China distributor that was signed at the beginning of 2019.
Based on the aforementioned activity, net income for the first 6 months of 2020 was $2.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to $10.2 million or $0.18 per share for the first 6 months of 2019. Net income for the 2019 6-month period included the nonrecurring gain of $12.1 million related to the note receivable from our China licensee.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2020 was $5.4 million, which compares to $863,000 in the year-ago period. As of June 30, 2020, the company had cash of $20.1 million compared to $23.1 million as of December 31, 2019. The company also had working capital of $31.8 million as of June 30, 2020, compared to $24.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Cash used by operations during the 6 months ended June 30, 2020, totaled $4.3 million, reflecting an increase in working capital mainly related to higher inventory values, prepayments as well as deposits and an increase in accounts receivables due to higher sales.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And currently, our first question will come from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Let me just first say congratulations on the strong results. John, maybe you can give us a little more color on how the process of adding DSD partners is going, since you're now over 130 partners at this point and maybe speak more about the retailers that are expected to flip over to DSD in second half, impacts on your business from that. And then kind of given the strong sales growth, how do you feel about inventory levels, production plans and position to deliver to meet that demand, considering the boost you typically experience from flipping over to major DSDs? Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. We appreciate it. The team has done a great job this quarter. It continues to execute extremely well. You are correct, we are about 135 DSD partners today. The transition of Bang from majority of Anheuser-Busch, independent distributors to Pepsi, has really opened up a lot of opportunity for us. So the team has been busy filling in the gaps in several key markets in the United States and the metropolitan areas, really cover the DMAs, so we're able to flip over those key accounts. So as it stands right now, with 135, we have about 70% of all the major metropolitan markets in the North America covered. We do have a few gaps that we're working to really close in the back half, really in Q3. But we really have come a long way since the beginning of the year. So really excited about that transition.
In the past, we talked about Target and flipping over to Big Geyser in New York, and that has gone really well as well as 7-Eleven in that market where we're currently working on CDS as well. We have been giving the green light in the third quarter, starting in the back half of this month into September, that we will be flipping over and changing the route to market with Target. So Target will be one of the first really key accounts that will be taking on more DSD distribution throughout the country. So a variety of key markets in the country will be serviced by DSD by -- through -- with Target. Also CDS, we're working with CDS extremely closely, doing the same thing. We anticipate a majority of CDSs will be converted over to DSD towards the back half of this year.
And Walmart is taking a little bit longer. So that will likely take place towards most likely around January 2021. So we have had a lot of -- everyone going through dealing with COVID in a lot of these key accounts. As we all know, a lot has been delayed. We were hoping that a lot of these key accounts would be migrated over in the second quarter. We disclosed that some of the delays we were seeing in the first quarter when we released earnings, but we're really optimistic. We're seeing great rotation in accounts that are serviced by DSD. And then the new partners that we brought on are extremely excited to get Celsius out into more points of distribution. So we're excited about that as well.
And we also saw the store count increase to 74,000 in United States, and that was really driven by a lot of small-format locations, regional accounts coming on through the help of our partners, our new partners in the DSD network.
As it relates to inventory, Jeff, we are -- we've increased inventories. We started to do that in Q1 due to the COVID pandemic. We wanted to make sure we have ample supply in case we have any difficulties with any of our co-packers who have been such great partners through this all and really supportive of the brand. We do have a new co-packer coming on board. Actually, we're running a test run next week in the Southeast. So we're really excited about that. That will give us additional ample supply and as we build out our distribution network.
So we feel confident that we'll be able to maintain demand -- meet demand with ample inventory and supply. We're working every day to get more efficient on that, get cost -- get cases to our customers and through our distributors at a lower cost. And the team has done a great job putting strategies in place to accomplish that. Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up to that. I know that you mentioned Peach Vibe being a success. Maybe you can just touch on some of the resets that are happening in second half with some of the retailers where you might be adding SKUs, flavors, getting more shelf space. And then if you could just touch on or update us on marketing plans, how those have evolved through second half? Yes. Excellent. Hopefully, everyone on the call has tried Peach Vibe. If you haven't, I encourage you to. It's been a great success. The team has done a great job really at a time of uncertainty and all the craziness. Our Peach Vibe launch was a great thing to bring to people, bringing positive vibes during the summer, much needed positive vibes. And the team did a great job through a variety of marketing activities to get that out there. We were the #1 newly launched or new release on Amazon for about 2 weeks, which was a great success. We saw a great rotation. We actually had to go back to production very quickly on that product. We overshot some of our forecasts initially. And a lot of our new distributors that are coming onboard, it was a perfect timing. All these new distributors coming onboard, bringing up something really exciting, new that added a possible vibe and it's cool. The team did a great job on the marketing with a variety of influencers and social engagement and activation.
And -- it's -- unfortunately, it was delayed with a lot of these resets. It was anticipated to be in more key accounts than it currently was in the summertime. We did feel it was time we moved forward with it due to our distributors, the number of distributors coming onboard and the plans for the summer launch. We did augment a lot of our marketing plans. The offline activation was augmented to online. But it was a great success. So hopefully, everyone gets to try it there. It will be listed. It is listed right now at CDS. So we did do a summer display program with CDS in about 2,800 stores. So right now, Peach Vibe is in a lot of locations at CDS. They took it in. In the back half of this year, you'll likely see it in a variety of Target locations and many other retailers as we head into the back half of these resets and into 2021. We think it's going to be a meaning contributor to revenues and another -- one of our great flavors that our innovation team has put together.
So staying on the forefront of labor innovation with an experiential offering has driven great success on behalf of the team. So they did a great job. Our next question comes from the line of David Bain with ROTH Capital. Great. I was hoping, first, maybe if you could speak to the promotional environment. I think [indiscernible] Red Bull up 10% in the second quarter, they did a similar watermelon flavor and a lot of promotions during COVID. It sounds like Monster may now resume some activities as well and expand with a watermelon product also. I mean, as competitors begin to ramp promotions and special items, is there a need to react differently? Or is this kind of ramp out of COVID pretty much as expected and no real need to adjust? Well, thank you, Dave. Appreciate the question. In regards to the category, the category has always been very competitive, with a lot of variety and different pricing architectures and promotional strategies. We indicated on our Q1 earnings call, we were going to run -- really heading post-COVID a lot of retailers wanted to see some integrated promotional programs really to entice consumers back into retail. We have participated in those. We were selected, as an example, in the month of July, we ran a BOGO program at 7-Eleven, which was great success, further increasing our penetration in the 7-Eleven chain, adding more additional SKUs on shelf. And we see a really great partnership further. However, the last 3 years has been great, but we see it further expanding with 7-Eleven.
So that was great. Also at Target, we have an [ NCAP ] program running. That was our first time really getting off that warm shelf in the energy aisle and with great placement, and we've run promotions there. Also at CDS, we've run some promotions on -- coming out of the COVID through this summer.
So I think the category has always been very promotional-driven, especially during the summer months, with beverage. What we have done is it's very important we continue this premiumization in the category. Celsius is the premium offering in the new performance energy category. So we won't be discounting down extensively. We're going to maintain our margins, but it's very important we continue to drive premiumization in the new category as it grows in scale. That's the opportunity we have. But you will see promotions -- targeted promotions to gain trial and gain awareness. Okay, great. And then just my second one, if I could. On the DSD, I know you gave a lot of good detail. I just want to make sure I understand. Maybe the easiest way for me, at least, would be on the last call, you gave us a penetration across your distribution. I think it was like 12%. And based on the color you provided, is there kind of a current maybe 3Q and 4Q contemplation of where that is and goes to? And as you deepen the certain DSD relationships, will the number of DSDs narrow to just the larger ones? And I mean, how do you strategically think about DSD partnership, that evolution generally? Yes. The partners we have now are in some of the top-tier distributors in the regions that we're operating in. So we're looking to build a really long-term relationship and partnership with our key DSD partners. So we're at 135. We'll probably -- we're going to be adding several more in the back half of this year to round out some of these markets. But we won't see really a contraction. It's really activating and partnering and working together to build Celsius and gaining more penetration. You absolutely do gain more penetration with our DSD partners, because that allows us to further expand into regional chains, small-format locations and also get that better execution in the trade and the higher velocity numbers. So those are some key points that we're really looking to accomplish on building out a national DSD network. And what we're seeing is extremely positive where we stand today. Great. And Perfect. Guys, could you -- is there a way to sort of capsulate the percentage penetration at this point? Yes. I mean, at the last earnings call, we said roughly about 10% and 12% of our stores currently being serviced by DSD. Over the last quarter, a lot of our partners did expand us into additional regional small format, and we did make progress on a -- on flipping over, transitioning some more accounts over in key markets. But we're probably still in the teens at this point. We really need a lot of the bigger retailers to help us as we go through the transitional phase with CDS, Target, Walmart, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven and several of our new customers that we have plans to come onboard in the back half of this year. So that will continue to grow. We anticipate that number to continue to grow over the next -- every quarter. Next, we have Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Great quarter on the top line. So congrats and a few questions from me. So you talk about the channels a little bit. I was listening to Rodney the other day talk about your Nielsen, like, [ 11.3 ] on the Amazon Direct and thinking about that as well as what's been going on with what they call gas and convenience as well as gym. So I assume that gyms are probably less than 1/4 of your revenue and have taken a lag. But could you talk about the gas and convenience a little bit as well as the online and kind of the trajectory that you had through the second quarter? Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Jeff. The channel mix has been quite interesting over the last quarter as we entered the second quarter and then throughout the second quarter. As we all know, gyms and vitamin specialty stores locations have been closed and reopened and closed back down. And in the gym channel, a lot of these gym chains have opened, but they're running at like 25% capacity, 50% capacity. So we had experienced a significant decrease in our fitness channel. We're very committed to fitness and working closely with our partners, also some of the news on 24 Hour and Gold's Gym as well. So that channel has impacted us, but it has been offset by the growth that we've seen in Amazon, mass grocery, where we're just seeing great rotation.
And it really goes back to what I said earlier about the opportunity we have here in the Celsius consumer. We're not just an impulse purchase. We're part of a daily active lifestyle. So you're drinking -- consumers that were drinking the product, which we hear a lot of times that were just a preworkout, we're more than just a preworkout. And it's -- obviously, that was shown in how the revenue has migrated over.
So when you look at gas and convenience, we have a limited exposure there. We are currently about 11% to 12% ACV. We're still growing at about a 50% growth rate, latest SPINS data coming out on that market with a -- right around 12%, 12.5% ACV. So a long runway ahead and just seeing great rotation in the accounts we're in. We closed additional Circle Ks in the quarter, several divisions there, which we're excited about. Seeing great rotation at QT, RaceTrac and of course, 7-Eleven has been great for us through the quarter.
So we feel it's going to come back. Obviously, we all know the traffic has been down through the quarter. You're starting to see more traffic come back. It's not where it was pre-COVID, but we feel that the trick that -- that the category is going to come back. It's going to come back in convenience [indiscernible]. And we want to make sure we're going to be a major player in that category as it continues to recover. That's great. And then secondly for me, could you just talk a little bit about your demographic and demographics as compared to your supposed competitors out there as far as picking up probably what I'd be more of the Gen X and Gen Y generation as opposed to Gen Z or boomers post-millennium? Can you talk about that a little bit for us? Yes, absolutely, absolutely. That's what's really unique about Celsius and the great opportunity we have and which Edwin and I and our team members here are really excited about the opportunity. It's -- we have a much broader consumer base than, say, a traditional energy drink consumer. The energy drink category, when you look at traditional energy, historically, that's been 18 to 24. Male has been really the target. The category continues to evolve. The category is aging up. The consumers that were drinking those traditional energy drink products are looking for better-for-you options. And as we all know, health and wellness is even more important today than it ever has been before. And Celsius born in fitness, vitamin specialty, we're all about encouraging people to live an active, healthy lifestyle and live fit with Celsius. So it's really resonating well with today's health-minded consumers.
So when you look at our demographics, we've always been about 50-50, male-female, which is unique in the category. And also, our age demographic has indexed up. We've aged up in the 45, 50 range actually in a lot of categories. And I think it has to do with the ingredients. We have green tea, guarana, ginger, biotin, chromium, a variety of 7 essential vitamins. And it tastes great. It’s light, airy and makes you feel really good as well and no crash.
So -- and we're also seeing the new consumers entering the energy drink category aren't grabbing for mom or dad's Red Bull or Monster. They're grabbing and they're looking for products that align with their active lifestyle. And one of your top picks has to be the premium offering and premium Celsius in the category. And we're seeing great rotation on that. We're seeing a lot more of Gen X and Z and millennials over-indexed in the category as well, drinking more of these products than the traditional energy drink consumers, say, 5, 6 years ago. So we're excited. And then lastly from me, can you talk a little bit about July versus June and kind of reopening of some of the economic sectors out there coupled with your traditional some restraints? Does it feel good where you're situated now into traditionally your strongest quarter versus how you came out of June in Q2? Yes. I think we came out considering, like you mentioned, 25% of our revenues, approximately 20% -- actually 28% of our revenues -- almost 30% historically have come from vitamin specialty, gyms and health clubs. So having that channel down as well as the momentum we are building in the on-premise, vending and micro market channel, which has been impacted, we're seeing good momentum. We saw good momentum in June, and we're seeing good momentum as we head into July. At this stage, that orders -- purchase orders in-house in North America, we're over 50% versus the prior year. So just looking at the quarter there, we entered and exited July with some pretty good momentum. And that doesn't even really include a lot of the new accounts that are planned to come onboard in the back half of this year. It really set us up for a really strong 2021. So I think we feel pretty good as an organization. We're working hard, and we want to take share in this category. [Operator Instructions] Next we have Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. John, I just wanted to talk about just a little more on the Amazon channel. You said you're third after Monster, Red Bull. Can you talk about the growth in the channel just related to Celsius versus last year at this time. What's the growth year-over-year? We've been growing very strong. Thank you, Anthony, number one, for -- appreciate your question. In regards to Amazon, and -- we've been seeing strong growth over the last several years on Amazon. We were in the high double-digit growth rates on the Amazon platform.
Most recently, I saw latest data from Rodney Sacks at Monster Energy on his earnings call. He had some of the latest Stackline data, which he disclosed, and the category is growing about an 88% growth rate. So that was over the last 4 weeks as of -- I think it was July 14 is cut-off. So strong growth in the category on Amazon. We are exceeding that growth rate. I think he reported us over a 200% growth rate, I believe. I'll have to double check that, but it was extremely high, 180% growth rate versus the 88%. So -- and we took -- we increased our share by 1 point. Red Bull did lose their 1 point share. So getting closer to #2 position, the potentially second largest energy drink on Amazon. But we've been doing very well, very well. That's where consumers are shopping now and at home deliveries. Their sales are up tremendously. So it's great that we're growing faster than the growth rate, which is key. That's great, John. And just in terms of the new accounts that are coming on in the second half is Celsius up for '21. How has COVID-19 changed -- it doesn't look like it's obviously impacting you, but how does it change your day-to-day practices for your team? And has -- what are some additional -- I know there are some additional expenses? But what type of sanitation expenses, can you talk a little bit about that? And has the sales practices changed a little bit? Yes. No, absolutely. I think everyone's world as an organization and everyone's world kind of turned upside down. The teams are working hard to continue to stay focused and execute and drive, maximize opportunities and stay nimble. It is a challenge for all of us. We live in -- we're operating in -- from South Florida. That's where our headquarters is based. So we do have contingency plans in place for -- most recently, we had a little bit of a scare with a hurricane coming at us. So it is something that we're always prepared to work remotely.
So we have our servers and [indiscernible] facilities. We do drills. So we have not really missed a beat, I feel. I think the product team has done a great job. It is difficult working with a lot of individuals remotely. So many of our team members are working remotely. We're taking extra precautions, cleaning, sanitizing, to your point. Also our teams on the sales side has not been able to really have those customer meetings. So right now, we're in the midst of 2021 or entering 2021 buyer season. This is the time to sell in additional expansion for 2021. And a lot of those meetings are happening now through different platforms, video conferencing. So you're missing those touch points.
Also many of our distributors, we're not really able to activate them as we originally planned with support and team blitzes. And we're doing the best we can and trying to be as precautious as I can as well. And then our marketing initiatives, obviously, had to pivot from offline, experiential marketing to online. So trying to get creative, think out of the box, and again, in front of consumers and continue to grow the brand and grow our consumer base and to stay flexible, which is key. Okay. Excellent. Excellent. Just maybe Edwin has the number. In the quarter that you're in, and do you expect that increased expenses for the COVID-19, cleaning, sanitation, sanitizing, whatever, do you expect that to continue in this quarter? And is it a material expense? Or right now, it's something that's you're doing, but it's not impacting the expense line that much? I'll let Edwin take that. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So yes, we are doing, obviously, those type of efforts. But to your point, it's not -- hasn't been material at this point. But we are obviously taking all the precautions and taking all the measures in terms of sanitation and safeguarding, as John mentioned, employees, consumers and so forth. So -- but not something that at this point is material. Yes. I'd just like to add, I think it's, Anthony, not really a cost -- a material cost to us. But it's a -- that cost is really an opportunity cost is really what's costing us as an organization because of the limited ability to execute and really activate our new distribution partners and the delays that we're seeing and a lot of these retailer resets. So it's more of an opportunity cost, which is the material component. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners. Congrats on the additional distribution agreements in the quarter. So first question from me is just around the new distribution agreements and kind of having them more as of your brand ambassador, if you will, especially with the retailers. So just kind of curious as to how it's going to help with your shelf placement? And then also how we can think about potentially being placed more at the fridges, at checkout as well to create more additional opportunities and kind of where you see opportunities for that going forward? Absolutely. That's the power of the DSD network. You nailed it on the head. We say kind of internally, faces sell cases, and when it's cold, it's sold. So that's -- we have a great product that fits both of those. That's where the DSD comes in. It's the power of the people, the power of the teams, activating them and getting more people out there selling Celsius. So we have a limited team and through these distributors, we're able to educate, excite, motivate and help us continue to build share and also help merchandise, which has been key. As you all know, there's a lot of going direct to retailers in this high turning category, causes a lot of challenges and complexities due to shelf presence, taking out some of the activity by other partners in the category at what happens on the street at retail. So the manpower is really the key, and that's where we see a great opportunity and benefit. All right. Great. And then just one more from me. Obviously, the category remains very competitive with players looking to innovate. You've come out with your own innovation as well. And there's particularly a lot of competition on the healthy beverages side that we've seen. So just curious to how you think about the competitive landscape, how it's evolving. Obviously, Celsius has been doing very well. So do you feel like it's more of a rising tide lifts all boats as you see these other competitors come out with product and the entire energy drink category kind of gains traction? Just curious to your thoughts on that. Yes. I mean, there's always been competition. Beverages fierce -- the barriers to entry are fairly low. The barriers to succeed are extremely high. And it's -- the competitive landscape continues to evolve. And that's important that the teams at Celsius stay on the forefront. We continue to build the brand, the brand equity, maintain our distribution. And this is something that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. That's beverages, especially energy. You're seeing that now in sparkling waters. You're also seeing it in spiked seltzers now. So -- but once you built a brand, a strong brand, you continue to attract more consumers, you can really take share in the category, and that's what we're focused on. I'll now turn the presentation back to our main presenter for his concluding remarks. Please go ahead, Mr. Fieldly. Thank you. Also like to thank Regan Ebert for her service as a Board of Director to the company. She has a great opportunity, and I wish her well on her new endeavors at Danone as a Senior Vice President role.
In addition, I would like to welcome Caroline Levy, who was recently appointed to our Board of Directors. She brings over 30 years of consumer industry experience and extensive network of industry and investor relationships. And we give her a warm welcome, and welcome to the team.
In addition, I would like to mention, on August 14, we will be participating in a virtual fireside chat hosted by Alliance Global Partners. If you would like to attend, please contact your Alliance Global Partners representative for additional details.
And then on behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum, and we are capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends. And the change is taking place in the transformation of the energy category. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. And we're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy and team and a large growing -- rapidly growing consumer base. Our mission is to get Celsius to more consumers profitably. And I'm very proud of our dedicated team, as without them, our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible.
In addition, I'd like to thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Celsius. Be safe, and have a great day. Thank you, sir. And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you once again. Have a great day.","the second quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic . the company filed Form 10-Q with the SEC and issued a press release today . this call may contain forward-looking statements, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties .",0.0

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue, Investor Relations for Celsius. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you and good morning everyone.

With that I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you. Cameron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter continued to see the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, materially impacting several channels of trade for Celsius including our health and fitness, vending and in foodservice as well as a reduction in food traffic in several other channels.
While we did begin to see an improvement in the third quarter with capacity restrictions and reopenings in our distribution channels, this remains significant, uncertain as there potentially could be reclosings with additional cases and increased in our regions of operation and extended closures in some states and countries.
The health and safety of our employees, customers, consumers and partners remains our top priority and we continue to monitor the environment and implement contingency plans to mitigate risk to our business.
In addition to the COVID disruptions in our retail channels, the entire beverage industry is now being impacted by an aluminum can shortage taking place in the United States. The impact is across the board with major bottlers recently announcing a material shortfall in cans for 2021 and many smaller brands are being turned away.
We have been in continual dialog with our suppliers, and while they remain certain to fulfill our base can needs for 2021, they indicated they do not expect to be able to fill our expected growth from our internal projections.
While this is a significant issue, we have also found a solution. Being an international company, we have been able to leverage our global relationships and strategic investors and will be securing additional cans needed -- as needed from Europe and Asia to support our growth.
While this is great news on all these incremental cans, we are able to source outside of the United States, we will see an increase in our cost of goods over the short-term period through 2021, which will impact our gross profit margins by a few points, but we remain confidence, the company will be at least at a run rate in the low 40s on a gross profit basis.
We are currently expecting 2021 as being impacted for the entire year until the new plants in United States get up and running, balancing supply and demand as we head into 2022. We will continue to explore additional opportunities as they become available to shorten the duration Celsius is impacted by this can shortage, but wanted to set an initial conservative expectation as a baseline.
I'm sure, I assure you our team is focused on continuing to improve operational performance and the team is focused on improving efficiencies as we continue to scale, and we will work to mitigate and offset this increase as much as operationally possible throughout 2021. With the only negatives for the quarter out of the way, I am extremely proud and excited with our team at Celsius and the accomplishments they've made during the quarter.
The third quarter results were at an all-time record for the company, including record revenue, gross profit, gross margins, operational income, net income, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Overall, revenue was up over 80% to approximately $36.8 million from $20.4 million in the year ago quarter.
Domestic revenues, we saw growth of 60% to $26.9 million, up from $16.8 million in the year ago quarter, which was driven by expansion in retail outlets, where we grew over 19,000 locations from the year ago period, expanded our distributions or DSD, and saw organic same-store sales growth. And we saw over 100% growth in our e-commerce channels during the quarter.
Our e-com revenue was driven by Amazon, where we saw an increase of over 111% to $5.6 million for the quarter, which represented about 22% of our domestic revenue. Initial revenue increased 172% to $10 million approximately from $3.7 million in the year ago quarter in which we saw our Nordic revenue increase 182% to $9.5 million, also a quarterly record since the acquisition and sequential growth of approximately 10% from the -- versus the second quarter.
Consumer demand for the CELSIUS brand has only grown stronger through 2021 and with the most recent reported United States SPINS data for the 52 weeks ending October 4, 2020, confirms that we have significantly outpaced the category across multiple channels, includes a 43.9% growth in the convenience channel outpacing the category by approximately 14.8 times with new store additions ramping up our ACV to approximately 16% and in the MULO channel, our growth rate is over approximately 100% with an ACV currently at 36.5%, outpacing the category growth by 7.4 times.
Additionally, third-party data reflects the same trends on Nielsen as reported all channels as of October 27, 2020, the CELSIUS sales were up over 61.3% for the four weeks ending with a 0.6% share. The next largest growth rate in the category was Red Bull with approximately growth rates of 20.2% for the most recent four week period.
According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales on Amazon in the United States for the four weeks ending October 17, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy drink category by Amazon including energy shots grew by over 157.5% versus the same period a year ago.
And CELSIUS sales increased outpacing the category by 190.3% and our share increased to 13.9% of the category, which puts CELSIUS as the third largest energy drink brand on Amazon just behind Monster Energy at a 31.2% share, which grew at 156% and Red Bull which is at a 15.8% share, which grew at 179% growth rate. Being the third largest brand on
Amazon demonstrates our opportunity and verifies Celsius [indiscernible] additional and much better placements as we continue to scale. Through the third quarter, traffic and purchasing patterns remained disrupted and online ordering patterns, pantry purchasing and curbside pickups became more prevalent in response to stay-at-home orders in particular markets and consumer shifting their lifestyles.
During the quarter we continue to see impacts in several of our distribution channels, mainly our health, club, vitamin specialty and vending channels. Our health club channel, specialty channel saw revenue decline by approximately 23% in the third quarter. This was historically represented approximately 20% to 25% of our United States revenues and this channel remains predominantly shutdown during the quarter.
We did begin to see some reopenings at a limited capacity during the quarter, but expect revenues from this channels to remain materially down in the fourth quarter. We do expect continued openings throughout 2021 and a rebound.
As I discussed, in the third in the second quarter earnings call, despite these two channels, essentially shutdown, our consumers shifted their purchasing patterns of CELSIUS to other channels, which did not only replace the sales in these channels, but drove record revenues and accelerated revenue growth of over 60% of third quarter in North America, further reinforcing the opportunity we have at CELSIUS. Our brand is more than just an impulse purchase.
We are part of daily lifestyle, aligned for today's health-minded consumer. The CELSIUS consumer bring significant value to retailers, not just as an expanded age bracket and a 50% female demographic, but our consumers are recurring regularly consuming CELSIUS as part of a daily lifestyle further expanding the channels and category growth.
During the quarter, we made significant process on further building out our DSD distribution networks on our pursuit for a national network to service our accounts. We secured additional distribution partners with Anheuser-Busch, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Molson MillerCoors network partners further expanding availability to new regions.
We further transition Target and 7-Eleven over to the wholesaler Big Geyser in New York during the third quarter and have already seen volumes more than double in those locations. The company initially announced last summer that we are building out our national DSD network, starting with our first major account DSD partner Big Geyser in New York City metropolitan market.
We have now built our network to over 147 regional direct store delivery partners and we have anticipate our DSD network now covers approximately 75% of major metropolitan markets in the United States. One of the initial challenges we did have building on our network, was really working with the retailers as you have to cover the retailer distribution and the stores in order to flip over those retailers to your distribution partners.
So, this is why the percentage of stores serviced by DSD is materially lower currently than our overall coverage, which is approximately 75% of metropolitan markets.
Now that we have grown overall coverage and completed all regional coverage on geographical areas, we have now seen in over a 100% increase in number of stores serviced by our DSD network from our Q2 earnings call, which includes our most recently announced target DSD conversion and the 2,700 Speedway store expansion we most recently announced.
The company anticipates that approximately 30% of doors will be currently covered by DSD distribution, which we will be adding additional stores and locations throughout the back half of Q4 and into 2021.
We anticipate that the accelerated transition will continue and include convenience as such, the recently announced Speedway launch drug and grocery over the next two to three years, we expect approximately 70% of our retail stores to be serviced by DSD distribution and the associated benefits of doubling revenues in those accounts as we continue to transition.
In our mass channel CELSIUS saw significant growth through our recently announced exclusive launch of Kiwi-Guava-Lime flavor of On-The-Go stick powders into over 2,700 Walmart locations. In addition to the Walmart launch of the new flavor, the company expanded our On-The-Go sticks into Publix over 1,200 locations with five flavors and expanded our flavor offerings throughout Europe -- Europa, who services the gym channel as well as Vitamin Shoppe and HEB in Texas.
We also expect to transition the remaining 50% of Walmart stores to DSD in the beginning of 2021. We transitioned as stated 1,200 Target stores to DSD through September and October with additional plans and regions to transition throughout the back half of 2020 and through 2021.
Target is a great case study for Celsius. As we have steadily grown our initial two SKUs and a 200 store test to national availability with five flavors serviced now by DSD, the company also participated in an end cap program which to support the transition in August and September, which was very successful.
In the convenience channel during the third quarter, we announced the expansion stated in Speedway to over 2,700 locations, which are now serviced by DSD and grew our ACV in the channel in the convenience channel in North America to approximately 16%. We also expanded and brought on Xtra Mart, Kum & Go and Union Pacific stores.
In the retail space our total US door count now exceeds 79,000 locations nationally, which is up for more than 19,000 locations or 32% growth from the 60,000 locations we announced in Q3 of 2019 on our earnings call. We expect the number to grow even further in the coming quarters as retailers execute planogram resets, which were delayed in the summer months this year.
In Europe, we continue to capture incremental benefits and synergies from full integration of Func Food, a Nordic wellness company into our operations. The business was immediately accretive to earnings and an important step in our strategy to build out a global dynamic brand.
As in the United States, our Europe operations were impacted by COVID and saw decreases in the FAST protein snack portfolio continued through the third quarter as consumers shifted habits to confectionery products, but we do see the protein category continuing to rebound in the fourth quarter and expected to continue to rebound into 2021. These decreases were more than offset by the sales increases of CELSIUS in the region, which we continue to see great opportunity and momentum.
Some of our operational highlights. In Sweden, we had a great successful launch of a new flavor great tasting strawberry marshmallow, which we launched in August and September, and we also kicked off in the back half of the third quarter a limited addition blueberry frost which is great tasting and was well received by consumers and retailers in the country.
In Finland we saw great, very strong campaign in Kesko, one of the country's leading hypermarkets where we saw over 65% growth versus the prior year quarter, and the team launched a great tasting indulgence bar in August, which has been very well received by the consumers.
As with Europe and the United States, China and APAC were impacted as well by COVID-19. Recovery continues and we saw momentums gained in the summer months. In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market where distributors cover approximately 76 cities and now cover approximately 60,000 points of distribution at the end of the third quarter.
And in Malaysia, we maintain a direct relationship with the local distributor. We maintain approximately 2,000 7-Eleven, with plans to reenter the fitness channel, specialty and gyms and additional retailers as the recovery continues.
As with Europe and the United States we see great opportunity to capitalize on the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings and we see tremendous opportunities in the enormous market of Asia.
On a marketing front, we continue to innovate Target new and existing consumers where they live, work and play to prioritize meaningful and emotional connections through robust marketing programs that drive live integrated programs, competitive activities, even while consumers are at home.
Specifically during the quarter, despite COVID-19 restrictions, we sponsored over 25 advance both in-person and virtual, sampled thousands of cans in-hands during the quarters in our key markets. We also [couraged] responders with thousands of donations to doctors, nurses, police, army, firefighters and also supported the California fires.
In addition, we started our Live Fit Tour in the Florida market, where we reached out and sampled and activated gyms and also created experiential outdoor activities throughout the quarter and have planned to further expand throughout Q4. In addition, we further leveraged our SWEAT WITH CELSIUS Instagram live workout programs and further leveraged our brand ambassadors and influencers where we connected meaningfully with more consumers.
In addition, we continue to partner with our core retailers and most recently we partnered in a college program where we have distributed over 100,000 On-The-Go sticks to college students through the Walmart back-to-school college program.
Our brand is resonating with an expanded consumer base, distribution platform and retail locations with the tailwinds and overall increased focus on health and wellness and specifically in the energy category where functional energy is recognized throughout the industry as the driver of future growth and shelf space with retailers.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in an industry that is rapidly changing. We are growing exponentially and adapting quickly, outpacing our competitors and grabbing market share. The momentum we are creating reinforces our confidence in the long-term growth and profitable aspects of our business, and we believe we are just getting started.
Heading into the fourth quarter of 2020, we remain excited and are seeing sales orders through October in the United States exceed over 50% growth rate versus the prior year.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. Starting with our third quarter results for the three months ended September 30, 2020 revenue was $36.8 million, a substantial increase of $16.4 million or 80.4% from $20.4 million for the same quarter of 2019.
The revenue increase of 80.4% was attributable to continued strong growth of 60.4% in North American revenues reflecting double-digit growth from existing accounts, new distribution and expanded presence in major retailers. European revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was $9.5 million, which translates to a robust increase of 182.3% from 2019 quarter revenue of $3.4 million.
The 2020 figures now reflect the full financial impact of the consolidation of Func Food Group, our European distribution partner whom we acquired in October 2019.
Asian revenues which basically consist of royalty income from our China licensee were essentially $275,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 40.8% from $195,000 in the 2019 quarter. Other international markets generated a $145,000 of revenue during the third quarter of 2020, an increase of basically $57,000 when compared to $88,000 for the same quarter in the prior year.
The total increase in revenues from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter was mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in pricing. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, gross profit increased by approximately $8.9 million or 103% to $17.5 million from $8.6 million for the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit margins for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were very healthy 46.7%, which compared favorably to 42.2% same quarter in 2019.
The increase in profit margins delivered an incremental $1.9 million of profitability this quarter. The increase in gross profit is mainly related to increases in sales volume from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were $8.3 million, an increase of basically $3.3 million or 68% from $4.9 million in the 2019 quarter. This increase reflects the impact of the full consolidation of the operating results of Func Foods. Thereby, resulting in an increase in our marketing investments of 88% or $1.7 million from the prior year quarter.
Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses give effect to the increases related to the consolidation of Func Food Group's operations. Specifically employee costs, which also includes investments in human resources to properly service our markets increased to $2.3 million or 71% from the prior year quarter.
Moreover, due to increase in business volume from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter, our support to distributors and investment in trade activities as well as our storage and distribution costs increased by $705,000 when compared to the prior year quarter.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were essentially $4.6 million. An increase of basically $2.4 million or 108% from $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the impact of the consolidation of Func Foods operations which were not present in the results for the 2019 quarter.
As such, administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 were $1.3 million, an increase of essentially $866,000 or 182%, from basically $476,000 for the prior year quarter. Employee costs for the three months ended September 30, 2020 reflected an increase of $360,000 or 63%.
Not only attributable to the consolidation of Func Food Group's operations, but also reflecting additional investment in resources to properly support our higher business volume. All other increases for general and administrative expenses from the 2019 quarter to the 2020 quarter were approximately $1.1 million.
These increases are mainly related to higher stock option expense of $1.2 million, additional depreciation and amortization of $15,000, which were partially offset by net decreases in all other administrative expenses amounting to $122,000.
Total net other income for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was basically $45,000, which compares favorably to other expenses of $543,000 for the same period in the prior year.
The 2020 quarter results reflect a total favorable impact of approximately $588,000, which includes $155,000 of lower amortization expenses, $143,000 gain related to foreign currency fluctuations, $408,000 gain on the note receivable from China and net other miscellaneous expenses of $63,000, which were partially offset by higher net interest expenses of $55,000.
As a result of the above, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 net income was $4.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $961,000 or dilutive earnings of $0.03 per share in the year ago quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.9 million compared to a loss of $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2019. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, the reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now turning to the year-to-date results. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue was essentially $95.1 million, an increase of $44.1 million or a significant increase of 86%, from $51 million for the same period in 2019. The revenue increase was attributable in large part to continued strong growth of 57% in North American revenues, reflecting double-digit growth in both existing accounts and new distribution as well as expanded presence in major retailers.
European revenue was $26.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 251% from $7.6 million in revenue for the 2019 period. The 2020 figures now reflect the full financial impact of the consolidation of Func Food Group. Asian revenues which basically consist of royalty income from our China licensee were $969,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
An increase of 38% from $629,000 for the 2019 period. Other international markets generated $309,000 of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of basically $150,000 from $160,000 for the same period in 2019. The total increase in revenue from the 2019 period to the 2020 period was mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 gross profit increased by approximately $22.3 million, or a robust 105% increase to $43.5 million from $21.2 million for the same period in 2019. Gross profit margins increased to 45.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 41.6% for the same period in 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars and gross profit margins is mainly related to increases in volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, were $23.6 million, an increase of effectively $9.5 million or 68% from $14.1 million for the same period in 2019. This increase reflects the impact of the consolidation of Func Food Group following its October 2019 acquisition by the company. As a result, our marketing investments increased by 77% or $4.2 million from the 2019 period.
Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses reflect the increases related to the consolidation of Func Food Group's operations. Specifically employee cost for the 2020 period, which also includes investments in human resources to properly service our markets increased by $3.6 million or 88% from the 2019 period.
Moreover, due to the increase in business volume, our support to distributors investment in trade activities as well as storage and distribution costs increased by $1.7 million from the 2019 period to the 2020 period.
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were essentially $12.5 million, an increase of $5.3 million or 72% from $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the impact of the consolidation of Func Foods operations which were not present in the results for the 2019 period.
As such, administrative expenses reflected an increase of $2.6 million which included an increase of $221,000 in our bad debt reserve to cover potential collectability risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Employee costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 reflect an increase of $1.1 million or 59%, not only attributable to Func Foods operations, but also related to additional investments in resources in order to properly support our higher business volume.
All other increases for general and administrative expenses from the 2019 period to the 2020 period were $1.4 million. These increases mostly resulted from higher stock option expense of $1.3 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $34,000, and net increases in all other administrative expenses of $59,000.
Total net other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $590,000, which reflect a variance of $11.9 million when compared to total net other income of $11.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The variance of $11.9 million is mainly related to the recognition of a gain of $12.1 million pertaining to a note receivable from our Chinese licensee.
The note receivable is part of an agreement executed with our China distributor related to the restructuring of our business relationship to a royalty based model, which requires the repayment over five year period of the investment the company made in China during the 2017 and 2018 years.
As a result of the above for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the company had net income of $6.9 million or $0.09 per diluted share. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, there was net income of $11.1 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The net income for the 2019 period included a non-recurring gain of $20.1 million related to the note receivable from our China licensee.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2020 was $12.2 million compared to a loss of $3.4 million for 2019. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance.
To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, company had cash of approximately $52.2 million and $23.1 million respectively and working capital of approximately $62.2 million and $24.8 million respectively.
Cash provided by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was approximately $3.8 million compared to cash used in operations of essentially $966,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019. Finally, subsequent to the end of the third quarter on October 30, 2020, the company paid off the bonds payable related to the acquisition of Func Foods in the amount of approximately $10 million and is now debt free.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Company. Please proceed with your question. Good morning everyone. First, let me say congratulations on the strong Q3 metrics. Terrific to see. John, maybe you can just touch on, I know you've ramped the DSD network quite a bit. I think you said you're at 147, but maybe you can just speak to which regions you feel are best covered at this point, maybe where you still need to fill in or add DSD partners?
And then what is kind of the optimization of your DSD network look like at the next phase based on recent business trends and kind of maybe just review the timeframe of getting to that optimization? Yes, no, thank you, Jeff. I really appreciate it. The team did a great outstanding job during the quarter, during these unprecedented times. So, really excited about the results and the momentum we're at, but you're absolutely right. I just stated on the call we're at a right around 147 DSD partners today. We have about 75% of the major metropolitan markets covered.
So, that allows us to really activate our retailers. So, our team, our key accounts team is in the process really working with our retail partners and getting plans in place to transition from a direct model to the DSD model where we just see great lift, really gets us much better placement, better activation, better in-store execution and so forth.
And that's really what we've been saying that's what we've been seeing as we flip over Target and CVS, 7-Eleven in New York and Ralph's in California as well. So, lots of momentum there. When you look at the areas where we're still working on and need coverage, the team is working very closely with a variety of potential customers is the Mid-Atlantic states, Northern California, we've been working on.
And also there is pockets in the middle of the country as well as certain pockets in Texas that we're working on. So, -- but we do have 75% of the major metropolitan markets covered. We can cover a good portion and a good footprint of our existing distribution. So, really just in the process, working with our retailers, we've even talked about Walmart before 50% are currently covered by DSD.
We're hoping that will change in the really in Q1 of 2021 as we continue to work with those retail partners and flip over these key accounts. So, we think we're in great position, we're in great standings and a better position than we ever have been on our retail distribution footprint and just really excited, we're seeing these distributors continually reorder products working with us.
We have some great team members, field sales team members that are working on activating these distributors. So, we think we're in a really great position as we exit 2020 and head into 2021. Okay, great. And then kind of a multi-part question here. Can you speak on how the process of converting Target to DSD has been going? Maybe what sort of lift you're experiencing lately when you convert to DSD. Overall, I think you said something along lines of 50%?
And then I think you also mentioned Walmart flipping to DSD in the first part of next year. Maybe you can just elaborate a little bit on that? And then, just curious any more thoughts you have on the C-store channel and how business is growing with Speedway? Okay, excellent. Target, we mentioned, we put press releases out, we have worked -- been working on flipping over 1,200 stores. There is a whole process that gets involved there to even get to that point. So, it's making sure you're covering all the stores within a given DMA, making sure that you're -- their vendor numbers have to be loaded, there is a lot of back office work that has to be done.
Not only on the Celsius side but also on the retailer side. And once that's all completed, then that needs to be communicated to our distributor partners, activated at retail, we do provide support with our field sales team as well making sure these shelves get set. I've been working on it over the last two months really September and October, getting those 1,200 Target stores set. There is additional Target opportunities to flip as I mentioned, as we head into 2021.
In regards to Walmart, we are in about 50% of those Walmart's are currently serviced by DSD, due to COVID and a lot of challenges as we know with these retailers with a lot of back office roles and responsibilities and [physicians] working from home, has taken a little bit longer.
So, we anticipate Walmart will get together with them and we'll continue to work on, move over to DSD, which is the preferred method and we anticipate that to happen sometime in Q1, early 2021. As it relates to convenience. Convenience, we're up to a 16% ACV, outpacing the category growth. Obviously we're into -- getting into the pick of buyer seasons.
So, really account calls for 2021. It has been extremely positive as we -- where we sit today and looking into 2021, we're getting a lot of excitement as we did last year at NAICS, as we presented there. We did have a booth there. We got a lot of excitement. We are anticipating a lot of resets in 2020 which had been delayed. But we anticipate those to come around.
We're expecting more accounts coming on-board in the convenience channel in that March-April timeframe in 2021. And we'll have more announcements over the next coming quarters of our expansion in existing accounts as well as new distribution coming on-board within that convenience channel.
As you look at Speedway, it's process of the first, really the first phase of the relaunch. Initial feedback has been positive on the -- in the 2,700 stores range. So, initial feedback has been positive. We'll continue to monitor, but I don't have anything else to really report on at this time in regards to Speedway, but things seem to be going well. Okay, great to hear. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll jump back in the queue. Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, John and Edwin and Cameron. How are you? Excellent. How are you doing today Jeff? Very well, thank you. Just fine. So, few random questions and one more of a macro question. So, could you talk about the, On-The-Go sticks, it's now up to six SKUs. Is that yet become a material portion of the overall business at least in North America? Yes, the On-The-Go sticks is a great offering for us, because that expands our usage occasion. So, we see a lot of -- we're seeing a lot of momentum with individuals making it part of their smoothy combinations, also taking it on their travel or travels down.
We've seen a lot of offers a lot more portability and we are seeing -- we expect it to be a meaningful part of our business. Obviously the RTDs or drive the bulk of our revenues, but we do see this additional opportunity with the On-The-Go sticks, they're doing well at Publix.
We just expanded into Walmart with them. With Vitamin Shoppe we've done really well over the years in our line and HEB has had in for some time, as well as Harris Teeter, so we do get a lot of excitement, a lot of interest on them.
We do have some new flavors plans for 2021 and as it will be a meaningful business -- part of our business, it is a piece of our business. And we expect it to deliver revenue and gross profits as we continue to scale and the team has put priority on it as well. But our main focus is the RTDs. Got it. You did mention a couple of new flavors, you said strawberry marshmallow and blueberry frost. Can you tell us what the timing is on that? And if that's the traditional line or the heat line and where we might expect that to pop up? Yes, it's in the market now in the Nordics. Great tasting strawberry marshmallow and the frost it's great tasting the blueberry frost, is a limited addition that we just launched at the end of the third quarter. So, locally here in the US, we don't have that slotted to arrive. But it is in the Nordics, if you're traveling over to Sweden, Finland or Norway, you will be able to find that. Okay, got it. And then, next, could you talk about, I know that Func is closed. Could you talk a little bit about the Vitamin channel and if you're seeing any disruptions with the GMC situation? Jeff, can you repeat the question. Sorry? Yes, could you talk a little bit about the Vitamin channel specific to this quarter or next quarter? Yes, I mean the Vitamin channel has been a channel, especially supplement channel in the gym business. We started to see great reopenings in Florida. We did start to see reopenings in Texas markets and in California we're actually the workouts are outside. We have some outdoor activation to support those local partners.
It's very key to our core. We're there to support the fitness channel. Regards to the vitamin specialty, I mean the channel has been has struggled. We've talked about, it was down 23% in the quarter. We anticipate it to come back. We feel health and wellness trends are here to stay. It's -- we don't see that going away anytime soon.
It's more important now than ever deep forward to stay healthy, stay fit, stay active. So, we feel the sports nutrition space is going to continue to grow. It's a great way for a consumer to be -- learn about CELSIUS for the first time in that channel as well and they bring a lifelong CELSIUS consumer on board. Okay. And then lastly from me. If you could talk about the situation with the cans. As I understand that you have had four or five facilities, is the limiting factor, the capacity of the current facilities or is the limiting factor the raw materials and the availability of the can manufacturing? Yes, we've spoken about the cans. We were notified late in October about availability as we head into 2021. There is a massive can, the physical actual body of the can shortage for 2021. It's anticipated in 2021, the industry in the North America is short about 30 billion cans.
So, lots of shortfalls, and that really has to do with the capacity of the manufacturing of the physical can, not the filling of the can. When we talk about filling stations, that's the five filling stations or co-packers we've been working with. We have capabilities to produce the cans, but we, to fill the cans into finished goods, the challenge we have, as we head into 2021 is the physical can body.
So, that's where the big shortfall is. All the manufacturers, the larger can manufacturers are all running over capacity and turning brands away, unfortunately. So, as I stated earlier, on the opening remarks of the call, we do have contingency plans in place for that. Being a global company is advantage to us.
We were immediately able to start sourcing cans out of Asia, out of Europe as well and immediately put our teams on that task to secure cans to sustain our growth and continue to outpace the category. So, we will have sufficient ample supply as we head into -- as we had through 2021. But it is an industry wide issue. Everyone is going to be dealing with which also can be an opportunity for brands that have cans. Got it, okay. That does it for me. Thanks for taking the questions. Excellent. Thank you, Jeff. Our next question comes from the line of David Bain with ROTH Capital. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks. And also my congratulations on the results and thanks for all the data points you covered a lot. So, I'll limit mine to two. Just given the cash on the balance sheet, cash flow generation, I mean, does this change your outlook either on potential M&A activity or brand extensions?
I mean looking at the SKU average for your industry leader, you start to add Rain, body fuel to Paradise, Dragon Tea whatever, it's got to be three times, four times, five times yours in the same locations. So, is that an opportunity potentially next year or am I thinking about that the right way? Thank you, Dave for the question. There is a ton of opportunity out there for us. No question about it. The key -- lead Celsius is focused execution. We did finish the quarter with $52 million in cash of which right around $42 million if you back out the $10 million paying off that debt, which we are debt free. So, that's been paid off.
So, we do have sufficient cash. We are generating cash flow positive. We will be investing in inventories to sustain growth. So, we have funds market for inventory investments. We also have some positive ROI targeted investments, we will be implementing into 2021 with cooler placements.
If you're out in California, I know Dave you're out there, if you stop into some Ralph's, we're getting great placement with some really good cooler assets and the ROI is extremely positive. So, we'll be looking to invest in that area into 2021. Opportunities arise every day.
We're willing to evaluate them and if we find an opportunity that's accretive to our shareholders, accretive in revenue and gross profits, we will look at it, but at the strategy right now is to continue to stay focused, drive profitable growth and drive Celsius into a major player in the energy category and take share. Fantastic. Okay, and then my follow-up would be, is if it's possible to kind of help us bifurcate 3Q North American revenue growth into buckets like same-store sale, organic growth, SKU growth, door growth, or any way we can kind of look at what the main pillars of the third quarter growth were? I mean if you look at the growth in North America like we stated on the call, I mean, on a year-to-date basis we're at a 57% growth rate. Edwin talked about a lot of the new distribution coming on. We did talk about the store count increase there that we saw. So, it's an interesting year as we all know in 2020.
So, it's consumer shifting their purchasing patterns and now they're going back. There is a lot of dynamics taking place. So, I don't really want to state anything. We haven't provided guidance. There is momentum behind the company. I did say we had a 50% growth in North America orders in-house as of the end of October.
So, that shows some underlying momentum there. But I would not going to provide any forward guidance at this time. No problem, just go ahead. Are you going to follow-up? No, I mean the underlying if you look at it, the SPINS data, Scan data as I said about is 60% growth rate and that was the latest Nielsen data. In the convenience channel, we're at a 43% growth rate. We have gained some new distribution as well. So, I think, organically we've seen and we stated this publicly about a 30% growth same-store sales and the other growth is coming from new distribution. Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Great quarter. Thank you David. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning, Edwin. Good morning John. How are you doing? Good morning. Good morning. Excellent. So, just on because there is a lot of talk about the can shortage across the industry, not just obviously what you are dealing with, but it's just -- it's obviously a big issue and it's excellent that you're able to source this outside. You said it's going to impact margins a little bit.
If it can start to impact margins right now, do you need to start sourcing from Europe and Asia now or is that a '21 issue? Yes, it's an industrywide issue. We anticipate sourcing in Q4. So, that will start in Q4. Okay. But in terms of being able to get the can that you need, based on the fact that you seem like you're ahead of this curve, you don't see it being an issue in terms of being able to meet the forecast you have for the demand, correct? That's correct. We already have purchase orders in place. We've already are far along on the processing order procurement process to have sufficient cans as we head into 2021. Okay, great. And then as we -- you mentioned Amazon the third after Monster and Red Bull. Just in terms of the corporate gross margin, is that in line, is it a little bit lower margin, when you go on Amazon and just remind me, John or Edwin, what's the percent of revenue that comes from e-commerce or Amazon at this point? Just, Anthony, it's roughly around 22% of our revenue for the third quarter, North America. So, if you're looking at the segment there. In regards to gross profit margins, we don't disclose particular accounts, but overall, margins were very good for the quarter. And like we said going forward due to the can, importing of cans, we are looking at the low 40s on a go-forward basis as we go through 2021. Okay, great. And on the DSD network Anheuser-Busch, Big Geyser, those are the big ones, but you have DSD agreements with PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper, MillerCoors Network. Are there any others and how your DSD network you believe can cover 75% of your major metropolitan areas?
Are there other DSD partners that you believe you need to increase that penetration or at some point maybe 75%, 80% is about as far as you can go in terms of DSD coverage? Great question. And keep in mind the Pepsi and Anheuser-Busch, Keurig Dr. Pepper were dealing with the independents. So, they're not corporate owned. So, this is an independence. The bulk of our distribution is with Anheuser-Busch independent wholesalers. A lot of brands can't even get to 75% major metropolitan covered.
So, it is a great achievement where we're at today. But we are looking for full coverage and we'll continue to drive that through. We will -- they we're talking to a variety of additional distributors to help fill some of those boys [ph] mainly in the Mid-Atlantic, Northern Tao, Texas, certain parts of Texas and then there are certain regions within the middle of the country that we are looking for additional coverage on.
But I think we're in a really good position right now with 75% major metropolitans covered. The opportunity to activate these distributors. We just picked up thousands of new potential sales reps that can be out there helping build the brand for Celsius. And we're looking to partner with them in a big way in 2021. And we've never been in a better position to have the opportunity we had on hand. Okay, great. And then just lastly, a few years ago you came out with the HEAT line which was -- it's a different packaging, different product, more caffeine than your standard CELSIUS line. Is there any other lines that you're looking at launching in '21 or is it more going to be just an extension of what you have in additional flavors? Yes. We have a great cross-functional innovation team. We have a lot of innovation plan for 2021 and beyond. Some great line expansions, innovative flavors coming to market and one opportunity we've had which we've talked about with the Func Food acquisition is leveraging that fast brand portfolio. So, we're looking to partner with them.
We've been partnering and bringing that Fast Protein snack portfolio to North America in Q1, starting to test it and ceded. But there's a lot of opportunities in that category. We do see massive opportunities in the RTD category and that's where we are mainly focused. But look for some great tasting flavor innovation, some line expansions as we head into and through 2021 and beyond. Alright. Great quarter guys, thanks. I appreciate it. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you, Doug. Thank you everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to take everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrates the products are gaining considerable momentum.
We are capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the changes taking place in the transformation of today's energy drink category. Our active healthy lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio strategy and team and a rapidly growing market that consumers want.
Our mission is to get Celsius to more consumers profitably. I'm very proud of our dedicated team as without them our tremendous achievements and significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible. In addition, I thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team.
And I thank everyone for your interest in Celsius. Be safe, stay healthy, and have a great day. Thank you, sir. And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you once again. Have a great day.","the call will open the call to your questions and instructions . the call may contain forward-looking statements based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of today, November 12, 2020 .",1.0

As we have all been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 has been impacted as well, materially impacting several channels of trade Celsius operates in, including our health and fitness, vending, food service as well as reduced foot traffic in several channels of trade throughout the country. In addition, our EU, Middle East, Southeast Asia and Australia operations, which remain adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Traffic and purchasing patterns remain disrupted and online ordering patterns, pant repurchasing and curbside pickup, maintained more prevalence in response to the stay-at-home orders and the shifts in consumer lifestyles. While we have started to improve in the third and fourth quarter with capacity restrictions as well as reopenings in hardest hit channels, there still remains uncertainty. As there potentially could be reclosings of additional cases increasing in our regions of operations, which could force extended closures in some states and countries. The health and safety of our employees and partners remains our top priority, and the safety precautions have been implemented, which we have developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities.
In addition, we continue to monitor the environment and implement contingency plans to mitigate risk to our business. The company's operations are fully operational, and our products remain generally available for customers. Even despite these constraints affecting our business in 2020, we persevered to set new records in revenue each quarter and for the full year of 2020. Celsius achieved a new record of over $130 million in revenue, with approximately $8.5 million in income and approximately $15 million in EBITDA. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the tremendous operational and financial achievements Celsius has accomplished. More importantly is the future opportunity as these achievements laid the foundation for future success. This is only the beginning.
On the convenience channel side in North America, we did see tangible ACV gains, mostly through our expanded national DSD distribution and expansion through existing chains. These include the largest new customer, Speedway, which added about approximately 2,700 locations. Several large convenience chains had their coolers resets pushed back due to COVID-19 in 2020, but we expect a very strong spring quarter reset in this channel, both from those that pushed their resets in 2020 as well as new opportunities driven by our category-leading growth metrics, which are drastically outpacing the category growth rates. We also discussed another COVID impact in our third quarter earnings call, the aluminum can shortage. The shortage has impacted the entire industry. The large can manufacturers in the US have all initiated major expansion projects with expected completion times coming somewhere in the back half of 2021 and potentially through 2022.
Celsius has successfully navigated this major disruption by leveraging our global relationships and strategic investors to secure the additional cans needed from both our Europe and Asia operations to support our growth. As outlined in our last call, this will impact our gross profit margins by a few points, but we remain confident that the company will run approximately in the low 40% gross profit range throughout 2021. This initiative and this initial conservative baseline expectation, which we expect to improve upon throughout the year. We continue to explore additional opportunities as they may become available to shorten the duration Celsius is impacted by the can shortage, and there is potential for additional domestic can availability in the back half of 2021. This is due to both a return to higher on-premise sales as well as timing of new capacity coming online, which will improve our operational performance.
Turning to some of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter; overall revenue was up 48% to $35.7 million from $24.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Domestic revenue grew 67%, approximately to $28.4 million, up from $17.1 million in the year-ago quarter, which was driven by continued strong double-digit growth in traditional channels trade, and our expansion with world-class retailers and distribution partners. Our continued strong double-digit growth in our e-commerce revenue saw Celsius draw within 0.2 of a point of market share within Red Bull on Amazon per stack line. Additionally, our fitness channel saw a 22% growth rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which is extremely positive given that many gyms continued to operate at limited capacities. International revenue increased 3% to $7.3 million from $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Nordic revenue increased by approximately 2% to $6.9 million.
The market was still strongly impacted by channel closures from COVID and timing of promotional programs. Despite these challenges, we have fully integrated and leveraged our synergistic benefits from the acquisition of Func Food, which has immediately been accretive to our earnings and is an important step in our strategy to build a global dominant brand. For the quarter, we focused on the collaborative benefits for further integration with marketing, operations and financial integrations, which will improve efficiencies and operational performance. In addition to the strong revenue momentum in the fourth quarter, the company hit record gross margin percentage levels totaling 48.9%, and 54.7% when excluding outbound freight. Net income was achieved of $1.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3 million for the quarter, approximately an 8.5% EBITDA margin.
Consumer demand for Celsius has grown stronger through 2020, with the most recent reported United States SPINS data US MULO plus convenience for the 52 weeks ending January 24, 2021, confirms that we have significantly outpaced the category across multiple channels. This includes a 57.9% growth in the total reported channels, outpacing the category growth rate by eight times, with an average ACV of approximately 25%, which demonstrates Celsius warrants additional shelf placements and provides a runway for future growth. Additionally, third-party data reflects the same trends with Nielsen reported all accumulated channels on February 20, 2021; the company's sales were up 88% for the last two weeks with a 1% market share of the category and up 97.9% for the preceding four weeks.
The next highest comp for the most recent two-week data was Red Bull, which grew at 14.8% and 17.7% over the four week time frame. Our e-commerce channel, according to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales on Amazon in the United States for the four weeks ending February 13, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy drink category by Amazon, including energy shots, grew at 177.8% versus the same period a year ago. And Celsius sales increased 224.8%, and our share increased 2.1% to 14.5% of the category, which puts Celsius as the third largest energy drink brand on Amazon, just behind Monster Energy at a 34.2% share, which grew at a 193.7% growth rate, and Red Bull, which is at a 14.7% share and grew at 171.8% growth rate.
Being the third largest brand with this share on Amazon demonstrates and reinforces our market opportunity in the energy category in traditional retail. And with a level distribution playing field, a 14.5% share equates to approximately over $2 billion in reported retail sales according to recent total Nielsen category data. This is why we're so excited with our national distribution network, which will provide us with the opportunity to gain those placements and, again, verify Celsius warrants better placements and greater distribution.
During the fourth quarter, we made significant progress on further building out our national DSD network to service accounts. We secured additional distribution partners in the Anheuser-Busch network, further expanding availability to new regions. In addition, we have initiated new hires to help optimize and educate our national DSD network. We recently hired Tony Guilfoyle as EVP of Sales in North America. Tony was formerly with Rockstar Energy, building their sales organization and leading the growth from initial revenues of $5 million to the multibillion-dollar organization, and the buyout through Pepsi. To expedite our growth, we have added over 50 new team members to support our national network and marketing initiative to drive channel expansion as well as educate and to support our partners.
We have begun our rollout of Celsius branded coolers. And in the first quarter of 2021, we rolled out our first phase of the 1,000 coolers that are currently on order to support our DSD partners and key accounts. The initial rollout of the coolers is showing positive ROI with a payback of approximately three months and over a 200% increase in velocity rates. And to this date, we have placed over 200 coolers in key accounts. We have now built out our network to over 150 regional direct store delivery partners, with new partners covering Chicago, San Francisco and many other markets. We estimate that our DSD network now covers approximately 85% of major metropolitan markets in the United States.
We further transitioned target over from wholesale to Big Geyser in New York City during the third quarter and have already seen volumes more than double in those locations. Due to this success, we have further transitioned to about approximately 82% of all targets to DSD as of today and have already begun transitioning CVS, Walmart and others. We anticipate beginning to see these benefits of our recent announced DSD service retail locations taking place throughout 2021, with the majority of the impact of these transitions and new locations reflected fully in the first quarter of 2021 and then ongoing throughout the transition of the remaining of 2021 with new accounts as well as our existing accounts.
Today, in the United States, our total door count now exceeds over 82,000 locations nationally, growing 18,000 doors from the same point in 2018. We expect this number to grow even further in the coming quarters as retailers execute their planogram resets, which were delayed due to COVID. On our co-packing front, Celsius went live on production with a new dedicated co-packer plant in North Carolina. This brings our total US co-packer footprint to eight locations that are active, which will help protect the future out of stocks and support our massive growth.
In Europe, we continue to capture incremental benefits and synergies from the full integration of Func Food Group, a Nordic wellness company, into our operations. The business was immediately accretive to earnings and is an important step in our strategy to build a global dynamic brand. As the United States and Europe operations were impacted by COVID and was impacted mainly due to supply constraints with the FAST protein snack portfolio which were partially offset by the growth in Celsius sales in the regions, we continue to see great opportunities and momentum in the market.
In Sweden, we launched a great-tasting blueberry frost. And in Finland, despite shutdowns, we launched a new flavor, Positive Energy and Strotella bar [ph] under the FAST brand, which was the number one selling bar in the country. In addition, we are evaluating the UK and working with Amazon Europe to further expand our e-commerce opportunities throughout Europe. In China and APAC, recoveries continued, and we saw positive sales momentum regain. In China, we maintained a licensing royalty model in the market, where our distributor covers approximately 76 cities and now has over 60,000 locations of distribution as of the end of 2020. And in Malaysia, where we maintain a direct relationship with the local distributors, we maintain approximately 2,000 retail locations, with plans to reenter the gyms, vitamin-specialty gyms and other retailers as recovery continues. As with Europe and the United States, we see great opportunity to capitalize on the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings, and we see tremendous opportunities in the enormous market of Asia.
Now moving to marketing; on the marketing front, we continued to activate, targeting new and existing customers where they live, work and play, building meaningful and emotional connections through robust integrated marketing programs, even while consumers are at home. Specifically during the quarter, despite continued COVID restrictions, we sponsored targeted events, both in person and in virtual, that filled over thousands of cans-in-hands in the quarter in key markets that were open. Continued to support our first responders, we handed out over 0.5 million cans to nurses, doctors, COVID testing sites, even the firefighters fighting the California fires were handed out cans. In addition, we reactivated our Live Fit Tour, which is an integrated experiential sampling tour. We further activated our SWEAT WITH CELSIUS on Instagram, which our live workouts have continued. And we further leveraged and built out our brand ambassador program and influencer programs, reaching more consumers in a meaningful way. In addition, we partnered with our key accounts, most recently with Walmart, where we handed out over 100,000 sticks to college students going back to school. And we kicked off a targeted integrated college brand ambassador program, which targets universities and key markets around the country.
Celsius is driving the momentum in the energy category, hitting record North America sales growth rates in January and February of 2021 through tracked Nielsen channels, outpacing the category growth. Our brand is resonating with a diverse consumer base, expanding the category demographics and supported by the increased focus on health and wellness, specifically in the energy category, where functional energy is recognized throughout the industry as a driver of future growth and shelf presence with retailers. The Celsius consumer brings significant value to retailers, not just as an expanded age bracket and a 50% female demographic, but our consumers are reoccurring, regularly consuming Celsius as part of a daily lifestyle, further expanding the channel. Our national DSD network is now in place, positioning Celsius to grab further market share on an expedited basis, especially in the convenience channel. The entire team is excited and are confident we are just getting started on the opportunity in front of us.
Before turning the call over to Edwin, I also want to add additional color on our ESG, environmental, social, governance commitments and initiatives, many of which have been ongoing. As we have increased our public visibility, both with consumers and investors, it is paramount that we articulate this dedication. With that, the company is currently in the process of reviewing best-in-class reporting standards to ensure all material components of ESG are covered in our initial report. In the interim, the following are some specific items detailing key operational components at Celsius on this commitment. We are committed to sustainability and to the principles to reduce, reuse and recycle. Approximately 95% of our products are sold aluminum cans, which are 100% recyclable. In addition, with our 12-ounce cans, we can ship approximately three times as many in a standard semitrailer versus 12-ounce glass bottles. Our can suppliers are leading initiatives, reducing the amount of aluminum in each can and also increase the amount of recycled aluminum in each can being manufactured. We have initiated a program to reduce the miles on cans through strategic placements of warehouses in conjunction with our co-packer locations and end consumers served, as well as focusing on more completed loads of full transit, also reducing the carbon footprint on our transportation.
On a social and health aspects, Celsius is clinically proven functional energy drink, which accelerates metabolism, burns body fat and promotes a healthy active lifestyle. With our eight essential vitamins and no sugar, we are a great alternative to sugary energy drinks, encouraging people who live a healthy, active lifestyle. Our European team has implemented significant programs in addition to these items listed, including saving over 158 tons of CO2 emissions by utilizing rail on inbound shipments and have also implemented strategies to reduce plastics on packaging. As mentioned, this is just a highlight of some of the key items already at the core of Celsius, and we look forward to providing more details report reflecting our commitments to our ECSG environmental, social and governance policies.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. Our fourth quarter results for the three months ended December 31, 2020, delivered revenue of $35.7 million, an increase of $11.5 million, which translates to a solid 48% growth when compared to $24.1 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to strong growth in North American sales revenue, which was a record $28.4 million, up a robust 67% from the $17.1 million in the prior-year quarter, and accounted for 98% of the increase in total revenue. European revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6.9 million, up 2% and from the $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The European business was affected by some stock-outs, as well as the impact of the pandemic. Asian revenue amounted to $224,000, an increase of 6% from the prior-year quarter pertaining to our royalty income from our China licensee. Revenue from all other areas amounted to $117,000, up 266% from $32,000, reflecting the expansion or business development into other geographies.
Gross profit in Q4 2020 increased by $7.3 million, landing at $17.4 million, which translates to a substantial 74% growth from $10 million for the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit margin for the three months ended December 31, 2020, was a very healthy 48.9%, up 700 basis points from 41.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. If we then exclude outbound freight, gross margin profitability would amount to a robust 57.2%, up 750 basis points compared to the same normalized figure of 49.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, we performed an overall estimate or analysis of the $7.3 million increase, which reflected that approximately $2.5 million or 35% of this increase pertains to price or cost optimizations. Specifically, this relates to lower promotions or discounting in the quarter and the beneficial impact of the stronger euro currency, as well as some synergistic beneficial impacts in the supply chain. We then estimated that approximately $4.8 million or 65% of the increase is related to favorable volume impact. While we have very good tailwinds in all these areas during the fourth quarter, these results may not be indicative or transferable to the immediate future periods as there are indications that our margins will come under pressure due to increased costs related to the sourcing of cans to strengthening of the US dollar and increase in fuel costs, which have a direct and high correlation to our freight costs, and an indirect impact in the processing costs and the cost of other raw materials.
Now turning to operational expenditures; selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2020, were $11.2 million, an increase of $4.2 million or 59.5% from $7 million in the same quarter in 2019. This increase reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operational results of our European business following our October 2019 acquisition. Specifically, our investments in marketing activities amounted to $4.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million when compared to the prior-year quarter. This increase not only reflects the consolidation of the European business, but also a catch-up of the experiential marketing activities since these types of events were significantly limited in prior quarters. Additionally, the 2020 quarter reflects increases of $520,000 related to sales and marketing investments for additional employee resources and $1.4 million of incremental expenses pertaining to trade marketing activities as well as distribution and storage costs. These increases are directly related to the greater business volume as well as include the impact of the European business integration. Additionally, currency impacts were estimated to increase sales and marketing expenses by $75,000 when compared to the prior-year quarter.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2020, were $5.7 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 30% from $4.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. This increase also reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operational results of our European business. Furthermore, employee costs increased by $474,000 when compared to the prior-year quarter, which also reflects increases in headcount in order to have a good infrastructure to properly support the growing business. The increase also reflects the impact of foreign currency translation in this area, which was estimated at 3% of the total consolidated employee costs.
Depreciation and amortization also reflected an increase of $220,000 when compared to the prior-year quarter. Additionally, there was a reclassification of amortization expenses of $430,000, which were previously presented in the other expense area during the prior quarters of 2020. Furthermore, stock option expense for the last quarter of 2020 reflected an increase of $144,000 when compared to the prior-year quarter. All other administrative expenses resulted in a net decrease of approximately $63,000 as the prior-year quarter included acquisition-related expenses of approximately $126,000. If we exclude stock option expense as well as depreciation and amortization expenses, operational G&A expenditures truly represented 8.8% of revenue, which compares favorably to 10.8% with the prior-year quarter. On a comparable basis, as it also excludes the $126,000 of acquisition costs.
Other income and expenses; total other income amounted to approximately $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, which represents an increase of $1.1 million from other income of $150,000 for the same period in 2019. This increase is mainly related to a favorable impact of net foreign currency exchange gains when compared to the prior-year quarter of approximately $330,000. Additionally, the current-year quarter reflected incremental net interest income of approximately $160,000, lower bond amortization costs of $50,000, the favorable impact of the re-class of amortization expenses to the G&A area of $430,000 and a net favorable impact of $140,000 pertaining to all other income and expense components. As a result of all of the above, fourth quarter net income totaled $1.7 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted shares based on 71.9 million basic shares and 76.5 million fully diluted shares. This compares to a net loss of $1.1 million available to common stockholders or a loss of $0.02 per basic and diluted shares based on a weighted average of 68.9 million shares and 72.6 million fully diluted shares in the year-ago period.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $3 million, an increase of $2.4 million when compared to $606,000 in the year-ago quarter. We believe this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP financial figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now, focusing on some liquidity aspects. As of December 31, 2020, the company had cash of $43.2 million, and working capital of approximately $64.9 million, which translates to an increase of $40.1 million when compared to $24.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Also, on October 30, 2020, the company paid off the bonds payable related to the acquisition of our European business in the amount of approximately $10 million and are now debt-free. Furthermore, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $3.4 million for the year 2020, representing a $2.4 million increase from $1 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by operating income adjusted for noncash items. The increase was further driven by efficient management of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and partially offset by cash utilization pertaining to increases in accounts receivables, inventories and prepaid expenses, which are directly related to the significant growth in business volume.
Now, turning to some additional metrics used to monitor the business. This provides a good perspective of our operational performance using Q4 business volume as a basis for their computations. Our DSOs, or daily sales outstanding, landed at 37 days as of December 31, 2020. Similarly, our inventory days on hand amounted to 91 days, and our payable days were also 37 days. Additionally, operational cash flow for the year amounted to 43% of operational income despite the net increases in working capital, which translated to a use of cash of over $13 million. As such, we have very good liquidity in order to plow back into the business and make investments that yield a high ROI and continue to accelerate top line growth. Finally, we have included the full year 2020 financial results in our earnings press release.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Company. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone. And let me say congratulations on the continued progress. It appears that the Nielsen data is showing acceleration vis-à-vis your comments regarding early 2021. Is that correct? And then any thoughts on the Nielsen sell-through data versus your actual sell-through in Q4? Just wondering if there might be something in terms of sell-in versus sell-through that didn't quite match some of the sell-through data that we're showing on Nielsen, any thoughts there? Yes, excellent. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, the team did -- the company did a great job. The team worked really hard. It was just a monumental year when you look at it all around for the company. But -- you are correct, that Nielsen data is extremely strong. What we're seeing -- I know the most recent Nielsen data had us somewhere around 80% to 90% growth rate on the two-week and four weeks. So that's looking really at Q1. The results we show here is the fourth quarter. But there has been some lags on the scan data to the sell-in on the timing of shipments with the company putting up numbers. But we've been pretty consistent on North America growth at a 60%, 66% growth rate in this most recent quarter in Q4, but we weren't really driving that trajectory. So we'll see how we transpire here. That is what's happening at the register, and it's great to see. We're just as excited as everyone else. Okay. And then, could you maybe speak more to some of the resets that are happening that were delayed due to COVID? I understand some of those are happening for spring, and how you expect that to impact your business heading into the peak summer period? Yes. I mean, when you look at the stores that were added in 2020, it's roughly about 18,000 locations. And as we said, I mean, we're really impacted in 2020 due to the reset delays. So that looks very promising to take place really over the next several months is what we're hearing is spring resets. And mainly, a lot of them are kind of coming in the convenience channel. That's where we were really hindered in 2020. So we expect a sizable increase in our store count over the next several months as they get resets and these retailers go back into resetting deployment grants. We haven't disclosed any key accounts that will be coming on, but we're excited on what we're hearing. We'll let everyone know as soon as they are finally reset, but we're looking to be very optimistic as we sit here today looking at the Nielsen data and then what's to come with some new distribution coming on board in the next several months. Okay, great. And then, if I could just squeeze in one more follow-up. Just any more color you could give us on flipping to DSDs in the near term, or, let's say, in the first half, where you aren't fully converted, just to look out there? Yes. We are fully committed to DSD. The transition -- when we transition our key accounts over to the preferred DSD model, we're seeing very much increased velocities, most importantly, keeping Celsius in stock and also getting those secondary and third displays and also, most importantly, getting the product cold. So we have started CVS. We further expanded with CVS. I mentioned that earlier in the call. If you recall, in Q3, we did convert the New York City metropolitan market over to Big Geyser. And due to the success we've seen there, we've already started to further transition out to other markets around the country. In addition, 7-Eleven is a big initiative in 2021, transitioning that volume over to DSD. We're working with all of our key accounts on this transitional plan. So 7-Eleven will be transitioning right around the May time frame, starting on the West, and then we'll be bringing it over to the East really zone by zone as they do the recording. So excited about that, and we are fully committed to DSD. All the new distribution coming on will be serviced by DSD as well. And did you say 200% increases you were seeing with -- where you put in the coolers, was that right? Yes, that is right. We've already placed about 200 coolers. We have over 1,000 coolers on order currently. And we are facing this -- our team is doing a great job placing these coolers and strategic accounts. And we're seeing roughly -- fairly short period of payback, upwards to three months, and also over a 200% increase in some of these stores. And we do have some stores that are actually returning into the number one selling energy drink in these locations, so with the right placement. And kind of what we see on Amazon. We're the third largest brand on Amazon, giving Celsius the same opportunity and the same shelf presence will turn at the same rate, if not better than the major leading brands. Okay, thanks, and continued success. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, John and Edwin. How are you? Hello, Jeff. Excellent, Jeff. So now that it's been a year since the Func acquisition, I was wondering if you had an opportunity to break out any of the growth metrics, which would include that because I know that some of their streams -- or streams that are direct now and that were previously in your hands. When you look at the -- year-over-year, when you look at 2019 to 2020, you're looking at pretty much comparisons on apple-to-apple basis there. And I guess, when you look at -- yes -- well, remember, John, at the end of last year, Q4 fully consolidated was only two quarters, versus this year where we have three quarters. So Jeff, I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but it's a little bit of apples and oranges from that perspective. Yes. I guess when you look at the fourth quarter, Jeff, that's what I was alluding to in regards you're looking at fairly close to almost a comp. As we stated on an earlier call, they weren't impacted by COVID. And our FAST protein snack portfolio, which is a large chunk of sales that come out of Finland was impacted due to out-of-stocks. A lot of the confectionery manufacturers were operating at limited capacity, unfortunately, during that time. So we've had some disruptions in supply chain, but we do still feel very optimistic. We're very excited about the opportunity we have in Europe. Same opportunity in North America, is in Europe. We expect this to continue to improve as we go through and work through 2021 and get through this pandemic, which seems very promising. Great. Okay. Could you give us any additional color on how the launch has gone with Strawberry Guava? And any commentary on the to-go stick portfolio and its growth, perhaps, for this quarter, if you break it out or you'll break it out? Thank you. Excellent, Jeff. The Strawberry Guava, we launched, has been one of the most successful launches in the fitness channel. Although this fitness channel has been closed due to disruptions in given markets, it was one of the fastest-turning items in that channel we saw in the fourth quarter. It's a great-tasting flavor, also has done extremely well on Amazon. With that -- and we're looking to further expand the availability there. So if you haven't tried it, go out and try it. It's a great-tasting flavor, it is available. When you look at our stick business, our On-The-Go sticks, it is -- the bulk of our business is cans today. That breaks up the largest portion of our revenue, but we are seeing good growth with the On-The-Go sticks. They are now available at Walmart. We're seeing good rotations on Amazon. Vitamin Shoppe. Publix, down in the Southeast, took the sticks on chain-wide. So it's available to air all flavors. And we're getting more interest on those. We're seeing a lot of our core consumers purchasing our On-The-Go sticks. It's a lot of very versatile, also making some interesting smoothies and some combinations. So it is a good piece of our business, although the bulk of our business today is the RTD business. Got it. Okay. And then, lastly for me is, on the margin side; the fourth quarter margins were quite strong or exceptionally strong, I should say. And you seem a little cautious on the pull through, although you've got now eight active co-packer locations. So anything to read into there as far as modeling purposes and how you expect margins to play out during 2021? Jeff, there's a lot of variables there. And you're right, we're being somewhat cautious because there's again -- several aspects that play favorably now, even the strength of the euro, which we're seeing that pull back a little bit. We're also seeing an increase in cost as it relates to the cans and sourcing. And again, all these things, for the most part, we're anticipating, obviously, is going to have a short-term kind of pressure on downwards towards the margins. But the important thing is that we have inventory, especially as it relates to the cans, that kind of thing. And we're looking to do some things also to manage the impact of the currencies and so forth. But you're absolutely right. I mean there's a lot of variables there, and we're being somewhat cautious as it relates to the immediate Q1 and Q2. Got it, okay. Again, congrats on the quarter. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. I was just wondering, John, if you could comment a little bit on the international growth. It looks like there was a pause this quarter. You mentioned some of the COVID-19 impact. Can you speak specifically to which countries you think saw the most impact? And do you think starting here in the first quarter, things start to bounce back, or is it going to be a couple of quarters in terms of growth bouncing back internationally? Yes. Thank you, Anthony. I mean when you look at the Nordics, they have been impacted. There's talks currently about Sweden also closing down again. I know Finland as well has been impacted. We're seeing some closures there. So Q1 likely will be -- has the potential to see another impact given some of the constraints and government closures and mandates. But the underlying business is extremely healthy and extremely strong. We have a lot of opportunity there, not only in Sweden, Norway and Finland, but also we're looking at some partnerships in the UK as well as Germany and Russia. So there's some opportunities as we further expand out. But it is -- we really are sitting at a point where, really, over the next several quarters, we'll have to see how this evolves. I mean the vaccine is rolling out, so -- and that's rolling out very quickly. So that should also provide additional confidence with these governments. And we're keeping an eye on it. But the underlying financial conditions are improving. Also, winter will be breaking as well.
So, we're excited for that and getting to the -- back into summer beverage season. Keep in mind, historically, their fourth quarter has been one of their lowest quarters, historically. So it does have a seasonality to the business, and we expect -- just like any year, we do expect some seasonality within the business. But we are extremely optimistic. Okay. And then just remind me, when did Func Foods close? Because it's now going to be apples-to-apples here in the first quarter. Was it partially apples-to-apples, or when did it close in '19? Was it end of third quarter, or fourth quarter? Yes. The actual date was October 25, Anthony. October 25? Okay. Correct. 2019, October 25, 2019. So yes, there's -- and you're right. Going forward, that's one of the things I was making some comments prior. Even now fourth quarter, again, last year was basically two months versus this quarter being three months. But again, there's a lot of intricacy since last year because of the transaction. We were still not fully operational there, so to speak. They didn't have a lot of inventory. And then, at the end of Q4, it really took off. Okay, yes. No, that was helpful. Thank you, Edwin. And then just in terms of these coolers, you mentioned the strategy this year of rolling those out -- 200 now, rolling out 1,000 or a little bit more than that. What's the total cost for rolling out 1,000 do you expect approximately? Yes. We haven't disclosed that. It is a positive ROI opportunity for us given our high velocity rates. We have 1,000 initially on order right now, and we are looking for some other opportunities with some key accounts we're in discussions with. And we have the potential to roll out double that number by -- really by the end of 2021. So we're working with some key customers. We're seeing -- as long as we continue to see a good rate of return on these, we'll continue to get those placed in key formats. But we haven't disclosed the cost, but it is -- we said the payback is roughly about three months for us currently. So it is a great investment for us. And we'll continue to get these coolers placed, and we'll continue to order them and work with our distributors and key accounts. Okay. And then Speedway, you said 2,700 locations. So you're in all 2,700 as of today? Is that the right number? And is there any more expansion there? Yes. We're in approximately 2,700 today with roughly two flavors, and we are in the process of getting potentially the opportunity to get another -- some additional flavors listed in the next cut-in. So we think Speedway is going to be a great account for us. We've seen the great results at 7-Eleven over the years, the continued growth year-over-year at 7-Eleven and in many of our key convenience chains and partners. And if you look at where Speedway's locations are, those are generally really good markets for Celsius. So we think it's going to be a great partnership, and we're at just the beginning of Speedway. So definitely look for more flavors there on the quarters to come and years to come. So look for a great partnership. And then, just in terms of the flavors, John, just whether it's Target or Walmart, is there -- when are those resets coming up? Is there -- do you believe near-term expansion or SKU expansion in those stores? Yes. When you look at the resets that we are anticipating, it is -- historically, it's been right around March 15 to April 15 is usually like the spring reset window and the convenience channel can get pushed back due to COVID as well, maybe runs into March or May. We're working closely with our partners. Everyone's on a little bit of a different schedule on timing this year. Usually, as we all know, we have a big event in North America at NACS in October, and then we look forward to those resets coming in spring in the convenience channel. So everyone is working on a little bit slightly different calendar in 2021, but we do expect these resets to take place over the next several months, and you will be seeing additional flavors on shelf. What's interesting on the flavors on shelf, as we spoke about this before, Anthony, is when we add additional flavors, it doesn't cannibalize sales. It actually increases sales at an increasing rate for the whole portfolio. So it's all incremental to us, and that's what we've seen. So we look forward to continuing to drive positive momentum. Okay. And then, just lastly on the sales and marketing side other than the increased expense for coolers, are there any other programs you're running, whether it's additional sampling, or -- I know you guys used to do the Tough Mudder's -- sponsor that. But is there any other events coming up, whether it's the Olympics or anything like that that you're looking to put money towards marketing dollars towards to increase the exposure? I know you mentioned the college rollouts and the sampling there, but any other programs? Yes. We have a lot of great things in the work coming this summer. We have some big things planned. We're really excited about that. We've got a great summer launch plan, so be on the lookout for that. And we have a variety of things we're working on within our marketing vehicles. I touched on a couple of them on the call. We'll keep the -- we won't disclose too much of what we're doing in regards to tactics, but you will be seeing more of Celsius out there as we continue to increase our household penetration, really building that brand in a meaningful way with consumers.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue, Investor Relations for Celsius. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings' first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Edwin Negron, Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and instructions will begin at that time.
The company filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC and released a press release pre-market today. All materials are available on the company's website, celsiusholdingsinc.com under the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, before I turn the call over to John, an audio replay will be available later today.
Please also be aware that this call may be contained forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations, and other information available to the management as of May 13th, 2021. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control.
Except to the extent as required by law, Celsius Holdings undertakes no obligations and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The company achieved a record first quarter exceeding $50 million in sales which were derived by over 100% growth in North America sales from continued strong demand for our portfolio and a 25% growth in international sales. International sales growth is primarily derived from a 22% growth from our Nordic operations.
Even with the record quarter, we are still dealing with the impacts of COVID-19 in several channels, international markets, and experiencing increased costs and raw materials and transportation.
Channels of trade we operate in which we continue to see these effects include our health and fitness, vending, food service, as well as reduce foot traffic and several additional channels. However, we are starting to see improvements to the first quarter, but still not fully normalized.
In addition, our EU, Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Australia operations remained adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic, while we have started to see sequential improvements over the last few quarters, with capacity restrictions as well as reopenings in hardest hit channels, there remains uncertainty as their potential could be re-closings due to case increases in our regions of operations what could force extended closures in some states and countries.
The health and safety of our employees and partners remains our top priority and safety precautions have been implemented, which we have developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities.
In addition to increases in transportation costs, we are experiencing another COVID impact. It is an aluminum cans shortage which has impacted the entire industry. The large can manufacturers in the U.S. have initiated major expansion projects which expect to be completion time somewhere in the -- starting in the back half of 2021 and potentially through 2022 and 2023.
Celsius immediately implemented contingency plans last fall by sourcing cans internationally. We received our first orders in March of 2021. The company anticipates 50% of can apply for 2021 will be derived from imported and wrapped cans, which should decrease in late 2021 and through 2022 as more U.S. capacity comes online.
In the first quarter, we saw a higher proportion of wrapped cans versus imported cans, but expect that mix to change to a higher proportion of imported cans going forward. Wrapped cans have a higher cost, so that represents a slight margin improvement going forward with the changing mix.
In addition the team is expanding warehouse distribution sites, implementing contingency plans to further source raw materials with minimum floor stock programs, blanket purchase orders, second and third supplier alternatives. The team continues to quickly adapt to the new COVID environment and are focused in driving efficiencies and operational performance.
As outlined in our last call, this will impact the gross profit margins by a few points, but we remain confident that the company will run at approximately in the low 40% gross profit range through 2021, which is right in line with our first quarter results. We continue to explore additional opportunities as they may become available to shorten the duration Celsius is impacted by the can shortage and there's potential for improvement in the back end of this year.
In addition, the company is optimizing its promotional architecture and strategies, partially mitigating these inflationary increases in raw materials and transportation. The company remains generally available throughout the quarter, but did experience shipping delays because of can shortages as well as the Texas freeze, which shut down two co-packers and one of our warehouses for over two and a half weeks during the quarter, but they have been fully back online at the end of the first quarter.
On a convenience channel side in North America, which represents the largest energy drink market in the country with over 9 billion in annual sales, the latest SPINS data shows that a 77% year-over-year increase for Celsius product portfolio and the convenience channel compared to 7.5% overall in the energy drink category, while only holding a 16.8% ACV. We have added over 13,500 convenience stores to the last 12 months with additional accounts expected through spring reset.
In addition, we recently achieved the second highest dollar growth in the category when compared to the top 10 energy drink competitors according to SPINs shelf stable energy and functional beverages convenience 12 weeks ending March 21st, 2021.
Our first new spring reset win began in late March with the National launch of Murphy USA and 1,500 locations which will initially be serviced approximately 80% of stores will be serviced by DSD with six flavors authorized.
Industry-backed third-party data continues to show accelerating growth and metrics and we are confident that the Celsius portfolio will continue to drive sales even higher as we further increase our ACV in the channel through additional launches with national chains and transitioning existing accounts to our DSD network.
Consumer demand for Celsius has grown even stronger through 2021, with the most recent reporting Nielsen scan data as of April 24, 2021, showing Celsius sales are up 218% year-over-year for the two-week period, 220.3% for the four-week period, and 151.4% for the 12-week period, as well as an 8.6% for the 52-week period, with achieving a 1.2% share in the last four weeks. The next highest comp for the most recent two-week data was Red Bull which grew at a 29% and 37.2% for the two and four-week timeframe.
In our e-comm channel, according to Statline, which tracks energy drinks sales on Amazon in the United States for the four weeks ending April 17, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy drink category by Amazon including energy shocks grew at 160.1% growth than the same period a year ago.
Celsius sales increased 265% and our share increased by 4.5 points to 15.5% share of the category, which puts Celsius as the second largest energy drink brand on Amazon behind Monster Energy at a 35.6 share and now above Red Bull, which is at a 13.7 share.
We continue to see acceleration through all channels of trade and are now beginning to see the additional lift from the conversion of accounts to our DSD network. Additionally, we secured additional distribution agreements with key partners further expanding availability to new regions, as Celsius builds out its national distribution network, which now includes over 180 regional direct store delivery DSD partners, and distribution centers covering approximately 85% of major metropolitan markets.
Recent additions have predominantly been filling distribution gaps outside of the major metropolitan markets, transitioning DSD continues with Target, CVS, Walmart, Racetracks, 7-Eleven, and others with additional regions and retail partners planted transition to DSD throughout 2021.
Today, in the United States, our total door count now exceeds 92,000 locations nationally, up approximately 10,000 locations since the beginning of 2021. We expect this number to grow even further in the coming quarters as retailers execute their planogram resets, which were delayed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On our co-packing front, we continue to expand our partners and scale at an existing locations improving line-time priority. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint is now eight locations that are active, which will help protect the future of our stocks and support our massive growth.
In Europe, we further integrated and leveraged synergistic benefits from the acquisition of Func Food and Nordic Wellness Company that was immediately accretive to earnings and is an important step in our strategy and building out global dominant brand.
Europe operations were impacted by COVID and additional lockdowns in the first quarter which were impacted -- largely impacted by the FAST protein snack portfolio, which was partially offset by growth in sales -- sales in Celsius in the region. We continue to see great opportunities and momentum in these markets.
We continue to evaluate additional European expansion primarily in the U.K. and Germany, in addition to working with Amazon Europe to further expand our e-commerce opportunities throughout Europe.
In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market where our distributor covers approximately 76 cities and serves approximately over 60,000 locations of distribution.
Our other international markets have started to pick up backup -- also off a small base, Australia sales resumed through our distribution partner in the market and in Malaysia, we maintain a directly ship with a local distributor, we maintain approximately 2,000 retail locations, with plans to reenter gyms, vitamins specialty locations, additional retail partners as the recovery continues.
As with Europe and the United States, we see significant opportunity to capitalize on a global scale, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for Better For You offerings in the enormous market of Asia.
Now, moving on to marketing. On the marketing front, we continue to activate, target new consumers and existing consumers where they live, work, and play living meaningful connections and emotional connections through robust integrated marketing programs even while consumers are at home.
Specifically, during the quarter, despite COVID-19 restrictions, we sponsored targeted events both in-person and in virtual and sampled thousands of cans in hands during the quarter in key markets that were open.
And we continue to do support our first responders, nurses, doctors, COVID testing sites, and reactivated the limited tour which is an integrated experiential sampling tour.
And we further leverage and built out our brand ambassador program, influencer program, reaching more consumers in a meaningful way. Our momentum is accelerating, our brand is resonating with a diverse consumer base, expanding the category demographics. Health and wellness is beyond a trend. Functional energy is recognized throughout the industry as a driver of future growth with retailers.
We hit not only a record for sales in North America, but we also achieved a record growth rate of 100% with third-party data reporting continued acceleration in the second quarter.
Our national DSD network is in place and only at the forefront of recognizing the incremental growth we will drive. Our team is ready. Our infrastructure is in place to support our growth and we expect to continue to grab market share on an expedited scale.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to first provide some background on the amended 10-K for fiscal year 2019 that we also filed this morning. The amendment relates to management's evaluation of internal controls, specifically disclosure controls that pertain to the October 2019 acquisition of the European business.
Acquiring companies have one year post-acquisition to perform a thorough review over the effectiveness of internal controls of the acquired business. We assess performer review with the assistance of a reputable international CPA firm and found the controls to be effective.
These are technical matters which were not fully addressed per SEC requirements regarding acquisition disclosures and have been updated in the amended 10-K. As it relates to Celsius, these matters are inconsequential as it relates to our financial reporting. As such, there is no impact to the reporting figures or any other footnotes or any of the additional disclosures.
We wanted to provide the investment community these details of the amended 2019 10-K so that there is no misunderstanding and it's clear that there is no impact regarding the reported figures and no impact regarding our operating and standard internal controls over financial reporting.
Now, to review the financial results for the first quarter. Our first quarter revenue for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 was $50 million, an increase of $21 million or 78% from $28.2 million for the three months ended March 31st, 2020. Approximately 90% of this growth was a result of increased revenues from North America where 2020 revenues were $19.4 million, which translates to an increase of $19.6 million or 101% from the prior year quarter.
The balance of the increase was mainly related to a 22% growth in European revenues. As such, the first quarter 2021 European revenues amounted to $10.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million from $8.5 million for the prior year. In addition, our European revenue reflected a sequential increase of 50% for the first quarter of 2021 when compared to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Asian revenues which mainly consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee amounted to $536,000 for three months ended March 31st, 2021, an increase of 100% from $268,000 for the prior year quarter.
Other international markets generated $128,000 of revenue during the three months ended March 31st, 2021, an increase of $71,000 from $57,000 from the prior year quarter. The total increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing.
The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth of 137% in traditional channels of trade, coupled with an increase in presses in world-class retailers.
Additionally, the continued expansion of our DSD network delivered a growth of 172% in our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year quarter. Moreover, e-commerce grew 79% or $3.7 million when compared to the prior year quarter. These results were partially offset by some shipping delays related to can shortages as well as a Texas freeze, which shut down two of our co-packers and one of our warehouses for two and a half weeks.
Furthermore, we estimated that the strengthening of the euro accounted for approximately 8.4% of the increase in European revenue in the 2021 quarter when compared to the prior year quarter.
Gross profit in Q1 increased by approximately $7.6 million or 58.3% to $20.6 million from $13 million for the three months ended March 31st, 2020. Gross profit margins decline to 41.1% for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 from 46.1% for the prior year quarter.
The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in volume, while the decrease in gross profit margins is mainly related to increases in freight costs, repackaging costs, higher raw material costs, and higher processing costs.
Furthermore, the temporary can shortage has also added incremental costs related to damages in transporting and processing our product, given the added complexities of the supply chain in procuring these items.
Based on our estimates, the increase in volume favorably impacted gross profit dollars by approximately $7.9 million and unfavorable currency impact provided an additional $700,000, which were partially offset by unfavorable increases in cost of approximately a $1 million.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 were $12 million, an increase of $4.5 million or 60% from $7.5 million for three months ended March 31st, 2020. This increase was mainly related to marketing investment activities, which were augmented by $2.5 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Additionally, employee costs increased by $650,000 from the year ago quarter as we need to continue to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support the commercial growth.
Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales expenses in the amount of $563,000, mainly related to trade marketing activities to support our conversion to the DSD network.
Lastly, storage and distribution expenses, as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area of $704,000 when compared to the prior year quarter.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 were $7.8 million, an increase of $3.3 million or 73.3%, from approximately $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31st, 2020. This increase was mainly related to stock option expense, which amounted to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31st, 2021, or an increase of $2.2 million, which accounts for 61.1% of the total increase in this area when compared to the prior year quarter.
Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership participation in the business in order to promote over performance which translates into the continued success of the company. Additionally, employee costs for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 reflected an increase of $660,000 or 70.2%.
As investments in this area are also required to properly service our higher business volume and provide support to the commercial and operational areas of the business. Administrative expenses amounted to $2.1 million, an increase of $460,000 or 28.8% when compared to the prior year quarter. This increase is mainly related to higher legal costs and increase in the bad debt reserve to cover any potential realization [ph] issues, increases in insurance costs, and office rent.
Depreciation, amortization, and all other administrative expenses accounted for the remainder of the variance, which amounted to a net reduction of $21,000 when compared to the prior year quarter. If we exclude the non-cash items, general and administrative expenses would amount to $15.9 million, or would be reduced to 7.8% of net revenues for the quarter.
Total net other expenses for the three months ended March 31st, 2021 were $228,000, which reflects a reduction of $194,000 when compared to the total net other expenses of $422,000 for the three months ended March 31st, 2020.
Net other expenses of $228,000 for the current quarter are composed of foreign currency exchange losses of $301,000 and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses of $13,000, which were partially offset by interest income of $87,000 related to the note receivable from our China distributor.
As a result of the above, for the three months ended March 31st, 2021, net income was $585,000 or $0.01 per share based on a weighted average of 72.5 million shares outstanding and diluted earnings of $0.01 per share based on a fully diluted weighted average of 76.9 million shares outstanding.
In comparison for the three months ended March 31st, 2020, the company had net income of approximately $546,000 or $0.01 per share based on a weighted average of 69.3 million shares outstanding and diluted earnings of $0.01 per share based on a fully diluted weighted average of 70.3 million shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was basically $5 million, an increase of $2.2 million when compared to $2.8 million in the year ago quarter. We've released this information and comparisons of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures, enhanced the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, the reconciliation of our GAAP results and non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings release.
Now, focusing on liquidity and capital resources. As of March 31st, 2021 and December 31st, 2020, we had cash of approximately $31.6 million and $43.2 million, respectively and working capital of approximately $73.6 million and $64.9 million, respectively with no long-term debt.
Cash flows used by operating activities totaled $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31st, 2021. The use of cash during the quarter is mainly related to increases in inventories in the amount of $19.2 million as well as $2.6 million related to prepaid expenses, which mainly pertain to the inventory prepayments and inventory in transit, as well as the process to secure processing time. If we exclude these aspects, operations would have delivered over $8 million of cash during the quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Company. Please proceed with your question. Let me say first, congratulations on amazing metrics in Q1. First question is kind of a multi-part question. So, if you can bear with me appreciate it. Just regarding the overall North American revenue increase, can you speak more about maybe how much of that sequential acceleration and growth you think was catching up with sell-in versus sell-through, given the triple-digit sell-throughs you've been experiencing in some channels and were there accounts that didn't get as much as they wanted due to production constraints around the cans shortage, is there any pent-up demand around that? And then maybe if you could give us any more color on where you stand now on getting enough cans to satisfy demand? Excellent. Thank you, Jeff, really appreciate it. The team did an amazing job in the quarter. To answer your questions specifically in regards to the revenue sell-in, sell-through, in North America, we saw great results, up 100% -- over 100%, 101%.
We were not shipping at full capacity through the quarter. So, demand was higher. As we indicated on the call, there was a lot of headwinds. [technical difficulty]
In the quarter, we talked about wrapping cans, we produced a lot of wrapped cans, they were -- they run at slower velocity levels at the co-packers, we were shipping probably roughly around about an 80% fill rate.
And then we also had challenges with the Texas freeze, also logistics coming out of the Texas freeze for two and a half weeks. So, in regards to sell-in and sell-out, our sell-in, has been somewhat limited in the first quarter due to some of those -- our heat line. But our sell-out seems to be very strong when we look at the inventory levels at our retailers, also at our distributors and the sell-through there.
So, I think we're seeing a correlation and we're seeing some of the scan data that's out there, when you look at the scan data in regards to the Nielsen and some of the SPINS, as well as the Stackline data we referenced is showing extremely strong demand at the register and the sell-out. So, we feel strongly about that and we think we're in a good position as we head into really Q2 because the latest scan data in April is also very strong.
When you look at the sales -- regards to the cans, the cans that are out there, we strategically moved back in Q4 of 2020 -- really 2020 trying to secure additional cans, once our main supplier -- our sole supplier for cans informed us we were not be going to be able to achieve our forecasts. Therefore, we have sourced cans from Asia, from Europe, from Canada, and working with all a variety of can suppliers.
In March, we started to produce Asia cans, we also have our German cans that were produced, that are now coming ashore. So, it's -- we have enough cans to secure our volumes for the remainder of the year and planning it to 2022 and beyond.
We are expecting to have a mix of imported and U.S. local cans. So, until we really get capacity up at a much better level in the U.S., there is potential we will be wrapping additional cans as well depending on how these containers come in through the ports as we all know, we're going through really a container pandemic at the moment with all the logistical challenges going through the Suez Canal and a variety of other demand components, as well as the backups and all the ports.
So, there's a lot of complexities. The teams are working through. But we are producing -- we're producing more product than the company ever has. We have plans to produce even more product than the company ever had in Q2, Q3, and beyond. So, we think we're in good position and the sell-out seems extremely strong. Okay, great. So, in terms of getting back to call it, I guess, 100% fill rate? Are you getting there -- or maybe just give us a sense of when you think you can be sort of back at 100% fill rate? Though our growth rates at the-- on the sell-out at retail, when you look at some of the velocity levels, with the Nielsen data and the scan data is extremely strong. We're working to bring our inventory levels up right now to a sustainable level. We're able to meet all demand. And likely, probably in the back half of Q2, I think we'll be in a better position to be able to fulfill all orders.
But things are changing rapidly. Right now we're going through some gas shortages with freight and transportation. So, that's a big thing this week on trying to get containers move, trucks move, logistics, we're getting feedback that truckers just don't have gas, especially in the northeast and a variety of other areas.
So, those are things we're dealing with. We'll work through that. We have a great team; a very, very passionate team, dedicated team and -- who are working through this. I have full confidence in the team will be able to drive forward and we will be able to meet this demand -- full demand towards the back half of Q2 and into Q -- the back half of 2021. Okay, great. And then if I could just squeeze in one more follow-up, just wanted to focus on Europe for a moment, any more color, you can give us there, I guess, on what you expect over the next couple of quarters, including the FAST brand and I think you had some production constraints around FAST? Yes, that's correct. We had a good growth, roughly around a 22% growth rate in Europe, when you look at them; they are mainly derived from the Nordic operations, when you look at a quarter-over-quarter. And then sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we saw about a 51% growth rate. So, those are good numbers there. They weren't impacted with COVID pandemics and shutdowns in the first quarter, in Finland, in Norway, and in Sweden. So, there was some difficulty. We also had supply constraints not with the Southeast portfolio, but with our FAST protein snack portfolio, which impacted the quarter.
Those are getting worked out, I think towards the middle -- really the back half of Q2, those will be realized and into 20 -- the back half of 2021 will get much better inventory levels. But we're working through that. They had a great new successful launch. We talked about in Q4 with a really great new innovative bar, indulgence bar that was very well received in Finland and we think we're well-positioned.
Also we are bringing the FAST brand to the U.S. in Q2. So, look out for that on Amazon in the coming weeks, where we'll be working with our digital teams, gaining some traction with an exclusive launch with Amazon there.
So, things are going well in Europe and we're not out of the woods in COVID restriction, a lot of things, but full faith and we have a great team over there that's executing. Okay, good to hear. Thanks for taking my questions and best of luck. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Hey, everybody. A couple of questions, I guess, on the balance between accepting winning new distribution and supply. It sounds like you've already benefited from some shelf resets, but the real benefits are happening now, kind of, moving forward in terms of resets, do you have to delay any of these shelf space gains maybe even until the April 2022 shelf resets because of limitations on supply? Thank you, Kaumil. Great question. In regards to the new distribution resets, when it's physically looking at the first quarter, we did add some additional distribution. Murphy's USA was a great win for us that gets reset, but the bulk of the distribution and new resets are taking place in that April -- that May, April timeframe.
We are we are not limited to the new expansion on the resets; we have enough product as a filled demand. We're working on more inventory. I think a lot of companies were affected with the Texas freeze and the shutdowns that took place. So, that really impacted us during the quarter.
We have more product coming in. We're producing more product than we ever have. We feel we'll be able to meet demand. We are roughly around -- in Q1 roughly around about an 80% fill rate that we experienced. But with a new distribution, we have more product coming on board in Q2 and we expect to meet the new distribution requirements to fill those new doors and those resets that are coming on board. Okay, great. And then a question on the fitness channel. We're seeing some improvements; I suppose we're seeing a bit of a recovery. Can you maybe give us a read on what you expect it to look like as we come to kind of full reopening, maybe just some early indications on what you're seeing at the gyms, perhaps the behavior, if it's any different from what the world looked like in 2019? And then your strategy, obviously, within what you intend to do in the channel? Absolutely. Great question regards. Historically, pre-COVID, the fitness channel represented about 25% approximately of our revenue, severely impacted as we all know. We have a great team -- a great dedicated team focused on fitness and that is our core. We have great partnerships throughout the industry with key chains and locations and we're working hard with those relationships and we're going to support them just like we supported them all the way through COVID. And we look to really get forge solid relationships on a go-forward basis.
It right around the -- the fitness channel represented approximately 10% of our revenue in North America. We did see a good growth rate in Q1, about 33% on net revenue, so seeing continual re-openings and growth, we feel very excited talking to our operators in the chains and also our distributors that are focused on fitness. Everyone is very excited to really continue to move forward with the reopening of America, the reopening of gyms.
It's really pent-up demand that we're seeing. We're seeing -- we're hearing comments about additional signups and there seems to be a lot of momentum there. They're nowhere near where they were pre pandemic, but it's coming. We're excited about the summer. We think it's going to be a great contributor to us. It is a focus of us. We have teams, like I said, that are dedicated to it and it's a great opportunity, especially, for the Southeast portfolio as well. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Thank Kaumil. [Operator Instructions]
Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi John, Edwin, and Cameron, how are you? Excellent Jeffrey. Very well. Good to hear. So, when may we see Tropical Vibe coming, this summer? It is this summer. What's your Vibe for this summer; we had such a great successful launch with our Peach Vibe. We were bringing back another Vibe; it's going to be What's Your Vibe for Summer. It's Tropical Vibe. It's actually right now you can pick it up at 7-Eleven, nationwide authorization at 7-Eleven. So, to go to your local 7-Eleven, you can pick some up and it's -- tastes amazing, great flavor profile. The team did a great job and it disappears here around the office. Got it. Okay. Can you talk about the test portfolio, you said it was going to be coming via Amazon in Q2, can you give us an indication of a number of SKUs we'll see? Yes, we're doing a really methodical rollout. We're seeing -- what we'll see is two SKUs that will be launched on Amazon initially as an exclusive launch in partnership with them. And then we'll continue to scale to grant from that point. So, initial feedback has been very positive on testing. We've been doing a lot of consumer testing as well as working with Amazon very closely.
So, we think it's going to be a great addition to a snacking product -- the FAST growing protein snacking category, which has a lot of momentum. And we have a lot of interest from a lot of our partners. Fantastic. Could you talk about the sticks a little bit, because of the issues going on with the cans, have the sticks picked up some share from your standpoint on the growth side and the aggregate numbers? No, as additional line extension and also expanded usage occasion, our powder products overall represent an immaterial portion of our topline revenue number. But they are growing. We're seeing a lot of growth and we're also seeing a lot of interest from retailers, mainly vitamins specialty and online, but now we're seeing interest from CVS, Publix, and Walmart and several other customers as well, where they're looking to carry the sticks as additional offerings.
And so there's a lot of opportunity there. We have come out with new flavors. We got a lot of different flavors planned in the pipeline and the feedback is extremely positive on our powder products. And also looking at opportunities potentially to expand our heat portfolio and our heat offerings into a powder on-the-go option as well. So, getting interest there, but the bulk of our revenue today is those RTDs. Got it. And then lastly, for me, if you could provide any commentary. I know we've got a fair amount of data on the ordering trends, but can you give us any flavor from what you're sensing as far as new customer, new customer acquisitions, reordering stickiness of current customers out there, that would be helpful? Thank you. Excellent Jeffrey. The stickiness of existing customers has been extremely positive as we -- as many of us on the call know we're very passionate about Celsius, we're -- our consumers and I speak to many of you. And it's -- the sticking power of the brand is incredible. We're seeing that you go back to even -- 7-Eleven we're launching our Tropical Vibe with them as we speak. And we've been with them for over -- going on four and a half, five years now and many of our retail partners, so we continue to gain more shelf space, better placements in stores, cold availability. So, we're really excited.
And in regards to the new distribution coming on, we feel we're up to 192,000 locations today. We'll be firm north of 100,000 locations by the end of this year for sure. So, lots of interest. We're also getting a lot of good new team members joining our team as we continue to scale and grow and bringing great relationships that we'll be able to further leverage. Super. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Great quarter. Thank you, Jeffrey. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Yes, just in terms of DSD, John, you guys have made a huge push into the DSD network understanding that not every market is amenable or not every store; every market can be a DSD, depending on where that market is.
Can you give us a general idea of what is the maximum penetration you see from your current -- in your current customer base? Where could you get to and approximately where are you at in terms of the percentage penetration? Yes, thank you, Anthony. We're very much focused on DSD, just with the velocity levels that we see at retail. And the demand for the brands, you have to build this company on a DSD national network. We just -- as we were seeing in 2019, you just can't keep it in stock, we're in too high of a velocity category. So, we've been building out our national DSD network, we’re at about 85% major metropolitan markets, we have closed additional distributors. To close those gaps to be able to transition our key accounts over to DSD and as we speak, we are expanding on the West Coast as an example, 7-Elevens -- almost 1,500 -- actually almost 2000 7-Elevens are being migrated over to DSD as we speak, and we'll be going further in division-by-division, also working with CVS for their targets, and all of our major retailers.
So, we would like to see a big significant portion of our distribution service through DSD and we're committed on that. We haven't provided percentages of where that is, but over time, I would like to see a considerable percentage of our retailer service by DSDs, better placement, better in stocks, better execution, and most importantly, better velocity and better revenues. Make sense. Okay. Good. And then just on the aluminum cans shortage, because this has come up on other conference calls for companies that are in your situation? Based -- I guess, on your earlier comments, you're expecting -- and did you say by the end of this year, for that shortage to be alleviated? I guess is it because of the ramping in U.S. production or can you just give us a little more color on your expectations there? Yes, absolutely. So, what's happening in the industry is that just due to the increase in demand for cans, the U.S. manufacturers just do not have the capacity. So, you heard to her Rodney Sacks on the Monster call most recently, he's -- every brand is running into -- every company in the can business and in beverage business is running into the same issues. There's just not enough capacity out there.
All the major players are adding a capacity lines, unfortunately, it just takes time to put these lines and we expect some of the production and the capacity will come on towards the back half of 2021, we're hearing into 2022 and beyond, but it's going to take time to ramp that up.
The other thing is what happens as the country continues to open, consumers go back to on-premise with fountain and demand for cans goes down. That's all to be determined. So, that's a fluctuation that could come into play here where we can source more U.S. cans and have quicker timeframe.
But right now we are secured with international cans and U.S. cans, domestic cans to meet our forecast demands and our internal expectations for 2021 and into 2022 and beyond. We have secured those. So, now it's a matter of mix and how we move forward in regards to our margin profile. We talked about in Q1 41% gross profit, mainly that's derived; we had a lot of wrapped cans. We also had a lot of rework during the quarter and increases in transportation. So, we'll continue to optimize that with non-wrapped cans which are better for our margins. So, -- and then -- but we'll have that mix from international and domestic, which will optimize as we go forward. Okay, great. And then just the last question on international sales, I know you said you're looking to expand in Europe, but can you also talk about the Middle East as well what's your expectation for that expansion by the end of this year and moving into 2022? We're working -- potentially the U.K. and Germany, that's an area we've been focused on and exploring. We're talking to potential distributors. We don't have a timeline for that, but it is an area of opportunity for us that the team has been focused on.
Also, you mentioned the Middle East; we do have a distributor locally in the Middle East and we're working with several others on an import basis. But it's all timing and sequencing at this point. And COVID has impacted a lot of that -- some of these discussions, but we are in discussions and things are moving forward.
Edwin, you wanted to make comment as well? Yes, I was just going to say, John, to me, the key is that we limit the footprint as much as possible. And we use the model going through distributors, so that we minimize the risk and current including currency risks, and so forth. And that -- to me, that's been the successful model and hopefully, we can continue to expand using that model. Okay, great. And once again, thanks for clarifying the internal control. I think that was a good way to kick-off the call to put that to -- put that question to rest. So, appreciate that and I'll turn it back over to you. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Anthony. Our next question is a follow-up question for the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Pleased to see with your question. Thanks for taking a second one guys. On international, you think about the international rollout, can you talk a bit about the marketing and your marketing intentions, sounds like -- you're looking to get into new regions and such maybe more maybe more aggressively than you would have discussed six to 12 months ago. And obviously, there would have to have a bit of a marketing overlay on that. So, can you talk about what the plans are? And ideally, if you can, what sort of the investment would look like? Yes, Kaumil, thank you. As we mentioned, we're going through more of a distributor model where we're importing and we allow -- it's a collaborative effort with the margins that are generated through the sales as well as our support as well that it'll be fairly limited.
Initially, it is a more methodical rollout that we are strategic approach as we enter a market. We don't have plans to invest heavily ahead of revenue in any of these markets. So, we'll be sticking with our positive ROI-driven model that we that we've indicated on many calls, and over the last several years.
So, we're looking for positive ROI investments as we go forward. Some of the initial relationships, there could be in regards to the margins and both contributing, there could be some investments, but it'll be generally material. Okay, great. Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum. We're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place in today's energy drink category.
Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy, and team, and a large rapidly growing market that consumers want.
Our mission is to get Celsius to more consumers profitably. I'm very proud of our dedicated team, as without them our tremendous achievements, and the significant opportunities we see ahead would not be possible.
So, believe we'll be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and we are well-positioned to thrive in the transformation of today's energy drink category.
In addition, I thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Thank you everyone for your interest in Celsius. Be safe, stay healthy, and have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue, Investor Relations for Celsius Holdings. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings' second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Edwin Negron, Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and instructions will be given at that time.
The company filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC and initiated a press release today. All materials are available on the company's website celsiusholdingsinc.com under the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, before I turn the call over to John, an audio replay will be available later today.
Please also be aware, this call may contain forward-looking statements which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of August 12, 2021. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. Except to the extent as required by law, Celsius Holdings undertakes no obligation and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly for his prepared comments. John? Thank you, Cameron, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our record second quarter results are representative of the momentum that the CELSIUS brand is achieving across the board, with increased sales growth, SKU expansion, distribution gains, increased brand recognition and increased organic social support adjust some of the drivers supporting what we feel has been a significant step-up for the company. We believe this also provide leverage to drive further acceleration in market share gains.
Total sales for the quarter totaled $65.1 million, up 117% from $30 million in the year ago quarter. Our domestic revenue increased to 157% to $53.7 million, up from $20.8 million in the year ago quarter, with both of these percentage growth rates, the highest in our history. Two of the highest hardest hit channels from COVID are fitness channel and vending channel each had triple-digit growth, which contributed approximately $4.9 million of incremental revenue when compared to the prior quarter.
International sales growth grew 25% to $11.5 million, primarily from a 23% growth in Nordic sales of $10.8 million. Even with the record second quarter and first six months of 2021, we are still dealing with the impacts of COVID-19, including in our International markets, increased costs in raw materials and transportation. Our fitness channel and vending channels saw tremendous growth of both a year-over-year period and sequential basis with positive trends continuing into the third quarter. Although, the comparable basis from the second quarter of 2022 was the low mark for both of these channels, the great growth rate and total sales for each continued to improve.
Our EU, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Australia operations remained adversely affected by COVID-19 with varying restrictions and lockdowns in these markets. Overall, we have been seeing sequential improvements over the last several quarters with capacity restrictions as well as reopenings in the hardest hit channels, but there still remains a lot of uncertainty, as there potentially could be reclosings due to new variance and cases increasing in our regions of operations, which could force extended closures in some states and countries. The health and safety of our employees and partners remains our top priority and the safety precautions have been implemented, which we have developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities.
The aluminum can shortage driven by COVID and impacting the entire industry remains in place, but for Celsius we believe we are well positioned from our proactive sourcing of international cans and new relationships with top can manufacturers in the US, which have been initiated major expansion projects and continued to anticipate the completion of this expansion in the back half of 2021 through 2022. We implemented our contingency plans around production and which imported can production started in March of 2021. We anticipate 50% of our can supply for 2021 be derived from imported and wrapped cans, which should decrease late in 2021 and through 2022. We expect a significant majority of cans will be sourced domestically in 2022, improving our margins, and at this point, we believe Q1 of 2021 was the low point for margins with the back half of 2021 showing sequential improvements towards our physical year 2020 levels.
In addition, the team is expanding warehouse distribution sites to six regional orbit model to drive efficiencies, implementing plans to further secure raw materials with minimum floor stock programs, blanket purchase orders and second and third alternatives of suppliers. The teams continue to quickly adapt to new COVID environment and are focused on driving efficiencies and operational performance and believe with our significantly expanded scale, we have the opportunity to leverage this to reduce input costs as we move forward. We have also further integrated and leveraged synergistic benefits from our global operations, focusing on marketing operations, financial integrations, implementing our strategy to build a global dominant iconic brand.
The company improved our fill rates through the second quarter from the 80% level in Q1, driven by shipping delays and can shortages, gas shortages in the East Coast and the Texas freeze which impacted our co-packers and warehouses for several weeks. We ended the second quarter in June at approximately 90% fill rate and expect to see this improve further in the back half as we continue to reach normalized levels of inventory.
Turning to some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Our domestic sales revenue topped $53.7 million, was driven by accelerating triple-digit growth in traditional channels of trade, expansion of world-class retailers and further activation and growth from our distribution partners. Our DSD, Direct Store Delivery network delivered growth of 333% and our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year.
Our fitness channel as discussed, sales increased over 300% from the prior year in addition to our vending growth which saw over 250% growth rate, which together contributed that $4.9 million of incremental revenue when compared to the prior year. As of July 1, we have over 18,500 vending micro market placements and we expect that growth to continue throughout the year as we drive additional new national distribution agreements with Performance, Food Group, contracts and additional several regional agreements.
In addition, all major chains at our gym, fitness channel expanded SKUs where we further expanded our new offering, our new flavor, our Tropical Vibe and our Strawberry Guava flavor, which is now the number one selling flavor in the fitness channel. On a mass club, channel continues to accelerate. We are now fully rolled out nationally in all 561 Costco locations. In addition in target, we have converted approximately 95% to DSD and are also in process of launching four-packs.
On our convenience channel side in North America, which represents the largest market in the energy drink category over $10 billion in annual sales. The latest SPINS data shows an 86% year-over-year increase for Celsius product portfolio in the convenience channel compared to a 9.1% overall growth in the energy category, while Celsius is only holding 17.1% ACV, which truly shows the opportunity we have lying ahead as we continue to further expand. Through this year we have added over 19,000 convenience stores to the last 12 months with additional accounts expected anticipated as fall resets take place. This is per SPINS shelf stable energy functional beverage convenience, 52 weeks ending July 11, 2021.
Industry-backed third-party data continues to show accelerated growth metrics. We are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we continue to increase our ACV across channels through additional launches with nationwide retailers chains and transforming our existing distribution to our DSD service model network. Consumer demand for Celsius accelerated through the second quarter of 2021 with most recent reported Nielsen scan data as of July 3, 2021 showing sales of Celsius were up 193% year-over-year for the two weeks ending and 195% for the 12 weeks ending with a 1.6 share of the total energy drink category over the last four weeks.
On Amazon, CELSIUS is the third largest energy drink with a 13.12% share of the energy drink category just 1.32% share behind Red Bull at a 14.44% share and 18.13% behind Monster at a 31.25% share last 52 weeks ending July 10, 2021 Stackline, Energy Drink Category, Total U.S. And for the four weeks ending July 3, 2021 category sales including shots surged a 104.5% with bank sales up 216.1%, CELSIUS sales were up 133.1%, Red Bull sales were up 109.4% and Monster sales were up 59.9%. According to Stackline, latest year-to-date LEADERBOARD Ranking, most popular search brands in the U.S., Grocery Department, CELSIUS is the number one fastest growing brand while positioned at 18 overall for the reporting period ending July 3, 2021.
We continue to see acceleration and are now beginning to also see the additional lift from the conversion of our accounts to our national DSD network. This delivered growth of 333% in our distribution revenues when compared to the prior year second quarter. We secured additional distribution agreements with partners in the Anheuser-Busch – independent Anheuser-Busch network, independent PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and MillerCoors network further expanding availability to new regions as Celsius builds out its national distribution network, which now includes over 190 regional direct store delivery DSD partners distribution centers now covering approximately 90% of major metropolitan markets and 85% of total U.S. counties are now covered.
We also filled one of the major gaps in our DSD network is the Mid-Atlantic region, adding additional securing initially additional three new distributors in that region, which were signed up in the second quarter. Transitioning to DSD continues with our retail partners with 45% of retail stores are now serviced by DSD. Key accounts converted with over 75% transitioned to DSD include Target, Walmart, RaceTrac, Kroger, Circle K, Speedway, Murphy's USA with CVS and 7-11 also in the process with more being transitioned in the back half of 2021 and through 2022.
Our rollout of Celsius branded coolers in the second quarter, total approximately 300 and now have over 500 placed in the market through the first six months of 2021. We have also implemented additional comprehensive tracking tools to leverage our growth and accelerate the metrics and through the retail partners. We expect additional cooler placements to the back half of this year at similar or increased numbers as we continue to see strong velocity rates and increased store sales.
Today in the United States, our total door count now exceeds over 100,000 locations, which is a major milestone and grew over by 20,000 doors in the beginning of 2021, with additional expansion planned throughout the rest of this year as retailers resets take place. On our co-packer front, we continue to expand our partners and scale at existing locations, improving our line time priority. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint now totals nine active locations, which will help fuel our growth and limit our out-of-stocks and support the national massive growth opportunity that lies ahead.
During the second quarter, we increased our inventory levels up to $63 million, up 27% from $36 million at the end of the first quarter to support our growth and increased warehouse distribution centers and to better service our customers and meet demand as well as increased our inventory of raw materials.
In Europe, Nordic, sales increased 23% versus the prior year, helped by the growth of our CELSIUS portfolio and the launch of two new flavors of Tropical flavors. In addition, our Global Celsius EMEA packaging launched in Finland where initial results have been extremely positive and has been further rolled out to a top main retailer SOK expanding to 832 locations. The FAST portfolio experienced out of stocks during the quarter due to co-packer delays associated with COVID which has started to normalize in the back half of the quarter.
Celsius sales made up for the reduction in the FAST portfolio to drive positive growth in territory. We also have initially a soft launch the FAST portfolio in the U.S. through Amazon. We continue to evaluate the timing of additional European expansion markets. We are confirmed to launch the first Amazon EU market of UK and Germany in the back half of 2021 and expect to launch additional EU countries through 2022 including Sweden, Spain, Italy, France and several others.
In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market, where our distributor covers approximately 76 cities and over 60,000 locations of distribution. Our other international markets have been impacted, both the in-country service and by our co-packers supporting these countries due to COVID impacts. We anticipate that these geographies once fully opened will provide additional long-term growth opportunities. As with Europe and the United States, we see significant opportunities to capitalize on a global scale, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better for you offerings in this enormous Asian market.
Now moving to the marketing. On the marketing front, we continue to activate, targeting consumers, they live, work and play building meaningful and emotional connections through robust integrated marketing programs. Specifically during the quarter, despite the COVID restrictions we sponsored targeted programs both in-person and virtual. We further expanded and integrated our experiential sampling Live Fit Tour in Florida, Texas and California and other markets as well. In addition, we further expanded our brand ambassadors influencer programs reaching more consumers in a meaningful way.
In addition, on June 9, 2021, the company completed an offering which generated net proceeds to the company of approximately $67.8 million and tended use of proceeds, primarily for growth capital, including building of inventory to support our sales growth, leveraging and optimizing our warehousing, targeting – investments in targeted marketing programs, as well as the expansion of the Celsius branded Cooler program. We have reached another inflection point in our operations and growth, one which positions Celsius for exponential sales and market share growth.
With this, we have been proactive in the building that Celsius team to maximize the opportunity as well as with key partners such as Ernst & Young as our corporate auditors beginning in the third quarter of 2021. Our national DSD network is in place with our retail partners accelerating distribution, which we have only just begun to recognize the incremental growth associated with these transactions. Our team is ready and our infrastructure is in place to support the sales growth we expect on an expedited scale.
I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. First, I wanted to cover the June 9 public offering led by UBS and Jefferies. The company issued and sold 1,133,953 shares of common stock, approximately 1.7% dilution and the selling stockholders sold 6,257,455 shares in the aggregate of common stock in the offering at a price of $62.50. The offering generated net proceeds for the company of $67.8 million with net proceeds for selling stockholders of $375 million.
The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, such as working capital financing, expanding our Celsius branded cooler program and expanding our warehouses and distribution model to reduce miles on cans and better service our distributors.
Now turning to the second quarter results. Our second quarter revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was approximately $65.1 million, a robust increase of $35.1 million which translated into a significant growth of 117% from $30 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Approximately 94% of this growth was a result of increased revenues in North America where 2021 second quarter revenues were $53.6 million, a considerable increase of $32.8 million or an impressive 157% increase from the 2020 quarter. The balance of the increase was largely attributable to a 23% growth in European revenues, to $10.8 million in the 2021 quarter from $8.8 million in the prior year quarter.
Asian revenues, which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were $619,000, an increase of 89.9% from $326,000 for the prior year quarter. This increase was provided for in our licensing agreement. Other international markets generated $62,000 in revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $45,000 from $107,000 for the prior year quarter, mainly related to an operational restructuring in the Middle East.
The total increase in revenue was mainly related to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in an optimization of our presence in world-class retailers. Additionally the continued expansion of our DSD network resulted in significant growth in distribute – in distributor revenues when compared to the prior year quarter.
We also achieved triple-digit growth in our fitness and vending channels in the 2021 quarter, which contributed considerable incremental revenue when compared to the prior year quarter during which time many fitness facilities were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we estimate that the strengthening of the Europe accounted for approximately 2.3% of the increase in European revenue in the 2021 quarter from the prior year quarter.
Gross profit for Q2 increased by approximately $15.2 million or 117% to $28.2 million, from $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Gross profit margins reflected a nominal increase to 43.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, from 43.3% for the 2020 quarter. Excluding freight, as some of our competitors do not include this as cost of goods sold, our adjusted gross profit for the second quarter would translate to 51.8% compared to 50.5% in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in gross profit dollars is mainly related to increases in volume, while the nominal increase in gross profit margins is mainly related to lower processing costs and repackaging costs. We estimate that the increase in gross profit dollars of approximately $15.2 million from 2020 quarter to the 2021 quarter reflected $14.4 million related to volume increases as well as favorable cost impact of approximately $25,000 and favorable currency impact of $796,000.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were $15.5 million. An increase of $7.6 million or 96.2% from $7.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to additional marketing investment activities, which resulted in an increase of $4.2 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Additionally, employee costs increased by $900,000 from the year ago quarter as we continue to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth. Additionally, we're now incurring in travel and business expenses as we are able to resume our in-person marketing events and selling activities. Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales expenses in the amount of $795,000 mainly related to trade marketing activities to support our ongoing DSD network expansion.
Lastly, storage and distribution expenses, as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area of $1.7 million from the 2020 quarter. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses amounted to 23.9% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 26.2% in the second quarter of 2020.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were $9.1 million, an increase of $5.2 million or 133% from $3.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to stock option expense, which amounted to $4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, or an increase of $2.8 million, which accounts for 51.9% of the total increase in this area when compared to the prior year quarter.
Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote overperformance. Additionally employee cost for the three months ended June 30, 2021 reflect an increase of $670,000 or 61%, as investments in this area are also required to properly support our higher business volume and the commercial and operational areas of the business. Additionally, travel and other similar expenses are now being incurred.
Administrative expenses amounted to $2.7 million or an increase of $1.4 million or 107.7% when compared to the prior year quarter. This variance is mainly related to an increase in bad debt reserve of $650,000 to properly cover any potential realization exposures. We also experienced increases in audit costs, legal expenses, insurance costs and office rent, which accounted for the majority of the remaining fluctuation of $750,000. Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $124,000 when compared to the prior year quarter. Lastly, all other administrative expenses, which were mainly composed of research, development, and quality control testing, increased by $200,000 when compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Total net other income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 amounted to $361,500 which reflects an increase of $51,500 when compared to the total other income of $310,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The total other net income of $361,500 is composed of foreign currency exchange gains of $178,000, miscellaneous other non-operational income of $108,000, interest income of $77,000 related to the note receivable from our China licensee, which were partially offset by miscellaneous interest expense of $1,400 pertaining to financial leases. The note receivable requires repayment by our licensee over five-year period. The note receivable is due from the licensee in accordance with his terms, even if the independent license arrangement is terminated.
As a result of the above, the net income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $3.9 million or $0.05 per share on a weighted average of 73.2 million shares outstanding and dilutive earnings of $0.05 per share based on a fully diluted weighted average of 77.2 million shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended June 30, 2020, the company had net income of approximately $1.6 million or $0.02 per share based on a weighted average of 69.4 million shares outstanding and dilutive earnings per share of $0.02 based on a fully dilutive weighted average of 71.5 million shares outstanding.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources, as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had cash of $83.8 million and $43.2 million respectively and working capital of $151 million and $66.2 million respectively with no long-term debt. Cash flows used by operating activities totaled $30.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, representing a $26.1 million increase from net cash used in operating activities of $4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The use of cash was mainly related to increase in our inventory levels in order to properly service demand for our products. Our net inventory increased $45.4 million from Q4 2020 to $63.8 million in Q2 of 2021. Excluding this significant increase in inventory, cash flow from operations would have totaled $15.1 million.
I also wanted to cover a few additional metrics we believe provide a good perspective of our operational performance using Q2 business volume as a basis. Our DSOs or daily sales outstanding were approximately 45 days. Our inventory days on hand were approximately 155 days and our payable – our days payable outstanding were approximately 31 days. Given our growth, these are very good working capital metrics. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $7.9 million or 12.2% of revenues. We believe this information of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding and visibility of our true business performance. To that effect, a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP figures has been included in our earnings press release.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thank you, operator. Hey everybody. A couple of questions. I guess, first you – there is meant to be quite a significant amount of I guess catch up shelf resets this fall, after some delays and those sorts of things. Obviously you've gained quite a bit of distribution. You have some momentum. Should we be expecting that to accelerate into those resets or do you think you've maybe captured a reasonable amount of what you would have captured at a reset, anyways we should just expect things to kind of continue along its current path? Thank you, Kaumil. This is John. When we look at resets, we added about 20,000 stores through the first six months of the year, reaching 100,000 doors is a major milestone for the company. What we're seeing, Coke Energy is getting listed out there right now and our team has been extremely aggressive potentially getting some of that space for us in the back half of this year as retailers are doing some mid-year cut-ins. So we do see some of the resets are a little bit unique given with COVID in 2020. There is some different timing on resets. So we are seeing shelf sets get – gaining additional distribution. We expect to gain additional distribution in Q3. Also the activation of the DSD network, really going after small format independents is a huge opportunity for us as we continue to activate this DSD network. So we anticipate stores to continue to grow. We'll see at the same rate, but early indications are we will continue to grow doors throughout the year and then as we anticipate larger resets happening in 2022. Got it. And then if I could ask about Europe. You mentioned that you are planning on launching an Amazon Europe in a series of markets. Can you maybe just add a little bit more detail on maybe the market size, what your expectations are for contribution in those launches that sort of thing? Yes, we've been talking about it for some time. We're obviously doing extremely well on Amazon in North America and working with the European partners and divisions over there. We're looking for really in Q3 to launch in the UK and Germany and other markets. Early indication, it is the overall size of the energy drink market on Amazon is not as large as the US. We do anticipate incremental revenue, but most importantly it gives us additional exposure as we expand into these markets. So think of it as air cover per se as we entered the UK and Germany and opportunity as we look for partners in retail as well as distributors. So lots of opportunity as we look to further expand throughout Europe, but in regards to significant dollars to top line, we'll see how it prevails, but we anticipate it to be incremental. Okay, great. And maybe a final question on margins. It sounds like you have quite a bit of confidence in getting your gross margins back up to where they were. But I guess was just under 47% last year. Is that what you are indicating when you're saying, we will sequentially get better to get back to that 40 – I guess 46.6% or was that, maybe longer range. Is that kind of a year – because the figure for what you intend to exit the year, what do you think you'll get the full year to? Yes, we feel in the back half of 2021 of this year, we're going to see sequential growth anticipated in the margins, as we've seen in Q1 and in Q2. There's a lot of variables out there, freight costs as well and in extremely volatile as well as we will be cycling through some imported cans and raw materials. So that will put some pressure on our margins in Q2 and potentially into Q4. We do anticipate more U.S. can manufacturing to be utilized toward the back half of 2021 and into 2022. And Edwin, I don't know if you want to add any additional color on that? Yes. Thank you, John. Yes, I agree, there's a lot of variables and the other one that I always like to emphasize is the parity between the U.S. dollar and the euro. And the dollar is strengthening. So I think that's also going to come into play as well. Again so difficult to kind of predict where we're going to land, but I always want to make sure that that's also taken into consideration. Yes. No. Good point. But we do anticipate the Q2 results at around 43% gross profit to anticipate being the floor as we continue to move forward. Okay, got it. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the question. How are you thinking about pricing in the energy drink category? And I guess, just maybe your ability to take pricing given some of the consumer loyalty metrics that you've seen? Yes, I mean consumer loyalty has been extremely high for us. That's more of a competitive advantage we have is our loyal fan base and regards to pricing, we do think there's opportunities on pricing as we continue to grow in scale. When we look at pricing right now, we're really watching what the other players in the category are doing and also same with Monster and many players really watching our promotional allocations, allowances and plans as we go forward to mitigate the overall frontline price increase. Great. If I could squeeze one more in. I just was curious just to how to understand the mechanics of the shift to DSD, and if that does have a drag on margins going forward? Yes, no, it's a great question. I mean there is somewhat of a transition. We are getting a top line dollars and we're giving up margin to move to our DSD network, but there's a lot of synergistic benefits that you receive on transitioning. So what we're seeing is, it's really potentially margin neutral. And also where we see opportunities as we grow further scale to really, really leverage some of those efficiencies on a larger scale operations as we continue to grow to further increase our margin. So at this point as we make the transition it has been fairly neutral. Yes, the way I would look at it as well is, from my perspective is, kind of short-term versus long-term or mid-term, initially, there may be an impact to contraction, but as John mentioned, then with the synergies and the other benefits we'll definitely be able to make that. Great. I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you, Sean. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, John and Edwin. How are you? Good morning, Jeff. Good morning Jeff. Excellent. Hey, just a bit of a follow-up on a couple of Kaumil's questions. As far as the big five plus in Western Europe, you're going to launch out on EU Amazon. Are there any plans for other channels to happen in the short to mid-term as far as the gym channels or retail? Yes, that is a massive opportunity. We are under discussions. We're looking at that with a variety of opportunities of potential partners. So more on that in the coming quarters. But at this point, our first step is to expand with Amazon and then we're looking for other partners in those markets where we are under discussions. Great. And then second for us, could you talk about the coolers and what we should expect for the back half and talk a little bit about some of the channels of velocity that you're getting to there and how that may roll out in some of the data in stores as far as what they're finding as far as the effect on the stores. Thank you. Yes, no, it's a great question. In regards to sitting here in 2019 and 2018, we had into 2020, we really had a lot of out of stocks at retail, just due to the velocity of the products. So moving to DSD is one step in enhancing our availability, maintaining that in-stock position and then taking it to the next step further is getting coolers placed strategically in locations where we really can drive a velocity and really service our customers, historically up and so really over 12 months ago the majority of our sales are all take home.
So with the cold availability that allows us to take part of the larger energy drink category, which is at immediate impulse purchase and when we're seeing when we place coolers in strategic locations where consumers are, we're seeing great returns on the investments in the coolers ROI and better servicing for our customers and also it's a greater partnership with our DSD partners. So I think of it like the salesperson as well when you see those coolers there. They look great. We are – I have indicated as I stated, we have about 500 that are currently placed as of June 30.
We have many more, we anticipate the place in the back half of this year and into 2022. We're working on some cooler programs with some larger retailers for 2022 as well. So really in a good place as we continue to service our customers better, where they live, work and play. Got it. And then lastly, first can you talk about the throughput rates previously 80% and 90% reported out this quarter. So we are just kind of steady state. And what are the push and pulls there involved? Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, fill rates in Q1 were roughly around 80%. We have increased those to the back half of the second quarter, mainly in June, getting to a 90% fill rate there. So we anticipate that to continue to sequentially increase over the next several months. Currently, in Q2 we're averaging right around that 94%, 93% fill rate, that should increase as we further increase our inventories. Moving to this six orbit model of warehousing, also will allow us to drive some efficiencies. The key is to get the inventory levels at a – at the right level and then we'll be able to continue to improve fill rates. Thanks again. Congrats on the strong retail. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. And thanks for taking my questions. Just any update you can give us on where we are on CVS and 7-11's progress on flipping to maxed out DSD? Yes. Great question, Jeff. In regards to 7-11, we continue to make progress each and every day. The whole West Coast division has been turned over. We're working on the Southeast Division and several other regions. So, we seem to have a full support of 7-11 really closing the gaps now that we have about 85% of every-county covered in the U.S., really gives us further grip. Our DSD team really made great strides in the second quarter, securing the final pieces of some of these counties that needed to be covered in order to flip over the zones. So really excited on 7-11. That's going to continue to transition there.
And then CVS, we make – we're making progress on that each and every day. More zones or more DCs are being converted. Still have a lot of work ahead to continue to move forward, mainly with the Anheuser-Busch network. There is some challenges on alcohol services – alcohol distributor servicing, some nuances there we're working through. But all in all, everyone is in favor and flipping over to DSD. And then the CVS, if you look at it, we have full shelves across the country. So lots of opportunity to drive volume to better service our customers. Okay, great. And then any – are you anticipating any impact on the fitness and vending channel with the resurgence of COVID or do you think we're beyond that? Yes, it's a great question. I mean we saw great growth in the second quarter in our fitness and vending, but between the both of them were up $4.9 million. We haven't seen it slowdown yet. That is definitely a concern we're having. We're taking additional protocols and safety measures throughout the whole company. Time will tell. At this point, we're seeing, especially in Florida, Texas, and many markets, we're seeing the gyms are coming back. So people are very cautious, but it seems to be a growing opportunity for Celsius. So time will tell. I don't have a great answer on that, but we're watching, monitoring that closely and we're aggressively pursuing those markets. Okay. And then if I could just squeeze in one more. If you could touch on the launch of the four-packs? Yes, the launch of the four-packs, Jeff, you've been with us for some time as well. When you look at where we've been, it's the company transition to a single strategy to drive trial and awareness, and now due to our velocity has increased exponentially, especially in grocery mass, there is opportunities for further pack size, and I think everyone has been talking about multi-packs. So what we've introduced strategically is further expanding the multi-pack offerings and the four-packs going into Target is a great win for the company. It just shows you the velocity.
We started off with three singles, three flavors, four flavors, five flavors expanded stores, now we're taking that partnership to the next level with four-packs and soon to be a multi-pack, we're working on as well as we look at 2022. So lots of opportunities there, but definitely take home, larger take home is going to increase our over velocity as well versus people buying one or two cans, you can pick up multiple packs. It's worked really well for us at publics as an example, where we have singles and four-packs. So expect more four-packs and multi-packs coming in the back half of 2021 and then into 2022. Thanks, and best of luck. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks, good morning guys. Good morning, Anthony. Good morning. So in terms of the branded coolers, that seems to be going well. Can you give a little more color around the metrics? When you put in a branded cooler and then cap or at the checkout what do you see in terms of velocity or sell-through for that versus before you had the branded cooler in there? I mean it's all about retail execution for us. I mean we're working on. Our teams are expanding. We are expanding our DSD support teams, our field marketing teams. We have great merchandisers and sales support teams we're building across the country. And it's all about now that our brand awareness continues to grow our velocity grows. We need to have additional placements in stores. Our goal is to have three placements in every store. We want to be three points of disruption, we call it.
As well as the importance of cold in an end cap. So that's a big initiative that strives. I mean it's important that we have that also additional stock on the floor in these retailers, but what we're seeing is the end capital drive with additional incremental rep, volume and velocities and then the cold equipment once it's in and you get cold placement at the proper location it grows even further exponentially there. So there's a lot of opportunity at placing cold equipment in the right locations in these are getting retailers in our given markets and we're just at the beginning of that. Okay, great. And then in terms of being able to meet the demand out there, I think right now we have around nine co-packers if that's correct. Is that based on your six to 12 month plan right now from what you could see? Is that sufficient or are you looking to add more co-packers at this point? We're always talking and looking for great partners. Great partners build great brands and great company. So constantly talking with new co-packers and potential partners, we do feel we have the nine co-packers now that are active will solidify our growth for the next 12 months depending on how things go. We're looking for further partners as well. We do have Paul Storey that joined the company. So he has been incremental building out our operations team, as our EVP of Operations.
So he comes with a great wealth of knowledge and also potential partners. So lots of opportunity there. I mean if you look at our – the velocity, the production levels that we've been producing over the last two months, we've produced more product than we did in all of 2020. So we are really well positioned as we continue to fulfill the demand that's out there for Celsius. Okay, great, thanks very much. I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and their continued interest. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum. We are capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place in today's energy drink category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have an award-winning portfolio, strategy and team in a large, rapidly growing market that consumers want. We believe we'll be able to continue to navigate through the challenge ahead of us as a result of COVID-19 and we are well positioned to thrive in the transformation taking place in the category today.
In addition, I'd like to thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Next week we'll be hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting in August 19 at 2:00 PM in Boca Raton. Notices have been sent out to all shareholders with a record date as of June 30, 2021.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Cameron Donahue, Investor Relations for Celsius Holdings'. Thank you, you may begin. Thank you. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

Except to the extent as required by law, Celsius Holdings' undertakes no obligations in the same any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our Safe harbor statements contained in today's press release, and our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information. With that, let me turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for opening comments. John. Thank you, Cameron. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, Celsius not only achieved another sales record for the quarter, but beat our previous quarterly record from Q2 by almost 50%. Beating by 46% growth, on a sequential basis from Q2 2021. The Company accomplished this exponential growth despite their tremendous supply chain constraints that continue to impact the industry. In order to hit the majority of our orders during the quarter, we did have to sacrifice efficiencies on the margin side, which we believe are either one-time costs or short-term in nature, with specific identifiable processes we are implementing to improve our margin profile going forward. The largest onetime costs impacting margins during the quarter stemmed from the build out of our 6 orbit distribution warehouse centers, which we announced in the second quarter.
We expect to see tangible efficiencies in both miles on cases, freight costs, as well as reduced inventory stock-outs with our distribution partners going forward from this initiative. But we did have incremental costs in Q3 as we essentially moved from 2 main warehouse centers to 6, while also significantly expanding inventory runs with our co-packers. With this, we had excess freight costs as we built out an optimized inventory levels across our warehouses, which is reflected in our cost of goods. And we estimate impacted margins by approximately 3% for the quarter. In addition, we experienced increased freight costs associated with higher labor fuel costs, which we are monitoring. As on average freight costs have increased industry wide by 20% versus the prior year per DAT Trendlines who tracks freight trends nationwide.
In addition to short-term margin impacts, we continue to utilize international cans sourced, which carry a higher costs. When we place these can orders, we expected the vast majority to come in and be utilized during 2021. Unfortunately, many are still outside of the U.S. and all are waiting at ports to be unloaded, which have been offset by purchasing spot rate cans from the U.S. suppliers. But with the significant increase in aluminum's prices, spot rate increase significantly. With that said, a higher spot rate, as well as the higher import cans have impacted margin for the quarter by approximately 5.3%. With that said, we experienced short-term and one time margin impacts during the third quarter, which totaled approximately 7.5%.
When taking this into account, our normalized margins would've been approximately 47.2% for the quarter, including outbound freight. To further optimize our supply chain going forward, we have added 2 new contracts with 2 of the top U.S. can manufacturers for 2022, which will move us away from the higher spot rate purchases and international cans. We believe we have adequate U.S. cans source for '22 to support our growth. We will likely have to cycle though some of the international cans that have been delayed, depending on when they arrive and get delivered in the U.S. through the first 6 months of 2022. But we expect the vast majority of our cans will be from U.S. sourced on a contract basis, materially reducing our can costs versus 2021. Some other cost increases we saw in the third quarter, such as raw materials, co-pack fees, tolling fees, and inefficient less than load shipping costs, we expect the majority of these will be offset in 2022 as we continue to negotiate better pricing with our scale.
While it remains uncertain, the energy category is one of the lone outliers that have not increased pricing. Driven by the top 2 players in the space, we believe the key factor in that decision is due to the rapid growth in consumer demand for functional performance, energy drinks, and the associated increase in new brands coming to market. The smaller scale new entrants pay significant higher shipping, raw materials, co-pack fees, competition, and by not taking price, the top 2 energy drink place an outsized cost on the new entrants entering the market to protect our share. For Celsius, we have reached a critical mass where we will not be impact our ability to grow. As evidenced by the record third quarter, and the only downside is that some of the expedited scale based incremental margin improvements are being offset by cost increases that are not transitory.
Even with that, longer-term, we expect margin expansion throughout 2022. As stated prior, we have identified onetime and short-term cost increases, and have planned strategies to mitigate as we continue to optimize and transition our stores to DSD distribution with further future scale base benefits with our current growth trajectory. To conclude, our margin analysis, as we recognize revenue growth rates more than double in North America to over 200% and continue to accelerate further. We made a cautious decision in the third quarter to ensure that we had the operational infrastructure to support our revenue growth to much higher levels and fully take advantage of the opportunities to take market share at an increased pace. As such, we accelerated initiatives on several operational improvements to position us for exponential future growth, which impacted margins by approximately 7% just from the one-time items in the third quarter. Additional incremental near-term benefits will be recognized if price increases are initiated by the top brands to our 2022 expectation.
In the meantime, we are implementing and further evaluating our promotional strategies. We wanted to ensure we provided a detailed breakdown on margins, and that our forward expectations of continued leverage remained unchanged before we detail the record achievements accomplished in the third quarter. Our record third quarter results are representative of the momentum that the Celsius brand is achieving across-the-board. Revenue growth driven by continued new store additions, SKU expansion, coal placements, DSD coverage expansion, as well as continuing to transitioning existing accounts, brand recognition, influencers organically supporting Celsius are just a subset of the drivers that cumulated in the record for third quarter results in North America. Total sales for the quarter totaled $94.9 million up 158% from $36.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Our domestic sales revenue increased 214% to $84.5 million up from $26.9 million in the year-ago quarter, with both of these percentage growth rates the highest in our history and the North America sales up 58% from the second quarter sequentially.
We continue to see 2 of our hardest hit channels from COVID, our Fitness channel and our vending channel, not only rebound by the drive of new sales records with again, reaching triple-digit growth rates and contributing approximately $5.2 million in incremental revenue when compared to the prior year, international sales grew 5% to 10.4 million for the quarter and 18% through the first nine months of this year. We're still dealing with the impacts of COVID-19 most pronounced in the European markets, with all markets facing increased costs and raw materials, transportation. Our EU, Middle East, Southeast Asia and Australia operations remain adversely affected by COVID-19 with varying restrictions and lockdowns in the markets. Overall, we continue to see quarterly improvements over -- or quarter over quarter with capacity restrictions as well as reopening and the hardest hit channels. But there still remains uncertainty as there could be potential reclosing due to new variance during the winter months, and case increases in the regions of operations which could force closures in some states and countries.
Turning to some additional financial highlights for the quarter, our domestic revenue reached at $85.4 million, was driven by accelerated triple growth in our channels of trade, expansion with world-class retailers, further activation, and growth from our distribution partners. Direct store delivery network grew over 429% in revenues when compared to the prior year. Also, our club channel continues to accelerate following the expansion roll out of over 550 plus Costco Stores. In Q -- late Q2 to Q3, Costco growth now has been listed as just over a 10% revenue customer. We are also now rolling out onto their platform costco.com. In addition to Sam's Club, we're launching in several test markets during the fourth quarter, driven by the strong growth in Walmart. On the convenience channel side in North America, the latest spins data shows a growth of 205.5% year-over-year increase for the Celsius product portfolio and the convenience channel, compared to a 13.6% overall growth in the energy drink category as of October 3rd of 2021, last 12 weeks, while during the same period, our ACV increased 118% versus the prior year to 34.7% total ACV average.
Industry back third-party data continues to show accelerated growth metrics. And we are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we continue to accelerate our ACV across channels through additional launches with new nationwide change and transitioning existing accounts to our DSD network. Consumer demand for Celsius accelerated through the third quarter of 2021 to record levels with the most recent Nielsen (ph) scan data as of October 23rd, 2021, showing Celsius sales up over 205% year-over-year for the 2 weeks, plus 213% for the 4 weeks, and plus 204% for the 12-weeks, but they two share of the energy drink category overall for the last 4 weeks. This compares to the total energy drink category, which grew 14% year-over-year for the 2 weeks ending, and 12% for the 12 weeks ending over the same period. On Amazon, Celsius is the second largest energy drink with 18.4 share of the Energy Drink Category. 2.88% ahead of Red Bull at 15.5 share and just 7.6 share behind Monster Energy at 25.9 share last 4 weeks ending October 30th, 2021 per Stackline Energy Drink Category total U.S. Transitioning to DSD continues or remains the top priority with our retail partners due to the increased velocities that are gained through the preferred route to market.
Today, for our latest MULO retail sales data, we estimate that we have transitioned and initially optimized approximately 50% of the stores reporting into SPINS MULO channel, and have plan -- further plans and expansion with additional DSD partners through the back half of Q4 and into 2022. Some of the key retailers that have transitioned over 75% of their stores include, Target, Walmart, RaceTrack, Kroger, Circle K, Speedway, Murphy's USA with CBS and 7-Eleven also expanding in other markets. Historically, it takes an average 2 to 3 months to optimize stores once they had transitioned to DSD, before we see that increased velocity levels. In addition in transitioning retailers and activating our DSD network, we continue to rollout Celsius branded coolers in the third quarter with an additional 400 coolers placed and over 900 coolers for the first 9 months of 2021.
We have also implemented comprehensive tracking tools in place to monitor accelerate growth metrics with our retail partners and we plan additional cooler expansion initiatives through the remainder of 2021 with accelerated rollout in 2022. Today in the U.S., our total door count now exceeds 118,000 locations nationally, growing 38,000 doors or 48% from the beginning of 2021 with additional expansion plan throughout 2021 and into through 2022 as retailer resets take place. In Europe, our Nordic sales totaled $9.5 million compared to a similar amount in the prior year. The top-line revenue was impacted by a pullback in inventory fills in -- during the quarter, for our new global can launch in September, which also included a great fresh apple flavor. Our relaunch of the Celsius brand on our global uniform can design platform presents a great opportunity for further growth and synergistic alignment globally. Our market share in Sweden did decrease early in the third quarter with the pending can new redesign and launch but increased to 9.3% of the total energy market in Sweden in September.
In Finland, we launched a mint chocolate bar with a holiday-theme wrap highlighted with in-store displays to secure space during the holiday season. We also launched a great tasting new RTD protein line, which is launching in the fourth quarter with initial orders of over 300,000. We believe this is a great test market for our products with additional geographic expansion opportunities. Additionally, the FAST portfolio bar launched in the U.S., sales have been going extremely well and have actually increased 50% in the third quarter from the prior Q2 run rate, validating the opportunity for further U.S. expansion and potentially expanding in the fitness channel in 2022. We've recently also launched on Amazon EU expanding -- expansion begin in the United Kingdom with launched 3 flavors, 6 FAST bars and Germany also expanded and launched today, most recently with 3 flavors of the Celsius portfolio, and we expect additional EU countries to come online the fourth quarter and in Q1. In China, we are maintaining a licensing royalty model in the market where distribution covers approximately 76 cities and approximately 60,000 locations, and we see great opportunities in this growing market.
Now moving to the marketing, on a marketing front, we continue to accelerate and target new consumers and existing consumers where they live work and play. They have a meaningful and emotional connections through robust, integrated marketing programs, reaching more consumers each and every day. We're not only driving growth in the energy category, we're also expanding the demographics while bringing an industry-leading percentage of consumers from outside the category who are new. We have also reached another inflection point in our operations and growth, one which positioned Celsius for exponential growth and market share gains. We have committed the resources, both in personnel and operational infrastructure, to maximize this opportunity and support the incremental growth drivers on national DSD distribution platform has opened in the convenience store channel in the U.S.. We're also not only seeing significant expansion in ACV across all channels, but doing so while increasing our velocities at retail. We are in a unique position to see material concurrent growth in both due to we're just materially entering the most productive convenience channel in the U.S., while transitioning our existing accounts to DSD network, where we have seen incremental growth post-transition. Our team is ready, our infrastructure is in place to support the sales growth we expect on an expedited basis. I will now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. Our third-quarter revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, was $94.9 million. An increase of $58.1 million or 158% from $36.8 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2020. 99% of this growth was a result of increased revenues from North America, where third-quarter revenues for 2021 were $84.5 million or an increase of $57.6 million, or a robust 214% from $26.9 million in the 2020 quarter. The balance of the revenues for the 2021 quarter were mainly related to European revenues of $9.5 million, which were similar to the prior-year quarter. Asian revenues, which include royalty revenues from our China licensee contributed an additional $706,000, an increase of 157% from $275,000 for the prior-year quarter. Other international markets generated $177,000 in revenues during the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021, an increase of $32,000 or 22% from $145,000 for the prior-year quarter. Gross profit for Q3 increased by $20.2 million or 115% to $37.7 million from $17.5 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2020.
Gross profit margins reflected a decrease to 40% for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021, from 47.6% for the 2020 quarter. Excluding freight out, as some of our competitors do not include this charge as the cost of goods sold, our adjusted gross margin for the 2021 quarter was 49.8%, compared to 53.7% in the third quarter of 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars is mainly related to increases in volume, while the decrease in gross profit margins is mainly related to higher raw material costs, ocean freight, transportation costs, and repackaging costs. We estimate that the increase in gross profit dollars of $20.2 million included $28 million related to volume increases. An unfavorable cost impact of $7.4 million and a favorable currency impact of $31,000. Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021 were $22.6 million, an increase of $14.4 million or a 174% from $8.3 million where the 3 months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was mainly related to higher marketing investment activities, which resulted in an increase of $7.7 million when compared to the prior-year quarter.
Additionally, employee costs increased by $2.6 million from the year-ago quarter as we continue to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth as well as incurred in additional travel and business expenses since we are now able to resume in-person marketing events and selling activities. Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales and marketing expenses in the amount of $400,000 mainly related to trade marketing activities to support our ongoing DSD network expansion. Lastly, storage and distribution expenses, as well as broker costs, accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $3.7 million from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 23.8% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 22.6% in the third quarter of 2020. General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021 were $11.1 million.
An increase of $6.4 million or 134% from $4.8 million for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2020. This increase was mainly related to stock option expense, which amounted to $5.8 million for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021. An increase of $3.7 million, which accounts for 50% of the total increase in this area when compared to the prior-year quarter. Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote their over-performance. Additionally, employee costs for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021 reflect an increase of $1 million or 108% as investments in this area are also required to properly support our higher business volume. Administrative expenses amounted to $2.6 million or an increase of $1.3 million or 97% when compared to the prior-year quarter. This variance is mainly related to an increase in bad debt reserve of $200,000, and increases in audit costs, legal expenses, insurance costs, and office rent account for the majority of the remaining fluctuation of $1.1 million.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $200,000 when compared to the prior-year quarter. Lastly, all other administrative expenses which were mainly composed of research, development, and quality control testing, increased by $235,000 when compared to the second quarter of 2020. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 11.7% in the third quarter of 2021, when compared to 12.9% for the prior-year quarter. If we then exclude the non-operational stock option expense, general and administrative expenses for the 2021 quarter would amount to only 6% of revenues. Now turning to other income and expenses. Total net other expenses for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021 amounted to $353,000 which reflects an increase of $593,000 when compared to net other income of $240,000 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2020.
The net other expense of $353,000 is composed of foreign currency exchange losses of $328,000, net other expenses of $97,000, interest income of $77,000 related to the note receivable from our China licensee, which were partially offset by other interest expenses of $4,500. Net Income. As a result of the above Net Income for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, was $2.7 million or $0.04 per share based on a weighted average of $74.6 million shares outstanding and dilutive earnings of $0.04 per-share, based on a fully diluted weighted average of 78.4 million shares outstanding. In comparison for the 3 months ended September 30th, 2020, the Company had net income of $4.8 million or $0.07 per share based on a weighted average of $70.4 million shares outstanding and a dilutive earnings per share of $0.06 based on a fully diluted weighted average of $74.8 million shares outstanding.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of September 30th, 2021 and December 31st, 2020, we had cash of $61.4 million and $42.3 million respectively. And working capital of $157 million and $65 million respectively with no long-term debt. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $52 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, which compares to $3.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020. The use of cash is mainly related to the increase in our inventory levels in order to properly service demand for our Celsius products. Inventory increased by $104 million during the 9-month period ended September 30, 2021. Sequentially, inventory increased $58 million from the second quarter of 2021. Without this significant increase in inventory, cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended 2021 would have totaled $52 million. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator. You may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. A couple of questions. The first one, I guess prepared remarks went a little fast. Can you just -- when you were talking about pricing, did you say you have intentions to take price or that you're not taking pricing because of competition? Thank you for your question. Right now, we are evaluating it and we're really keeping a close eye on the market. Obviously, there are a lot of top tier players, but we are doing pricing strategies in regards to promotional strategies as we go forward and pricing architecture within the portfolio. But it is something we're looking at as we go forward. We do feel based on these one-time charges as regards to the importing of cans, as well as the freight costs we -- increases in freight costs, we've seen really moving to the 6 orbit model that we've talked about in the past. We can get back to more of a normalized gross profit, once we cycle through the imported cans and move away from the spot rate purchases. But it is something definitely we're looking at as we continue to go forward. We're seeing transitory increases in a variety of other costs. The question is are those permanent or transitory in which we're evaluating. And just your best guess from what you're seeing in the market at the moment, does it look like the competition is reducing promo, taking price in a way that would make it possible for you guys to follow? We are seeing that in the marketplace by other players, in regards to promotional strategy. So we're not the anomaly out there. Got it. And then if I can ask a little bit about maybe dissecting the growth between the incremental contribution, while the distribution gains that you're winning versus equivalent of same-store sales? I don't know if you can give us precise figures, but at least maybe give us some guidance on the growth which has been substantial. Is it 50-50 new distribution versus old? Is it 70-30? Can you give us a rough idea? Yeah. I think when you look at the numbers, it's quite -- the team is doing a great job. Number 1, with Coke Energy coming out, we all know that was discontinued. We were able to pick up a lot of incremental points of distribution and taking advantage of that. When you look at the number of stores that the team was able to capture during the period which keep in mind is outside of normal reset windows. That was a great win for us during the quarter. We're seeing same-store sales further increase as we move to migrate them more over to our DSD network.
Our DSD network performed phenomenally during the quarter when we were up over 400% there. The team is doing a great job, we got a lot of good processes in place to currently continue to optimize. We're nowhere near fully optimized within the distribution network where we are putting processes in place, team members. We've hired a variety of great team members that are well experienced and capable to continue to drive revenues here. And we also have our cooler placement strategy where we see great opportunities there to further leverage, as when we place a cooler with Celsius, we see exponential growth there in the existing accounts. So lots of opportunities on all fronts and we got strategies in place to leverage. Okay. And then just finally on what you're seeing in terms of the gyms and fitness business seems have very notably turned around. We understand there will be a mix effect away from that business, but maybe just what you're seeing in that channel would be helpful. Really, I highlighted the fitness channel. Obviously, that's been a core for Celsius since its inception. And it's great to see it continued to rebound there. Lots of opportunities. It's great seeing everyone going back. I think that just goes and further shows you the opportunity we have at Celsius; healthier, better for you, fitness forward position, Celsius is aligned with today's health-minded consumer. The health and wellness trends are even stronger now than ever before, and the transition is taking place and it's affecting the energy category. So we're in a really good spot. I think that's just good indicators to see that channel come back even in a stronger pace. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies, please proceed with your question. Great, thanks. Good morning, guys and congratulations on the continued momentum. Want to pick up on the same line of questioning, just around the U.S. business specifically and the conversion to DSD. We look at the Nielsen data, the distribution gains look great, and importantly, the velocity gains quite good as well. John, I think as you rightly pointed out the brand is still very underrepresented in the convenience channel, which is obviously a huge opportunity. Just a handful of questions here on this topic, just confirm, I think the number is 50% accounts have been switched over to DSD at this point, I think the longer-term goal was 80%. Just confirm those numbers and how quickly you can get to that long-term goal. Relatedly, how has distribution velocity tracked relative to the Company's own internal expectations? And then just lastly in this area, do you have any early reads on shelf space? What those gains could look like as you think about next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Yeah, thank you Kevin. In regards to the 50% number, I put out there in regards to -- that was MULO reported channels. So right now, we're at 50%. I think 80 -- still at 80% numbers ideal currently with our distribution map and network. We would like that number to go higher, but I think 80% would be a great number for the Company to continue to strive for. We're working on that, as we move into 2022, I think you'll see more of our distribution continuing to convert over, and also all the new distribution coming on that we anticipate is most likely being serviced by our distribution network. When you look at the velocities, the velocities are meeting our internal expectations. Velocities as you've seen in the scan data has continued to increase. So even as we are increasing our ACV, which is a good thing to see there, the brand's resonating well.
When you look at 2022 space opportunities, we're really excited about that. We just attended NACS, many of them on the call is the largest show in the country in the U.S. in the convenience channel, where we had a great booth, a great presence. and some of the initial feedback we got from the show is really positive and we don't know until resets take place likely around March, April time-frame, is usually when they take place in the convenience store industry. But we feel really optimistic there. And initial feedback has been positive. We'll continue to keep everyone updated as we gain more distribution in stores, we won't know until the resets are final, but is probably one of the best next shows we've had in Company history, so really excited about that. Great. Thanks, John. Just pivoting to the margin outlook, but a little bit more longer-term oriented, I guess I would say, I think, there's an expectation in the marketplace that the margin potential here could be substantial over time. John and Edwin, for you as well, please. Just your updated thoughts on broadly your vision for this business. How you are balancing the market share opportunity with the substantial skill for margin improvement, understanding those dynamics are not mutually exclusive, but your updated thoughts, there would be helpful. And then I have 1 last follow-up. Thank you. Sure, Kevin, I think what's interesting if you look at our average scan on a per can basis has increased on the 12-week and 24. So we have been it reducing our promotions. So that promotional strategy has been taking place, and it hasn't decreased the velocity levels. So we do feel there's opportunities there as we scale. In regards to the overall margins, where we've historically said that we can get back towards pre - COVID margin profiles and our existing setup, we feel there's further opportunities to leverage our scale as we drive further volume, as well as the synergistic benefits of moving towards our 6 orbit distribution or warehouse model where we can better serve our customers in a more efficient, more effective manner and keep them in stock as well. There's a lot of opportunities there on a go-forward basis. I would agree with you. There is a lot of margin upside and the team is working on strategies to implement that. I will turn it over to Edwin as well. Yeah. Thanks, John. Yeah, absolutely, Kevin. I mean, one of the things that I wanted to add, you're absolutely right from my perspective as we continue to gain market share, which translates into additional volume, that's going to drive more synergies. And as we normalize or the supply chain normalizes going forward, that should also benefit. There are significant opportunities from our standpoint. And as John said, once we start getting the benefits of those 6 orbits, all those things should have a very good positive effect on margins. Got it. Thank you both. Just one last one for me and then I'll pass it on. Cash flow running negative, but the business requiring investment in coolers also inventory up and -- up to a degree greater than sales growth. Could you just provide your updated thoughts on your ability to fund the business organically at this point? What are your thoughts for the year, what are your thoughts looking out to next year as you think about the capital requirements to fund your top-line objectives? And I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. I'll jump in on the first part of that regards to our cash position. We feel we have sufficient cash to meet our demand, our needs are going to go forward basis. We did increase inventories that were strategic. We spoke about that prior as well. And we feel we're optimized. We're going to continue to invest in the business, in inventory, personnel, and resources as we continue to scale, so we can drive that optimal leverage and reach our goals. Sure. Yeah. I'd like to add, I mean, if we'd back out the inventory aspect or buildup, we would've delivered over $50 million of cash flow from operations, even if you back out all the working capital components to have a normalize your pro forma cash flow. We would've delivered over $13 million of cash. So I fully agree with John that the business is generating sufficient cash flow going forward, and we did make significant investments in the coolers. But, again, that's going to translate into incremental volume as well. There's no doubt going forward that we should be able to generate sufficient cash flow. And in the quarter, we also -- if you look at the prepaid balance in inventory, about $40 million, and that was strategically done to secure raw materials during the inventory constraints that we received in the COVID environment in Q2 and Q3. So taking that into effect, that should normalize and we shouldn't have significant pre -pays on a go-forward basis as the environment gets more normalization. Very good. Thank you, both. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley, please proceed with your question. Good morning, and let me add my congratulations on the phenomenal revenue growth. Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. On SG&A, and I know you mentioned one-time items associated with the 6 orbit warehouse strategy. Can you maybe speak about any extraordinary costs and expenses you anticipate into Q4 and early '22? Around that, just wondering when are we to expect those inputs around the 6 orbit strategy to be more normalized, and then I guess -- what sort of contribution to P&L leverage could we see in '22 from that? Yes. Thank you, Jeff. The team's working really hard, I appreciate the question. In regards to forward-looking information rocket to provide any true forward-looking guidance on leverage, specifically on that we do see in the short-term, our warehouse costs will increase going to the 6 orbit because we're investing ahead of our overall top-line revenue. So just keep that in mind that our warehousing costs will increase as we're moving from 2 warehouses, move to 6 warehouses, will have those into the full fourth quarter and beyond where revenue needs to scale up to get that margin profile. Also, keep in mind also we are investing in marketing as well of them so come back extremely strong in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. The Company is investing in marketing, really touching those consumers where they live, work, and play. But as we go forward with the growth rates we're seeing, we feel we're making the right moves in infrastructure resources to really be able to continue to drive top-line revenue and market share within the operation -- channels we're operating in. Edwin, you want to add anymore additional comments? Sure. And I think Jeff mentioned to you all in the G&A area. Yeah, we had -- I mentioned an increase in the bad debt reserve, about $200,000. And, again, that's driven by the more volume that we have. We want to be conservative in that area. And we're seeing also some increases in professional expenses, again, to support the business. So those kind of things are in there as well and have impacted our profitability. Okay. Fair enough. And then, it seems like you have a pretty substantial opportunity to grow the business in Europe outside of the Nordics, just wondering if you could speak more about plans for further rollout into Germany and the U.K. Yeah. We're really excited to initially start and be able to service those markets through Amazon. So we're really excited about that opportunity, and we're talking to significant larger distributors in those markets as well. Really, when the -- when you look at the success of the U.S. that is gaining a lot of interest as well overseas with substantial potential partners. So the Company is evaluating. Our main focus is North America as well. We continue to optimize and grow in the Nordics. But as we see opportunities in additional markets, we'll continue to evaluate. And the U.K. and Germany is the area of great opportunity for Celsius and we expect to further optimize initial is the rollout with Amazon and we're looking for partners locally to continue to drive scale. Yeah. I agree. And I'm to me the key is like John has mentioned you to have a light model there, in other words, go through either partners like Amazon or distributors where we don't have to make a significant investment, setup legal entities in the countries, that type of thing. And that's the more profitable model. We can invoice in U.S. dollars and avoid any of the effects exposure. Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one more, just wondering about the roll-out of the FAST bars beyond Amazon and also the protein drink line roll-out? Yes. Regards to the FAST bars, we've been -- it's a very methodical approach. We're investing as we see increase sales invest and initially tested it in the second quarter on Amazon. So we have placed additional orders for the bars, they taste great. Initial feedback has been extremely positive in the U.S. We are currently importing the bars from Europe, so we have some supply constraints, but we're working with the manufacturer to be able to produce in the U.S. on a go-forward basis. So the businesses under evaluation, we're really learning about the consumers and how best to go-to-market, to drive scale efficiently and profitably.
So initial feedback has been really positive, like I said, sales were up 50% on Amazon with the FAST protein snack portfolio in the U.S. What is very excited as well, the team in Finland launched a new protein RTD indulgence product line, which just tastes extremely amazing. Initial feedback has been extremely positive and it launched with initial orders roughly around 300,000, which is extremely a success. So we're evaluating that. We see a lot of opportunities as we continue to expand and grow into the protein space, mainly in Finland where a FAST protein snack portfolio is one of the top-selling brands and with this protein line, we are able to increase our overall margin profile versus the prior products so team's doing a great job, we'll continue to evaluate that as we continue to grow in scale. Okay. Thanks and best of luck in the remainder of Q4. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, John and Edwin, how are you? Hello. Excellent, Jeffrey. Doing well. Just a little follow-up on Jeff's question. Can you talk about number of SKUs now in installment on the FAST line and then talk about SKUs on the protein line as far as actual numbers? I think you had at the moment, 2 SKUs that you've introduced in the U.S. Yeah, we have. We have 2 flavors now currently available and online on Amazon. We are also looking at additional flavors to further drive a variety of offerings there. So we're continuing to evaluate the supply chain of importing them into the U.S. obviously, it's challenging, so we don't want to drive too much scale. We do want to build our consumer following, and that's what the teams are doing right now. And we look into 2022 of potential rolling out additional channels of opportunity once we can produce locally, and really drive efficient margin profile to further invest in the brands, the FAST brand in the U.S. Right now in Finland they launched an initial RTD protein line which is an indulgence product. It tastes phenomenal. The team is extremely excited about that initial rollout has been positive. Comes in three great flavors currently. And we'll continue to evaluate that. And as it continues to -- there is, obviously, synergistic opportunities to further scale in other markets as we grow. Health mining consumers, it's a complementary product to Celsius. And we'll continue to evaluate. Would you anticipate manufacturing in the U.S. in 2022? We anticipate manufacturing in the U.S. in 2022 with the protein snack portfolio, which is mainly the bars. We're evaluating the protein RTDs with some of our local production as well. Those are initial businesses in the early emphases in the U.S., but it is definitely something that team is currently evaluating. Okay. Got it. And looking for a little further commentary on the cooler front, Any anticipated goals or aspirations for Q4 or for 2022 as far as the aggregate numbers? Yeah. If you look at all our coolers in the first 9 months of this year we placed over 900, so 400 just in Q3 alone, so we anticipate that momentum to continue to increase. It's very important -- we don't want to over push out coolers. We want to make sure these coolers are placed in the right location, so it's more of a methodical approach. But we are getting a lot more requests with the success that they're seeing, so we placed a few coolers within a distributor, they see the success and it's really a partnership. And then we work together to really get into their top 20 accounts -- top 20% their accounts. We would love to add great coolers in great placements there. if you see a Celsius cooler out there, we've got some great new designs coming with our logo on the front and they look extremely well and they sell extremely well. So grab a cold Celsius if you see one. And then lastly, for us, any updates on U.S. flavors in SKUs, should we expect more or will they wind it out in future? Are you talking in regards to the Vibe line? Yes. Yeah. Our Vibe line has done extremely well. Our Peach Vibe and our Tropical Vibe has been one of our top sellers in the initial launch, will be rolled out new innovative flavors. We expect continue that strategy and we'll be coming out with a new Vibe this summer so, we're not going to disclose the flavor yet, but do anticipate a new vibe coming that's going to tasted great and amazing, and we'll have a lot of great marketing strategy behind that, which is innovative and really connects with consumers in a meaningful way. Super. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks, Jeffrey. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning, John. Good morning. Edwin. How are you? Good morning. Doing well. Excellent. Just a couple of questions on the stores fronts or the doors that you're. Did you say you're at 118,000 at this point, and how many were added this quarter? Yes, that's correct, Anthony. We're up -- store front we're up to 118,000. We have -- the stores that were added during -- we said that were year-to-date, that was a number that was about -- was 40% increase that we had in the greater store count this year. Correct. A lot of opportunities on further expansion there and new doors. So I think that's a great area. The team is working hard. We have a great key accounts team that's focused on new distribution in all channels of trade. Obviously the biggest opportunity we see currently is in the convenience channel, and really leveraging the DSD. Keep in mind, before our key accounts team is more handling the national accounts, but now leveraging our DSD partners, we're able to activate and work with the local regional chains where these DSD partners have local relationships. So we're excited about that and that's a big initiative through the rest of this year and into 2022. Okay. And then just on the DSD front, with your -- I believe, 224 regional DSD partners in that covers 92% of the U.S. counties that you're currently serving, is that the right number? That is correct. That is the right number. Then we had the largest increase in DSD partners in the third quarter really signup. Keep in mind once we sign this distributors, it does take some time to get product to them, products or their warehouse, educate their team members, and really optimize the accounts, the network and the distributors, so we do new product launches. It's the education process, so it does take time, but it was the largest quarter, the increase in distribution partners. And we're at about 92% of all counties in the U.S. are now covered. So large portion of the population is covered. And now it's -- the teams are working on converting our key accounts over to DSD. And really, we're in the optimization phase as well as bringing on new accounts. And that's why you saw when you look at the great growth, we had in our DSD network, it was up over 400% for the quarter and up sequentially as well. So great, great opportunities there as we continue to execute and optimize. And then just on the supply chain, I know you talked about the cans and the trouble getting some of those from overseas. So you had to source some of those here in the U.S. on the spot market. You said you have enough right now, but what about the freight issue? From what we're hearing, this is industry-wide across a lot of industries, not just the consumer packaged goods industry or the drink industry. How are you planning to deal with that the rest of this year and into 2022, if it continues to be an issue? Great question. You have to really on the scale of the business, obviously, if we were at a larger scale and we weren't seeing our growth rates where they are, we would have more of a material effect on our freight that we're seeing on the overall general nationwide cost increases of freight. I mentioned, according to DAT it was about 20% overall. Keep in mind, we were going from 2 warehouses now we're migrating to 6 warehouses. When we're running at 2 warehouses and we're bringing on DSD as well, we are shipping a lot of product, what they call less than a truck. It's called LTL. So that is much higher costs of shipping products around the country and we're shipping our long hauls as well on LTL, less than a truckload. Once we move to this orbit model and we bring on our distributors, our distributors can take full truckloads. Not only are we shipping a full truck opportunity as we continue to optimize these distributors, we're shipping that truck at a lower cost -- at a lower -- a shorter distance. There's a lot of synergistic benefits on freight, just as we continue to scale and grow, and gain that leverage versus more of a mature business in this current environment with the increases in freight that the overall industries receding. No, that's very helpful. And then just what -- did you say or did Edwin say there was a one-time cost that impacted this quarter for the movement from these 2 to 6 warehouses? Yeah, I stated that as -- calculating it roughly around 3%, and that's really associated. When we're moving from 2 warehouses to 6 warehouses, and we're really optimizing in the fourth quarter as well, just keep that in mind. We're not fully optimized in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to optimize in Q1 and Q2, but when we move to six orbit, we increased our inventory levels. We're still shipping longer loads, longer lead times, and longer distances as the inventory really optimizes. We have a variety of flavors, as we all know, so it's very important that we have all the flavors at each warehouse in order to be able to shift very efficiently. So that's why you saw our inventory levels increase at the end of September, and there's further optimization there. Edwin, do you want to add anything? Yeah, no, John, I just wanted to add in that sense. As we establish, like you're saying, the additional orbits or warehouses. Yes, there's been some incremental intra-warehouse rates and moving and redeploying some of the inventory to then get the synergies or the benefits going forward. So I think that's what we were alluding to earlier. Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with Roth Capital. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions surrounding the idea of what is normal going forward. When you said you can get back to pre-COVID margins, is that to suggest that you could -- what you were putting up before, let's say, the first quarter of COVID, is that what you aspire to get to or can all of the economies of scale and everything get you well beyond that? What do you consider to be normalized gross margins now, ex-freight? I think our margins include freight, so if you look at it that way, we anticipate to get back around like that 46%, 47% margin profiles that we had in 2020, I think, would be an area just currently as we continue to optimize. But as we gain more scale, we can -- we anticipate to be able to go North of that. But we're also looking at these transitory costs over keeping that in mind as well. At the time, you got those decreasing and getting back to a more normalization. But looking at a normal profile, I would say mid to upper forties is kind an area we feel we can get back to. I don't know, Edwin, do you want to -- Yeah. I agree with that. To me, it's more of the timing because I fully agree with John that we will be able to get to that. It's just more of the timing when that normalization occurs, and we start getting all those benefits, perhaps towards the back end of 2022, that type of thing. But to me, yeah. Without a doubt, we can get to that, it's just more of the timing issue. Yes. All right. That's helpful. And just to clarify, when you give some of those your color commentary on what the various puts and takes were to the gross margin, should we be interpreting that as those are like when you say 3% hit? A 3 percentage points off of the gross margin, is that the way you interpret that? Yes, that's correct. I mean, the total adjustment -- look at the increase in the cans and some of the other input costs as well as the freight of 3%. That's how we're arriving at the 7% overall. Great. Thank you. And then last thing again, trying to figure out what's normal. To what extent is the inventory build year a way of dealing with logistical and supply chain challenges, as opposed to just feeding consumer demand and retail expansion. How much overbuild is there in the inventory to try to smooth out some of those shipping challenges? There's not -- we're not building at this point, and in the third quarter, we were building to driving efficiencies in margins were building inventory to drive and fulfill demand. So that's going to -- the efficiencies are going to come down the road, maybe, as we look at 2022. But right now, we were -- our inventory -- does have a mix of spot rate, product cans, we have import cans. And it's more of a -- at a higher level of costs when you look at the overall cost on a per case basis. Those are things that are currently where we're building our inventories to justify and fill the 6 warehouses that we're bringing on board as we optimize our 6 orbit model, in addition to meet the growing demand and the anticipated new stores coming on in the future, as well as the optimization of the DSD network. Yeah. For my perspective, there's always 2 ways to look at this base, like I'd say, looking back and looking forward. And looking forward, based on hand, some computations, we're probably like around 120 days. So again, something that it's not, it's something that is still within the range of optimal that we're looking for. Okay. Thank you very much. We have run out of time for questions, I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our record fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results mirror our industry-leading growth metrics from third-party data providers, indicating that Celsius is grabbing more market share at an accelerated pace across all channels. For the first time in the Company history, we delivered over $100 million in sales, and we did this in the fourth quarter. In addition, annual revenues exceeded over $300 million for the first time, which is truly an exciting accomplishment for the team. This is exemplified by our initial material penetration in the convenience channel, where we grew our store locations by over 95% to over 29,000 locations during 2021, now totaling just under 60,000 doors, while at the same time, driving the club channel revenue, and we grew Amazon revenue to new records for the Company. This material expansion in historical underrepresented channels in the convenience channel and club channel has not impacted growth in other channels. Our growth is exemplified not only in sales, but also in our customer demographics. We further diversified our industry-leading consumer base over the past year, historically in the 24 to 44 age range, with our fastest-growing segment in the 18 to 24 age bracket, driving new female energy drink consumers into the category as we maintained our historical 50-50 male-female split. This is in conjunction with driving 20% of our sales from both male and female consumers new to the energy drink category. Our market share over the past year has been historic, even with the top two revenue customers, Amazon and Costco, not incorporated into tracked metrics as well as our fitness channel and vending channel. In third-party tracked channels, our share reached 2.1% share of the total energy drink category, growing 163% in the prior 52 weeks ending January 23, 2022, per IRI, MULO plus convenience data, total U.S. This is in our first full year of leveraging our national DSD network. Our future opportunity can be best exemplified by our market share on Amazon, where we are on an even playing field in terms of distribution. As of February 1, 2022, Celsius is the number two brand with over a 20% share of the energy category. These metrics further validate Celsius as a player in the energy category. And looking at the last four weeks' data, scan data, as of January 23, 2022, per IRI total energy U.S., Celsius' share in the energy category increased to a 3.2% share in the category, further demonstrating the momentum behind the portfolio. With this growth in revenue, we have also transitioned from a microcap company to a current market cap of over $4 billion over the past 18 months. Our investments in building out our world-class team and operational infrastructure during this time, has been just as important as our sales growth. In conjunction with our internal team, we have also made significant investments expanding our Board of Directors as well as engaging Ernst & Young as our new auditor, which we announced in the second quarter of 2021. Over the last several quarters, we have accelerated this transition by implementing best practices recommended and brought on by BDO as our internal auditor consultants to assist with this transition. This process has been all encompassing, and unfortunately, we have multiple weeks in January and early February, where a majority of our finance team was out with COVID. In addition, we have had multiple open positions, and we have been vigorously recruiting top talent into the Company's finance area to support our operations and our strong growth in our business, which was impacted by our ability to finalize the Ernst & Young first full year audit. We filed for an extension on our Form 10-K with the SEC earlier this evening and expect to file our 10-K during the 15 calendar day extension period as of the final audit and internal control procedure work are performed and completed. We have been able to finalize the majority of the pending items prior to our call today, including as reported today in an 8-K filing, a prior period error correction has been made to the non-cash stock expense in our second and third quarter financial results for 2021 totaling approximately $2.7 million and $12.6 million in additional non-cash stock expense for those periods, which was the results of prior stock grants that were awarded to foundational individuals, which were modified to allow for continual vesting past their contracted service dates. This was an error of interpretation of a Class III modification rule, technical rule, which resulted in an immediate mark-to-market adjustments for the prior periods' stock grants as a non-cash expense. We highlighted this financial impact in our full year updated totals on our flash results table at the beginning of our earnings supplement as well as the financial statements on the earnings supplement included in the 8-K filing today, which outlines the prior period of changes reflected in the non-cash stock expense for those periods. In addition, in light of this error, our management has then concluded that a material weakness existed in the Company's internal controls of our financial reporting for the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, which were not effected as of December 31, 2021, which was disclosed in our 8-K filing earlier today and which will be further discussed in our upcoming filing. To close these non-operational updates in regards to our previously disclosed SEC investigation, the matter is ongoing, and we are continuing to cooperate with the SEC staff. There has been no material developments in the investigation since the last disclosure. Now moving to the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. As stated, sales hit another quarterly record, and this was our first quarter to total over $100 million, which is a major accomplishment for the Company. Revenue growth was driven by continued new store count additions, SKU expansion, cold placements, DSD coverage expansion as well as the continual transition of existing accounts to DSD as well as the unrepresented channel growth in the convenience, club and vending. Total sales for the quarter of $104.3 million, up 192% from $35.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our domestic sales increased 238% to a record $95.9 million, up from $28.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. With both of these percentage growth rates the highest in our history, we continue to see our two hardest-hit channels from COVID in 2020, our fitness and vending channel, not only rebound but drive growth in sales. Fitness was up 91% for the year, and vending was up 186%, which when combined, contributed approximately $14.7 million of incremental revenue for the full year. International sales grew 15% to $8.3 million for the quarter and 17% for the year, with record annual revenues from the Nordics. Our gross profit margins continue to be impacted, as we previously addressed in our third quarter results. We made a strategic decision in late 2020 and early 2021 to import cans to fulfill our demand, sacrificing some efficiencies on the margin side. As a result, we are seeing the impacts of these onetime short-term impacts as we run through these higher cost sourced cans. We anticipate margins will continue to be impacted through the third quarter of 2022 as we process through these sourced cans. As we move forward, we are confident that U.S.-sourced cans making up the majority of our production will be normalized our can input cost going forward. In addition, we are experiencing inflationary costs in our operations, which is further impacting our business from increased cost of freight and raw materials. We have implemented promotional pricing strategies to mitigate some of these immediate changes in our business environment, which will start to realize in the coming months. In addition, we further optimized our warehouse supply chain to reduce miles on cases to better service our customers and reduce costs. We anticipate when cycling through the imported cans, our margin will normalize to full year 2020 levels based on current volume run rates. To conclude our margin analysis, as we recognize revenue growth rates more than double in North America to over 200%, we made a conscious decision to ensure that we had operational infrastructure to support our revenue growth and take full advantage of the opportunity to take share at an increasing pace. As such, we accelerated initiatives on several operational improvements to position us for future growth, which would impact our margins in the short term. Additional incremental near-term margin and benefit will be realized through pricing and promotional strategies, operational efficiency gains through our supply chain and a move to locally sourced cans on a go-forward basis. The Company continued to improve our order fill rates toward normalized levels through the fourth quarter from an 80% fill rate at the end of Q1 to the end of this year at a 97% fill rate in the fourth quarter and expect to maintain normalized levels even with accelerated growth rates due to the improvements in our warehousing expansion to a six-orbit infrastructure model where -- will be put in place into the third quarter and expansion in our inventory, which is key as we enter the spring resets and anticipate material new placements as well as further expansion into the club channel. Some additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Our domestic revenues of approximately $96 million was driven by accelerated triple-digit growth in traditional channels of trade, expansion with worldwide retailers and further activation and growth from our distribution partners. Direct-store-delivery, DSD, network delivered over 400% growth rate versus prior year in our distribution revenues. We secured additional distribution agreements during the quarter, expanding availability into new regions as Celsius continues to build out its network, now totaling over 276 regional direct-store-delivery service centers, covering approximately 98% of the U.S. population. And we began 2021 with only 150 DS partners and 80% coverage. We made substantial improvements throughout the year. Our vending channel grew over 210% in the fourth quarter. We added over 1,200 vending machines in micro markets in '21, increasing the number of locations by 96% for the year and expect that growth to continue in 2022. In the fitness vitamin specialty channel, Celsius launch with Lifetime Fitness and is now available in over 150 of their locations and their Life Cafe. We also signed partnership agreements with Cycle Bar as their official energy drink and expect more clubs than ever to join before as -- the country continues to reopen in 2021 as we gain more awareness and placements in the fitness channel. Our mass club channel to accelerate growth following of the rollout of 561 Costco stores in Q2. Costco's fourth quarter established a new record, growing over 1,100% for the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We're also seeing significant opportunities in the club channel in other markets, to include Sam's Club and BJ's through 2022. In the convenience channel. Our convenience channel store locations increased by 95%, as I said, to over 29,000 locations for the full year, totaling 60,000. We recently signed a national contract with Circle K, which will drive further expansion in the channel in 2022. The convenience store channel has the largest growth in number of doors in 2021 and expect similar growth trends to continue through 2022. Industry-backed third-party data continues to show Celsius' accelerating growth metrics, and we are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we increase our ACV across channels through additional launches with new nationwide retailers and further transitioning existing accounts to our DSD network. Consumer data for Celsius accelerates through the fourth quarter of 2021 and through February of 2022 to record levels, with the most recent Nielsen scan data as of February 12, 2022, showing Celsius sales were up 233% year-over-year for two weeks, up 234% for the four weeks, up 227% for the 12 weeks, with a 3% share of the energy category over the last two weeks. And on Amazon, as I said, Celsius is the second-largest energy drink with a 20% share of the energy category, an approximately 7% share ahead of Red Bull at a 13% share and moving closer to the number one spot, just four share points behind Monster at a 24% share. This is according to the last four weeks' data ending February 12, 2022, stack line energy drink category, total U.S. In addition, Celsius has a year-over-year growth rate of about 94% compared to Amazon's energy growth rate of 37%. That's just over 2.5x the category for the last four weeks ending February 12, 2022, and according to Stackline. Our U.S. store count now exceeds 135,000 locations nationally, growing over 53,000 doors or 65% from 82,000 at the beginning of 2021, with additional expansion plans throughout 2022 as retailer resets take place. On our co-packing front, we continue to expand with our partners in scaling at existing locations, improving our line time priority. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint now totals over 13 that are active, which will help protect for future out-of-stocks and support our massive growth as we continue to improve efficiencies in our supply chain. In the fourth quarter, Europe mainly derived from Nordics totaled $7.4 million compared to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 7%. Our market share in our largest market, Sweden, increased through the fourth quarter to just over 10%. For the full year, sales in Europe reached a record with an annual growth rate of 13% for 2021. We recently launched on Amazon EU. Expansion begins with Great Britain, which was launched with three SKUs of CELSIUS and six FAST protein bars. And in Germany, we launched with three great flavors of CELSIUS. We are also expanding to additional EU markets to include France and Italy launching in early 2022. In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market with a fixed royalty rate through 2024, which then becomes a volume-based royalty starting in the first year of 2024 with a minimum royalty of $2.2 million annually. In our international markets, additionally, ending 2021 drove about $3.2 million, an increase of 109% from $1.5 million in the prior year period. Material markets to include Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where we saw great growth. Now moving to the marketing. On the marketing front, we continue to activate, targeting new and existing consumers where they live, work and play, building meaningful emotional connections through a robust integrated marketing programs. Our momentum is accelerating, and our brand is resonating with a robust consumer base, expanding the category demographics. Focus on health and wellness is beyond the trend now. Functional energy is recognized throughout the industry as a driver of future growth with retailers and customers. We are driving and leading growth in the energy category across all channels, expanding the demographic while bringing an industry-leading percentage of consumers from outside and new to the category, while accelerating our share in the growing energy market. We have committed the resources, both in personnel and operational infrastructure, to maximize our opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Edwin? Thank you, John. I wanted to start by providing additional clarity on the adjustments that John highlighted regarding the non-cash stock compensation expense. During Q2 and Q3, the Company calculated and recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to options and RSUs held by former foundational employees and retired directors ratably over their vesting period. However, because the options and the RSUs were allowed to continue to vest after the employees separated and the directors retired from the Company, those awards were deemed to have been modified. And the expense should have been calculated and recognized using the firm market value of the stock as of the data termination or retirement. This led to the adjustments that John discussed, which resulted in the understatement of the stock compensation expense in Q2 in the amount of $3.1 million and $12.1 million for Q3. These aspects are further detailed in the 8-K that we filed today. As a result of this situation, the Company's management and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors have determined that the Company's previously issued interim unaudited financial statements contained in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for each of the affected quarters should no longer be relied upon. The Company's management has also concluded that in light of this situation, as previously described, a material weakness existed in the Company's internal control over the proper valuation of stock compensation expense regarding the modifications performed to stock awards for some former employees and retired directors. Now turning to our fourth quarter financial results. We had a record fourth quarter revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021, of $104.3 million, an increase of $68.6 million or a strong 192% increase from $35.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 98% of this growth was a result of increased revenues from North America. For 2021, four quarter revenues were $96 million an increase of $67.5 million or a robust 238% increase from $28.4 million in the 2020 quarter. The balance of the revenues for the 2021 quarter were mainly related to European revenues of $7.4 million, or 7% higher when compared to $6.9 million in the year ago period. Asian revenues, which included royalty revenues from our China licensee, contributed an additional $680,000, an increase of 203% from $224,000 from the prior year quarter. Other international markets generated $265,000 in revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $148,000 or 127% from $117,000 for the prior year quarter. Gross profit for Q4 increased by $24.2 million or 139% to $42.4 million from $17.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit margins reflected a decrease to 39.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 48.9% for the 2020 quarter. Excluding freight out, as some of our competitors do not include this expense as part of cost of goods sold, our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 48.4% compared to 57.2% for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increase in volume, while the decrease in gross profit margins is mainly related to increase in costs pertaining to imported cans, higher raw material costs, ocean freights and transportation costs and repackaging costs. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2021, were approximately $24.6 million, an increase of approximately $13.4 million or 119.2% from $11.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to higher marketing investment activities, which resulted in an increase of $8.2 million when compared to the prior year quarter. Additionally, employee costs increased by approximately $1.5 million from the year ago quarter as we continued to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth as well as incurring in additional travel and business expenses since we are now able to resume in-person marketing events and selling activities. Additionally, storage and distribution expenses as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $4.2 million from the 2020 quarter, basically related to the increase in business and revenue volume. Lastly, there were slight offsets in other sales and marketing expenses in the amount of $487,000, mainly related to savings in trade marketing activities. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing charges amounted to 23.6% for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 31.5% to the fourth quarter of 2020. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2021, were $14.2 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 147% from $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly related to stock option expense, which amounted to $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $6.2 million, which accounts for 74% of the total increase in this area when compared to the prior year quarter. This increase is mainly related to the non-cash expense adjustments that I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared comments. Additionally, employee costs for the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflected an increase of $804,000 or 53.8% as investments in this area are also required to properly support our higher business volume and commercial and operational areas of the business as well as the increased travel and expenses that are now being incurred. Administrative expenses amounted to $3.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 153% when compared to the prior year quarter. This variance includes an increase in the bad debt reserve of $425,000 as well as increases in other costs, legal expenses, insurance cost and office rent, which account for the majority of the remaining fluctuation of $1.7 million. Depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately $222,000 when compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of revenue, G&A costs amounted to 14% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared to 16% in the prior year. However, excluding the non-cash stock option expense for both periods, G&A decreased as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 to 6.1% compared to 11.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020. Other income and other expenses. Total net other income for the three months ended December 31, 2021, amounted to $250,000, which reflects a decrease of $350,000 when compared to the total net other income of $600,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The prior year quarter included a foreign exchange gain of $730,000, which accounts for the majority of the variance from the 2021 four quarter. The net other income of $250,000 for the fourth quarter of 2021 is composed of foreign currency exchange gains of $175,000 and interest income of $77,400 related to the note receivable from our China licensee, which were partially offset by miscellaneous other interest expenses of $2,100. Net income. Our net income for the three months ended December 31, 2021, was $11.9 million, which included a tax benefit of $8.8 million, mainly related to the release of valuation allowances regarding prior year tax losses. As such, earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2021, were $0.16 per share based on weighted average of 74.8 million shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share of $0.15, based on a fully diluted weighted average of 78.4 million shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of stock options to purchase 3.6 million shares. In comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had fourth quarter net income of $950,000 or $0.01 per basic share, and diluted share based on basic of 71.9 million shares and 76.5 million fully diluted shares. Now focusing on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had cash of approximately $16.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately $169 million and $66.8 million, respectively, with no long-term debt. Cash flow used in operation and operating activities totaled $95.8 million during 2021, which compares to $3.4 million provided by operating activities for the three -- for the year ended December 31, 2020. The use of cash in the 2021 year was primarily driven by higher inventory levels in order to properly service our -- the demand for our products, support our new six-orbit warehouse model and mitigate the impact of supply chain inefficiencies and inconsistencies as well as also to anticipate our upcoming spring resets. Specifically, our net inventory value increased $172.8 million from $18.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $191.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the significant increase in inventory, cash flow from operations for the full year, December 31, 2021, would have totaled approximately $84.3 million. Our current cash position, together with the expected results from operations, should provide us with sufficient cash to operate our business as we're also normalizing and optimizing our inventory levels, which should release significant funds over the next 12 to 15 months. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. First, just a housekeeping question on the control issue. Can you just confirm that the issues here, as you wait for the audit to wrap up as best you know, are just going to be exclusively isolated to the stock-based comp accounting? That's the expectation. Hi, Kevin, this is Edwin. Yes, that's the indication right now. But yes, as you well pointed out, we're still going through the audit and obviously internal control system making effect of what's remaining. So that's the expectation, but we'll see what happens. Okay. Fair enough, Edwin. Two more quick ones for me. John, you were pretty optimistic on the shelf-space resets, which is encouraging. I think the comment was you expect material new placements and expansion in the club channel. Maybe just spend a little bit of time on that. And John, I guess, within the answer, we can see the really positive trends in Nielsen scan data at about 2% market share. Maybe as part of your response, just talk a little bit about how you expect distribution velocity to kind of play out here, and where you expect that share to go within scanned channels over the next 12 to 36 months? Yes. No, Kevin, you're absolutely right. I mean the scan data has been extremely strong, as we were talking earlier about on the call, and we look at that. What's interesting is, as we're expanding into these reported channels, we're still seeing great increases in velocity in the club channel, mainly at Costco and also on Amazon, seeing that improve. So, we anticipate that to level off at some point as we're gaining more broader distribution. But initial feedback has been -- I mean the data looks really strong as we stand now, especially looking at that February data, the most recent. When we talk about the club channel, that was a big surprise for us in 2021, seeing how well the product was performing. And we're talking to Sam's Club right now, and hopefully, we will see opportunities with them in 2022 as well as BJ's, as I mentioned. And the big win in Circle K is, for us, in the convenience channel. And that's where about 6,000 stores that we're getting a national distribution agreement with. So we're going to continue to expand. We had a great NACS. We talked about that in the third quarter. In October, the Company had one of the best NACS shows that I've ever attended with the Company. So we feel we're in a good spot. We've got a great key accounts team as well that's been working really hard. And we're going to see the fruits of all their hard work here over the next several quarters -- next several months really. Got it. Just one more for me and I'll pass it on. I have a number of questions we can take offline. But just the -- on the gross margin, Edwin, maybe just -- I know you guys don't like to guide, but maybe just at a high level now, what the expectation is given commodity cost pressure? You made the comment that you have higher-cost cans in inventory, and inventory is up materially here as you look at inventory days in the fourth quarter. Can you just help give us some directional sort of guidance on how you expect gross margins to sort of trends here as we look out in '22? And then within that, anything you can give more broadly because there's sort of this near-term pressure, which is a little bit worse and new investors, but this massive longer-term opportunity for margin expansion as you could potentially approach Monster-like EBITDA margins. So maybe just sort of marry up near-term expectation versus sort of the promise of what could be really material margin expansion longer term. And then I'll pass it on. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, sure. I mean as we said in the past, there are several variables to that equation to say the least. One of them is kind of the mix between the local-sourced cans and the cans that we source out of the U.S., which are a higher cost. So clearly, that's going to have an impact. And we're seeing that that's probably going to be -- they're going to be flowing through cost of goods sold, at least through Q2, a little bit thereafter as well. So that's going to be an impact. And then obviously, the issues that we're seeing with the supply chain in terms of freight, we're all seeing the impact of the macroeconomics in terms of the price of oil and all that. So we'll have to see how that plays out as well in terms of transportation costs. We saw at one point freight cost of a container all the way close to $20,000. So again, there's a lot of variables in this equation, which is very difficult at this point to -- for us to kind of evaluate. And as again, the mix between the local cans and the foreign cans is also going to play an important part of this equation as we cycle those cans through. In terms of the EBITDA or going forward, yes, at one point, hopefully, when this normalizes, there's always talk about this inflation being transition in nature, so -- or transitory in nature, I should say. So once we normalize, sure, I think the expectation is that we go back to kind of the gross profitability that we were seeing initially in 2020 and, thereafter, also continue to leverage, with the volume that we have, to then improve our EBITDA margin. Yes. I'll just chime in. When we look at our internal forecast, we're expecting to cycle through the import cans, sourced cans currently sometime in the third quarter. So expect that to be more normalized to 2020 levels as we cycle through it. And we are working on a variety of pricing promotional strategies to offset some of this inflationary pressure that we're currently seeing. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. I guess, first, just following up on the stock-based comp commentary. Edward, I think you said that's the expectation, that it was just specific to that. So are you saying that there's nothing else that you're aware of that could potentially come up, at least at this point? I respect the fact that it could potentially come up over the next 15 days. But are you saying there's nothing else that you're aware of beyond that? And then related to that, was this in any way related to the SEC investigation? Well, no, first of all, I mean, it's a first year audit, right. So clearly, when you -- I've been on the other side of that when I was an auditor. And first year audit are more -- you go into a lot more scrutiny, that kind of thing. We're playing now in the big leagues with Ernst & Young. So perhaps there's something that could surface. At this point, we're not seeing something to that nature. But you never know. That's why kind of leave the door open at that point or at this point because, again, they're doing a very thorough job. And that's fine, and that's what we expect them to do, that kind of thing. In terms of your other comment, I'm not sure as it relates to that, not necessarily. It's more of a situation that happened regarding some of the awards that had to be properly valued at fair market value for some of these employees that were separated and some of the Board members that also retired. And I'll just chime in, in regards to some of the employees. It was also -- it's a technical aspect there because some of them are still providing services through contractual services. So there was just a technicality. That was an error and interpretation there on those stock awards. So it definitely was an oversight and a correction that was noted. And I think also management feels very confident in the numbers we put out in preliminary numbers. So obviously, I think anything can come up. But at this point, we wouldn't put out preliminary numbers unless management felt confident in the numbers provided today. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then switching over to the business, John. If you looked at your market share on a state-by-state basis, it's pretty interesting that your home state share is something slightly in excess of 10% relative to current national share. It's somewhere in the mid-3s based on the latest data that we've seen. So I guess I'm curious if you could talk a bit about how you think about those two numbers sort of ultimately working in unison. And is there anything that would potentially prevent your state market share from improving in some material way once you get more distribution. And I guess, sort of related to that, maybe you could talk about the state of distribution the further you move away from Florida from just an overall penetration standpoint. Yes. Let me -- the share count you referenced in Florida is phenomenal. I mean the Company has been working extremely hard at that. And also, I think you're really seeing the power of the DSD network. Florida has been fully covered now for a little over -- almost going on two years now. So you're really seeing that availability, that increased ACV. Also, you saw Circle K. We did land Circle K in the Southeast. So that came on as well, and 7-Eleven and a variety of other key accounts as well as Publix. So we've been doing extremely phenomenal there. I think it's just an indicator. It's another indicator, given the same opportunity, CELSIUS will perform at the same level, if not better than the competition. So Florida is extremely a great state for us as well as Texas and California. And several other states around the country are starting to really increase share in those markets as we build out the DSD network and really been able to activate those accounts, those key accounts and gain more distribution. Got it. Okay. I just want to clarify one thing, going back to the SEC. So Edwin, is the SEC investigation related to this? Or they are separate items? Again, they're completely separate aspects here. I mean, this was more, yes, an internal aspect. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. So just wanted to follow up on the Circle K contract, what we're looking at there as far as the rollout. And then also, I wanted to follow up just on the DSD expansion, kind of where we are now in overall percentage. And then what you think is a reasonable target by the end of fiscal '22? Yes, Jeff, thank you. When we look at our overall -- where we're at when we see Circle K, that was a great opportunity. We've been long-term partner with 7-Eleven, and Circle K is a great opportunity for us, and we've been testing in some regions. So getting this national contract and national rollout is really exciting. So it puts us in about -- approximately about 6,000 doors nationwide with about probably around -- right around average about four flavors. And its a great really jump start to the DSD network. So we're bringing another great key account to our distribution network. We got a bunch more coming as well. And that's going to further activate and allow us to close that white space that's out there. So, we talked about -- I mentioned earlier in the comments, some of the DSD gaps that have been closed in 2021. The team -- the old DSD management team has done a phenomenal job, really working on closing those gaps, which is extremely difficult to do. We get up to almost over 270 direct store delivery, really warehouses at facilities that are out there that are being managed. We got systems, processes in place, and we're at about 98% of the population covered. So we do have some gaps in certain states we're working to close, we're looking to get a majority coverage and be able to service all of our key accounts nationwide, definitely by the end of 2022. It's definitely the plan. And we're pretty much able to service 98% of the population now. So, it's really the next phase. 2022 is all about activation, activating our DSD network, driving more distribution, increasing velocity and getting -- better activating sales and bringing new consumers to the portfolio. Okay. Great. And then if we could just turn to the six-orbit warehouse model. Can you give us more detail on, I guess, where you are on ramping that up, what the next milestones are that you're targeting there, time frame around that? And then if you could speak more about what level of benefit you anticipate once the six orbit system is fully optimized. Yes. We started that six orbit model in the third quarter, built that out, building the warehouses. We did increase inventories, as you can see in our balance sheet. We feel we're at a really good inventory level, and we're going to be able to activate. Really it's about optimization. So Q4 is about optimizing inventory levels, and also really getting those proper servicing lanes established within the logistics supply chain. So, we're working with some of the largest logistics suppliers -- providers to provide us the best rates to service our customers, reducing the number of days to service customers, lead times, and most importantly, driving more efficiency through the networks, full truckloads, full pallet flavors, those types of things, which just really improve your -- we'll be able to improve our freight costs as well so -- and margins. So that's where we're at. We're looking to be really -- when you look at Q1, we're looking to be fully further optimized by the end of the first quarter is what the team is really working on. So, always optimizing, always trying to improve and get better, but by the end of Q1 2022, we should be really well optimized for 2022. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. If I could follow up on the last question as it relates to how much -- how many of those accounts you've actually changed over of the 98%. I think you gave a lot of examples of accounts, specific names. But are you now 60% converted, 70%. I don't know if I missed it or maybe you never gave out that figure. Yes, no worries. Thank you, Kaumil. In regards to -- the 98% is the population coverage. So we're able to service all our key accounts as -- assuming they were all flipped over to our DSD network, we'll be able to service about 98% of the population. So that's really what we meant by the 98%. When you look at our -- right now, if you break it down, if you look at -- in the press release, we kind of break it out. We have about 65% of our MULO+C, so MULO and convenience stores, are now being serviced by DSD. So we have a lot more optimization to go. And that's what the teams are working on in 2022. So new accounts are all coming on through DSD, and some of our existing established accounts, we're working on converting them over. So like I said on prior calls, it does take time. It's not as easy as an overnight flicking a switch. There is a process that has to take place, and the teams are working hard to move over. Because we know when servicing -- by having Celsius serviced by DSD, we increase velocity, increase within the given store. So -- and it benefits everyone, benefits of the store owners, it benefits our distributors and benefits us. That MULO+C number is representative of your overall, does that sound fair, 65-ish percent? Yes. Yes. Okay. The next question on margins. Can you give maybe a little more context on what the perhaps the spread is on the imported cans versus the domestic cans. We look at how much gross margins were down. Would they have been down half as much if you were sourcing domestically 1/3? Can you maybe just give some context of as you work through that inventory, we have a sense of where margins or margin should look like? Yes. I mean as we work through the margins, I mean, we said once we cycle through the international cans, we expect to be back to margins somewhere closer to the full year of 2020. So that's really where we see the margins at this current level, where our current run rate is. But when you look at the international -- some of these sourced cans, they're coming in, as Edwin mentioned, some of the costs on containers are $20,000 a container. We're starting to see container prices drop a little bit. We do have some more imported cans that have to come over, and we have some on the water. So that's why we anticipate those to cycle through some time, based on our current internal forecast, right around the third quarter, so 2022. And you're seeing some of those imported cans are right around a 3% -- or 3% to 4% margin impact overall. So it's pretty substantial. And then we have some -- also some transitory freight increases that we've seen, and raw material costs that we're working through. And we're trying to offset and mitigate some of those increases with pricing and promotional strategies that we have implemented. Okay. Great. And then finally, if I could ask about marketing spend. You're now -- as you push to fulfill that 98%, as you mentioned, '22 is all about activation. How should we be thinking about your marketing and sales spending? We are investing ahead of revenue based on our -- where we are in our life cycle and our growth cycle. So we're hiring a variety of staff members in all departments from finance, sales, marketing, operations. So we're really building out our team. So we are investing head count resources in regards to marketing. We're trying to be very methodical in our approach on marketing, but we are, as Edwin mentioned in his comments -- prepared comments, we're getting back into events. We're really seeing some great activation. We're gaining more distribution as well. So it's very important, as we gain distribution, we continue to market and invest behind the brand to continue to drive those new consumers to the portfolio, to maintain those velocities at retail. So we're working on that. We're going to gain more efficiencies as we go. I think if you look at what -- our current quarter, we're probably somewhere around -- maintain some of those spending levels currently on a go-forward basis through 2022. And if you look at the G&A, I think if you back out some of the stock-based compensation expense there that was in the fourth quarter, we're right around a 6%, 6.1%. And that does include increased costs associated with accounting and legal and those type of fees as well as consultants that are helping us as well. So there's definitely a lot of leverage in the model as we grow. Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with Roth Capital. Please proceed with your question. Yes, I wanted to start a couple of quickies, too. So is -- I mean, is all of the stock-based compensation expense taken in the G&A line? So like 100% of that is in that line? Correct. Yes. And the level that we see then for the fourth quarter, is that -- do you think that's going to be like a normal level that we should expect to see each quarter? Or is there kind of some catch-up from this issue that you flagged, and we would see that level actually go down over time? I mean it should be around what you're seeing now or what we commented on going forward. Okay. Then shifting to a housekeeping on taxes. Can you give us what the dollar amount was of that deferred tax credit reversal in the release? Yes, I think it was around $8 million, $8.5 million. That's the whole thing then. What would you expect would be the tax rate going forward then? Well, we still have some NOLs. So again, and we're cycling through that in terms of the provision and finalizing those computations. So -- but yes, we're still going to have some -- a little bit of NOLs going forward. Okay. But it should be higher, I mean, some significantly higher rate than what we've been showing, right? Yes, obviously, yes, depending on the profitability and profit. But yes. And jurisdiction. Okay. And a couple of other questions, John. On the -- could you provide a little bit more color on the inventory build? How much of that is just pure inflation? And where do you expect maybe more use -- where would you expect these inventory to be 12 months from now? Yes, jump in as well. I mean feel free to chime in. But our days of inventory, we're looking at a -- when you look back, you got to get a look forward on a go forward. And we did prepay a lot of -- a big chunk of raw materials. So we got a little -- right around $60 million, $70 million of additional prepaid associated with cans and raw materials. It's still a lot -- very difficult out there, environment in raw materials. We took advantage of making strategic prepayments, making sure we secured raw materials as we enter 2022 and enter really this -- start to get in position for resets and summer beverage season as well. So that puts us in a good position, so we maintain stock levels. But as you go forward, I mean, in the growth that we're seeing, some of the growth rates, especially in North America, upwards of 200%, you really need to be very close to the inventory levels. It's important that we maintain a higher inventory level as we go forward with these growth rates. But ideally, we want to be, somewhere at this stage, right around 90 to 120 days on hand. We are sitting currently at the end of the year at a higher level just due to the large production runs we made in December, strategically positioning us for 2022. Okay. Then final question on international. We've talked quite a bit over the course of last year about North America being the focus because that's where there's so much low-hanging fruit and opportunity. Is there anything else that's constraining international sales from being higher? Can we expect that growth rate to accelerate? I think what we've said on somewhat conservative on international currently. We do see a lot of opportunities there. We did -- you have that opportunity in the Nordics to expand out. We started to do that on Amazon, as mentioned, entering Great Britain, the U.K. and also into Germany. So there is opportunities also in Asia with Southeast Asia. There's a lot of opportunities there. But we're being very methodical in our approach as we continue to grow in scale. As we see increased velocity, we'll put increased investments in currently. But I think the current -- where we stand now, it's being a very methodical approach and conservative. Yes. What we've said in international, the key aspect is to identify good partners. You own master distributors so that then you avoid having a large footprint. And again, even things like currency exposure and things of that nature. So like John said, it's always about identifying those key partners in those different markets. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Please proceed with your question. I guess I said just looking at how strong growth was in the quarter and thinking about some of the difficult comparisons in the back half of 2022, like how should we be thinking about sort of bumping up against production constraints? And I guess the confidence that you have that you can keep up this level of growth. Yes. I think when you look at the growth we've had, I mean we're going to continue -- we're forecasting internally in regards to our inventory levels. We expect to continue to drive continued momentum and share in the category. So as we mentioned, we've got 13 co-packers that are active. We're talking to a variety of others. We have Paul Storey we brought on last year, who has a great knowledge of the beverage industry, especially with co-packing and associated with energy drinks. So we really feel we're in a really good position currently as we scale. We have capacity levels. Internally, we're telling sales to outsell production and having an internal competition on it. So I think we're in really good position. We feel in a really good space. Things happened that can happen out of your control. But as we sit right now, we're ready for -- to continue to drive scale. Our next comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. If I could follow up a little bit as far as the co-packers, up to 13 now. How does that pace look over the third quarter? And what would you anticipate domestically for '22? Right now, we're at six orbits. You're going to see us -- what we want to do is as we drive efficiencies, you want to keep your supply chain in your warehouses in an orbit. You really don't want to ship outside of an orbit to gain efficiencies. So right now where our volumes are at, we're at a six orbit. But as we grow in scale, we'll continue to create more orbits, which will further drive efficiencies through the model and the supply chain. So that is really based on how fast and how quickly we scale, and that we're building our plans and you'll see those to come alive. So, we're talking to a variety of additional co-packers, strategically placed around the country as well as additional warehouse facilities that we'll be able to -- you want to put the least amount of miles on cases and be as efficient as you possibly can. So that's what we're working on, but we feel we're in a good position right now, given our current growth levels and current volume. Got it. And I wanted to touch base again on the inventory levels and cans specifically. So, domestic cans have caught up as far as supply and demand out there. Is that a good way to look at it over the past few months? I wouldn't say it's -- you're still hearing a lot of capacity constraints out there. So we feel we're in a good position based on some long-term agreements arrangements we've made. But in general, can supply is still tight. If you look at a lot of the major can manufacturers that are out there and the comments that they're saying, it's tight right now. And that's going to be difficult for a lot of smaller brands. You're still seeing a lot of smaller brands wrapping cans out there. Obviously, that's a lot more expensive than importing cans or sourcing cans abroad. But we feel, based on our volume, we have additional leverage to be able to buy and purchase and secure domestic cans on a go-forward basis, based on our current internal forecast, once we cycle through these sourced cans that we have currently in inventory. Okay. And when we think of inventory, could you give us a sense of what percent that is of cans as opposed to fully finished products? Yes, we're probably about 15% to 20% of our inventory is probably currently within our packaging components. Got it. Okay. And the balance is finished products. We do have some additional raw materials in there as well, packaging materials. Yes. Okay. Got it. And then any sense -- and I know you talked a little bit about some of the challenges of labor and logistics. Any sense of how they may affect the gross profit differential between the outbound freight and the gross profit going forward? Does it feel like it's peaked out? Or does it potentially continue to diverge slightly? There so many macro elements that are happening right now, I mean, gas prices and what's happening in the current environment. So we're sitting in a really unknown area going forward. I mean we're trying to mitigate as much as we can. In regards to labor, there's still a lot of labor shortages around. We're having that -- those challenges internally here in all of our departments. We have positions open, where we're trying to get really qualified, good talent into the Company. So I think every company is being affected these days in regards to logistics and trucking labor. That is short as well I don't have the number in front of me. I think I had it in the last call there was a substantial number of open positions and drivers. And also now you have gas prices that are anticipated to continue to climb. So, we're getting into somewhat of an interesting area, which we're going to all be impacted by. Yes, the gap in outbound freight has always been you around 8% to 10%. So yes, who knows again, with the gas prices and all that, how that's going to further perhaps make that gap broader. But that's what it's been in the past historically. Okay. Got it. And then lastly for us, on the CycleBar exclusive, is that with all the national CycleBars? I think there's a couple of hundred out there. That is -- there's a couple of hundred currently out there. It's a great partnership for us, a great partnership, a great brand, and we're looking for a great year with them. So we've got a lot of things planned, a lot of events planned, cross promotions planned and should be exciting. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. This is actually Jeremy on the line for Anthony. So just two quick questions. First, regarding store expansion, how much runway do you think you have left for that? You had a really tremendous growth in 2021, and how should we look at the growth in store expansion in 2022. Well, I think there's -- the biggest opportunity for us right now, it's twofold. So number one is optimizing existing accounts, so gaining better placements, additional flavors. Cold placements is a big opportunity where we see increased velocities. So that's what our teams are really working on, is really better -- having that perfect store, working towards that perfect store. So -- and that's really leveraging the DSD network and our team. So, that is one component. So existing same-store sales opportunities. And then number two, when you look at where our convenience is, the convenience channel, we're sitting roughly around a 44% ACV. So lots of runway left just in the reported stores in the convenience channel. You're looking at -- we got almost a 56% opportunity of additional distribution and convenience, which is usually the higher, in the energy space, the higher-velocity location. And then the expansion in non-reported, tracked channels is a great opportunity for us. So it's a little bit of a variety of things, same-store sales, optimization, convenience channel, big opportunity, and then some of the opportunities that lie in untracked channels. Okay. And then the Costco contract, I know that you're about -- you said you were in about 500 stores in Costco. We're in 561 today roughly. Right. Okay. And then there -- is there plans to grow? Because I know they have about 880 stores nationwide or warehouses they call them. Yes, warehouse. Currently, we're in about 561. I have to check on the expansion number, but roughly 561, I think, was the last count, but should be in a Costco near you. If not, Edward. No, I have seen it, have seen it. So is there any risk that -- I know -- I shop at Costco a lot. I've seen a lot of times products, they have a -- they're there for a little bit and then they're out and you don't see them again. Is there a risk that they have -- you have certain metrics you have to hit? Is there a risk that they could pull that contract? I don't know that works exactly, if you could give us a little more insight into that. Yes. That's the beverage business. So in pretty much any business in retail, so you really have about six months to perform otherwise you're out. So retail shelf is expensive, not only at Costco but every single retailer in the country. So, it's important to continue to drive velocity, drive consumers, drive growth and share in the category. So that's just the business we operate in, and it's extremely important that we rotate at retail. Otherwise, you start losing distribution. At this point, we're gaining distribution because of the velocity that's happening in existing accounts. This is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the Company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrate the product is gaining considerable momentum. We're capitalizing on today's health and wellness trends and transformation taking place in the energy category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy and team in a rapidly transformation category. We see great opportunities. We believe we will navigate through the challenges ahead, and we are well positioned to thrive in today's energy drink category. Thank you, everyone, for your time today and confidence in the team. Stay safe, stay healthy and lifted. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

With that, let’s turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our record first quarter represented our 14th consecutive quarter of sequential growth and a 20% increase over the fourth quarter period. According to the trailing 4-week IRI MULO data as of April 17, 2022, Celsius is the number one brand driver of growth in the energy category compared to 2021. For the last 4-week dataset, the energy category grew $101 million. In that period, Celsius added $38 million of the growth accounting for 38% of the total. This is dollar share growth, eclipsing Monster by 1.4x, Alani Nu by 2.2x, Red Bull by 2.5x, Ghost by 3x and C4 by 4x.
During this period, Celsius increased to a $4.1 share and surpassed Rockstar for the number four position in the energy category. This growth has been driven across all channels, including those non-tracked with the two newest channels of club and the vending foodservice channels leading on a percentage growth metric and driving an incremental $25.2 million in revenue for the two channels alone compared to 2021 first quarter.
In March, we also began a full nationwide rollout through Sam’s Club more than doubling the number of stores in the channel adding 589 locations with the launch. In the first quarter, we also expanded into additional Wal-Mart locations now bringing our store count total to over 4,400 stores and expanded our offerings, which now totals on average about 6 facings across the country with expanded distribution as well as new cooler placements in select stores. In the convenience channel, we began a nationwide rollout to over 6,000 Circle K locations. And in the fitness channel, we are now the official energy drink partner and provider of CycleBar nationwide. In addition, since our Q4 launch with Lifetime Fitness, we are now the number one selling drink and have increased sales each month since our launch.
On April 18, we announced the retirement of Edwin Negron and appointed Jarrod Langhans, our CFO. I would like to formally introduce him today and share our excitement of having him join the Celsius team. In addition, I’d like to thank Edwin for his commitment to the company and for the contribution over the years, which will continue to provide lasting positive impacts. We have also recently added Grace Clark [ph] as our new Head of IT and welcome her to the Celsius team. And in addition to the many other new team members who have joined our team, we would like to welcome them as we continue to expand our organization to keep pace with growth and maximize the opportunities we see ahead.
Before I move to operational highlights for the quarter, in regards to our previously disclosed SEC, we continue to fully cooperate and we do not have any material updates at this time. Moving to some of our financial highlights of the first quarter, sales hit another record achieving first quarter revenues in the United States exceeding over $100 million in sales, hitting $123 million growing exponentially. Revenue growth was driven by continued new store additions, flavor expansions, additional cold placements and the optimization and activation of our DSP network as well as growth in underrepresented channels. As we mentioned in the convenience store, we see great expansion in club and vending.
Sales for the first quarter of 2022 totaled $133.4 million, up 167% from $50 million in the prior year quarter. As mentioned, domestic revenues increased 214% to a record $123.5 million, up from $39 million in the prior year quarter. International sales decreased proximately 10% to $9.9 million for the quarter, with Nordic sales down approximately 18% to $8.5 million as a result of timing of trade campaigns, flavor launches as well as supply chain delays, and other international sales grew approximate 114% to $1.4 million.
Gross profit for the quarter increased $162 million to $53.9 million up from $20.6 million in the year ago quarter and gross margins totaled approximately 40.4% of net sales and excluding outbound freight totaled 42.8% of revenues for the 3 months ending March 31, 2022 and from 41.1% or 49.5% when excluding outbound freight for the prior year quarter.
There continues to be margin pressure felt across the beverage industry. And we have not been immune to these impacts. With the expansion of higher cost of international cans, a majority of these cost increases have been offset by efficiencies of scale through our raw materials production, full load shipping, reducing the miles on cases with our 6-orbit warehouse model expansion last fall. Our product channel sales mix has also impacted margins as our club channel revenue has externally had lower margin levels due to secondary repack facilities, which are required with this rapid growth in the channel, which contributed over $26 million in revenue in the first quarter and has increased overall margin pressure. And we have initiated several changes to improve margins in this channel, including the rework working with co-packers and our partners to further drive cost out of the system. Overall, the company still expects to cycle through the remaining of our international cans by the end of the third quarter with margins then moving back up towards the mid-40s based on channel mix.
Our first quarter 2022 fill rates were experiencing about – roughly around a 97% fill rate and we expect to maintain these normalized levels even with our accelerated growth rates due to optimization of software improvements warehouse expansion to our 6-orbit infrastructure model put in place during the third quarter and an inventory expansion which has been key to the spring resets load-ins with new accounts expanding and optimization of our national distribution network as well as Sam’s Club, Circle K and the Walmart expansions just to name a few.
Some additional highlights for the first quarter. Our domestic revenues of $123.5 million was driven by accelerated triple growth – triple-digit growth in traditional channels of trade expansion with world class retailers and fuller activation in growth with our distribution partners. Direct store delivery, our DSD network, grew approximately 395% to our – in our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year. Our vending channel grew 296% approximately in the first quarter and drove over $202 million in incremental revenue. We are now in over 12,000 vending and micromarkets placement since the first quarter of 2021, increasing our number of locations by 96% and expect that growth to continue through the rest of the year.
In our fitness vitamins specialty channel, in addition to now being the number one drink at Lifetime Fitness in the quarter, we officially launched with solid core at 70 locations. GNC also expanded their offerings in their corporate sets and are partnership – partnered with CycleBar, which is lied with franchisees ordering product. Our mass club channel continues to accelerate following the rollout of the 561 Costco locations expanded in Q2 of 2021. Costco’s first quarter established a new record in revenue growing over 1,100% for Q1 of 2021 and we continue to gain transaction – traction in the online sales platform on Costco.com. We initiated a sell-in with over a full nationwide rollout with Sam’s Club at 589 locations and we also saw significant additional opportunities we see ahead in penetrating – further penetrating the club channel with BJ’s in 2022.
In Walmart, we expanded our store count of flavor assortment as well as gaining front-end coolers and NCAP activity in select locations and in Target, we have a chain-wide NCAP program, which we expanded our availabilities and also with additional cooler placements and in-store placements throughout the first quarter. In the convenience channel, our convenience store locations increased by 88% from the first quarter of 2021 and now totaled just under 64,000 locations. We began our national Circle K launch, which will be completed by the second quarter and totaled over 6,000 new locations upon completion, second only to our overall 8,000 locations with 7-Eleven in terms of total store size in the convenience store channel, with 7-Eleven and Circle K now being our two largest chains in that channel. RaceTrac was fully converted to DSD in the first quarter and we expanded our shelf placements through approximately between three quarters of a shelf to a full shelf in all locations.
The convenience store channel has the largest growth opportunity and addition expansion indoors in 2021 and we expect that growth to continue in 2022. Industry-backed third-party data continues to show accelerated growth metrics and we are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we increase our ACV across channels through additional launches with new chains and transitioning existing accounts to our DSD network for better optimization and in-product placements.
Consumer demand for Celsius accelerated to the first quarter of 2022 and as of April of 2022 to record levels with the most recent report in Nielsen scan data as of April 9, 2022, showing Celsius sales of up 216% year-over-year for 2 weeks, 215% for the 4 weeks, 230% for the 12 weeks with a 3.4 share according to Nielsen data on the energy category. This compares the energy category, which grew 6% on the 2 weeks, 11% on 12 weeks over the same period. Celsius also saw average price increase of 17.4% over the 52-week period. On Amazon, Celsius is the second largest energy drink with 18.23% share of the energy category, 6.6% share ahead of Red Bull at 11.6% share, and 7.7% share behind Monster at a 25.9% share, approximately that’s 4 weeks ending April 23, 2022 at Stackline data, energy drink category total U.S.
With this, sales hit record quarterly revenues for Amazon which totaled $13.8 million, up 74% from the first quarter of 2021. We continue to see acceleration through all channels and are now beginning to see the additional lift from the conversion of accounts to our national DSD network. This delivered growth of 395% in our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year. We secured additional distribution agreements during the quarter further expanding our availability. The company now has completed nationwide network, which now services approximately 99% of the population.
Our rollout of Celsius branded coolers in the first quarter was expanding with over 700 coolers placed and now over 1,900 coolers placed nationwide in key retailers. We have also implemented a comprehensive tracking tool to leverage growth acceleration metrics with retailers. In addition, over 400 barrel coolers were placed in key locations at premium retailers. And we anticipate additional cooler placements to continue through 2022. Our U.S. door count now exceeds 140,000 locations nationally growing over 49,000 doors or 53% from 93,000 from Q1 2021.
On our co-packer front, we continue to expand our partners and scale at existing locations improving our lifetime priority. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint now totals 13 that are active which will help protect for future out of stocks and support our growth that’s ahead. In Europe, sales totaled $8.5 million, a decrease of approximately 18% as a result of translation costs as well – translation as well as timing and trade campaigns, flavor, timing of flavor launches as well as supply chain delays. And we expect this to continue to optimize in the second and third quarter.
We recently launched our Amazon EU beginning with Great Britain, which launched with three flavors of Celsius and six flavors of our fast protein snack portfolio and Germany launched with three flavors of Celsius. We expect additional EU launches to take place through 2022 include France and Italy momentarily. Additionally, revenues are small today, but we see tremendous opportunities ahead.
In China, we maintain a licensing royalty model in the market, with fixed royalty revenues through 2024 which then becomes a volume based model, but no lower than the minimum royalties of $2.2 million. And our other international market locations driving growth includes Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore with initial markets penetrating as well as future opportunities with discussions in Japan, Australia and Taiwan. We continue to focus on our approach in these markets to find top distributors to partner with, to drive revenue, profitable revenue and growth opportunities.
Now, moving into the marketing front, on the marketing front, we continue to activate targeting new and existing consumers where they live, work and play building meaningful and emotional connections through robust integrating marketing programs. In the first quarter, we continue to activate through our Celsius Live Fit Tour and we kicked off a Celsius Essential Vibes Tour, which initially kicked off during the Super Bowl at Shaq’s funhouse, which was a great event. In addition, we also partnered with Shaun White around the Olympics and did a lot of activation. And we also launched a great flavor, a Mango Passionfruit in 7-Eleven nationwide, which was a very successful launch for us just to name a few items which we accomplished. We continue to activate and connect with consumers in a meaningful way, bringing new consumers to the Celsius portfolio and energy category.
We are driving leading growth in the energy category across all channels, expanding the demographics by bringing in an industry leading percentage of consumers from outside and new to category while accelerating our share and growing the energy category. We have committed the resources both personnel and operational infrastructure to maximize our opportunity.
I will now turn the call over Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John. Before I turn to the first quarter financial overview, I wanted to thank John and the entire team at Celsius for all the support they have provided over the last few weeks as we wrapped up our 10-Q and I transitioned into the CFO role. The company is very well positioned and I am excited to join the team as the business continues to accelerate and we progress on the many opportunities ahead of us.
And looking back at our last 10-K, we had noted some internal control weaknesses that we would be remediating this year. Although it has been less than 2 months since the issuance of our 10-K, I am pleased with our progress thus far and we are confident that we will be able to remediate these controls by the end of the year. We are building out our IT and internal audit teams as well as adding additional financial resources to our operations and sales teams in support of our ongoing growth and expansion.
Turning to our first quarter financial results. Our first quarter revenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 was approximately $133.4 million, an increase of $83.4 million or 167% from $50 million in the prior year. As expected, the growth was driven by our North American operations, where first quarter revenues were $123.5 million, an increase of $84.5 million or 217% from the prior year quarter. The balance of the revenues for the 2022 quarter were mainly attributed to European operations, which generated revenue of $8.5 million slightly below the prior year quarter primarily due to foreign exchange rates, raw material sourcing and timing.
Asian revenues, which include royalty revenues from our China licensee, contributed an additional $1 million, an increase of 80% from approximately $500,000 in the prior year. Other international markets generated approximately $0.5 million in revenues during the quarter, an increase of 256% versus the prior year quarter. The total increase in revenue was largely attributable to increases in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continue to strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in and optimization of our products presence and world class retailers, such as SKU additions, cold placement, and NCAP displays. Additionally, the continued expansion of our direct store delivery network resulted in significant growth of 395% in distributor revenues when compared to the prior year quarter.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2022 increased by approximately $33.3 million or 162% to $53.9 million. Gross profit margins decreased slightly to 40.4% for the quarter from 41.1% in the prior quarter. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in volume, while the decrease in gross profit margins is mainly related to higher raw material costs, customer mix and inflation across our supply chain.
Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 were approximately $31.6 million, an increase of $19.6 million or 164% from $12 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to higher marketing investment activities, which resulted in an increase of $9.1 million when compared to the prior year quarter. Additionally, employee cost increased by approximately $1.4 million from the prior year quarter as we continue to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth.
Lastly, storage and distribution expenses as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $9.1 million from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 23% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2021.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 were approximately $12.2 million, an increase of $4.4 million or 56% from $7.8 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to other administrative expenses, which drove an increase of $2.4 million or 116% increase when compared to the prior year quarter. The other administrative expenses are mainly related to increases in audit costs, legal expenses, bad debt reserves and insurance costs. Additionally, employee costs for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 reflect an increase of $1.2 million or an increase of 76.2% as investments in this area are being made to support our higher business volumes being generated by our commercial and operational teams.
We also saw a $700,000 increase in stock option expense when compared to the prior year quarter. Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote over performance, which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes.
Depreciation and amortization increases were minor at approximately $100,000 when compared to the prior year quarter. As a total percent of revenue, G&A costs decreased to 9% of sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 16% in the prior year as we were able to leverage G&A against our growth.
Net income for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 was $6.7 million or $0.09 per share based on a weighted average of 75.2 million shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share of $0.09 based on a fully diluted weighted average of 78.3 million shares outstanding. In comparison for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, the company had net income of approximately $600,000 or $0.01 per share based on a weighted average of 72.5 million shares outstanding and the diluted earnings per share of $0.01 based on a fully diluted weighted average of 76.9 million shares outstanding.
Focusing on liquidity as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $25.5 million and $16.3 million respectively and working capital or net current assets of approximately $186.5 million and $169.2 million respectively, with no long-term debt. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $9.1 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, which compares to $13.3 million of net cash used in operating activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. The approximately $22 million increase in cash generation was driven by an increase in net income and improvements in working capital.
Working capital improvements were driven primarily by the stabilization of our inventory as we have established optimal levels to service the demand of our products as well as timing of accounts payable offset in part by increases of accounts receivable driven by the significant growth in our business. Our current growing cash position, together with the expected results from operations should provide us with sufficient cash to operate our business as we continue to operate inventory levels and deliver strong growth throughout the year.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks. Good evening, guys or good afternoon and congratulations on a really strong result. John, why don’t we start I guess with sort of the state of the consumer, your businesses is obviously doing extremely well given the significant expansion of distribution as well as some really nice improvement in velocity. The Nielsen data still looks very good for the category. Are you picking up anything from distributors or anything perhaps from your sales folks in any geographies that gives you any concern around the state of the consumer? And then this kind of dovetails into a broader question around pricing and it’s not lost on you for a moment that, that Monster moved on that which is good news for the category. Maybe just comment on that sort of twofold state of the consumer and then given the likelihood the category moves with Monster pricing, any pause with that given what is viewed to be perhaps an increasingly fragile consumer? So sorry for the long winded question, John. No, Kevin, great question. I think when you look at it, there is a lot of discussions going on, right in regards to what’s going to happen with the consumer, what’s taking place with the customers. And like any of us, we are all very concerned. So I mean, there is talk about recession now. It looks like the inflation that we are all experiencing is not transitory. So everyone is making adjustments on that. We have spoken in prior calls about doing promotional strategies. And we have been hesitant on taking overall frontline pricing. We did initiate a frontline price increase, which we put out notices on April 1, which will slowly take into effect over the next couple of quarters, but that started to be implemented as of April 1. So, those are things we are working on. Their consumer sentiment seems to be quite mixed, especially with the news and what’s happening in the markets most recently. We do feel there is opportunities for Celsius to have a premium position and maintain a premium position in the category. Due to the pricing elasticity and the testing that we have done with some of our promotional strategies, we felt that we were able to take price, which will offset a lot of the inflationary costs that we have been experiencing in the beverage category overall.
So, we are watching it closely. This will give us additional leeway, where we can further adjust them promotional strategies on a go forward basis. But we do see, overall, the category continues to grow. We are watching it. Our growth is continuing. We think there is a lot of opportunity ahead based on where our pricing is at. We do think we are in a pretty good position given that we are not in over luxury position, product or offering. Got it. Thanks. Quick point clarification and one for Jarrod, the amount of the pricing that you took on April 1, was that across the entire portfolio and what was the amount? Yes, we haven’t – we did take frontline price where we haven’t disclosed, we are not going to disclose the percentage of the increase. That is something we are working on. It is a – I mean, it has been implemented within the frontline pricing portfolio and will continue to optimize, but we are not – at this point, we are not going to disclose the actual percentage that we took. We are taking a sufficient amount of price in order to protect the increases that we are experiencing in the inflationary environment. Okay, that’s good news. A quick one for Jarrod and then I will pass it on. So, Jarrod again, congrats again, and understanding it’s really early days, I think perhaps maybe just some early observation in terms of what you see as opportunity, whether this is around return optimization tools or SKU management, profitability, working capital, etcetera. Any comments there would be helpful? And I’ll pass it on. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I think early opportunities are really blocking and tackling. The company has grown significantly over the last 2 years, so really coming in and on the finance side looking at people processes and technology. So, we don’t want to be disruptive to the business. But I think there is a lot of opportunity from a data analytic perspective and from a finance perspective to really help the operations and sales teams in terms of analyzing the data, building out models and different things like that. The team has done a great job obviously doing that. But I think there is different processes we can implement to become more effective and efficient at what we do as well as some different tools from a technology perspective, so that we can do even better than we have done. So I think that’s probably there is some low hanging fruit from that perspective. And really, it’s just about building a team from a G&A perspective that can support the business as we continue to grow and excel. Very good. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. So, first question on club stores and kind of all the incremental growth from the club stores. Are you also delivering DSD to clubs? And then maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what velocity looks like there versus some of your other channels? Yes, thank you, Kaumil. In regards to the club channel, it’s been quite surprising for us. If you look over the last several quarters there, you see the growth that we delivered in Q1. Costco has been just an extreme success for the company. And we are told by one of the top selling beverages in the energy sec at Costco. So lots of opportunity to still grow and scale, especially leverage their online platforms, which we are working on. We do have some DSD. Mainly, the business is direct at this point. But I think the big opportunity for us in the club channel is to further leverage and optimize Sam’s Club and then also through 2022 opportunities that lie ahead with BJ’s. So, it’s a great channel, what’s interesting it didn’t affect our other channels, which are continuing to grow. When you look at the growth that we saw on Amazon as well as in all of our channels, it’s great. Okay, great. And then I am like, I noticed your 10-Q was out already. So that’s a little faster than last quarter. Since it’s out, maybe I can just ask about the freight expense. Maybe as I read it all too fast. But it looks like last year was up 3 – it was $3.2 million and only $4.2 million this year is that given how much you grew, I might have expected that to look quite different. I am just curious, is this linked at something related to timing, something with the orbit model? Just curious if there is just anything that might skew us a little bit? Yes, no, no, great question. I’ll turn it over to Jerrod. Yes, it’s something that we look into really, because we noticed the same thing over the last 6 weeks or so. But Paul and his team have done a great job managing freight in the first quarter. We did have a few opportunities that we took advantage of during the quarter and we benefited from. Some of that is the mix, so Costco as an example and also different kinds of packaging and growth at other specific customers where we are able to really leverage that orbit model that we have created, so that we were able to use local freight in many instances, which was much in terms of pricing per load, it was significantly reduced relative to what we were paying. So we did see a lot of good call it or lower costs come in from a freight perspective. We are going to continue to utilize that that opportunity. But it will vary depending upon the volume of the packaging and where the growth is happening. But with the growth in stores like Costco where we are closer to the warehousing and the production sites and where we can use local freight that will allow us to save some costs. Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just on – one more quick one, getting back to club stores, is there anything timing there that we should be aware of as it relates to just whether it’s filling inventory or anything like that, I just want to make sure I don’t get kind of a future comp… No. The revenue at Costco is just continue to be standard recurring revenue now that we have been in there a couple of quarters. Now, when you look at the sales of that took place in the quarter, that was a fill-in. But we did receive a reorder as well, so in the quarter. So, it was a fill-in and a reorder. So, I think we are going to – we had a lot to learn about Sam’s Club and the opportunity that lies there. We are just in the initial phases. I think we have a better understanding once we get through the second quarter. And maybe what does that initial run rate look like. Keep in mind when you go into a new retailer, historically, it has taken us some time to get up to ramped levels or enable that continual run rate. Although Costco seems to be what of an anomaly in some of the new retailers, we are entering now, just due to the brand awareness, sales are turning at a fairly good velocity level. So, a lot to learn there in the club channel. We will see how – I think we will have a better look at the end of the second quarter with the performance of Sam’s Club. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. Hi everyone, and let me add my congratulations. Just as we are on the topic club stores, just wonder if you could speak more about the opportunity with BJ’s, the status of BJ’s? What kind of the next steps are there and what we should look for? Yes. I mean we are in some BJ’s currently, Jeff, and thank you. The team has worked really great on the accomplishments. I mean it was a great quarter all around. Team is working really hard. And like I said on the call my prepared remarks, the amount of new team members joining the team is just really exciting time. So, we are just continuing to get better each and every quarter. But in regards to the BJ’s opportunity, right now, we are testing in some stores and regionally. But we feel pretty confident we will be able to hopefully get a larger rollout here within this year, it should – we should definitely get reset throughout this year. I think initial store tests have been positive. But that’s all will be dependent on the buyers, their decisions. But due to the success at Costco and initial success at Sam’s Club, we feel pretty confident about that. So, just a little bit premature on where those revenues will come in at. We are also looking at some additional pack size configurations to try to better optimize the margins for that business. And then we will look at the mix as we go forward, lots of opportunity. Okay. And then just sort of, I guess a follow-up to that, just thinking about your overall take on spring resets, maybe you can just touch on that. Yes. Pre-resets, we have an amazing key accounts team and actually had two individuals that started this week on their team as well as we further expand. The spring resets, like I said, we got Circle K, about 6,000 locations. They were – some divisions were delayed. They have about 13 divisions. So, you will start to see us in a variety of locations in the Circle K divisions today. But they will also be continuing to further roll out over the next several weeks, that due to really a lot of our – there has been a lot of delays with labor shortages on some of these resets, where some of these retailers have pushed out the reset delays due to labor shortages. So, we are working on that. But we think we are going to have a great reset. I talked about Walmart expansion earlier, Target. We are getting a lot of interest from existing accounts where we are going to see additional flavors on. We launched in the first quarter with the mango passion fruit, it was such a great success. If anyone has not tried the product, please go to 7-Eleven and try it, it’s amazing. It’s going to be a winner for us. And we have some new flavors coming out in Q2 that we just launched. So, I think it’s going to be a great summer as we head into summer beverage season. So, we are well positioned. You are starting to see that DSD network really come alive as the team further activates them we get better distribution, better placement and most importantly get it cold, so which we know we have a winning portfolio when it’s cold. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and continued success. Thank you, Jeff. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Okay. I think you might have hung up. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Hi, John and Jarrod, how are you? Excellent, Jeff. So, I think John, you were referring to strawberry lemonade, and Arctic five, which is my question. And it looks like 38 SKUs now. Can you talk a little bit about the launch cadence anticipated for the balance of the year? And then anything to call out specifically on go to sticks, either the regulars or the heats? Yes. No, that’s a great question, strawberry lemonade, I am being told that it’s probably the first best tasting energy drink out there. So, those we are really excited about that, this summer is going to be a great summer launch. And the Arctic five [ph], which is rolling out in the second quarter brings one of our – expand our Vibe portfolio, which is performing extremely well. And the convenience channel is a little bit more inviting fun. We got some great experiential marketing programs behind it for the summer. So, we think that’s going to be a great hit is a frozen berry flavor profile. So, we are excited about that. So, we will have about three flavors there coming to retail over the next several months. And when you look at our around on the go sticks, which is quite interesting. We are seeing a lot of demand for the on the go sticks. And although currently represents a smaller portion of the revenue, we did launch our heat on the go sticks, which is now available in a variety of retailers plus Walmart, and nationwide. So, lots of opportunities on the, on the go, is a portion of the core portfolio. And we continue to bring great innovative flavors to the category, our marketing team and innovation team is doing a great job. So, keep your eyes out. So, some great new flavors. That’s super and I have a follow-up, a wonder if you could call out anything in the international business outside of Nordics and China, any specific territories to call out, which are or could be perhaps, million plus territories this year? Look, I mean it was a great, that’s in North America, we are getting a lot of interest from some a, top tier distributors in other markets. I think it’s too preliminary to really talk about those markets right now. But we are getting a lot of interest from some Tier 1 distributors and distribution partners that you know, upon putting the right structure together to allow us to further expand and drive profitable growth, as we have talked about as we look at international and further expansion opportunities. So, we see a lot of great markets with same health and wellness trends in the U.S. or in Europe and in Asia. So, we have a global opportunity here. Super. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice quarter. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Let’s try that again. Can you guys hear me? Actually, Mark? Perfect. So, I wanted to go back on pricing, John, if you could go into the scanner data since April 1. It doesn’t look like your pricing has gone up. So, is there some sort of lag that we should be taking into account, is there offsets of the reduced promotional activity that you were doing in lieu of pricing? Prior to that and just might as well for related to the pricing, was there any sort of selling in the March quarter ahead of the price increase? Yes. Well, I think when you look at just that period in April 1, what we are seeing there is it’s benchmarking off the prior year. So, during that same timeframe, you are seeing some pricing adjustments which took place. We have reduced a lot of our promotions in regards to, the Buy Juice, Buy One Get strategies there. The pricing, frontline pricing we have taken is not going to be seen in retail, for likely, really impacted on the scanner data until like right around the third quarter. So, we started take frontline pricing, it is a process that we have implemented. And it’s going to take some time to set. But we did notify the mark – some of our key our key customers, and retailers which you have to provide notice for as of April 1st. So, you are not starting to see that in the scanner data that you are looking at today. But we did start to initiate a price increase as of April 1st. Got it. So, to be clear, we are going to see that in the data starting at what point in 3Q? You will likely start to start seeing that in the data, starting in the third quarter and then continuing through the fourth quarter. Got it. Okay. And then maybe just shifting to your comments and some of the work that we have done on the incrementality of both you as well as your performance, Energy brand, is there anything you can kind of point to in terms of how much you keep it to use specifically if you want in terms of incremental consumption, or incremental consumers to the energy drink category, versus sourcing share from more traditional players like Monster and Red Bull? Yes. I think that’s the great opportunity we have with Celsius. And that’s really the message we are providing retailers and our key customers. And what we are seeing in our key customers is we are not cannibalizing the sales of other leading players. So, what – we are incremental. And when you look at the category growth, we brought in over that time period contributed about 38% of the growth during that period. So, we are bringing in a new consumer into the energy category. We are helping the category further expand. Our demo has been 50-50, male-female. So, very much incremental to the category. There is some cannibalization slightly that you are seeing. But the majority of it is all new to category is what we are really seeing with some of our data. Great. That’s helpful. Thanks guys. Thank you, Mark. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Jeremy on the line for Anthony. Two quick questions for me, I know you mentioned on the call that you said the convenience store, I think that’s your greatest growth opportunity. Maybe could you talk a little more, so where do you see that growth coming from within the convenience store? Is that within current stores, you are in and if you are expanding the growth there or expanding store, stores in general? Yes. Jeremy, great question. I mean you look at the opportunity for us. And we have talked about this before on a variety of calls. But really what we are doing, we are really back-dooring the Energy category, when you look at it. The company has performed very well on Amazon, the e-com, the club channel, grocery, mass and extremely well in club at CVS. And the next frontier really is the convenience channel where 70% of energy drinks are sold. So, the team has done a great job, we talked about expansion at Race Track, 7-Eleven, you look at Circle K. So, by no means are we tapped out with the number of doors to capture in the convenience channel, we are just scratching the surface and just getting really in position in many of the leading convenience chains today. And you look at the like Loves and Flying J as well, we just recently entered. So, lots of opportunities, not only in expanding the ACV in the convenience channel, but also expanding the offerings, when you look at the number of offerings that Celsius currently has versus some of the leading players in the leading competition. So, we have a long runway ahead in that category for sure we feel. Okay. Great. And then just one more shift into gross margins, and on the call, you also mentioned that you have a lot of initiatives to offset inflationary costs. And this is I think before you even you took price, or you mentioned you took price, is there is there any more room in those initiatives for to help bump up the gross margins, or is that all have been baked in? Yes. I mean the challenge we have now and we have talked about it as well as these imported cans the company has to cycle through. So, the good news is, is that all the cans that we originally imported are now arriving. The final cans have arrived into the U.S. So, now it’s about flushing them or using them through this – through using them up and flowing them through the system. So, in Q2, we did have a good portion of international can mix. In our first quarter, we had a good portion of international can mix that was flowing through our cost of goods. In Q2, we anticipate the percentage of international cans to increase, which will further put somewhat pressure on our margins from Q1. And then we expect to use up those international cans by the end of the third quarter and get back to more of a normalized gross profit level somewhere in the mid-40s and by the fourth quarter and into 2023. We are working to further improve upon that. But that’s really kind of what we are looking at today based on the current environment. We are analyzing and optimizing the six orbit model, as Jarrod mentioned, to seeing the opportunities on local delivery savings versus the long haul rates. And then there are just so many other variables out there today. With aluminum alloy, you are seeing aluminum alloy come down in the most recent week, prior [ph], that’s been going up substantially. So, lots of movement there that we are looking at. But that’s kind of what we are seeing now. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I will hop in the queue. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with ROTH. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. First, John, if I could ask you to clarify something he spoke kind of quickly on in your opening remarks. When you were talking about Europe, and the decline in some markets there, I think you said you will continue to see optimization. So, can you clarify whether or not we should expect to see those revenues turn around and be positive year-over-year, or are you saying continuing to see some negative pressure there? Yes. I mean, I think we are still looking at – we had the team in Florida last week going over the strategies. I think we are still looking at somewhere of a 10% to 15% revenue growth rate for the year. At this point, we have had some delays in the first quarter associated with timing. There is also a lot of logistical challenges with railways being shutdown due to the activity in Europe and also some of the protein snacks portfolio had shortages of raw materials. So we have had a lot of things that impacted the first quarter. We are watching it closely for the second quarter. We have great programs and new flavor launches we will be working on. And I think we are – there is lot of opportunities in the European market. And it’s been a little bit slower than initially anticipated. But we do see a long runway ahead. Okay. Thanks. And then if I can ask two other quickies? What’s the outlook for your inventory levels relative to sales? I think you had said at the end of the fourth quarter that, that was unusually high and you would expect to see that coming down, obviously, really strong sales performance. But would you expect that kind of ratio of inventory to sales come down further from current levels? Yes. I mean, right now, when you look at our inventory and you look at the Q, I mean, we are sitting at, we did reduce inventory levels by about $6 million. You did have additional cans of those international cans move from a deposit into inventory, because we physically took possession. And then we finalized the purchase of the international cans we committed to when they – we had the cash shortages that took place. So we are going to be cycling through those cans, which I think is about right around 20 million or so that’s on the books, currently. I think, really good inventory levels, which is allowing us to really service customers on a 97% fill rate. We have a new distribution coming on. We are entering beverage selling season. And you are starting to hear about shortages and supply chains. So, when we talk to a lot of our year – a lot of our suppliers, there is talk about shortages again that are that have been talked about. So we feel we are in a good position. We have good inventory levels on raw. We are watching the markets very closely and we will take action as needed. Okay, thank you. And then just to touch on the price increase that one of your competitors announced kind of get a kick out of them saying, we are taking price up about 6% in 4 months, do you expect your customers to kind of load up on a lot of Monster product between now and then that could clog the channel a little bit? I mean, anytime you do a price increase you do get some load-ins there. I would assume 6% to get a return that you could make in a couple of months if that’s the [indiscernible], but I want to see how that there is challenges each and everyday in this business. So, it’s a street war. We got some really good distributors that will make sure we are housing our position. We don’t feel there is going to be any slowdown in our trajectory or the opportunity we lie ahead. We got really great team members, like I said and distributors and partners and we think we are in a good position. Great. Thank you. That brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to hand the call back over to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you on behalf of the company, and just like thank you everyone for their continued support and interest. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum as we capitalize on today’s global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place in the energy category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We are building upon our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying our best practices. We have a winning portfolio strategy and team and a large, rapidly growing market that consumers want. We believe we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead and we will continue to position and thrive in the transformation of today’s energy category. And additionally, I would like to thank all our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Stay healthy, stay fit.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our record second quarter represented our 16th consecutive quarter of sequential growth and an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2022. According to the trailing 12 weeks IRI MULO data as of July 10, 2022, Celsius continues to be the top driver of the energy category growth, representing 34% of the category growth, which corresponds to the #1 brand driving category growth. We were also notified last Friday that the S&P announced that Celsius will be added to the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index, graduating from the S&P Small Cap 600 Index after the close of trading today, August 9.
We continue to see growth across all channels, including those not tracked with the club channel sales increasing by approximately $24.9 million for the second quarter from 2021, an additional rollout and expansion in over 175 new BJ wholesale locations that have been -- took place in the second quarter. Our vending and foodservice channels continue to see rapid expansion with over 50% growth in sales from the first quarter with approximately $4.4 million in sales in the second quarter.
Additional second quarter retailer highlights include the benefits from the Walmart expansion we discussed on our Q1 2022 earnings call. Sales increased over 700% on a year-over-year basis in accordance with SPINS 12-week data as of June 12, 2022. And in the convenience channel, sales increased overall by 227% compared to the second quarter in 2021. And Celsius is now ranked the #5 brand in the convenience channel per SPINS energy ending June 12, 2022.
Moving to the most recent highlights for Celsius. On Monday, August 1, we announced a distribution and investment agreement with PepsiCo. This transformational partnership provides significant near-term U.S. growth acceleration with an estimated 40% increase in incremental distribution on top of our internal projected door growth over the next 12 months. we have also have begun the transition with PepsiCo -- to PepsiCo through our distribution and expect most of the transition to take place by the end of the fourth quarter.
As part of the transition, a $550 million convertible preferred investment was made by PepsiCo in Celsius, and the investment aligns incentives for both parties. The underlying -- the investment is priced at $75 per share. It converts approximately 7.3 million shares, which equates to approximately about 8.5% ownership in Celsius on an as-converted basis.
The preferred shares receive a 5% annual dividend, paid quarterly in cash or in kind at Celsius option. One point of clarification we want to be clear, on the call last week, we notified and discussed the transition was cash-neutral in regards to our distribution network. This was not inclusive of the $550 million investment by PepsiCo. In regards to the distribution settlement and transition costs, PepsiCo will assist with these charges as part of the distribution channel transition agreements, whereby the cost will be cash-neutral to Celsius.
As part of the strategic alignment and agreement with PepsiCo, we want to officially welcome James Lee to our Board of Directors. James Lee -- Mr. Lee is currently the Senior Vice President Chief Strategy and Transformational Officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America, PepsiCo's largest operating sector. He is responsible for leading the PBNA's long-term strategy, business development, digital and value chain transformation and sustainability. Mr. Lee joined PepsiCo in 1998 and has had several financial leadership and other leadership roles since that time, including Senior Vice President of PBNA, Senior Vice President and CFO of Russia and CIS region; Vice President and CFO of Southeast Europe; Senior Director and CFO of PepsiCo, Australia and New Zealand; and Senior Director, Strategy and Planning of China Beverages. We look forward to utilizing his significant experience in both domestic and international opportunities.
For those of you who did not have a chance to join our conference call discussing the key drivers of this agreement and transition, a replay with a slide presentation can be accessed on the webcast included in the link in the press release that was released Monday, August 1.
Moving to some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Sales hit another quarterly record of $154 million, and our U.S. revenue totaled $145.4 million as approximately $22 million increase sequentially from the first quarter in U.S. revenues. Revenue growth was driven by continued new store additions with C-store additional drivers, a significant portion of the U.S. growth, SKU expansion, additional cold placements with both our branded Celsius coolers and expanding in retail coolers.
International sales represented approximately 5.6% of total sales for the quarter with sales down about $2.9 million or 25% to $8.6 million from $11.5 million a year ago quarter. Driven by the Nordic, revenue decreased to $7.3 million compared to $10.8 million the prior year. This was partially offset by sales in other international markets, which totaled approximately $1.3 million, was up $680,000 and included royalties from China.
Gross profit for the quarter increased 110% approximately to $59.3 million, up from $28.2 million for the year ago quarter. Gross margin was approximately 38.5% or about 44%, excluding outbound freight, compared to 43.4% and 51.8%, excluding outbound freight, in the prior year quarter. This represented approximately 190% basis point decline from the first quarter margins and is consistent with our expectations that we discussed on our Q1's earnings call. We expect Q2 as came in as expected, where we saw our margins under pressure due to the large percentage of international cans flushing through during the quarter.
We reiterate and our expected expectations of sequential gross margin improvements throughout 2022 with fourth quarter gross profit margin is expected to be in the mid-40s. With the exception of higher cost with international cans, a majority of our other COGS increases have been offset by scale efficiencies to raw materials, production, full truck shipments and reducing the miles on cases as well as optimizing our 6-orbit warehouse expansion, which we announced last fall.
Our product channel mix has also been impacted margins as well in regards to the club channel revenue, which has historically been lower margins due to the secondary repacking facilities that is required and needed. With this rapid growth in the channel, which represented approximately $30.9 million of revenue in the second quarter, it has increased the overall margin pressure. And we continue to take initiatives and through production initiatives to improve margins in this channel, including working with our co-packers who are working on capabilities to basically conduct the multi-packing in line versus hand packing. So this will improve our margins on a go-forward basis, which we expect to implement some time in the fourth quarter or early Q1 of 2023.
Overall, we see -- continue to expect cycling through the majority of our remaining international cans in the third quarter. In conjunction with the price increase rollout, we expect our margins to move back to that mid-40% range in the fourth quarter, even with a higher mix of club business. In addition, we are transitioning from a significant number of our independent distributors to the PepsiCo distribution. This will allow our team to consolidate sales, marketing and distribution efforts with associated cost benefits, which we expect to recognize and leverage once the transition is complete. We will provide additional clarity on both margins and operational leverage and targets as we move through the transition but expect additional net benefits on both of these metrics.
Some additional highlights for the second quarter. Our DSD network sales delivered growth of in the second quarter when compared to the prior year, totaling approximately $61.9 million with over $41.8 million approximately in incremental revenue generated during the quarter. On our fitness and vitamin specialty channels, we launched the co-branded displays with CycleBar, and we expanded into Life Time Fitness. We are now the #1 selling SKU brand in fitness and saw record revenues in June.
On our mass club channel, it continues to accelerate. The club channel now totals 1,337 locations with approximately expansion of 175 BJ locations as discussed we expanded in the second quarter. In the convenience channel, our stores continue to increase -- our store locations increased by 97% or over 40,000 locations to 82,000 locations at the end of the second quarter of this year. This compares to 42,000 locations at the end of the second quarter last year. The convenience store channel accounted for on retail on sales, according to IRI SPINS of about $87 million in the second quarter, and our sales were up 227% compared to the second quarter and 2021 core IRI SPINS.
Industry-backed third-party data continues to show accelerated growth metrics. We are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we increase our ACV across channels and have launched additional nationwide and expand our independent chains through our new distribution agreement with PepsiCo.
Consumer demand for Celsius on a dollar base accelerated through the second quarter of 2022 and through July of 2022 to record levels. Their most recent reported Nielsen scan data as of July 16, 2022, shows Celsius sales were up 143% year-over-year for 4 weeks, 194% for the 12 weeks and 185% for the second quarter. This compares to the -- the overall energy category grew 8% for the 4 weeks, 8% for the 12 weeks, approximately 8% for the second quarter over the same period.
On Amazon, Celsius has continued to maintain the second-largest energy drink spot with a 22.6% approximately share in the energy category, ahead of Red Bull that has a share of approximately 10.6% and just behind Monster at a 24.7% approximately. And this is as of the latest 4 weeks ending July 30, 2022, Stackline Energy category data total U.S. Celsius year-over-year sales is up 185% compared to Amazon energy category, which is up 79%. Celsius is outpacing the category growth on the platform by approximately 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, and that is the 4 weeks ending July 30, 2022, Stackline total energy total U.S.
The company placed an additional 800 coolers in the second quarter of 2022 and over 2,700 since the beginning of this year. The company anticipates the continued acceleration of cooler placements throughout 2022. Our total U.S. store count now totals approximately 196,000 locations nationally, growing over 59,000 doors and locations or 54% growth from 109,000 doors or stores reported as of the end of the second quarter of 2021 with additional expansion planned throughout 2022 and acceleration anticipated with the new partnership with PepsiCo.
On our co-packer front, we continue to expand our co-packer partners and scale at existing locations, improving our line priority time. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint totals 13 that are active, which will help protect future out of stocks and support our massive growth. Internationally, Nordics revenue totaled at $7.3 million, a decrease from the prior quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange rates and timing of orders -- and both timing of new launches with end consumers as well as supply chain delays in the market. Revenue from other markets totaled about $1.3 million. It was up 957% from $680,000, which included revenues from China.
As we have publicly stated on past several calls, we continue to explore discussions with large-scale international distribution partners, which can facilitate material worldwide expansion. I'm excited to say we have now found that partner. As part of the PepsiCo distribution agreement, Celsius is now the preferred global energy partner with PepsiCo, which holds the #2 position in beverage distribution globally. While we just began our distribution partnership with PepsiCo and the initial focus will be on U.S. distribution transition to their networks, we see significant opportunities to capitalize on global scale, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offering, which will now include the distribution partnership to accomplish our international expansion goals.
Before I turn the call over to Jarrod, I want to close my prepared remarks recognizing the amazing job of our entire team and all of our partners has -- which they have done, establishing Celsius as the leading driver of brand growth in the energy category over the first half of 2022 and the incremental opportunities for growth going forward with our new partner, PepsiCo.
I'd like to turn the call now over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before jumping into the results, I'll cover a quick housekeeping item. As an update to our previously disclosed SEC inquiry, we have fully responded to all follow-up questions but do not have any material updates to date on this process other than reaffirming our previous comments.
Turning to our second quarter financial results. Our second quarter revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, was approximately $154 million, an increase of $88.9 million or 137% from $65.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021. Approximately 103% of this growth was as a result of increased revenue from North America where second quarter 2022 revenues were $145.4 million, an increase of $91.8 million or 171% from the 2021 quarter. The balance of the revenue for 2022 was mainly attributed to European revenue of $7.3 million, which decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange rates and timing.
Asian revenues, which include royalty revenues from our China licensee, contributed an additional approximately $900,000, an increase of 43% from approximately $600,000 for the prior year quarter, which includes increases in royalties payable under our licensing agreement. Other international markets generated approximately $400,000 in revenues during the 2022 quarter, an increase of roughly $400,000 or 634% from the prior year quarter. Total increase in revenue was largely attributable to increases in sales volumes as opposed to increases in product pricing.
The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels combined with an increase in optimization of our products presence in world-class retailers, i.e. additional SKUs. Additionally, the continued expansion of our DSD, or direct store delivery, network resulted in significant growth in distributor revenues of in excess of 200% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Gross profit. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, gross profit increased by approximately $31.1 million or 110% to $59.3 million from $28.2 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021. Gross profit margins reflected a decrease to 38.5%, 44% excluding outbound freight for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, from 43.4% or 51.8% excluding outbound freight for the 2021 quarter. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in volumes, while the decrease in gross profit margin is mainly related to higher raw material costs, primarily aluminum cans, ocean freight costs, transportation costs and repackaging costs.
We estimate that the increase in gross profit dollars of approximately $31.1 million from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter included $40.7 million related to volume increases as well as an unfavorable cost impact of approximately $7.5 million and unfavorable currency impact of $2.1 million.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 21% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 24% in the second quarter of 2021 as we were able to leverage our accelerated growth. General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, were approximately $14.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 17% from $12.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021. Employee costs for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, reflect an increase of $1 million in investments in this area also required to properly support our higher business volume in the commercial and operation areas of the business as well as travel and expenses, which are now being incurred.
Administrative expenses amounted to $6.8 million or an increase of $4.1 million when compared to the prior year quarter. Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $200,000 when compared to the prior year quarter. These increases were offset by a $3 million decrease in stock-based compensation, which amounted to $4.2 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote overperformance, which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes. All other administrative expenses, which were mainly composed of research, development and quality control testing, decreased by approximately $200,000 from the second quarter of 2021.
Lastly, as a total percent of revenue, G&A costs decreased to 9% of sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, compared to 19% in the prior year. When excluding stock-based compensation, G&A costs decreased to 7% of sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, compared to 8% in the prior year.
Net income for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, was $9.2 million or $0.12 per share based on a weighted average of 75,451,165 shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share of $0.12 based on a fully diluted weighted average of 78,000 -- 78,371,705 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact share-based awards of 2,920,540 shares. In comparison, for the 3 months ended June 30, 2021, the company had net income of approximately $800,000 or $0.01 per share based on a weighted average of 73,158,836 shares outstanding and a diluted earnings per share of $0.01 based on fully diluted weighted average of 77,238,389 shares outstanding.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital reserves. As of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $60 million and $16.3 million, respectively and working capital of approximately $197.9 million and $169.2 million, respectively, with no long-term debt. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $42.3 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, which compares to $30.3 million net cash used in operating activities for the 6 months ended June 30, 2021. The approximately $72.6 million increase in cash generation was driven by an increase in net income and improvements in working capital.
I also wanted to cover a few additional metrics we believe provide a good perspective of our operational performance in the second quarter. Starting with inventory. Total Q2 ending inventory decreased to $162 million from $191 million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, raw material inventory decreased from approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $57 million in the second quarter with the reduction primarily representing the pull-through of international cans as well as the fantastic job our sales and operations teams have done in selling product over the summer.
As we've stated a number of times, even with this decrease, we are carrying some additional inventory as we work our way through the busy selling season and also with the ongoing supply chain challenges, but we have not seen any major disruptions in our supply chain network as demonstrated by our phenomenal fill rate. With the latest injection of funds from our PepsiCo transaction, we have sufficient firepower to take our business to the next level as we transition into the PepsiCo distribution network across the U.S. and then internationally.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Congrats on another strong result. So I know it's really only been a week here, but would just love to get some perspective on whether you have some updated thoughts on the Pepsi distribution agreement. Have you begun to wrap your head around like kind of a long-term revenue opportunity and how we should be really thinking about the benefits of top line growth looking out to 2023? Yes. Thank you, Peter. The team did a great job of results, and we are starting to work through that process. Based on our analysis, when we look at it, we look at the opportunity, we're also looking at the results from Bang relationship on increase of points of distribution and GDP. We do anticipate the expansion into these alternative channels or to unreported as well in regardless to foodservice and also independent convenience, we see a huge opportunity for the brand to expand. And we anticipate about a 40% increase in distribution at the end of solidifying this relationship over the first 12 months, and it could be a significant upside from that number. But initially, internally, we're going with a 40% increase over our expected growth rates that we were -- internally had over the last 12 months. Got it. Super helpful. And then I guess following up on a separate topic, just the gross margin progression. I know you reiterated sequential improvement, but still kind of a meaningful gap versus where you landed in 2Q versus kind of getting back to that mid-40s in 4Q. So is there any way to frame kind of the expectation for 3Q and then kind of the buildup from there into 4Q? Yes. Yes. Thank you, Peter. We spoke -- I think it was our Q4 call, we talked about like some of the impact on the percentage is roughly around 6% in regards to some of the impact we were getting from the international cans. So we're still cycling through. So I know it looks like a big increase as we expect to be back in the mid-40s in Q4.
Q3 probably could be somewhat similar. There is some upside. We do think there is potential for sequential growth. We're working through cycling through the rest of these international cans that are on our balance sheet. All the cans now -- the majority of the cans are now in finished goods. So we'll be cycling -- we anticipate the cycle through the majority of the finished -- of the international cans in the third quarter.
So it's hard to say on the exact percent where that will land, but we do think there's sequential growth in the third quarter. And then our goal is to get back to the mid-40% range by the end of the fourth quarter. Congrats again. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Can we talk about the club channel a little bit? You mentioned -- you gave us a good amount of figures on your success in the club. How much of that was kind of first-time fill-in versus kind of continuation? Obviously, BJ's seems to be a bit new. And can you maybe just talk about what we should expect from this channel going forward now that you seem to be in quite a few more stores? Yes. Kaumil, good question. The club channel has been really surprising to us. We first started expanding in that channel. And really, that happened in the fourth quarter with the national rollout at Costco. And then in the first quarter of this year, we expanded into Sam's Club.
So when you're looking at the second quarter, you're really looking at reorders from those customers. Now that's 175 stores from BJ's are new. But in general, you're looking at majority of reorders that are flowing through those clubs. And the volume coming through those clubs is just really exciting because just shows you the opportunity. And we're not seeing any slowdowns in alternative -- from the other channels as well. So it was really incremental to our overall sales. Okay. Great. And then on the -- it's been a week now. You've probably had some, I guess, tough conversations on the transition over to the Pepsi system. Could you just talk about what you're doing to try to keep it be as smooth as possible? Yes. We're working with the team. So I've spent a lot of time today with the teams as well, trying to work on -- get our plans ahead. We have a lot of team members that have worked through the PepsiCo transition in the past. And I think with the groups involved, we're going to hopefully be able to mitigate as much of the disruption as possible. We know there will be disruption, but we're trying to put plans in place to mitigate that, especially with the transition of the timing and when the -- your existing distributors and your new partner can start servicing chains.
We're trying to work closely with a lot of our distributors. We're going to start really working with them on the transition piece to try to limit the impact that you see in the marketplace. And that's the best we can do at this point. We do have plans in place, and we're working to fill that supply chain on the PepsiCo system. We're working on that over the next several weeks. We'll be filling a lot of their mixing centers at first before we go, and then we'll move to direct with some of the larger distributors to really optimize shipping costs and logistics costs as well. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. I wanted to pivot to the international business. A 2-part question. The first one, just sort of near term and cleanup. Jarrod, I think you mentioned the results in Europe. Some of it was timing-related. Certainly, the stronger dollar played a part. Should we expect to see that reverse? If it's such a smaller part of the business, but I think it's sort of enough to move the needle a bit versus The Street in the quarter. Maybe just comment on some of the near-term dynamics. And I think, John, more importantly, of course, is going to be the opportunity with PepsiCo, where I understand they have a right of first refusal for the international distribution. Maybe just speak to how quickly you can move on that opportunity, balancing the significant opportunity you have in the U.S. as well. Yes. So Kevin, the first part, there were some issues in getting the supplies and the product that we needed, especially for a new line that we were trying to get in a new SKU into Sweden. And so we weren't able to get that in for the selling season. So we did miss that.
If you look at July, we've had very good results. The team has worked and been very focused on making sure that we've got products on the shelves. And so we are moving back into the right direction, and we fully expect the team to be in good shape in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year, but we did have a lot of supply chain issues. Many of those were around the location in terms of availability of transportation because it was being utilized for other means. But at the moment, we are ready. The product is on the shelf. And we saw, like I said, very good results in July, and we expect good results for the rest of the year. Yes. And Kevin, on part 2 of your question in regards to the international opportunity, we see massive opportunities. Like I said before, the same health and wellness trends that we see in North America are global trends. And this fitness helping wellness trend is a megatrend that's kind of really taking on all regions of the globe.
So I think it's going to be timing and sequencing. We do not -- we want to make sure that when we enter new market, we enter it correctly, very methodically on our approach as we've done to make sure we build that loyal consumer and really become part of a daily lifestyle or the daily routine. We're really adamant on that as we build scale. Want to be cognizant on entering new markets, but talking about the U.K. and Germany as near-term opportunities.
But right now, we're really focused as a company on this transition. We want to make sure there's North America transition gets completed with at least disruption as possible. And then we do have ongoing discussions now with the opportunities in the U.K. where we're looking to explore. Just a quick follow-up on what you're seeing with current trends. As we look at the Nielsen data, the category slowed a little bit. Your data still looks quite good. I think the distribution gains -- or excuse me, the sales gains are -- year-over-year sales growth being more driven by distribution than velocity. I think that it has been more recently. Do you want to speak to that at all? Has anything been surprising to you in terms of how your results have come in or with respect to pull-through from a velocity perspective as you've expanded into additional doors? Yes. No, Kevin, I think the brand is performing really well given the growth we've seen, especially over the most recent resets in entering new markets and new retailers. So we're watching it. We watch it very closely. We do see good growth coming out of our established markets. Some of our new markets, as you enter new market, your velocity is not going to be as high as some of your more mature markets that are building.
So we're being very cognizant of that, very methodical on our targeted marketing programs, really making sure we're building the brand awareness in those markets while strategies over the next, really right now in Q3, we have a lot of great programs going on. You'll see that towards the back half of this year and into 2023. So that is something we're watching very closely, but we think the velocity levels are truly strong, especially given the expansion in the ACB gates. Okay. Very good. And congrats on the quarter. Thanks. Thanks, Kevin. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Partly just following up on that question. So if you look at where your penetration is versus the energy drink category and larger peers, you have roughly 50% of sales coming from C-store. So I guess as you think about expanding that probably via the Pepsi partnership, how do you factor in the velocity? And what should be a higher sales per unit or per space channel? That's the first question. Yes. We think that's a -- thank you, Mark. We think that's the biggest opportunity as well is with the PepsiCo system, is really being able to further expand the ACV in convenience as the latest data showed 67% of the volume in the energy category is coming from the convenience channel. And when you look at the data and look at how the product is performing and some of the broader retailers getting Circle K, Speedway, QT, RaceTrac, just to name a few of those, the product is doing extremely well in those retailers.
And as we're entering -- as we enter new markets, you are going to see a slower velocity at -- in the beginning, but we're seeing a higher velocity than we saw prior several years back when we were entering new markets. So the velocity level does seem to -- on the new stores, you enter slowly. You need to get involved into the daily consumers' lives, but then we do see that building on. So we do think that will balance out.
Now as we further expand into the larger convenience store channel, we get a higher ACV. Some of those stores will not be as productive as some of the stores that we're in currently. So just keep that in mind as well just given the geography, the volumes on some of these other, call it, Tier 3 or Tier 4 accounts that we'll be entering. So that's something to keep in mind. It will also benefit from moving into the mixing centers because we'll be able to go with Pepsi and with their products into these smaller convenience as opposed to just going in on our own. So there will be some benefit in combining with them and working with them on their metals program and a variety of different things that can help keep our velocity up at the same time.
So we think there's some things that will help it go. But there's definitely -- as we enter new markets and new territories, we're pleased with what we're seeing, but it is a little slower to get things moving. And like John has mentioned a variety of times, we're really excited to see what we can do with foodservice as well. Yes. And I think just as well, when you look at where the opportunity lies, it's better placement in existing accounts as well and better placement in new new distribution points, getting into that what we call the bull's eye within the coolers and getting in that strike zone that the sales team has been working on. We think PepsiCo will be able to really leverage that, especially through their metals program as we expand independence. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up, 2 related questions to that. One, why is it looking at bank distribution points the ultimate opportunity rather than just the 40% incrementality that you're talking about? I think if you look at the data, spending is roughly in twice the point of distribution that Celsius is today. And then second question, just on the mixing piece of it. Maybe talk a bit about that. Is that a potential starting point? How do you think about potentially working with Pepsi from a co-packing standpoint as well to sort of more co-habitate everything together under one roof? Yes. I think your first question in regards to the 40% increase in distribution, I think that's a great reference point. That's really what we're using internally. We were just mentioning the Bang. We did watch that through that process. But I agree, just a 40% increase in the overall distribution is kind of what we're expecting here over the next 12 months.
When you do look at the initial rollout with PepsiCo on the logistics and operations side, we will be entering their mixing centers for immediate efficiencies to feed out to their distribution networks in a very most efficient manner. And then we'll continue to optimize that going direct to some of the larger houses. When you look at production and co-packing, I think that's opportunities down the road, but it's something we're not discussing today. And just to be clear, it's distribution. So it's not top line. I think you got that, Mark, but just to be clear on the call or not, looking for all of a sudden, the top line to be 40% higher than we had expected. We're looking to get to distribution up 40%. Yes. No, I think that's well understood by folks. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. I just wanted to follow up on the Nordics business. Does the Pepsi partnership change how you'll handle business in that -- in those countries as well as the FAST protein business associated with that? Jeff, great question. Right now, I mean, we're really not -- we haven't really looked -- explored those opportunities yet. I do think -- we do think there's a big opportunity for the FAST portfolio. PepsiCo does have a big snacks business, as we all know. And our FAST portfolio is one of the leading protein snack portfolios in Finland.
So there is opportunities there, but I think we're a little bit earlier in the phase on the discussions there. But there is opportunities, for neuro opportunities, to get further synergies and leverage best practices and their distribution partners throughout those regions. Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about your plans for coolers. I know, obviously, you have a lot more capital to put into buying more coolers. But co-location with Pepsi coolers or how does that all evolve now with Pepsi as far as being cold? As is another great opportunity we spending some time talking about. We're going to be entering some of their co-branded energy coolers that are -- there's roughly about 50,000 to 70,000 of them out there in the marketplace just in North America alone and will be included in those coolers. So we're pretty excited about that.
In addition, we will be placing -- one of the big strategies as we all know, placing coolers, we have over 2,700 that we placed so far this year in the first 6 months. We're looking to ramp that up. We do have orders in -- already placed for larger cooler placements and getting a lot of interest on those as well. Trying to get a fixed fee from the checkout is ideal. That's where we want to be. We see great rotations and great opportunities. But we're definitely focused on placing coolers at front checkout. Okay. And then just one more, if I could squeeze it in. Just any comments on pricing -- your pricing strategy? Pricing strategy has not changed. Where pricing strategy, we did take price. As we announced, we'll expect we are rolling that through a phased approach. And we're monitoring pricing very closely as we continue to move forward. The category is price-sensitive, promotionally sensitive as well. So we do think there's opportunities to further take price with the brand as we maintain our premium position. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg. Congrats on the news last week, and congrats on the S&P upgrade. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. Just a couple of questions from our side. So any commentary specifically on the rollout of the On-The-Go sticks as far as early learnings? And I'm assuming the On-The-Go sticks are also part of the deal with Pepsi as well. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. The powdered product is going to be something we're managing internally. That's not part of the PepsiCo arrangement. We are seeing great interest in our powdered products. CMP, Spin it into Walmart, many retailers, including down here in Florida, Publix, does well online. We do think on the go for our core consumer. It is a smaller portion of our revenue. It does contribute to good gross -- does have to gross margins but -- and it tastes great. So there's an opportunity in the portfolio, but that is not part of that PepsiCo arrangement. But you will start to see it in more retailers around the country. Yes. We do see an opportunity to really expand the distribution across the retail market. And it's a product that can be transported pretty easily because of its -- it's lightweight. So we'll be able to roll it straight into the distribution centers of the various retailers. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Jarrod, could you maybe walk us through and comment on sales and marketing and G&A for the back half of the year and going forward? Does it -- does this seem unreasonable that we should expect a more muted ramp with the PepsiCo arrangement? Yes. Especially in Q3, we'll probably keep our foot on the gas on the sales and marketing piece. Where we're seeing our leverage within G&A and within S&M is really our people cost, where we're able to scale up our business without adding the same number of heads over the last -- if you look year-over-year, so we got about 1% on the S&M line and 1% on the G&A line from [indiscernible] to expand at the same rate from a personnel need.
So I think we'll be able to continue to maintain that kind of trajectory both from a marketing and a sales perspective. We will keep our foot on the gas and keep that going while we're doing the restocks and while we're really rolling into the Pepsi footprint. We want to keep the velocity going, and we want to keep the demand there and keep the brand in front of mind. Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Just a couple of questions. First on the expanded distribution. You've mentioned 40%-plus -- with the Pepsi distribution agreement, you'd be able to expand by 40%. Just on the capacity side, how quickly are you able to ramp up capacity to meet that is that currently in your current capacity? Or do you have to sign additional co-packer agreements and just kind of where you're at with that? And then I have a question about the termination agreements with the distributors. Within our current orbit structure that we've set up, we do have that capacity to flex up to meet the demand of the extra 40% in 2023 and also to continue to expand in 2024 and 2025. So as we look out over the next 3 years, from an expectation perspective, we've got plenty of capacity with our current system to meet the demand. And then on the termination agreement, I know that Pepsi is going to help with that. What percent approximately are they going to pay of those termination agreements with your DSD networks? Yes. So it's -- we've got the -- we're not going to be able to get all of our DSD network in this year. We think we can get most of it in this year. I think the way we're managing it is consistent with how Pepsi has managed Rockstar and Bang in terms of growing in the distribution. There will be some distributors that we keep, and there will be some distributors that over the next year or 2 years or maybe even 3 years that will roll out. So as we get farther away, further discussions will happen between us and Pepsi in terms of where we want to go. But at the moment, a majority or most of the cost of these terminations will be borne by Pepsi as a part of the partnership. Our next question comes from Sean McGowan with ROTH Capital. Following up on some similar questioning before. But could you -- is there a scenario where you might imagine sales and gross margin actually dipping ahead of the full benefit of the transition? Is there a disruptive scenario where you actually have a slowdown in sales and a drop in gross margin? Or should we expect this to be kind of smooth up into the right, right from the get-go? In regards to -- in the way we're seeing the third quarter, we are going to have a pipe order and a fill order into the PepsiCo system, and then we will have some returns that are going to be coming through as we pick up inventory. So it is going to be -- there's going to be a lot going on in the P&L in the third quarter in regards to sales with the pipe order to fill and then returns -- estimated returns on product that will -- in case we have to take up a product, which we likely will be picking up product from those distributors that will be terminating. So the margins, we do feel, should be somewhat accretive from this point forward, but I think soft guidance on that. I don't know if, Jarrod, you have anything to add. Yes. I mean it's really going to be up those to make sure that we're meeting our fill rates. And so that's what we've been planning with our operations team and our sales and marketing team is really to make sure we got the product on shelves. As long as the products are on the shelf, the consumer won't notice the difference. There will or potentially could be some sell-in as we move away from one group of distributors and into the other groups. So there could be a little bit of noise on the backside. But we believe that we'll be able to keep a good tight lid on things in terms of making sure products on the shelf. Okay. And while you're -- mic is still on your hand, Jarrod, you talked on the last call last week about some things that you might help us out with on how they'll be accounted for, these distribution fees. I don't imagine it's going to all hit in 1 quarter. Is that a fair assumption, that it could kind of be spread out over several quarters? How is that going to be accounted for? How are you going to treat the assistance that you get from a P&L standpoint? And is the Pepsi investment right now sitting on the balance sheet as $550 million in preferred stock? The settlement fees, the termination expenses, we will have to book an accrual for any distributors that we've basically sent a letter or sent a termination note on. So majority of the termination expense will be on the books at Q3. There will be some that have not sent letters for. There are some that we need to -- that don't have a 60-day term or a 90-day term or 120-day term. They might have a 1-year term. So we wouldn't have sent that yet.
So there will be -- most of them will be on the books. There are stragglers out there, but the majority of them will be in Q3. It will be recorded within OpEx as an expense. So it would be very significant. To give you a perspective, I think when we look back at Monster, it was something like $112 million or something to that impact. So it will be significant on our P&L. It will likely be higher than that with inflation that Monster paid their fees quite a while ago.
With that said, the assistance that we will get will be recorded into the balance sheet, and it will be amortized over the life of the agreement with Pepsi. We are kind of reviewing what we believe that term would be because there's a variety of clauses within the agreement that we need to make sure line up with GAAP and that we're making the right decision in terms of what the lifetime of that rollout would be. So the expense, more or less, will be hitting the P&L. The impact of the assistance from Pepsi will be borne over a number of years.
In terms of the preferred stock at the moment, based on the way we're reading the researches, it will be mezzanine equity. We should be finalizing that up in the next few weeks, though, in terms of where our expectations are from that aspect. Okay. And then on these termination fees, just to clarify, so if you know that you're going to be taking, just pick a hypothetical number of $150 million, you would book that $150 million as an expense in Q3 even if you did lay out all of that cash in Q3. So some portion of the offset would be assistance from Pepsi and the rest would be simply didn't pay it in cash yet, right? It's just a prepaid asset or something like that, right? Yes. So the cash impact should be nominal, but it will -- the expense is just a timing thing. So on the cash flow statement, it will be nominal. There might be a little bit of timing, probably not much, if any. But on the P&L, yes, it will be up in -- it will actually be a deferred revenue. Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with the Maxim Group. Just a quick question on the international revenue. I think you mentioned on the call, John or Jarrod, I don't know, but timing of some shipments, supply chain issues. Is that something -- obviously, North America is incredibly strong, growing well over 100% for the last couple of quarters. Is it a distribution issue? Or is it a combination of distribution and supply chain? Is that something -- even though I know it's not a focus right now, but is that something that you think the Pepsi distributor agreement will help address? Yes. So over in the Nordics, it was more of an ingredient issue and getting the ingredients to our co-pack partner in order to manufacture the product. And there were some distribution -- or not distribution, but supply chain channels that got disrupted because of the activity that was going on over there and still continues to go on over in that part of the world. So that was the biggest piece and because we couldn't get the right raw material in for the new product we were launching or the new SKU we were launching, we weren't able to get that to market in time for the summer selling season. So that was the biggest component of -- over in Sweden, other than obviously the FX impact that we had.
There was a little bit of the same kind of things that happened in Finland as well from an ingredient perspective. Those suppliers are back on track again. We've got our product. And we have been working with Paul, who's over in the U.S., on making sure that we've got enough stock over in -- with our -- actually, it's a German co-packer, as we go forward so that we don't have to worry about the out of stocks that we had before. So is that something you expect to be resolved here in the current quarter? Or is that going to take another couple of quarters to resolve? No. It's resolved. Lot of logistical challenges in the second quarter, too, Anthony. As Jarrod mentioned, there was a lot of disruption in supply chain for our European partners. And to the second part of your question with Pepsi, with their organization and their scale and ability from a procurement perspective, it will definitely benefit us from a supply chain perspective and a purchasing perspective both here and over in Europe. But like you said, it will be a huge opportunity for us in Europe because they've already got the supply chain set up, the distribution set up. We do have products that we're already manufacturing over there. So we are over there. So launching over there will be less complicated than if we didn't have anything over there already. So it does set us up well as well as over in Asia in that part of the world because we've got a co-packer over there as well. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support and interest. Our results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum. We're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends, and the transformation is taking place in the energy category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core, leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy and team in a large, rapidly growing market that consumers want.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The company achieved a record quarter in the third quarter of 2022 with sales over $188 million, delivering revenue growth of over 98% and according to their most recent scan data at retail, per IRI MULOC total energy, one week ending October ‘23, 2022, Celsius is now the third largest energy drink in the United States.
In addition, according to the trailing 12-week IRI MULOC total energy as of October 2, 2022, representing the majority of the third quarter, Celsius was again the number one brand driver of growth in the energy category in the United States, responsible for 29% of the category growth, driving over approximately incremental $123 million in sales for the category. This represents the third consecutive quarter at the number one spot and prior to the transition to the PepsiCo distribution network, which started October 1, 2022, and will be represented in our fourth quarter numbers.
We continue to see growth across all channels, including the non-tracked with our club channel sales in the third quarter totaling over $34 million in sales, increasing by approximately $20 million from the third quarter of 2021. Amazon sales, another non-tracked channel for the third quarter, hit a new quarterly record of approximately $16 million and year-to-date in 2022 totaled approximately $43 million and was up 108%, compared to approximately $21 million in the nine months ending 2021.
Third quarter retailer highlights include the benefits from our Walmart expansions announced in the first quarter of this year. On a year-to-date basis, continuing to hit new revenue records. In the convenience channel where we see the largest opportunity, Celsius continues to perform extremely well and according to the convenience and gas IRI as of the 12 weeks ending October 2, 2022, total U.S. energy, Celsius sales increased 158% in the channel setting a new sales record.
In the grocery channel, both Kroger and Publix lead the incremental revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022 with both retailers setting new records and sales and share gains in the energy category. We officially commenced our distribution partnership with PepsiCo subsequently to the third quarter with the distribution to most of our retail accounts transitioning as of October 1, 2022, while early initial track data on both ACV and items carried per store growth indicate impressive gains already gained and exceeding our actual expectations on both these tangible metrics.
In addition, the transition process with respect to our retail partners, as well as our consumers also have exceeded our initial expectations. As highlighted in the earnings supplement for the one week ending October 23, 2022, IRI data reported in MULOC, total energy, Celsius has surpassed Bang to be the number three energy drink in the United States with a 4.9% market share compared to Bang’s 4.4%.
In addition, Celsius has seen an approximately 11% increase in ACV, since October 1, 2022, and the initial launch with the PepsiCo distribution network with average items carried per store increasing from an average of 7.7% to 8.3% over the same three week timeframe. The convenience store channel, Celsius has seen the largest gain with approximately a 23% increase in ACV since October 1 of this year.
Our third quarter sales hit another of approximately $188 million in the -- with U.S. sales totaling about $179.5 million and approximately $34 million sequential increase from the second quarter of this year. Revenue growth was driven by over a 60,000 increase in door count from the prior quarter with convenience store additions representing 37,000 of the 60,000 increase. Club channel expansion, as well as increased items carried at locations in conjunction with increased placements at retailers, including both branded coolers at retail locations.
International sales only represented approximately about 4.6% of total sales for the quarter with total sales approximately $8.7 million, compared to $10.4 million in the prior year quarter. Our European revenues represented a $7.5 million of international revenue, compared to $9.5 million a year ago quarter, a decrease of approximately 21% with around a third of the revenue decrease associated with foreign exchange impacts, as well as timing of innovation and supply chain disruptions.
Revenue for the other international markets totalled $1.1 million, up approximately 30% from $883,000, which included royalties from China. We believe there is significant opportunity for international growth going forward with PepsiCo as part of our distribution agreement that we entered into both Pepsi and Celsius are committed and expanding internationally utilizing Pepsi's best-in-class international distribution system. While we just began our distribution partnership with Pepsi and our initial focus will be in the U.S. distribution and transitioning our distribution to the PepsiCo U.S. distribution network, we see significant opportunity to capitalize on a global scale, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better for you offer brings, low and no sugar and more the need for more energy.
While the U.S. transition has taken a majority of our focus to-date, we expect to have additional international rollouts, details through additional calls and quarterlies going forward through 2023. Gross profit for the quarter increased 109% to approximately $79 million, up from approximately $38 million a year ago quarter and gross profit margins were 41.8$ and 49.6% excluding outbound freight for the three months ending October or September 30, 2022, compared to 39.7% and 48.8%, excluding outbound freight in the prior year quarter.
This represents a 330 point -- basis point increase from the second quarter gross margin percent and consistent with our expectations and discussions from our second quarter earnings conference call. We reiterate our expectations for continued sequential gross margin percent improvements through the fourth quarter with gross margin percent expected to be in the mid-40s by year-end.
Our product channel mix, sales mix also has been impacted margins as the club channel revenues has historically had a lower margin levels due to the secondary repack nature of the product with the rapid growth of the channel, which contributed to approximately $34 million in revenue in the third quarter has increased our overall margin pressure and we continue to initiate production efficiencies to improve margins in this channel, including working with our co-packers, who have the capabilities to produce in line and also so we can limit the number of secondary production facilities.
Even with higher sales than originally forecasted in sales mix in the club channel, our margin guidance has stayed consistent for 2022 as we continue to optimize our supply chain and gaining incremental efficiencies against rising inflation pressures. In addition, with our transition from a significant number of independent distribution partners to the PepsiCo distribution network, this will allow our team to consolidate sales, marketing, distribution efforts with planned associated cost benefits, which we expect to recognize and leverage through 2023 and beyond. We will also provide additional clarity on both gross and operating leverage and targets as we move through the transition, but expect to see additional leverage as we look to drive efficiencies post transition.
Some additional highlights for the third quarter, 92% of our MULOC -- reported MULOC retail store locations are now serviced through our DSD network, up from 72% in the third quarter of 2021. Our mass channel is now more or less 100% DSD service and 99% of our convenience channel is serviced by DSD. Industry backed third-party data continues to show accelerating growth metrics and we are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we increase our ACV across channels through additional launches with nationwide retailers, independent chains and through our new partnership with the PepsiCo distribution network.
Consumer demand for Celsius on a dollar basis accelerated in the third quarter of 2022 and has reaccelerated after the initial distribution shift on October 1 this year to the PepsiCo distribution network. The most recent reported Nielsen data as of October 22, 2022 shows Celsius sales were up 118% year-over-year for the two weeks, 120% for the 12-weeks and 126% for the third quarter. This compares to the total energy category, which grew 10% for the two week period, ending 10% for the 12-week period and 10% in the third quarter over the same time period.
On Amazon, Celsius is the second largest energy drink with an 18.5 share of the energy drink category ahead of Red Bull at a 12.01% share and trailing Monster at a 26.2 share on a year-to-date basis ending October 22, 2022, and according to stack line total U.S. energy on Amazon. Celsius reported sales year-over-year grew 79%, compared to Amazon Energy Drinks sales business, which grew at 39% outpacing the category.
The company placed an additional 550 coolers in the third quarter of 2022 and over 3,500 since the beginning of 2021. The company anticipates a continued acceleration of cooler placements through 2022 and into and through 2023 in addition to the incremental placements and Pepsi Energy Coolers, which provide approximately over 50,000 additional placements that are rolling out right now.
U.S. store count now totals 174,000 locations nationwide in the U.S. growing over 60,000 doors or 54% from 114,000 doors as reported in the third quarter of 2021 with additional expansion planned throughout the rest of the year and into 2023, acceleration by the -- and yet being accelerated by the PepsiCo distribution agreement. Convenience store locations increased by largest by 77% or approximately 37,000 locations to 86,000 locations at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 49,000 locations at the end of the third quarter in 2021.
On our co-packer front, we continue to expand our partners and scale at existing locations, improving line time priority. Our total U.S. co-packer footprint now totals 13 that are active, which will help keep our product in-stock and support our massive growth.
Before I turn the call over to Jarrod, I want to close my prepared comments recognizing the amazing job of the entire team and our partners, which they have done, establishing Celsius as a leading brand, driving growth in the entire energy drink category in the U.S. Our consumer demand remains robust, our portfolio is resonating with a broad consumer base and our teams are positioned to leverage opportunities for growth going forward with our new partner PepsiCo.
I will now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Jerry? Thank you, John. Before jumping into the financial results for the quarter, I'll cover a few administrative items including transaction-related items stemming from our PepsiCo distribution agreement. It was a very exciting and busy quarter. The announcement of the partnership with Pepsi through a distribution agreement and investment is a significant step in our growth, and key to our ability to not only continue to grow the category, but to grow market share.
Although Pepsi did not start distributing our product until October 1, we worked in conjunction with their operations team to make sure that they add Celsius in all of their key locations across the U.S. As John mentioned, the transition has gone very well and we are excited to see the early results of this long-term partnership.
So let's walk through some accounting highlights associated with this transaction. Let's start with the termination expenses. Included within our quarterly results, we recorded $155.4 million of termination expenses associated with termination notices issued during the quarter, so that we could transfer distribution to Pepsi.
We had an additional $50 million of termination expenses agreed upon in the fourth quarter as well, which will be recorded in our Q4 results. We've already transitioned most of our distribution footprint over to Pepsi, but there will be some activity in Q4 and through the beginning of Q1 2023. These expenditures were funded by Pepsi and as a result, we have recorded the funding as a deferred revenue that will be amortized over the 20-year period of the associated distribution agreement.
And looking at the preferred share investment, we received $550 million in cash from Pepsi during the quarter as a payment for the Series A preferred shares. As a part of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we valued this instrument at $832.5 million and recorded this valuation net of issuance costs within the mezzanine section of our balance sheet. The difference in cash proceeds and the valuation was recorded as an other asset and we will amortize this balance over the 20-year period associated with the distribution agreement as a contra revenue.
Let's talk taxes as well. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was negative 33.5% -- nine months ended September 30, 2022, deferred from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the tax impact of the $282.5 million Series A preferred stock value adjustment, which will be expensed over 20-years for book purposes. As this expense is non-deductible for tax purposes, we recorded $71.4 million in deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter as a discrete item.
The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30 was also impacted by disallowed stock-based compensation expense, state and local income taxes and the release of certain state income tax reserves. I believe that covers the unique items from the agreements with Pepsi.
And looking at other activities that occurred during the quarter, we had previously planned on bringing our FAST bar brand to the U.S. from Finland, but as a result of the Pepsi partnership we will be focusing on our core Celsius Energy brand in the U.S. transition and rolling this product out internationally and in turn, we performed evaluation whereby we determined that the FAST brand was impaired in the amount of $2.4 million.
Moving on to litigation costs, as was noted in an 8-K that we issued last month, we have agreed to settle a class action filing in the amount of $7.8 million associated with our can label. Although we believe that our claims in the can are accurate, we believe that the cost, energy and focus that would have been needed was better utilized on transitioning over to Pepsi and growing our business. In regards to the SEC review, we do not have an update, but we'll continue to cooperate with any inquiries or requests that are received.
Turning to our third quarter financial results. Our third quarter ended September 30 2022, had revenue up -- revenue of approximately $188.2 million, an increase of $93.3 million or 98% from $94.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Approximately 102% of this growth was a result of increased revenues from North America, where third quarter 2022 revenues were $179.5 million, an increase of $95.1 million or 112% from the same period in 2021.
The balance of the revenues for the three ended September 30, 2022 quarter were mainly attributable to European revenues of $7.5 million, which increased by $2 million from the same period in 2021, due to foreign exchange rates, timing of new product launches and continuing supply chain challenges. Asian revenues, which include royalty revenues from our China licensee, contributed an additional $1 million, an increase of 37% from approximately $700,000 for the same period in 2021.
Other international markets generated approximately $200,000 in revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 3%. The total increase in revenue is largely attributable to increased in sales volume as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continued strong triple digit growth in traditional distribution channels combined with an increase in and optimization of our products presence in world class retailers.
Additionally, revenues were increased as a result of building inventories at Pepsi warehouses and distribution centers in anticipation of transition to the Pepsi distribution network. These revenues were offset by the prior distribution network, which reduced their inventory balances as a majority of the prior distribution system was terminated as of September 30, 2022.
Gross profit. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 gross profit increased by approximately $41 million or 109% to $78.7 million. Gross profit margin reflected an increase to 41.8%, 49.6% excluding outbound freight of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2022, relative to 39.7% or 48.8% excluding outbound freight for the prior year quarter. The improvement in gross profit dollars was due in part to the improved average can prices within our inventory, as well as improved freight costs relative to the third quarter of last year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $198.8 million, an increase of approximately $176.1 million or 779% relative to September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to termination expenses of prior distributors, which resulted in an increase of $155.4 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing represented approximately 23% of revenue. In the third quarter of 2022, after backing out the $155.4 million of termination fees, compared to 24% for the third quarter of 2021. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $27.5 million, an increase of $4.2 million or 18% from $23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021.
Employee costs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflect an increase of $900,000 as investment in this area are also required to properly support our higher business volume and the commercial and operational areas of our business. Impairment expenses increased by approximately $2.4 million, when compared to the prior year quarter. These increases were offset by a $11.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation, which amounted to $6.3 million in the current quarter, when compared to the prior year quarter.
Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote over performance, which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes. Administrative expenses also increased by $12.3 million, primarily due to a litigation settlement in the amount of $7.8 million, as well as increased cost associated with third-party service providers, including internal control and SOX compliance, audit fees and other litigation.
Lastly, all other administrative expenses, which were mainly composed of research, development and quality control testing, increased by approximately $300,000. As a total percent of revenue, G&A cost decreased to 15% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 25% in the prior year. When you take some of the outliers out of the equation and exclude items such as $7.8 million for the litigation settlement agreement, $2.4 million related to the brand impairment charge and stock-based compensation is $6.3 million. G&A expense as a percentage of sales 6% for the third quarter 2022, and excluding the stock-based compensation of $17.9 million in 2021. The G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 6% as well.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31 2021, we had cash of approximately $727 million and $16.3 million respectively, and working capital of approximately $755.7 million and $169.2 million, respectively. Included within the Q3 2022 cash balance was approximately $135 million of cash that will be utilized for termination payments.
Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $171 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which compares to $52.1 million in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The approximately $223 million increase in cash generation was driven by the timing of transactional costs associated with the Pepsi distribution system, as well as continued growth in the operations of the company.
And looking at inventory, total Q3 inventory ended at $154 million down relative to the $191 million at the end of December 2021. As we benefited from growth in our business, as well as a pipe fill in advance of Pepsi beginning to distribute our product. We would expect some increases as we continue to grow and also as we prepare to launch a number of new flavors in the first quarter of 2023.
We will continue to carry some additional inventory in order to make sure that we are able to keep up with the significant growth we are experiencing, but we would expect to start to drive some efficiencies in our DIO as we move through 2023. With the latest injection of funds from our PepsiCo transaction, we have sufficient firepower to take our business to the next level as we transition into the Pepsi distribution network across the U.S. and then internationally.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Go ahead, Mark. Yes, thanks and afternoon, everyone. I guess, I wanted to start on the distribution gains and the shelf space. So obviously, we all know the challenges that the Bang is dealing with, you're obviously also transitioning into basically the same shelves that they had. So is it simply a one to one sort of trade off there, how do you think about what your shelf space is going to look like as you go forward over the next kind of three to six months as the changeover is completed heading into the spring set? Do you think you can end up with more space? How do you think about the number of SKUs you can put on shelves relative to where you are where Bang is today? Maybe that's just a good starting point? Thanks. Yes. Thank you, Mark. We appreciate it. Great question. We've got some audio difficulty, the team down in South Florida, we are in the middle of a little bit of hurricane, but with weather coming through here, but we get to have a little choppiness. But great question, Mark. I mean, what we're seeing, there is a lot of opportunities out there. I think what you're seeing especially with the gains right now that we're seeing as of October 1, as referenced in the prepared remarks, we did see the number of SKUs just in the three week period increase on shelf space with the largest gain coming from convenience.
There is obviously disruption that's out there with Bang and the distribution network that they have exited and what they're putting together. So there’s opportunities that are really coming out of normal course of resets that the team is vigorously working to take advantage on as well as every other brand in the set in the energy category. What we do look at -- when you look at what we were able capture with Coke Energy when that was going through and being delisted in many retailers. We're able to take advantage a lot of that opportunity and gain incremental shelf space on that change.
I think the momentum we have allows us to be one of the top choices when you look at -- when retailers are looking to add and find a replacement if that's what they so choose at certain retailer locations. So I think we're in a good advantage to take -- to move into some of that space as we have, as you're seeing a variety of key retailers. And then as you look forward and we look for the spring resets, think we're in really great position. We know we're incremental to the category, we know being the number one driver of growth in the category puts us in really good position as we're looking for resets.
And right now, we're in the midst of buyer season, selling season coming out of one of the greatest match the company has ever had out in Vegas and I know, there's a lot of retailers coming by the booth. So I think we're well positioned. Obviously, they don't provide forward guidance on revenues, but we feel really optimistic on where this brand is positioned, especially leveraging Pepsi in our new distribution partnership. That's great. And maybe just one sort of related follow-up there, if you could talk a bit about the velocity in terms of sales per point of distribution or however you want to think about that metric as you transition especially into convenience stores where you're selling single serve items, how should we be thinking generally about kind of where the current trends are and how we think about that going forward? Yes, that's something we're watching really closely. Now keep in mind, like when we're looking, we're entering a lot of new distribution and we're also entering some new markets where the brand has lower awareness than really where we've been building out over the last, call it, two to three years in some of our core markets. So as you saw in our P&L, we're further increasing our investments and expanding. So it's something we're really watching closely, I think you're also -- we're getting into one of those Tier 3, Tier 4 accounts that as we go forward potentially may not be as productive as the Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts, which we are in today.
So we're watching that closely, when we look at it, it seems to be at a level basis right now, kind of, what we're seeing over the last several data pools. But that's really to be determined, the brand has been performing really well. So it's something we're watching closely as well. I can't really give you an answer on that at this point. Got it. All right. Well, thanks all. Excellent day, Mark. Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Go ahead Kevin. Hey, everyone. This is [Noah] (ph) on for Kevin. I was looking to dig a little further into your PepsiCo distribution transition? And first, just starting off in the U.S., could you give us a little more context on how much business has already been transitioned, sort of, some early observations in the areas of your business that hasn't shifted? And what your expectations are for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Yes, I mean, if you listened to the Pepsi call that was about a month ago, there were two weeks into October, they already announced -- we were in excess of 80% with our DSP business and we've continued to expand out there. And like I said on the call, there are and for more geographies or territories that Pepsi will be rolling out into over the course of Q4 and into Q1. But really everything that we've planned on transferring to them plus additional territory has been kind of locked in. So although, I don't have an exact number for you, we're confident by the time we get to early Q1, will be in great shape. Now there are still a couple of distributors out there that we are not transitioning. But at the end of the day, we'll end up transitioning most of all of our DSP network. Yes, I think Noah, just to chime in as well, add a little bit more color in regards to what we're seeing. When you look at that data point that we referenced in the prerecording and also in our earnings supplement that was filed, when you look at the momentum we've gained since October 1, I think it really shows the team's doing an excellent job on the way we're wired into Pepsi and a lot of our team members. So the transition is moving really nicely.
And talking about those 50,000 incremental cooler spaces in that Coke Energy, we're already seeing those come to fruition, as well as food service as well coming to fruition, especially at the college university level. So we're seeing a lot of extreme positive just over the -- you really call it the first three to four weeks of the relationship. Great. That's really helpful. And just one more if I may. In terms of the potential international expansion that could occur. Could you maybe just share some thoughts on sort of how you're thinking about expansion and sort of where -- what the timeline is on that? And how that would work through the systems? Yes. Right now, we're extremely focused on the U.S. transition. The opportunity we both parties see opportunities on an international front with over 126 markets that Pepsi has great distribution in. It's timing and sequencing, so I think it’s -- we're very cognizant about that being very methodical on our approach when you look at they're going to be our preferred partner going forward and we'll have more details to come as we really look through 2023, but we're really taking the timing and sequencing and as we scale and we want to make sure that it's a -- that we enter these markets appropriately and have the right strategy in place as well. Great. Thanks guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Go ahead, Peter. Thanks, operator, and good evening, everyone. So I guess just to start, can you maybe just help us understand the impact from the sales to Pepsi in the quarter? I think the 10-Q says that Pepsi made up about 12.4% of sales, which is pretty substantial. So I guess is there any way to kind of quantify or breakout what was kind of one-time in nature versus kind of what is recurring? And I guess I'm really trying to get and understand you don't give for guidance. But how should we be thinking about 4Q revenue growth in North America given all the noise that kind of occurred through this transition? Thanks. Yes, Peter, good to hear from you. The -- like we talked about on the call back in August, it’s going to be noisy in this quarter and next quarter. We did have a pipe fill, so there is some timing there. To be honest, it's very difficult to put an exact number on what was the benefit of the pipe fill versus the offset of the distributors’ wanting down their inventory and then pulling back at the end retailer or the end customer. If we had to kind of peg it, are we talking, I don't know, $15 million, $20 million somewhere in that range that could potentially be shifted from one quarter to the other on the top end. I don't know if that's the exact number, but that's kind of the gut feel I have.
Again, you got the transition where there's a little bit of a dip you take. If you go back and look some of the data with Bang, they had the same impact. At the same time, we're getting into a lot of space that we haven't been in. So as we look at Q4 and then into Q1 those coolers John talked about food service, so we were -- it's not an apples to apples comparison when we look at what happened with Bang in terms of what is the data telling us. So we think there's still a very big opportunity in Q4 and into Q1 to get into a lot of space we haven't been to before.
On top of expanding the SKU count and the retailers we're at and getting into more space from as there's some disruption within the industry. So I think overall that's probably the best I could do for you. It's not exact, I don't have a bunch of data to support it, but that's kind of the feel we have. Got it. That's really helpful. And then can I just ask one on just the gross margin trajectory. I may have missed this so apologies, but are we through the higher cost cans at this point? And then John, I think you mentioned for mid-40% by year-end. I might be reading too much into this, but is that in reference to exit rate or should we still be expecting fourth quarter gross margins to still be in that same ballpark? Thanks. Yes. No, Peter, excellent question. I mean, the international cans, we were anticipating cycling through the majority of our international cans by the end of the third quarter, due to the flow of some of the international cans, the way they've come in on East Coast, West Coast. We are sitting on still some international cans, although the much smaller amount of our overall total inventory, mainly on the West Coast of the country. So when we look at our margins and some of the improvements also the sales mix we talked about with the costco pack, variety packs.
When we look at the mid-40%, we believe we can hit the mid-40% range by the end continue to hit the mid-40% range by the end of the year. Looking at somewhere between 43.5% to 47.5% somewhere around that range, it’s a little bit hard to say with you got gas prices that come down. We're seeing some softening in the aluminum pricing as well. And then we will be cycling through some of those international cans on that mix as we go through here.
And then we did have some returns come through as well of some product flowing through in regards to the old -- moving out of the prior distribution network, so a little bit of -- as Jarrod mentioned, noise that's coming through the system. But getting that mid-40% range, I think is definitely an eye for us as an organization. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen from B. Riley. Go ahead, Jeff. Hi, everyone. Just wanted to circle back to a couple of things on the ramp with Pepsi's DSP. Sounds like it's going extremely well, I guess, what are the next steps that you touched on a lot in Q4. But what are the next steps as we think about Q1? I know you mentioned kind of the spring resets? And then overall, what are the milestones we should be looking for to track the progress when you report Q4 and Q1? Yes, I think, Jeff, great question. I mean, we are seeing a great opportunity. I think the milestones you're going to see within us is really the expansion and convenience. We started to see that really just in the few weeks. I mean, we see a huge opportunity in convenience expanding that ACV and the numbers used and items per store. So that's really where you're going to see robust growth out of the organization and also maintaining that velocity at retail, which is so critical. So those are the metrics we're really watching.
Convenience is a massive opportunity and PepsiCo has this program of metals program, which is the loyalty program with over 150 independent retailers that's going to be a big opportunity as we start to penetrate that opportunity and then the foodservice opportunity that's out there. Unfortunately, that channel is majority is unreported. So when you're looking at reported numbers, really I think the opportunity is getting that ACV number, when you look at the two largest players north of that 90 ACV range where we have room to grow as it stands now. Okay. That's helpful. And then if we could switch to the club channel for a minute, I know you mentioned Walmart, I'm not sure if you mentioned Sam's Club, maybe I missed it, but just wondering, as you sit here today, what do you feel is left to do in the club channel. I know you mentioned margins there too, but maybe any other retailers that are not part of the network or maybe they are part of the network that you're eyeing here to potentially add. So from the club channel, you know, we just started getting into Sam's Club at the end of Q1. So if you kind of looked at Costco a year before that, it took two, three quarters for it to get ramped up. So Sam's Club really starting to ramp up for us and it's starting to really produce very well for us. So I think we still have good continued growth in Sam's Club consistent with what we saw with Costco. And then there's still BJ's, which we're in stores now, but we've got some more opportunity to expand across their entire footprint. So I think there's still some good room to grow for club and club is going to be a good area for us.
The other thing is we've seen the demographics coming out of clubs, it’s not cannibalized the growth in other channels. So it seems to be a consumer that's got the same interest, same with the interest, the central energy and those kind of things, but it's a consumer that may not be shopping in the other channels. So we're seeing good growth come out of both areas and it's continued. Makes sense. And then just one more sort of house keeping, I'm just wondering how many coolers that Pepsi has that you're getting into in their network at this point? Yes. I think at this point, we don't really have a clear number on the total opportunity, but what we've been told and really what we're working towards is there's roughly around 50,000 energy Pepsi owned coolers that we will be gaining additional placement in. But there's also other opportunities that given retailers that Pepsi owns the space and we're able to participate in. So it’s probably a much larger number than that, but the 50,000 is kind of what we're -- 50,000 is really what we're told is an immediate opportunity today. And there's the other coolers that we see as well. So as I make my rounds across Florida, I've seen us enter different coolers over the last three weeks. I'll be in a store, a shopping center and one week we're not there and then I get the sales guys a hard time and we're there in the next week. So that's an area that they are rolling us out. They could get us their week one, but the goal is to really get us across those 50,000 energy coolers, but then also the opportunity to get into their other coolers as well. Okay, excellent. Best of luck with the remainder of the transition of Pepsi. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg Thalmann. Go ahead, Jeffrey. Hi, John and Jarrod. How are you? Excellent Jeff. Couple of questions from our end. Jarrod, you're talking earlier about the termination expense paid. So one, was that paid, you said it was paid by Pepsi and then it will show up under deferred revenue, is that right? It was paid by Pepsi, yes. So we had an initial tranche of $174.7 million of which we ended accruing $155.4 million, so we've got whatever we don't spend we send back. But then we also did have some settlements in Q4 as well. Right. That would be I think you stated $50 for Q4. Is there any follow on after Q4 expected or that should be wrapping it up? It's a good question. I think that we're in great shape from that perspective. I can't say absolutely nothing after that, but the goal is to really be in a position that we're locked in, moving into 2023 clean and really focused on getting into all the locations and having them with a stable footprint and knowing exactly what they need to do as we roll out and we look to really start to capture market share in ‘23. Got it. Okay. And then secondly for us, could you talk a little bit about SKUs from two perspectives, I imagine. The first perspective being, what's the right number for some of these retailers and SKUs? I know you started out with 1s and 2s and 3s and a number of them. Talk about that a little bit and then talk about SKUs from the company's perspective as far as the totals you have? And John did mention some new flavors coming into ‘23. Well flavors more out of favor go away as new flavors are added on or how should we think about that in ‘23? Yes. I think it's -- you've been following the company for some time with -- in our stores in one or two flavors and now we've grown -- look at Publix as an example, we have over almost well over 15 flavors and SKUs and products now in retail, as well as multipacks. So there's a massive opportunity for us where we stand. And I think when you look at where we're at now on average nationwide, you're looking at about 8.6 items, so a lot of the major other players and leaders in that category have north of 20 to 30 items in a given outlet.
So the opportunity to grow is if we're just getting started here. Now the number three energy drink officially has the last data pull for the one week. Just really excited about that, I think that's going to open up additional opportunities, especially with the Bang transition. And also when you look at the resets that are taken to take place next year upon retailers resetting for the transformation of the energy category better for you and UH Energy, which Celsius is a major contributor to. So I'm not going to have a real specific number for you, but we're going to get as much space as we can out there for sure. Got it. And then lastly for us, is 13 a good number on the co-packer front? Or should that change based on volumes and or geographies? So we're at 13 now, but we've got backup ones beyond that. So we've got co-packers that we can turn on quickly. And some of them we -- there's a number of co-packers at a multiple locations. So we're co-packing in other locations, so we can flip on their other locations as well. So we're set up from a capacity perspective for a number of years to come. Perfect, [indiscernible] for us. Thanks for taking the questions. Excellent. Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group. Go ahead. Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the marketing front, is Pepsi spending any direct dollars other than working on the distributor side and putting your SKUs in their coolers and so forth? Are they spending any actual marketing dollars on their own? Or is that all going to be under Celsius? Yes, so it's still early in the relationship, so there's definitely opportunities to partner on different things and different programs whether we've talked about the college opportunities. So there are different -- is there a college program that we can partner on from a sponsorship perspective. So those are definitely on the table and I'm not saying we're specifically having a discussion about that, but I'm saying those types of things we are having discussions about as to how can we work together.
When it comes to the various pricing and the go to market strategy, there are some opportunities for us to -- if you think kind of co-op for things like that. The energy drink category is very promotional. So there are opportunities and we will be running, kind of, joint promotions when it comes to the pricing of the cases and working with our especially our key accounts across the board. And then there's the metals program that Pepsi has as well that there's opportunity.
So I guess you could call some of that more back shop promotions, the front facing promotions, again the [Technical Difficulty]. But those are really going to be more of our focus it's up to us to really push the brand and push the velocity when it comes to that component. And just a follow-up on the coolers, right? Because you placed 550, you're now at over 3,500. Pepsi has 50,000 initial coolers you're going to look at. But you mentioned you're looking at to roll out more specific Celsius coolers. Does that still make sense? And if so, why versus just focusing on the Pepsi collers at this point? Yes, I think, I mean, we're really focused -- we're focused on all opportunities. And the Celsius branding collers will be wholly owned by, you know, Celsius, and they'll be -- they’ll only carry Celsius. And there's a huge opportunity there. We see the benefit on both the co-branded or co-existing in the energy Pepsi coolers for availability. And our branding coolers are, you know, silent salesperson that's out there for us. So we see the great returns, we got great ROI, and we do have a significant amount of coolers on order currently. Okay, great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean McGowan from ROTH Capital. Go ahead, Sean. Thank you. First, I just wanted to Jarrod, if you wouldn't mind repeating the comments you made in your prepared remarks on the tax, kind of, noise in the quarter. I think the recording got a little muffled there. So would you mind repeating some of that? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, so the gist of the noise this quarter is when we value the preferred shares, we put them on the books at $832.5 million. So and $282.5 million based with total premium, since that's reported as an asset outlook since amortized contra revenue over the distribution agreement, so roughly 20-years. And so from a tax perspective, it's not deductible. So there's a full tax timing basically a DTL. And we booked brand that through the tax line this quarter. So that's [Technical Difficulty]. Okay, so what do you think we should be using as the effective tax rate kind of going forward when you don't have an event like that? So I'll kind of look to the 21% federal and roughly 5%, 6% from the state rate? Okay. So [Technical Difficulty]
Q - Sean McGowan
All right. Thank you for that. And then on the other question I had was, can you remind us, did you take any additional price increases during the third quarter? The reason I'm asking is, relative to my expectations, accounts receivable were low -- were higher and inventory was lower than I thought, which suggested me that the timing may have been some shipments maybe later than I thought. And how does that -- was there any price increase during the quarter that might have helped the gross margin, because it came after price increase? No. I mean, we have kind of the rollout [Technical Difficulty] so nothing's changed from that prespective. Okay.
A - Jarrod Langhans
[Technical Difficulty] a little [Technical Difficulty], we’ve got some of these accoumnts to [Technical Difficulty] because we've been picking up even throughout this year, right? So from a pricing perspective, nothing's changed from the prior commentary. From margin perspective, [Technical Difficulty] for us, that is we're benefiting from our orbit model from a great [Technical Difficulty] onboard freight. Gross profit excluding onboard freight relative to last year we had a really good pick up. So that's contributing a lot of our benefit in the profit line.
And then the other piece is we are seeing some of the average camp [Technical Difficulty] as we cycle through those cans and we cycle the percentage [Technical Difficulty] more and more [Technical Difficulty] a better, you know, overall raw material at this pace, a better it was. Okay. Thank you. And at this time, I would now like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum and we're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place with today's energy drink category. Our active position is a global position with mass appeal, we're building uponing our core business and leveraging opportunities and deploying our best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy and team in a large rapidly growing market that consumers want.
In addition, I'd like to thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team and thank you everyone for your interest in Celsius. Stay healthy, stay fit. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.","Celsius Holdings earned a record quarter in the third quarter of 2022 with sales over $188 million, delivering revenue growth of over 98% . the company is now the third largest energy drink in the united states .",1.0

We encourage you to review in full our safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and our filings with the SEC for additional information. With that, let me turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We achieved record sales for the fourth quarter of $178 million, an increase of 71% from last year's fourth quarter of $104 million. This revenue growth was driven despite approximately $15 million to $20 million we discussed in the third quarter that was driven by the inventory pipe fill by the Pepsi system in the preparation for distribution transition that began October 1, 2022. We believe the distributor inventory levels are now back to normalized levels as we began the first quarter of this year.
For the full year, sales totaled $654 million, up 108% or $340 million growth compared to $314 million in 2021. According to the January 1, 2023, 52-week IRI energy category SPINS MULO+C data, representing the calendar year for 2022, Celsius is the #1 brand driver of growth in the energy category in all of 2022, responsible for 22% of the category dollar growth, driving $474 million approximately in incremental retail sales for the category.
We continue to see growth across all channels, including those non-tracked, with the club channel sales totaling over $138 million for the year ending December 31, 2022, which were up 247% compared to $40 million last year. We also hit record sales through Amazon in 2022, with full year sales of approximately $58 million versus full year sales in 2021, up $32 million, up 83% approximately. In addition, according to the trailing 12 weeks IRI MULO+C Total Energy as of January 1, 2023, representing the majority of the fourth quarter, Celsius is now the #3 energy drink brand in the category with dollar sales growing approximately 128% versus the same period in the prior year.
Our fourth quarter represented our first quarter since the commencement and distribution partnership with PepsiCo. During the fourth quarter, we had an additional $38 million in expense of sales and marketing related to termination associated expenses from prior distributors, which was recognized. Most of these distributors were transitioned by November 1, 2022, and in conjunction with approximately $156 million of similar book charges that were recorded in the third quarter.
For the full year, transition costs totaled $194 million associated with -- mainly associated with distributor termination costs. This completes our distributor transition to the PepsiCo network, and we do not anticipate any further material changes going forward. We have been extremely happy with the transition, both from our PepsiCo partner as well as with our Celsius team. And I'd like to thank all of our previous distributors for their amazing work that they did helping us build the Celsius brand, especially through these challenging macroeconomic times over the last few years.
As highlighted in our earnings supplement for the 4 weeks period and according to SPINS and IRI Total Energy as of January 1, 2023, in the MULO+C, Celsius is the #3 energy drink with a $6.4 share in the energy category versus $3.4 share in the year ago period, with an ACV now reaching approximately 89.7% versus 59.6% in the year ago period. In addition, in the convenience channel, Celsius has seen approximately a 96% increase in ACV growing 89% compared to 45.3% in the year ago period.
We see substantial growth opportunities and convenience on a go-forward basis. In addition, in the foodservice channel, we have now expanded over 1,600 colleges and universities and over 1,600 health care locations in the United States. And we're also continuing to drive authorizations with key Pepsi customers such as the Marriott and Hilton as well as travel and airport segment and casinos, which are all incremental to the brand. International sales did see a 38% growth in the fourth quarter, totaling $11.5 million compared to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. We believe there is significant opportunities for international growth going forward with PepsiCo.
While we just began our distribution partnership with Pepsi and the initial focus has been on the U.S. distribution transition to their network, we have begun initial discussions and we see significant opportunities to capitalize on a global scale in the future, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings.
While the U.S. transition has taken the majority of our focus to date, we do expect to announce additional international expansion initiatives in additional countries in the future. Turning to our gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter increased approximately 90% in the fourth quarter to a record for the quarter of $79 million, up $42 million in the year ago quarter.
Our gross margins for the quarter totaled 44.4% and increased approximately 445 basis points from the prior year. As discussed on our last earnings call, we reiterate our expectations for continued sequential margin percentage improvements as we further gain efficiencies through our supply chain. And as stated on our last call, our goal was to achieve a mid-40 gross profit margin upon our exit of 2022, which we have achieved.
The improvement was made despite the significant growth we saw in the club channel as this channel has a story had lower margins due to secondary repacking facilities, which is required for the pack size. We continue to initiate production efficiencies to improve margins in this channel, including working with our co-packers to transition to in-line packing. So the product doesn't have to be moved to a secondary location facility.
In addition, we are working to increase our pack size from a 15 pack to an 18 pack size through this transition, which started in the fourth quarter. We did launch a second SKU of multipack in the fourth quarter at Costco and in the first -- through -- and will continue through the first quarter of 2023. And we launched a second SKU also at a club pack at Sam's Club. And in the first quarter of 2023, we are fully rolling out through BJ's nationally.
The company does see opportunities to drive incremental efficiencies in 2023 and beyond from both the expected improvements in the club channel, in addition to with our transition from a significant number of independent distributors to PepsiCo's distribution. This will allow our team to consolidate sales, marketing and distribution efforts, which will have associated cost benefits, which we expect to recognize and leverage in the future.
International third-party back data continues to show accelerated growth metrics, and we are confident that Celsius will continue to drive sales even higher as we increase our ACV across channels through additional launches with new national retailers and independent chains and further leveraging our new partnership with PepsiCo.
Consumer demand for Celsius on a dollar basis reaccelerated to the fourth quarter of 2022 and into the first quarter of 2023 from the initial distribution shift, which started October 1, 2022. The most recent period Nielsen scan data and Energy reported as of January 28, 2023, so Celsius sales were up as of the 4 weeks, 136% year-over-year, 129.8% for the 12 weeks ending, 127.5% for the fourth quarter.
This compares to the energy category, which grew approximately 17.1% for the 4-week period, ending 18.8% for the 12-week period ending and 10.8% for the fourth quarter over the same period. On Amazon, Celsius is the second largest energy drink brand with a 16.94% share in the category, ahead of Red Bull, which is at 11.71% share and just behind Monster, which is at a 26.38% share year-over-year periods as of February 11, 2023, per Stackline, Total Energy, Total U.S.
Amazon full year 2022 sales hit a record for us at $58 million versus the prior year, which totaled $32 million, which, as we stated earlier, was up 83%. We see great opportunities as we continue to leverage consumers in the omnichannel world. The company has plans to acquire place an additional 15,000 dedicated branded Celsius coolers in 2023, which will bring our total dedicated Celsius coolers in the U.S. to over 20,000 by the end of this year of 2023.
This will be the incremental to the additional co-placements we expect to gain as we discussed before in the PepsiCo energy dedicated coolers, which provides an additional incremental up to 50,000 additional placement opportunities. Our U.S. store count now exceeds over 210,000 locations nationally, growing approximately 20% from the third quarter, with additional expansions planned through 2023, accelerated by the PepsiCo distribution agreement.
Before I turn the call over to Jarrod, I want to outline some key pillars the company is focusing on to drive further shareholder value. The first pillar is top line growth, which includes increasing the number of stores and channels that carry Celsius. New retailers, national expansions within existing channels, such as our recent national expansion, as mentioned earlier, with BJ's and also a national rollout, which starts this quarter -- the first quarter of 2023 with ALDI.
In addition, leveraging and expanding new channels such as foodservice and college universities, also increasing the number of items carried per location, focusing on key drivers to drive velocity rates and the opportunities to leverage with international growth. Our second pillar is the operational excellence. These drivers include a focus on gross margin. Our focus on gross margin will be driving efficiencies and leverage as we scale, leveraging our orbit model -- our distribution orbit model to drive more efficiencies.
As an example, shipping from co-packers straight to distributor, optimizing freight warehousing costs, vertically integrating and improving our scrap and waste efficiencies. Also focusing on sales and marketing initiatives to gain further leverage, optimizing our PepsiCo partnership and in the G&A, optimizing our revenue per employee, leveraging software optimizations and focusing on building our internal and expertise internally to drive scale.
The driver of the final pillar is cash generation and EBITDA leverage. Goal of driving increased EBITDA and as we scale. I close my prepared remarks with the PepsiCo transition now complete, Celsius is positioned for the next phase of growth with further opportunities as we begin to expand international markets to further capitalize on our future and optimize our leverage, driving further value for our shareholders. Celsius is now established as a leader in the energy category in the United States, driving growth for the entire category at all of 2022, with incremental opportunities to further drive growth to 2023 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John. Before jumping into the financial results for the year and the quarter, I'll cover a few administrative items. It was another very exciting and busy quarter. For the quarter, we successfully integrated into the Pepsi distribution system going from an ACV in the mid-60s to the high 80s very quickly. In addition to moving to the Pepsi system, we processed the majority of our prior distributors terminations, including final payments, inventory returns, et cetera.
As John mentioned, the transition continues to go very well, and we are excited to see the results of this long-term partnership. So let's walk through some accounting updates. Let's start with transition-related expenses. Included within our annual results, we recorded approximately $194 million of termination expenses associated with termination notices issued in 2022, primarily related to the transfer of distribution of Pepsi.
As of the first quarter of 2023, we have effectively transferred all activities that we had set out to transfer to Pepsi, plus a few additional areas. During the fourth quarter, we saw some increases in inventory reserves and other related costs as we transition from our prior distribution network and into the Pepsi system. As a part of our contract with the prior distributors, we accepted return product and had to make decisions on the product in terms of taking the product back or disposing of the product.
In a number of instances, we chose the donator disposes the product. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we made a decision to overinvest as a part of the integration into the Pepsi system in order to support the significant expansion. More on that later.
Now let's talk taxes. As a reminder, from our Q3 call, our effective tax rate for the year deferred from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the tax impact of the $282.5 million Series A preferred stock value adjustment, which is being expensed over 20 years for book purposes. As this expense is nondeductible for tax purposes, we recorded a deferred tax liability in the third quarter as a discrete item.
The effective income tax rate for the year was also impacted by a disallowed stock-based compensation expense, state and local income taxes and the release of certain state income tax reserves. Moving on to a few legal items. We have progressed on the settlement associated with our can label. As of the middle of February, the notification process was completed, and we would expect to close this out prior to the end of the second quarter.
As many of you know, we received an unfavorable verdict in January of 2023 around litigation involving Flo Rida. We have incorporated a detailed discussion within our 10-K as well as a range of potential outcomes. We are in the process of appealing and believe that we will ultimately prevail. In regards to the SEC review, we continue to cooperate with any inquiries or requests that are received, but don't really have any updates beyond that.
Before moving to the results, I wanted to make a few comments on our internal control environment. We have significantly expanded our finance team, especially during the fourth quarter, and our control environment has seen great improvements across 2022. With that said, 2022 was a very busy year with our significant growth, Pepsi transition and new team members. And as a result, although we were able to make progress and saw many improvements, we were not able to get to a position where we could fully clear the material weaknesses from 2021. This is reflected in our 10-K.
As we look out across 2023, the team is focused on working towards fully clearing these items, and we will work diligently to get across the finish line. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was approximately $178 million, an increase of 71% from $104 million, driven by North America, where fourth quarter revenues were $160 million, an increase of 74% from the same period in 2021. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to our integration into the Pepsi distribution system as well as continued strong growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in an optimization of our product's presence across our footprint.
As a reminder, we discussed on our third call that revenue in the third quarter was elevated as a result of building inventories at Pepsi warehouses and distribution centers. This was a onetime pipe fill of around $15 million to $20 million. Gross profit for the quarter increased 90% to $79 million, up from $42 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter were 44% of revenues compared to 40% for the prior year fourth quarter. The improvements in gross profit margins were due to lower average can prices, improvements in freight lanes from our orbit model and transition into Pepsi as well as pricing benefits.
Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022, were approximately $90 million, an increase of approximately 265%. This increase was primarily attributable to termination expenses of prior distributors in the amount of $38 million as well as an intentional increase in marketing spend versus budget in the amount of $15 million as we moved into the Pepsi distribution system.
With the huge gains that were made in ACV, we felt that it was appropriate to overinvest in marketing in support of this expansion. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing would have been in line with historical rates had we not incurred the termination expenses and put forth the additional marketing investment. As we moved into Q1 2023, we expect our sales and marketing spend to be in line with historical rates as a percentage of sales.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022, were approximately $22 million, an increase of 54% relative to 2021. This increase was due to increased employee costs associated with building back shop that can scale as we grow as well as administrative fees such as legal, audit and other consulting fees. G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 12% for the fourth quarter of 2022 versus 14% in the prior year, which was in line with our annual rate. We would expect to see this area leverage during 2023 once we have fully built out the team.
Turning to our full year financial results. We had revenue of approximately $654 million, an increase of $340 million or 108% from $314 million in the prior year, driven by 126% revenue growth in North America. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volumes were related to continued strong growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in optimization of our products across North America as well as our transition into the Pepsi system.
Gross profit increased 111% to $271 million, up from $128 million in the prior year. Gross profit margins were also improved, up 66 basis points on a full year basis. We saw gradual improvement in our gross profit margins across the back half of 2022 as we saw improvements in our average can cost with less higher-priced international cans, more efficient freight lanes with our orbit model and also some pricing benefits.
Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $353 million, an increase of $278 million or 372% from $75 million in the prior year. The largest increase was from $194 million of termination expenses to our prior distribution network. In addition, we had increased incremental marketing investment activities of roughly $48 million, saw increased employee costs of $8 million and had increases of $28 million across storage, distribution, broker costs and trade spend.
Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of sales were consistent year-over-year when excluding the $194 million in termination expenses and fourth quarter incremental marketing spend. General and administrative expenses were approximately $76 million, an increase of $18 million or 32% from $58 million. Employee costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, reflected an increase of $5 million as investments in this area were required to properly support our higher business volume in commercial and operation areas of the business.
Administrative costs drove an increase of $26 million, mainly related to increases in legal expenses, audit costs, insurance costs and other consulting fees. Depreciation, amortization and impairment had an increase of $3 million when compared to the prior year due to investments in operational equipment, mainly coolers and the impairment of the Func Food brand name, the increased expenses were offset by lower stock option expense in 2022, which was $21 million, a decrease of $16 million from the prior year period.
This change in stock option expense was mainly attributable to the revaluation of certain share-based payment awards that were modified during 2021. G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 12% versus 18% in the prior year. Excluding stock-based compensation, G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% versus 7% in the prior year. Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $653 million and $16 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately $757 million and $169 million, respectively.
Included within the 2022 cash balance was approximately $39 million of restricted cash that represents $35 million due back to Pepsi, representing excess funds provided by Pepsi for our distributor transition and $4 million of remaining accrued payments due to former distributors. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $108 million for 2022, which compares to $97 million in net cash used in operating activities in 2021.
The approximately $205 million increase in cash generation was driven by continued growth in operations of the company as well as working capital benefits, including the timing of transactional costs associated with the Pepsi distribution transition. And looking at inventory, total inventory ended at $173 million, down over $18 million versus the prior year. We'll continue to carry additional inventory in order to make sure that we are able to keep up with the significant growth we are experiencing. But we would expect to continue to drive efficiencies in our DIO as we move through 2023.
With the business generating cash as well as the injection of funds from our PepsiCo partnership, we have sufficient firepower to take our business to the next level across the U.S. and eventually internationally in the coming years. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. First for me, I think just in the interest of clarity, just trying to reconcile a bit the performance in North America on sales growth relative to what we saw in the scan channels. I know a handful of moving parts here, not the least of which would be, Jarrod, the pull forward the $15 million to $20 million, which you quantified last call and mentioned again.
Jarrod, you also mentioned some product returns, which would be a drag. I guess kind of going the other way, you also had strong growth in club again. You had some distribution wins, which John talked about before. Maybe just comment a bit on the gap that we saw with North America up 74%. Nielsen channel is up very strongly, up about 130%. Can you just kind of reconcile the 2 for us a bit? Yes, Kevin, if you look at the pipe fill that would have brought us up to in excess of 90% from a North American perspective. We are hoping a little bit to some of our bigger customers in terms of seasonality or in terms of timing. So I suspect there was also a little bit of working capital management at the end of the year, which would have pulled inventories down a little bit. So from that perspective, I think the scan data continues to be accurate.
If you look at Q1 and how we've done thus far, we continue to accelerate our growth and do very well. So I think there's a little bit of clunkiness around Q3 and Q4 with the onboarding and integration into the Pepsi system and the pipe fill and also some kind of year-end working capital type activities associated with some of our customers. Yes, yes, that definitely makes sense, Jarrod. And then just the follow-up, just more broadly, the transition to the Pepsi system, it seems like it's gone really, really well. Maybe just some color on the spring shelf space resets wins there, where you guys sort of expect to land? And then just further context for kind of where we are. We see the ACV ramp. You guys mentioned some of that. We can see it in the Nielsen data, but maybe just some context from where we are and ultimately, where you think the company will land as we think about ACV, as we think about total distribution points and even as we think about non-track channels, some of the wins you guys have on college campuses, health care, et cetera? Just give us a sense for where we are and ultimately, when this starts to look something closer to where the ambition is from a fully distributed perspective. Yes, Kevin, great question. I think there's a lot of momentum, as Jarrod mentioned, especially in the first quarter of 2023. Our ACV, we finished the year right around 90%, give it right around an averaging 90% ACV, about 89%, as we talked earlier. Great execution through the transition with the Pepsi system. Keep in mind we still had some distributors that transferred over in the quarter. So it weren't purely 100% Pepsi system from that October 1 transition window.
But we do expect to pick up additional ACV points, especially with the spring resets that are coming ahead. We also have been very aggressive and gaining additional bank space has been out there. So the teams -- I just hats off to the teams working extremely hard on our key accounts team, gaining incremental distribution and also picking up new distribution as well. So we're really excited about the next resets coming out.
As I talked about earlier, we talked about BJ's as well and the club channel, non-tracked. I think there's opportunities there that's rolling out, also meaning incremental shelf space. And then in the alternative channel, foodservice has been a big opportunity for us. I just touched on the college and university where we have about 1,600 currently and then hospitals as well as around 1,600, but we're really just getting started in the foodservice business. That could be a considerable amount of upside, especially when we're seeing the usage occasion with Celsius really expanding.
So we're really excited right now. We're not going to provide forward-looking ACV guidance. But where it stands right now, we're in really good shape and look forward to a great 2023. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Two questions for me, please. First is on just thinking about distribution, not ACV, but actual distribution points. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about where you're going in '23? We're close to spring resets at this point. What have you secured on a percentage basis?
And maybe more broadly, how do we think about where the product is going? Is it in existing energy coolers? Or are you moving into more dedicated performance functional, helpful coolers? That's the first question. Yes. Thank you, Mark. I'll jump in. In regards to distribution points, we talked about currently rightly around 210,000 as reported, but we are gaining considerable amounts of distribution incrementally in the nonreported as just talked about earlier, the foodservice. And then as Pepsi calls it, the OTS segment, which is the independent market, which Pepsi is really strong. And we talked about that in the third quarter being involved in their metals program, which is really their independent loyalty program. And that's going to be a great opportunity for us.
There's resets taking place for 2023 now. So that could add considerable amounts. We're -- there's over 150,000 additional doors or locations that are out there. So we're watching that closely, and there's definitely considerable upside. Then when you look at the reported channel segment, I think there's additional opportunities there in regards to Tier 3 and Tier 4 accounts and on a regional basis as well as we gain further ACV gains in a variety of new markets and territories for us.
In addition, to where the product is being placed, we're going core energy. So that's where we're mainly gaining our shelf space and doing extremely well, and the team has done a great job expanding that space, and we expect the next resets to be expanded with additional items per location. Also, I talked about the coolers that we're investing in. We anticipate by the end of the year to have over 20,000 dedicated Celsius coolers. And so that's a really great opportunity, and we've never had that before.
In addition to the PepsiCo energy coolers, which were total up to about 50,000, currently that gives us opportunity. So definitely opportunities ahead in 2023 to expand a number of stores, locations and coolers availability. Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a clarification on some previous points. So I'm still trying to understand the puts and takes of the pipeline fill. So $15 million to $20 million of sales ahead of actual sales in the third quarter. So why wouldn't you add that to the fourth quarter be coming out of fourth quarter, fourth quarter is essentially just servicing what demand is, right? So that run rate should then be higher, right, because then you're servicing kind of what was there previously.
So I guess maybe put all together, I'm surprised sales were as strong as they were given that you had that headwind in the third quarter. So is the run rate we should be thinking about the number in the fourth quarter plus the $15 million? And then you made some comments about the inventory destocking as well in December. So kind of help put those pieces together, please? Yes. With regards to the comments that Jarrod and I made in the prepared remarks, when you look at the -- it's right around $15 million to $20 million what was incremental in regards to a price sales. So adding that to Q4, I think, gets you to kind of what we saw as a normalized run rate. We are -- there is some year-end inventory felt there was inventory control metrics or potentially there could have been. So we're watching the inventory levels very closely.
We don't have full transparency on the inventory levels, but we do think pulling forward that $20 million in Q3 that will be -- $15 million to $20 million in Q3 kind of gets you to a normalized level for Q4. Keep in mind there were several other distributors that were transitioning in the quarter too. So you're not looking at a full 100% distributor partnership with our PepsiCo leveraging the full power of the distribution of PepsiCo. So there's still some large markets for Celsius that were transitioning during that time. I don't know if you have any other comments, Jarrod. Yes, I think we need a little bit of history, too, to understand some of the ebbs and flows in terms of the inventory management of our partners, in particular, our biggest partner to see kind of is a pull down something that's going to recur at the end of every quarter. And obviously, after we get to a couple of quarters, then we'll have a good and a baseline and it won't really be impactful because it will be more kind of like that onetime item that happens.
But at the moment, we're seeing great scan data, we're getting good pull-through across the board with our customers and our primary distributor. So we're seeing -- things are looking up. Q1 obviously is not as big as we expect when we get to Q2 and Q3. And Q4 and Q1 are probably more consistent with each other from a seasonality perspective. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Can you -- you alluded a little bit to some increased selling expenses related to some of these big distribution gains. Can you maybe just give us some context on how much was incremental? What's the right run rate in terms of how to think about selling expenses as a percentage of revenue during this phase of sort of this distribution boom? And then maybe more of a how we should look at it on a more of a run rate standpoint? . Yes, Kaumil, great question. We did invest through the transition. If you look at the -- we made a strategic decision, Jarrod kind of alluded to it in his prepared remarks about how we went over budget by about $15 million in the quarter, really supporting the distribution gains and the ACV gains. And the company has seen a considerable amount of increase in ACV going from October 1 to where we ended the year. We made it a strategic initiative to really continue to invest ahead of those ACV gains to make sure consumers know where we are, where they can purchase Celsius and continue to drive velocity.
So that was really key. I think it's very important we continue to invest with the expansion of the number of points of distribution and the ACV. I think when you look at historical rates, if you go back, we've been running around 23, 23.5. And if you back out -- in the fourth quarter, if you back out the $15 million that Jarrod was referencing, that was over plus back out the transition fees of about $38 million, you kind of get it back to that same run rate around 22% of revenue there.
So we're going to continue to invest in the brand, continue to build the brand, especially as we continue to increase the distribution, and we're really focused on driving velocity, especially heading into resets. Yes. And so for Q1, the idea would be back to more along that 22%. Okay. Great. And then it seems very intentional the -- some of the commentary about the international rollout. You're doing very well in the United States, obviously, and your share is high compared to where you came from, but still a long way to go. Why is now the right time to start thinking about or talking about international? Yes. We do have opportunities internationally with Pepsi. We're mainly focused on the United States and the expansion opportunities we have here, but we do see opportunities on a global basis, and there's partners through the PepsiCo system as well as our existing partners looking at in the Nordics and also our Asia distribution and the APAC markets where we've been really laying a foundation. So the energy market continues to grow around the globe, and we see these health and wellness trends continuing to gain momentum, and we're getting more interest from Celsius. But our main priority is North America. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. So I just wanted to ask a quick clarification in response to Kevin's question on the quarter-to-date acceleration. Is that just a broad-based comment? Are you actually seeing top line growth quarter-to-date stronger than the 90-plus percent growth you saw in 4Q after adjusting for the Pepsi transition? Yes. I think what Jarrod was alluding to is the Nielsen scan data and IRI SPINS data that he's referencing that we weren't providing any forward guidance on Q1. . Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, I just wanted to ask around gross margin. So you've seen some nice sequential progression in 3Q and 4Q. So how does the exit rate of 44% plus kind of inform your view on gross margin looking out to 2023? And just would you expect sequential improvement from here as we move through the year? Peter, so this is Jarrod. So I think from a gross margin perspective, the idea was to exit the quarter at kind of that mid-40s, which we have. Actually, we kind of hit the mid-40s for the entire quarter. So we did see the improvements that we expect to come through. We're no longer beholden to the expense of cans that we had historically over the last kind of 18 months. We're seeing good opportunity within the freight lanes as we deliver products straight to distribution centers or mixing centers with Pepsi.
We're also seeing some other areas from a COGS perspective or raw materials perspective, where we're seeing some advantages or some benefits. So we think kind of that mid-40s throughout 2023 is still valid. Is there opportunity as we work through the year to do better? Definitely. But at the moment, we think kind of sticking with that is the way to go, seeing that we don't really know how the rest of the year will go when it comes to commodities and things like that.
But at the moment, we're confident in that mid-40s, and we're probably more on the side of seeing opportunities than we are seeing other areas that would not allow us to hit those numbers. . [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Mine is actually on the Amazon channel specifically. Obviously, when you look at track channels, trends have looked as good as they ever have. But you did see some decel in the Amazon channel. And so if you could talk about any drivers behind that? And then specifically, any color you could provide on how that channel specifically has trended over the first couple of months here, I think that would be helpful? Yes. No, great question. In Amazon, we saw -- in our prepared remarks, have a really strong Amazon business. The quarter is -- we're going to be watching that closely. That's why we wanted to share the information there. As we gain more ACV, we're going to have to watch to see how that performs, but it was great to see it up for the quarter and continuing to show good, solid growth.
In the quarter, we did have some in regards to some warehouse movements underlying around Amazon, which potentially caused some delays as they were moving products in different locations closing some locations and opening additional locations. So there was definitely some inventory movement that was taking place, especially around the holiday season, and they were -- obviously, they were likely going through substantial volumes through their warehouses.
So there were some challenges in the quarter with inventory in regards to some of the warehouses. But I think -- as we look forward, I think that's still going to be a really strong business for us. We live in an omnichannel world. Consumers want it, how they want it, when they want it. And we embrace all platforms, including Instacart as well and driving to retail and home delivery, which we see great results as well. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Keypour with Bank of America. I'm just wondering in 4Q, where the ACV was filled geographically in the states sort of what regions did you guys move into. And then what is left to move into? And then also, I guess, as you guys spend to activate and kind of get consumers aware of the product, how should we think about maybe like a lag on entering a new geography before you kind of operating at like optimal consumption or more optimal consumption. I guess, what is sort of the flow-through of the marketing into consumer response? Yes, Jonathan, great question. Historically, we have been, prior to PepsiCo, mainly regionally focus with a higher ACV. And prior to PepsiCo, we were roughly around, I believe, like 65%, 67% ACV at the time. So -- and very much regionally to certain pockets of the country, the Northeast, Southeast, Texas markets and Southern California, we saw our bigger higher ACV markets.
But with the transition to Pepsi, we're seeing ACV gains really open up broadly in other markets. And that really goes back to that additional investment in marketing that we made in Q4 because of the ACV gains as we wanted to continue to drive velocity rates and educate consumers what Celsius is and where we're located.
And when you look at that area, you're looking at the center of the country, you're looking in the Northwest. We gained a lot of distribution. So those areas, we saw some great gains, especially in regards to the mid-Atlantic areas as well. So we're roughly around 90%, 89% ACV right now nationwide. Great. And then just a follow-up. In terms of -- I guess I'm trying to think about how a store you're in depending on whether or not you have a fridge, it's an own fridge or not. I guess I just -- I'm trying to get a sense of how productivity in each of those kinds of go-to-market scenarios, how do those compare?
So basically, like -- is it like a 1.5x better sales pull-through when you guys have an own fridge in a location, something like just trying to get a sense of that kind of relative effectiveness. Yes. No, I mean, a great question. We haven't really discussed that the exact number. What we have stated prior is, historically, we've gone back, like last year, we were talking about coolers and the payback period on the cooler was roughly around 5 months. But what I will tell you, when we have a cooler, the sales increase exponentially when we have that cold placement, it's got to be 60 from the register, an optimally placed to get the maximum benefit. And that's really what the teams are focused on. The goal is to be upfront and 60 from the register.
So definitely, coolers are great tools for us, the product. It's -- they see it and our consumers are able to buy it and you get a higher rotation as we were saying many times before, if it's cold, it's sold. So that's something we really say internally. But that's really all I can comment on that. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. I just wanted to kind of circle back to the opportunity to increase SKU count this year. Maybe just give us a sense, if you could, by channel, where specifically do you expect those accounts to grow most maybe if you think about it first half, second half, just any thoughts around that? Yes, Jeff, great question. I think when you look at our current -- when you're looking at the current ACV number, the average items carried per store has increased exponentially since the PepsiCo partnership, and we're currently sitting at roughly -- it's 12.5, like 12.5 items per store, we do anticipate that to continue to increase with the next resets. Where that lands? I think we not really comfortable on commenting on that. We have internal expectations.
But I think we'll have a better understanding as we get through the resets that are taking place, and we look maybe around April start looking at the data in April, you should be able to get a better set on where we will be for the rest of the back half of the year. Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then just a couple of things around margins. Your latest thoughts on efficiency opportunities with Pepsi -- overall Pepsi distribution and then maybe club distribution and the potential benefit to P&L metrics from that process. Also noticed you mentioned taking some price. I'm wondering if you're planning to take more price this year. . Yes. This is Jarrod. I'll start with some efficiencies. With the club channel, John did mention that, historically, we've had to go to a secondary packing facility. We have found a number of co-packers that can pack that in line for us so that is definitely an efficiency and will help drive margin as we look out over 2023. We did start doing that a little bit in Q4 and start expanding that to most of the club channel in Q1.
We do have pricing that was kind of fully in play in Q4, but that will benefit us across 2023. We haven't announced anything for 2023 at the moment. So we'll sit tight on that and see where we land. But other opportunities really it's the orbit model we've created to continue to drive the freight lines and continue to drive efficiencies there and also taking advantage of our scale when it comes to raw material purchases and benefiting from some of the changes we've seen across the raw materials categories in terms of pricing. Next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with ROTH Capital Partners. Following up, Jarrod, on the comments you made regarding efficiencies, can you give us some sense of what the kind of order of magnitude upside is on that margin improvement? I got to think that taking the cans off the line, putting it in the Fort Knox box you used to have cut into the margins. So what is the upside? Are you talking about hundreds of basis points of improvement potential? Yes. I mean I guess, mid-40s is a wide range. I think last call, we mentioned out... Specifically on the club, I mentioned specifically on those extra pack, the 18 packs in the clubs, like how much higher margin would that be if you got more cans in there and a more efficient process on a thinner hardboard, it's not corrugated anymore. So how much higher margin is that item from what you had 6 months ago? I mean, ultimately, we have to get it all into the same co-packer set in order to get that benefit. So we haven't fully transitioned, but I think we'll have the opportunity to do that this year. If you looked at the club margin, it's pretty good. It could be a couple of percentage points, but you got to remember that the club is only a small piece of our business from that perspective. So there is some opportunity there on that piece of the business. I think there's also opportunity, like I said, with the freight lanes on improving that. If you look at our historical rates. Over the course of the last 2 years, the freight lines have gone down for us.
I think if you look over the last couple of years, it's gone from roughly 6% to 4% on an annualized basis. So we've seen some gains there across that. We'll see what the aluminum cans as well where that was putting pressure on us. And there's opportunity with other things like sucralose and caffeine as well. Okay. And then following up on the earlier comments about potential placement or resets and the benefits that could come in April. Would you also expect to get kind of better position within some of the back wall refrigerators, going to some stores and you're kind of down by the ankle, would you expect to get some better placement higher up on a reset? . Yes. Yes. So absolutely. We definitely don't want to be buy your ankles that you mentioned there. So our goal is to get out of the cutter and get out of the nose bleed and getting the we say. And that's what our key accounts team is focused on -- if you look at a lot of the areas we're getting very close and targeting some of the bank space that's out there. So I expected us to be pretty prominent on the next resets and hopefully, you start seeing us in much better places as we go forward, especially we have the distribution power of PepsiCo now. . Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Diamond. Just a few from my end. I know I heard impairment on the fund Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there with Splunk and any of the fast forwards out to fill in? And then maybe talk about what you can as far as Pepsico and some of their SKUs as far as food and production goes and what discussions and opportunities may be going on there as far as SKU expansion from year-end? . Yes. Yes. In regards to the Nordics, Celsius Europe has been mainly Sweden distribution in Finland. It's been going really well, and they had a great fourth quarter, had some new innovation that came in, and they're doing a great job with the Celsius portfolio. With our fast brand, our snack portfolio, which is focused on Finland. And there's opportunities there. We're not -- it's not -- we haven't really had any discussions with PepsiCo now on potentially distributing that in other areas.
And we've had somewhat challenges in Europe with supply chains as well with some of the protein bar raw materials. But the business continue to maintain the business. And at the right time, there could be opportunities internationally just not right now. Got it. And could you talk about SKU expansion or new flavors or all flavors and targeting ex U.S. territories as far as Europe? Will they be kind of country specific on the SKUs and flavors? Yes. Internationally, we have -- we're starting to leverage our -- the global supply chain as well, trying to gain more efficiencies. So really look internationally to leverage some of the innovation collaboratively because really, when you look at the world today, especially with social media, the awareness and radiation, it goes cross Atlantic. So we're trying to get more aligned, more strategic in our flavor launches. And as we go forward, we expect to have more consistency. But flavor innovation is extremely key has been driving the category and expect us to continue to lead in flavor innovation. Yes. I know I took a couple of weeks to get that And then lastly, talk about ALDI a little bit. How many stores -- geographical rollouts and what we may see during '23? Yes. ALDI, we have a national rollout that's taking place. So expect to find us in an ALDI in the near future. And the number of stores, I believe, there -- it's roughly -- I think there was like 600 and growing roughly approximately. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Just wanted to follow-up on the coolers. Did you say, John, about 20,000 coolers you expect to be in terms of the brand at Celsius coolers by the end of '23? That's correct. We have placed in retail is our internal goal, and we have about 15,000 on owner currently. So -- and we're working on placing those strategically in a variety of our core markets and core retailers. And how many were placed in this quarter 4Q '22? We didn't disclose the number that was being -- that we placed in the fourth quarter. But we did place a good number. But through the transition, we kind of pulled back a little bit, and we expect that to continue to increase upon the new year. Yes we're probably somewhere between 4,500 and 5,000 by the end of the year. But overall, we held back on that as we were doing the transition. And also, we really ramped up our ordering in Q3 and Q4. So they do have a little bit of lead time. So we're starting to see all those come assure. Okay. And then lastly on the Pepsi energy coolers. You mentioned there's 50,000 of those. How many are Celsius in right now? And what's the goal by the end of '23 for those Pepsi coolers? Yes. I don't have that current number in regards to how many of the 50,000 we're in. We're working on getting those reset. I expect us to have a -- I'd like to be in the majority of them by the end of the year. That's the goal. So we're part of the PepsiCo energy portfolio, and we expect to be in every single one by the end of the year, and we'll work towards that goal. Okay. And the last question is on erythritol, the sugar substitute. How many of your products have that right now? And are you concerned about the recent news that could cause an increase in stroke -- in heart attack? Yes, it's a very minor piece of the portfolio. There's certain store types that have wanted the Stevia-type branded product from us. So I'd be surprised if it was more than 1% of our sales. So not really a big volume for us. It's something that we provided to a customer set that's wanted it, but not really core to our portfolio. And we're looking into it. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. I wanted to bring it back to a little more high level on talking about distribution. You mentioned the Pepsi transition is complete, but the actual practical conversions, they're still sometimes similar to what we saw during the Anheuser-Busch transition. How much is left? You've given a lot of very detailed figures about kind of piece of it, but are you 100% available but only 60% converted. How much is kind of left on the PepsiCo actual availability side? Well, just to clarify, when we stated in the prepared remarks that the transition has been complete. When we talk about distributed distribution, that's our distribution partners. So we're about 90%, 95% being serviced now by PepsiCo in North America. We did keep on a few of our prior distributors and partners in certain markets. But other than that, we are pretty much 100% complete with the transition within the PepsiCo agreement that started October 1 of 2022.
Now when you look at the opportunity on store distribution and store expansion, we have reached that 89% ACV number of reported stores. We do think there's considerable -- there is additional upside from there, but we're not in a position right now to really comment on where that will arrive. I think we'll have a better indication at the April data to see where the company will really probably finish the year at.
Now there is nonreported stores and locations that we're able to gain additional distribution and cooler placements. And that's really those OTS stores which are nonreported, which is new PepsiCo's metals program, and we're told there's about 150,000 of those so independent locations.
So we're working through those. Our resets are taking place as well. And then also in foodservice, there's a huge opportunity in foodservice and really just scratching the surface there. So that's another big opportunity for us. There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support. Our results demonstrates, our products are gaining considerable momentum, and we're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place in today's energy drink category.
Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy and team in a large, rapid growing market. I would like to thank all of our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. The company will be attending several upcoming investor conferences the week of March 13, including attending Bank of America, UBS, ROTH Conference, investor conferences.

With that, let me just turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We achieved record sales for the first quarter of approximately $260 million, an increase of 95% from last year's first quarter of $133 million, exceeding the $200 million revenue threshold for the first time in company history. And we saw a sequential increase from the fourth quarter of sales of $178 million, exceeded it by $82 million or 46% growth sequentially.
Our North America revenue increased 101% for the quarter to $249 million, up from $124 million in the year ago quarter. CELSIUS continues to be the top driver of growth within the energy categories and was the number one dollar growth brand and total U.S. MULO+C energy, for the last 52 weeks ending as of March 26, 2023, growing approximately $552 million in increased retail sales and contributed to 23% of category growth on an overall increase of 139.6% versus the year ago period.
Per IRI in the last four weeks earnings as of March 26, 2023 in total MULO+C energy CELSIUS is the number 3 energy drink brand in the United States reaching a new market share record totaling 7.5%, doubling its 3.7% share a year ago. As Celsius and Pepsi continue to synchronize our organizations we continue to see opportunities for future efficiencies.
In the first quarter we experienced an inventory build quarter-over-quarter from December 31, 2022. We expect this increase was due to anticipated retailer resets and a build inventory levels. We will continue to work with Pepsi to make sure there is adequate inventory and update shareholders quarterly if there is any significant deltas that impact the warehouse inventory center inventory levels. Jarrod will provide additional details shortly.
We continue to see growth across all channels, including those non-tracked, with the Club channel sales totaling over $47 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, up 77% compared to 26 million in the first quarter of 2022. We also just hit a new record on Amazon. CELSIUS is now the second largest energy drink brand with a 19.1 share of the energy category as of the last four-week period ending April 22, 2023, per Stackline Energy Drink Category, total U.S. data.
In addition, we continue to expand growth opportunities in non-tracked foodservice channels and are gaining more distribution in colleges, universities, hospitals, hotels, eateries and casinos, and more. Overall foodservice represented approximately about 10% of our PepsiCo revenues and we're seeing significant opportunities to scale and grow over time. We have been extremely happy with our PepsiCo partnership and see a long runway of growth ahead of us across a variety of channels, including expanding in retail, convenience and foodservice.
As highlighted in our earning supplement for the four-week period per IRI spends total energy data ending March 26, 2023 as stated in MULO+C CELSIUS is the number three energy drink brand in the United States now has a 7.5 market share, doubling from its 3.7% share a year ago reaching an all-time new high. In addition in MULO+C CELSIUS grew its ACV to a record 95.4% versus 69.5% in the year ago period, which is a tremendous achievement by both our teams and our partner Pepsi.
And in convenience CELSIUS has gained an additional 37.7 points of ACV growth versus the prior year to end the period at a 93.4% compared to 55.7% of ACV in the prior year. This provides a tremendous opportunity as we have gained greater availability across the country in the convenience channel and are now gaining more awareness with consumers.
Internationally sales grew 15% growth rate for the quarter, totaling $11.4 million compared to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. We believe there is significant opportunity for international growth going forward with PepsiCo. While we just began our distribution partnership with Pepsi and our initial focus has been on the U.S. distribution transition to their network, we have begun initial discussions and we see significant opportunities to capitalize on global scale in the future, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings.
While the U.S. transition has taken a majority of our focus to date, we do expect to announce additional international expansion details in the future. With that said, we look forward probably likely to early 2024 for opportunities to roll out internationally with 2023 being the year of planning around logistics, production, distribution and marketing.
The company achieved a record non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $48.7 million in the first quarter representing over an 18% of sales for the period. This was driven by not only a record sales, but we also saw benefits across the timing of marketing and sales programs as well as the results of gaining operational leverage across G&A. Although we saw some very good leverage across our SG&A, we would expect our investments to increase during the summer season of Q2 and Q3 of this year as we continue to drive growth, awareness profitably and are entering into a number of campaigns designed to grow brand awareness.
The company sees opportunities to drive incremental efficiencies through the back half of 2023 from expected improvements in gross profit margins as we optimize and synergize our supply chain and gain more efficiencies. In addition, we see additional leverage opportunities as we scale to drive further efficiencies in our SG&A.
To close my prepared remarks, we achieved the highest quarterly dollar sales growth in company history in the first quarter, and as previously -- our previous recorded highest quarterly record revenue was in Q3 of 2022, we exceeded by over $70 million. We are gaining market share at the fastest pace in company history, while at the same time drove the highest quarterly EBITDA margin of over 18% demonstrating the leverage in our operating model.
We believe we have significant runway ahead of us and are excited about the spring resets, driving additional shelf space in both new and existing customers while optimizing our placements. Celsius is now an established leader in the energy category, driving growth in the entire category with incremental opportunities for further growth as we continue to scale and leverage our partnership.
I will now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John. Turning to our first quarter financial results, revenue is approximately $260 million, an increase of 95% from $133 million driven by our North American business where first quarter revenues were $249 million, an increase of 101% from the same period in 2022. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to our integration into the Pepsi distribution system, where we saw increases across the board, including continued strong growth in traditional distribution channels including SKU increases as well as distribution across a number of new channels within C&G and foodservice.
We've also seen our velocity increase post our significant ACV growth. During the quarter we saw an increase in the days inventory outstanding within the mixing centers relative to the end of 2022, which equated to roughly $20 million to $25 million in incremental sales. We would anticipate that this build would be sustained through the summer selling season as we continue to see steady growth across our footprint.
Gross profit for the quarter increased 111% to $114 million, up from $54 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the first quarter were approximately 44% of revenues compared to approximately 40% for the prior year first quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins was due to lower average can prices and leverage of our orbit model offset in part by increased freight and a few million dollars of inventory write-offs.
Q1 was the second quarter that we were operating within our new distribution system and we continue to drive efficiencies and optimization within the system while maintaining our number one goal of keeping the shelves stocked in order to meet the consumer demand. And looking out across the year, we continue to believe that we will operate with gross margins in the mid-forties with some pressure during the first half of the year while we fully integrate into our new distribution system and began to better optimize our supply chain with upside in the back half of the year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were approximately $48 million, an increase of approximately 51%, although we saw increased marketing investment during the quarter in line with historical spend, this was offset by less expense within sales due to timing of our activation. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 18.3% compared to 23.7% in the prior year. On a full year basis we continue to expect our sales and marketing expenditures to remain consistent with historical run rates. As noted, this quarter benefited by timing as well as some inventory builds within our mixing centers.
General and administrative expenses for the three months in at March 31, 2023 were approximately $21 million, an increase of 75% relative to Q1 2022. This increase was due to increased employee costs associated with building a back shop that can scale as we grow, including stock-based compensation, as well as administrative fees such as legal, audit and other consulting fees. G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the first quarter of 2023 versus 9% in the prior year, which is in line with expectations. We'd expect to see this area begin to leverage against our growth during 2023.
Moving to our back office buildout, we have significantly expanded our back office team over the last year, adding a number of team members across IT, FP&A, controlling, legal and HR, driving great improvements, consistency in processes and transparency across the business. We look forward to the many successes that these team members will assist us with as we look to deliver an effective controlled environment for 2023 and drive further value with our operations, sales and marketing teams.
From a legal perspective, we have closed on the settlement proceedings with our can label and are pleased to have that behind us. In regard to the SEC review, we continue to cooperate with any inquiries or requests that are received, but that said, we do not have any further updates at this point in time.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources, as of March 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $634 million and networking capital of approximately $801 million. Included within the first quarter, cash balance was approximately $38 million, which is primarily balances due to Pepsi representing excess funds provided by Pepsi for our distributor transition.
Cash flows used by operating activities totaled $14 million for the first quarter, which compares to $9 million in net cash provided by operating activities in Q1 last year. Overall, we saw some cash usage associated with our growth as well as the timing of working capital. As we look to Q2, we would expect to return the excess funds to Pepsi while also improving on our DSO. Overall, we would expect that excluding timing impacts of cash transactions associated with the Pepsi transaction, we would continue to generate cash year-over-year.
Looking at inventory, total inventory ended at roughly $150 million down versus the prior quarter. This was driven in large part by the significant increases that we saw in our sales volume. As we look to the busy summer months, we will see production increase significantly to accommodate the demand of the market. Going forward we look to -- we would look to carry additional inventory in order to make sure that we are able to keep up with the significant growth we are experiencing. At the same time, we do see opportunities to drive efficiencies in our DIO as we move through 2023.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Man, I'm still writing down some of that stuff that you just breezed through. Whew, that is a fast transcript. Anyway, I guess to start, maybe give us a bit of an update on how the spring resets look from a shelf space standpoint, and how much is in existing energy doors, how much is coming in or going into new doors and kind of overall expectations for incremental space for the year? Yes, Mark, great question. I think if we had a, we're really excited about the resets that started off this year, especially started in January we saw a good increase in the quarter. What we're looking at is, we saw a lot of great expansion, as I kind of mentioned on the call in the convenience channel, where we saw the biggest really ACV gains when you go from over a 37.7% really increase in points of distribution and convenience, so that's a really big win for the company. It's really the last channel of expansion for us into tracked channels. So we're really excited about that. I think we're seeing good velocities in the convenience channel as well. We're seeing them grow. So that was a -- that's a big win also in overall MULO+C getting to that 95.4% of ACV most recently as of the March 26th data coming out of the IRI SPINS data. So I think we have some more expansion there, but we really grew significantly on the resets.
Also, the number of items carried on average per store increased as well. So right now we're looking at about an average at the last four weeks as of March 26, really at the end of the quarter, we went from an average of about 13.6 items per location in the recorded channel versus the prior year was at 8.6. So we saw a really good growth in a number of units. We got some more resets ahead of us. I think the biggest opportunity we have, as well as in tracked channels is really gaining better placements in locations, more cold availability, more cooler placements and those type of executions. So maybe not a large increase in number of doors being at the 95% at the end of the quarter, but really the breadth in each retailer's massive opportunity for us. Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just on the doors, so existing doors versus new doors, do you still want to be in the legacy energy door? And then somewhat related to that, I think many folks have been surprised at the velocities being not only as strong as they've been, but actually accelerating with all the incremental points of distribution. How much of that is just higher velocity C-stores versus just overall brand awareness? And kind of, how do you think about that number through the summer? Yes, I think when you look at our, I guess, as you called them, legacy doors, that's mainly in the food, when you look at the food channel, we still maintain an ACC [ph] section in a variety of stores including Publix and Kroger and those, but majority of the stores outside of those are in energy. So we do great business in the food channel.
We do extremely well at Publix, doing extremely well at Kroger. So it's really about gaining those additional off shelf placements, those additional cold placements, cooler placements and so I mean, we're not going to change that strategy within the food in our existing business at this time, but when we look at the distribution ahead, there is opportunities for additional SKUs. We see that.
We've got some great innovation plan for this summer. I think you saw some great innovation come out in the first quarter with new flavor innovation, our Lemon Lime, our Green Apple Cherry flavor at 7-Eleven was a great win for us. So there's a lot of great innovation coming this summer that we'll be able to add some additional breadth within the retailers. That's great. And just on the velocity, thank you. Yes, I mean, we're seeing velocity increase, Mark. I think there's opportunities for sure to go further north on that. We've got some great marketing programs ahead of us, and we think summer us going to be a great summer for us. We're watching it closely. I think we don't provide any forward guidance, but something to look at and we're monitoring it closely all around, especially as we'd increase such an exponential increase in ACV. Got it. Thanks guys. Thanks Mark. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Van Sinderen from B Riley. Your line is live. Hi everyone, and let me add my congratulations on the strong quarterly metrics. I wonder if we can kind of circle back to, and delve a little bit more into how much of the Q1 reacceleration of growth was initial channel fill for new stores, new doors, call it added SKUs, et cetera, versus reorders derived from sell through retail. Just trying to get a better sense, I guess, of how much the initial channel fill impacted new doors, new SKUs in the quarter? And then maybe what impact that phenomenon might have in Q2? I think you alluded to a little bit of that or Jarrod did in his prepared comments, maybe just how we should think about growth acceleration from here? Yes, no, thanks Jeff. We did gain some distribution with the resets that taken place, and you know what, I think as we're starting to see velocity increase, that is a really good sign that we're cycling through whatever pipe fills we had for the quarter. So the increase in distribution didn't slow the overall velocity, so the sales are moving quicker out of the registers. So I think that puts us in a good position. We feel really confident. It's hard to say exactly what the pipe fill was. We did talk about in the quarter how we saw Pepsi increase inventory levels, which Jarrod talked about in his earlier in regards to approximately 20 million to 25 million, we feel is the average impact for the quarter with the increase in inventory levels. But I think seeing the velocity's increase, I think we get a really strong feeling that we're seeing repeat purchases out there. Okay. That's helpful in quantifying the inventory with Pepsi. And let me ask you this, as you're going into some of the, I mean, you've got a great ACV now, so you're going into some, I guess some C-stores for example, that might be lower volume, some other store, other doors within various retailers that might be perhaps a little bit lower volume. Just wondering what you're experiencing there as far as sell-throughs and then overall what's your outlook for your business in the C channel? Yes, I mean that's a great question. I mean, we did gain a lot of tier three and tier four convenience distribution, especially with the expansion since October with the Pepsi system. We had a lot of tier one and tier twos. It's really building out a further breadth within those -- within our convenience where we're seeing, starting to see velocities increase. I think when you look at the smaller tier three, tier fours, the lower velocity, it's difficult to get the true reporting on that, on the velocity. I think we're looking at the overall velocity as a good number on indication on how the overall health of the portfolio is performing. And I think we're really confident in convenience. I mean, we know this brand performs well.
We're seeing usage occasions expand outside of energy. And we're just really excited on where the brand is and where the portfolio and where we're headed. So it's something we're monitoring closely. But foodservice now, when you look at foodservice opportunity which is 10% of Celsius' business, it just shows you the broad brush of the portfolio and how it's resonating with a broad brush of consumers today. And it sounds like you're gaining more, you feel like you're gaining more traction in foodservice than some of the other channels as well that are not reported or not tracked? That's correct. We see great opportunity in non-tracked channels as well. Okay, terrific. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll take the rest offline, continued success. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. The next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is live. Hey great. Good evening guys. Good evening, Kevin. Hey a question John, for you. Just in terms of the ambition now with items per store, so the ACV progress has been fantastic. I remember a conversation you and I had in the fall, and it was a 10% market share was kind of an ambition at that point. It's, if we can get 92% ACV, if we can get 15 items per store, if we can maintain current velocity, and you're kind of checking all the boxes at this point, so around 7.5% share, this is past the 10% is very near and present now. So as you kind of take a step back, what do you think is possible now in the Pepsi system? The 10% again seems like it is very attainable and near term what do you think is possible now for this brand as you look at the strength and the reach of the Pepsi system, as well as what you guys have done with the brand? Yes, I think Kevin, I mean, it's a great question. I think we're just seeing this ACV and we're quite amazed with how quickly the ACV has come together at a 95%. Internally, we thought we were going to at least take potentially another 12 months, 18 months to get to that 95% ACV. So I totally really give hats off to our sales team, our key accounts team and also our partner at Pepsi has done in just an amazing job. I think they see the opportunity we have here with Celsius that it's bringing in new consumers to the category. And, I think when you look at it, we have a lot to learn over the next, probably a quarter or two to see how this product, this portfolio performs in the channels that it's expanded in, especially in the convenience channel so quickly.
So I think we'll have a better view of that, probably at the end of next quarter and especially at the end of Q3. But when you look at the number of items per store, we're at 13.6. And when you look at some of the -- that current velocity numbers we had on our first few items, and you look at gaining 15 to 17 items per store by the end of the year, if that's a potential, that gets you close to that 10% opportunity or 10% share in the category. So, we're really excited to hit the 7.5 share most recently at the end of the first quarter and there's lots of opportunities ahead. Got it. Thanks John. And then just a followup, I feel like, probably it would be remiss if we did not touch on some of the competitive launches in the space, including Monster Zero Sugar, Reign Storm, which I think is not lost in you for a moment. Kind of looks remarkably from a packaging perspective like your product prime, in sports and energy. So there's been a lot in a fairly short period of time, and I know it's still very early days with zero sugar and Reign Storm, which you're kind of just hitting. Thoughts there, in terms of how worrisome those competitive launches are? Anything you're seeing very early days where there's some overlap with Celsius, anything you can give there in terms of market share, velocity, et cetera, I think would be helpful to folks? And I can pass it on. Thank you. Yes, Kevin, great question. I mean, there's competition every day. An energy category is about as fierce as they come. Tons of new competition every day. And, I think where the opportunity lies, where we're looking at, when you talk about where Celsius can go and, like in Miami, when you look at the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market in MULO+C, the last four weeks ending as of April 23, 2023, we have about a 21.7 share in the market. So, there's a lot of opportunities. We're number two brand now on Amazon. We compete with a lot of different brands in the category. I'm not going to comment on any other brand out there. There's a, it's a big category, and we wish every brand luck on operating their business. We're really excited where our portfolio is, where it's resonating with consumers, excited about our partner Pepsi, and just see a lot of opportunities at this time are really excited about moving forward. Okay, very good. Thanks guys. Continued success. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thanks, operator, and good evening everyone. So Jarrod, I just had a few questions on gross margin. Maybe just first, can you just help us understand how much the inventory write-off impacted GM this quarter? And then second, I recognize you still expect gross margin for the year in this mid 40% range. And I may have misheard you, but I thought you mentioned that you expect one-half gross margins to be under pressure. I mean, is that just relative to the mid 40% range? Is that year-over-year, just any color on that comment would be helpful. Yes, no, we were talk -- we've been consistent with saying we're going to be in the mid-40s. If you looked at the run rate we left Q4 and we did the, some additional write-offs on inventory as we are building out the supply chain and driving some efficiencies within that channel. I mentioned on the call a couple million dollars, so not a huge amount, but enough to impact the margin a little bit.
We also had a little bit higher freight costs within the quarter. So as we get to the back half of the year, we'll be looking to clean up the freight lanes and make sure we got the supply chain operating as efficiently as possible and making sure we're fully optimized. So that, it was really just around the inventory and the freight in terms of what would have driven margins really from a Q4 to a Q1 perspective. But we're still confident in the mid-40s and we see the opportunity for upside in the back half of the year as we get fully integrated into our new distributor. Okay. Super helpful. And I guess just, I would love to get some more details on kind of this international discussion, and I recognize that it's likely to prove to be a 24 narrative, but can you just help us understand the work you've done that informs, the decision that the brand can resonate and do well in these markets? What markets are you targeting initially? Is this going to be some broad based multi-market rollout? Is it going to be more gradual, just any initial color you can provide, would be super helpful? Yes, I think we've talked about this on some of the conferences we've been in, back in March, but from our perspective we look to hit markets that are obviously already, well-defined energy markets. So we're not going into a new market that we have to train the customer on what is energy. So if you look around, kind of think of APAC and Europe, the different markets that are popular energy drink markets, we'd look to roll into those first. We're not going to do a shotgun approach. We'll look to go into a handful of markets first and learn and partner in most instances with Pepsi or Pepsi partners and really use that as a tool to learn to build the model. And then from there we would look to roll into more markets over the coming years, but I would say for kind of a 2024 launch, we're looking at a handful of markets to really get into, understand them, learn them, but they're going to be the bigger energy markets across Europe and APAC.
We do see some opportunities in some smaller markets where we can kind of roll in because they're close to co-packers and they're ready. But those wouldn't really move the needle. So, there's some core markets we'll learn at and, most people know what those markets would be if you look in the Europe and in APAC in terms of what are the big energy drink markets. So that's really, this year it's all about planning, it's about getting aligned with the partners. It's about creating market launch plans and then looking to roll out in 2024. Got it. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jonathan Keypour from Bank of America. Hey everybody, congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to drill into the foodservice commentary you guys had. If I heard you correctly, that's was 10% of sales in the quarter. And I'm just wondering maybe what the impact, as Pepsi kind of brought in that inventory to sell what that -- what the pipe fill for foodservice might have been in 1Q? Yes, Jon, great question and is, just correct myself there, as 10% of our Pepsi sales approximately is coming from the foodservice business. So, we've been working on that since October. So, when we first launched initially partnered with Pepsi, so we've been expanding distribution a variety of outlets, in college, universities, hospitals, just expanded into a variety of hotels. So it is not really a pipe fill in the quarter, I would say. We just continue to build upon the momentum. We are gaining more distribution, but we're seeing good reorders and strong reorders within the channel, and we think that can be a really meaningful growth opportunity for us as we go forward and gain more distribution.
We just really the, as we look ahead the distribution opportunities is at eateries and within fast casual restaurants, we feel there's a great opportunity there and that's really has been untapped. So it's definitely, tells you the brand resonates with an extremely broad consumer just to see the sales mix at the Pepsi system of approximately 10% of sales today. So it gets us really excited. Great. Just one followup. I guess looking at the Nielsen data, this is a boring question that I got asked a lot last quarter, but I have 1Q growth in scanned channels about 138%. If we use that and sort of apply to what 1Q was in 2022, it implies something like 290, it's about a $45 million difference, whereas, you do the same math on --in 4Q is about a $50 million difference. Is that the same kind of like, the lag between scanned and reported that we should kind of expect, or is it going to be, is there any line that you guys have to some lumpiness or more or less or any kind of swings in that regard? Yes, I mean, what you're getting on scanned data is coming out of the register. So, when you look at it, I think there's probably some lumpiness in regards to, the kind of the value chain as it's going through the Pepsi mixing centers and then into their sales barns and then into the customers and then cycling through. But it's something we watch. You also have the mix of our Amazon business as well as our club business and there's that's in there. It didn't grow at those factored rates. So I think it's a mix of all those items and probably a little bit of timing. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Gerald Pascarelli from Wedbush Securities. Your line is live. Hey guys, good evening. Thanks very much for the question. So obviously very strong revenue growth here. It sounds like distributor inventory levels are going to remain elevated at least over the next few months. So just on your supply chain, can you speak to your ability to continue to service this type of demand? You know, maybe over the longer-term in particular as it relates to your aluminum can supply, which is now, back to being sourced domestically, which has obviously had a big benefit to your margins. So just I guess any kind of high level color you could provide on your thoughts there would be helpful? Thanks. Yes, from a raw material perspective, we're in great shape. We've got multiple partners in the U.S. like you mentioned from a can perspective, no issues there. From a capacity perspective, we've got the ability to quickly double, in terms of capacity and in terms of production. We've got our orbit model built, but we've got a number of co-packers that we can flex to and we have capacity at our current co-packers that we can utilize as well. So we're in great shape in order to meet the demand we're seeing or even demand outsize relative to what we're seeing. So from a supply chain and production perspective, we're in good shape. Perfect. Thanks Jarrod. I appreciate it. Next one from me is just on the Club channel. If you could just provide maybe a refresher of where we are kind of on the 18-pack transition? I know you were in the midst of rolling out a second variety pack to your legacy stores and then finally on the BJ's rollout, just where we are with that? I know that that was taking place over the course of this quarter. Thanks. Yes. Gerald, its John. We've pretty much have moved into the 18-pack within all of the Club channels, and we've started to expand from our core variety pack. In addition, you'll see incremental placements at a variety of Club channels with our bi pack that went in. So and it's been doing -- both packs have been doing extremely well and I think there's opportunities to get further flavor combinations and or single flavors in that channel since we're seeing great success there. Perfect. Thanks very much for the color, guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Just wanted to come back to the $20 million to $25 million inventory you mentioned for the Pepsi system, the inventory build. With the ACV running ahead of your expectations and velocities as well is there a good portion of that that's really just an adjustment to faster sell through and kind of reset to normalized levels that are above what they would have initially expected or is that really some cushion that's volume that's pulled forward? Can you kind of dissect it, out of that amount, if there's a bit of both? Yes, so there's a bit of a build for the summer selling season, so to get ready for it and to meet the expected volume. So to your point, a bit of that is in anticipation of Q2 and Q3. We've also got a number of activations and a number of sales and marketing programs that we've got ahead of us over summer. So I would say it's partially well, in large part it's preparation of what's to come. Okay. That's helpful. And just on the SG&A run rate, it's been in roughly the same neighborhood, the last three or so quarters. Looking ahead, I know you've talked about stepping up the marketing a little bit, but you also get some operating leverage benefits from the revenue growth. How do we think about just, how that might look over the rest of the year? Yes, so our plan is or at least our expectation is, if we have the opportunity to continue to drive velocity, we'll, we want to maintain our kind of historical runway rate. I think in on our last call, we talked about kind of 2022 to 2024. I think historically we've been more in that 2023, 2024 range. So we were talking about can we shave off a couple percent this year. We did just over 18% in the quarter. We did benefit with some of that inventory bill, but also with the speed at which our revenues are growing and our -- the ability that our marketing team has been able to really drive that velocity. And our sales team has been able to drive the ACV with Pepsi. So we have been benefiting and seeing leverage there.
We are going to -- we've got a hundred days of summer program. We've got activation and a number of things we'll be doing over the summer. So we do look to increase our marketing and sales spend. And so at least for the summer period, we're, the goal is to stay consistent with history. But there is opportunities with the rate we're seeing the revenues grow to continue to leverage. And I think the goal for the year was to end the year roughly at that kind of 22% marker. Can we do better? If we have the opportunity we will, but at the same time, we want to make sure that we're putting the right money into the right investment into making sure those velocities continue to grow. Okay, great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Thomas McGovern from Maxim Group. Your line is live. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So just to start, I just have a question on the back office buildout. So given your summer launches, which you guys have mentioned quite a few times, and then this presumed transition into the international markets, just want to get an idea of how you guys are looking at it. Do you think it's a sufficient buildout for the near-term, or do you expect to continue to build on your back office throughout 2023? Well, I think -- thanks, Thomas for the question. I think when you look at the back office as Jarrod was talking about, we've been building it out really on our finance, IT that he's referencing as well as our GL teams as well as our legal teams. So when you look at back shop office there we're, we built out a great team. We probably have a few more hires here that we're working on, but we've been really investing as well in addition to, Jarrod's departments that we was referencing, on specific finance and, HR, legal areas. We also are investing in operations department as well. So we'll have some additional hires there as we scale and gain more really and open up additional co-packers for and have greater runs taking place to drive more efficiencies with logistics and so on.
But we have also been investing and continue to plan to invest and grow our sales teams and marketing teams as we build out. I think they're -- you're going to start to see, you're going to see leverage opportunities, especially when you look at building out the human resources. And I think we're going to get better leverage on our marketing investments, especially now that we have much broader distribution on hand and have reached that 95% ACV in the U.S. Now when we build out internationally and the plans we're working on, we will be investing in these new markets. We'll have more details on that as we continue to get further, and then back half of 2023 and 2024, but there will be initial investments that will be required to enter new markets on a go forward basis. Great. Thanks for that color. And then just my last question real quick is if you guys are still providing these metrics, I was curious to know how many branded coolers there are as the end of the quarter. How many coolers you're in total? And then just kind of where you guys are at in terms of penetrating Pepsis, I don’t, I believe it was 50,000 Pepsi owned energy coolers that you guys mentioned on one of the last calls. Just kind of want an update on there if you can provide it. Yes. We've eliminated some of those specific details that we were due to competitive and competition coming in, they category vigorously. So we still have a big presence and a big push for coolers and that's a big opportunity for us gaining more cold placements. We see that opportunity now. The number of coolers we're investing, we've made a decision not to disclose that specific number on a go forward basis, but we are investing in coolers, we're investing in additional placements, off-shelf racks and those types. And we think there's a lot of opportunities. In the past on the last call we said we were working towards and planning to half place by the end of the year of approximately 20,000 Celsius branded coolers, but that's, we're not going to provide any additional color on that. All Right. I understood. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions and congrats on the great quarter. Excellent, thank you. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sean McGowan from ROTH. Your line is live. Thank you, guys. Yes, I had a couple of questions; one on freight. Have you seen [indiscernible] and is any of the higher cost of freight [indiscernible] hello? Sean, are you there? We think he lost the signal. Yes, I must be having a problem with the signal. I'll just talk to you guys later. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That concludes today's conference. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thank you, Matt. And thank you everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interests and support. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum. We're capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and the transformation taking place in today's energy drink category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal. We're building upon our core business, leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices.
We have a winning portfolio strategy and team, a rapidly growing market that consumers want. I'd like to thank all our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. The company will be attending several upcoming investor conferences the week of May 22nd, including Goldman Sachs and B. Riley.

With that, I will turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John? Thank you, Cameron, and good afternoon, everyone. We thank you for joining us today.
On our first quarter call, I highlighted that it was the first quarter in company history to exceed $200 million in sales. Today, I highlight for the first time in company history we have achieved over $300 million in a single quarter. Our record sales in the second quarter totaled approximately $326 million, an increase of 112% from last year's second quarter of approximately $154 million.
In our North America business, revenue increased 114% for the quarter to $311 million, up from $145 million in the prior year second quarter. Celsius continues to be the top driver of growth within the energy category, both in dollars and unit growth. In total U.S. MULOC energy for the last 52 weeks, ending June 18, 2023, contributing over $665 million in incremental retail sales or 23% of the category growth, and $204 million in incremental units, representing 35% of the category growth.
Per IRI in the four weeks ending as of June 18, 2023, in MULOC total energy Celsius maintains the number three energy drink brand in the United States, representing a new market share record in the company history in the category of 8.6%, doubling its market share of 4.3% in the year-ago period.
We continue to see growth across all channels, both tracked and non-tracked, with our club channel sales hitting another quarterly record of approximately $68 million for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, up 120% approximately, compared to $31 million in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter channel sales also exceeded our first quarter sales by approximately $20 million, which was driven by a full rollout of our second new pack size of our Vibe energy pack going into Sam's Club, and the first full quarter of our national rollout within BJ's.
We also just hit a new record on Amazon with over $28 million in sales, up 108% from the prior period second quarter revenue of $14 million approximately, Celsius maintained its position as the second largest energy drink brand with approximately 18.6 share of the energy category as of the last 14 weeks period ending June 30, 2023, per Stackline energy drink category data total U.S on Amazon.
In addition, we continue to expand growth opportunities in non-tracked foodservice channels and are gaining more distributions in colleges, universities, hospitals, hotels, eateries, casinos, and more. Overall, foodservice represented and exceeds approximately 11% of our PepsiCo revenues and we see this as an area of growth and scale in the future. We have been extremely happy with our PepsiCo partnership and see a long runway of growth ahead across a variety of channels, including expanded retail, convenience, and foodservice.
As highlighted in our earnings supplement, for the four-week period ending per IRI SPINS total energy data ending June 18, 2023, as stated in MULOC Celsius maintains the number three energy drink position in the U.S and now has an 8.6 market share, which doubled from the prior year share of 4.3. In addition, in MULOC, Celsius grew its ACV to a record of 96. 8% versus 79.8% in the year-ago period, which is a tremendous achievement by our teams and our partner with PepsiCo.
And in addition, in convenience, Celsius has gained an additional 31.9 points of ACV growth versus the prior year ending period and resides at 94.9% ACV comparative 62.9% of ACV in the prior year. This provides a tremendous amount of opportunity as we continue to gain greater availability across the country as we can - and in addition, as we continue to build greater awareness with our consumers.
International sales grew 76% in the second quarter totaling $15.1 million compared to $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2022. We believe there is a significant opportunity for incremental growth going forward with PepsiCo over the next three to five years. Although earlier in the process, we are mapping out and rollout plans and continue to have discussions with our partners and opportunities for 2024 and beyond.
While the U.S transition is taking the majority of our focus to-date, we do expect to announce additional international expansion opportunities and plans in the future. With that said, we continue to work towards early 2024 for some opportunities to rollout internationally with 2023 being a year of planning around logistics, production, distribution, et cetera.
The goal will be to create a blueprint in a handful of countries in 2024 for further expansion within 2025 and 2026. We will provide additional details as we continue to get closer to those dates. Beyond new markets, we are very excited about a number of innovations that our team has been working on throughout the year. We hope to have some initial exciting launch plans in 2024 and beyond and we'll provide additional insight as we get closer to those launch dates.
The company achieved a record non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $78.1 million in the second quarter, representing approximately 24% of sales. This was driven by gross margin improvements by over 1,000 basis points from the year-ago period to 48.8%, up from 38.5%. In addition, we saw continued leverage across our sales and marketing with a total of approximately 19.2% of sales in the second quarter compared to 21.1% in the prior year. This leverage was more of a product that accelerated sales as we did increase our spend in the second quarter, as we outlined in our first quarter call.
In addition, we have seen some savings as we have rolled out slower pace against our headcount resulting in our initial budgeted expectations. We will look to add additional headcounts across back half of 2023, Jarrod will walk you through in more detail some expectations around this area. Celsius was the leader in unit growth over the last 12 weeks ending June 18, 2023 per IRI for the entire beverage category, contributing over 17% of unit growth in LRB, which is liquid - total liquid refrigerated beverages.
As the company continues to gain new consumers, we believe they are unique to the energy category, which further increases the value of each of our customers. With this proximity equal mix of male and female customers, the average age demographic is 18 to 45-plus. We are expanding the energy category with expanding consumer base and usage occasions. The Celsius consumer making it a daily part of their active lifestyle with consumption patterns that are similar to coffee than traditional impulse purchases with legacy energy drink brands.
To close my prepared remarks, both on a dollar and unit growth, Celsius is the industry-leading in the category with tracked channels showing acceleration year-over-year. Our customer's unique expanding the category to new consumers where they are increasing their dollar spend on Celsius. This is even further evident by our record sales in the club channel and on Amazon, as well as the rapid growth in ACV expansion we've seen in reported in MULOC. With our topline growth of 112% for the quarter, we saw over approximately 400% growth in operating income, showing the leverage in our operating model to drive further shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John. And thank you all for joining us.
It was another great quarter, where we continued to exceed both internal and external expectations, not only are we continuing to benefit from the distribution system of Pepsi, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays, and continuous improvement within velocities. As we look to Q3 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our growth and we have multiple opportunities and strategies that we will be testing in the back half of the year.
In addition, we have seen the opportunities of leverage across our business with gross margins, operating margins, and EBITDA margins, all improving quarter-over-quarter. Before I jump into the results, let's start with some administrative comments, in regards to progress on clearing our material weaknesses, as things stand through the second quarter, we have seen very good progress and we have a clear path ahead of us. With that said, we will not be able to provide full clearance until we get through the entire year and complete all testing.
In terms of legal updates, in mid-July, we reached a preliminary agreement to settle the securities class action suit. The agreement provides for a single cash payment of $7.9 million in exchange for the release of claims. Although we were confident that we would have prevailed, our leadership team felt that our time was best spent on growing the business and the many opportunities ahead of us as opposed to replaying challenges that existed as a result of the pace of our growth from a few years back.
Regarding the SEC review, we will continue to cooperate with any inquiries or requests that are received. With that said, we do not have any further updates at this point in time. Turning to our second quarter financial results. Our second quarter revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was approximately $326 million, an increase of 120% from $154 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022.
Driven by our North American business, our second quarter revenues were $311 million, an increase of 114% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 76% to $15 million, as we saw a recovery of the business from the challenging environment that existed in the prior year.
The acceleration of growth relative to Q1 in North America sales volume can be attributed to several key factors. A primary driver has been our successful integration into the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in continued growth. Notably, we've experienced consistent and robust expansion in traditional distribution channels and club channels with SKU increases and SKU placement contributing significantly. More ever, our products have found their way into several new channels within C&G and foodservice, further fueling the sales growth.
Additionally, following substantial growth in our ACV, we have observed a notable increase in product velocity. During the quarter, we did not see a significant increase in days inventory outstanding within the Pepsi mixing centers relative to the end of Q1 2023, as the changes likely contributed less than $5 million in incremental growth, and therefore was not a key driver of our growth in Q2.
In looking at our promotional allowance, we continue to see a consistent rate relative to prior quarters. As we look to the back half of the year, we would expect this to see some increases as our 100 Days of Summer program will incorporate incentive programs that fall within this bucket as opposed to the sales and marketing bucket.
As a result, there will be some movement between promotional allowances as a percentage of sales, and sales and marketing as a percentage of sales in Q3, which in essence will reduce the top-line, but overall will not impact expectations around total EBITDA or net income as it is simply where the spend is classified within the P&L. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, increased 168% to $159 million, up from $59 million in the year-ago quarter.
Gross profit margins in the second quarter were approximately 49% of revenues compared to approximately 39% for the prior year second quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower packaging and raw-material unit cost, reduced product waste and scrap, and improved inbound and outbound freight efficiency.
Q2 was the third quarter that we were operating within our new distribution system and we continue to drive efficiencies and optimization within the system while maintaining our number one goal of keeping the shelves stocked in order to meet the consumer demand.
In looking towards the second half of the year, we believe that we will operate with gross margins in the mid-to-high 40s. The second quarter saw improved freight lanes as a percentage of net revenues relative to Q1. This is one area that we will continue to monitor but has the potential to fluctuate during the back half of the year.
In addition, increased promotional allowances will put some pressure on the topline relative to gross margins, both of which are driving our overall margin expectations. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were approximately $63 million, an increase of approximately 93% compared to the second quarter of 2022. We saw increased marketing and sales investment during the quarter, but at the same time saw our SKU count and velocities accelerate at a rate in excess of our budget, delivering good leverage across the sales and marketing expense lines.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 19% compared to 21% in the prior year. On a full-year basis, we will continue to invest in our sales and marketing expenditures and would expect to see some further increase as our 100 Days of Summer program only included one month in Q2, with two-plus months in the third quarter.
As we look to Q4, we are working on some strategic investment programs across the U.S, which will include programs with our distribution partner, as well as specific sales and marketing activities beyond our budgeted pillar strategy, albeit, we would not expect these opportunities and investments to exceed our historical sales and marketing spend from prior years.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were approximately $32 million, an increase of 119% relative to Q2 2022. This increase was due to increased administrative fees such as legal, as well as audit and other consulting fees. G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 10% for the second quarter of 2023 versus 9% in the prior year and versus 8% in the prior quarter, which is higher than expected primarily due to the class action litigation settlement accrual that was booked in Q2. Adjusting for this accrual, G&A was better aligned with historical rates.
Looking at the first half of the year, revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was approximately $586 million, an increase of 104% from $287 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This was driven by our North American business, where first half revenues were $559 million, an increase of 108% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 43% to $27 million in the first half of the year.
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2023, increased 141% to $273 million, up from $113 million in the year-ago first half. Gross profit margins in the first half were approximately 47% of revenues compared to approximately 39% for the prior year first half.
The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower package and raw material unit cost and improved inbound and outbound freight efficiency in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 19% in the first half of 2023, compared to 22% in the prior year first half.
G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 9% for the first half of 2023 versus 9% in the prior year same period. Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources, as of June 30, 2023, we had cash in excess of $680 million and net working capital in excess of $800 million.
In the second quarter, we returned in excess of $30 million for the balances due to Pepsi, representing excess funds provided by Pepsi for our distributor transition and this reduced restricted cash on the balance sheet by the same amount.
Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, which compares to $42 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in cash generation was driven by an increase in net income and improvements in working capital, offset in part by the reimbursement to Pepsi, which I just noted.
Looking at inventory, total inventory ended at just above $150 million, flat versus the prior quarter. This was driven in large part by the significant increase that we saw in our sales volume. As we look to the second half of the year, we will see production increases to accommodate the demand in the market, going forward, we will continue to monitor inventory to ensure we are able to keep up with the significant growth we are experiencing. At the same time, we do see opportunity to continue to drive efficiency in our DIO as we move through 2023 and into 2024.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you all. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jon Keypour from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Jon. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Congratulations on the quarter. I guess to start, could you guys tell us anything you've seen in terms of exit rate out of 2Q and maybe what quarter-to-date has looked like so far? Hi, Jon, thank you. I appreciate the question. Teams did a great job in the second quarter and being north of $300 million, we're really excited about the performance of the brand and our portfolio. We don't give any forward guidance right now, so - but I will say that the company performed extremely well during the quarter. Okay. If I could ask a follow-up, you guys mentioned the 11% of sales through Pepsi went into the foodservice channel, I was just wondering if you could - I know it will be in the queue, but if you could let us know what the Pepsi size was, and I guess how should we think about that channel going forward as the school year starts up pretty soon? Are you guys fully distributed in - across colleges, is the opportunity in the next two quarters coming from that specifically for colleges or is it - there's a lot more to be had, are you guys also sort of distributed in the other foodservice channels you guys mentioned? Yes, that's a good point, Jon. When you look at the quarter, 11% of our revenue through Pepsi was attributed to the foodservice division and that does include college and universities and we know that was pretty much down for the quarter, so with the summer and everyone getting back to college and campus in Celsius, we launched our Celsius University and graduated 170 students just two weeks ago that are going to be going back to campuses around the country. So really excited about that, that is correct, that volume is not included in that second quarter and that's - could be some opportunities for us in Q3 as everyone gets back to campus. In regards to the overall revenue, it represented about 56.7% was the Pepsi revenue, that's - so you can take 11% of that number. Got it, thank you. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Jon. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead, Mark. Yes, hi, thanks, and afternoon, everyone. I guess, my shot that's going to be to whoever in marketing decided to invest in the fight this past weekend and the Miami FC sponsorship pre-Messi, so hats off to that person in person. On a question, I guess, from your standpoint, are you surprised at the level of distribution that you've achieved through Pepsi, if yes, what channels have surprised you? And then how do you think about where the distribution points can go in terms of where an absolute to where on a percentage basis or if you don't want to answer specifically how to just broadly think about where we are today versus where you could be in certain key channels? Thanks. Yes, Mark. I mean, great question. I see the relationship with Pepsi has been just a great transition and great opportunity. I think it's exceeded all of our expectations internally and our internal budgets. I give hats off to our team, all of our sales team members, and our marketing team members, and operations and finance team, I mean there's really - it's a 360 approach. The way we're able to tie in and just forge a really great partnership and everyone on the PepsiCo within all the divisions have been very collaborative.
We've been hiring a lot of staff members, working closely with them and it was a seamless transition. I think the biggest opportunity we saw going into the partnership was really gaining additional distribution in convenience and gas, and that's the biggest ACV gains that we've seen in convenience and gas.
And then seeing the number of items being - that our scanning at each point of distribution has increased as well so - the foodservice was something we weren't even thinking about and having that represent 11% of our revenue, just really surprised us. I think we know Celsius is being consumed outside of that traditional energy drink usage occasion, pairing it with food and those or likes.
So that was - I mean, we saw that as an opportunity, but we didn't think it would be as large of an opportunity as it is today, representing 11%. And then I talked about in the last to Jon of Bank of America, regards to college and universities are really going to be opening up next month. So that was a big surprise and everything is going extremely smoothly with the partnership and we look forward to a bright future together. Got it, okay. Maybe a similar sort of question, but put differently, so the shelf-space that you're getting and total distribution points increasing obviously a lot, how much of that is coming from other energy brands versus incremental space in additional coolers and what do you think the opportunity is for the latter, assuming that that's a contributing factor here? Yes, I think that's a great point. I know in the latest IRI MULOC data as of June 18, 2023, we had about - on last four weeks, we had about 14.6 spacings in the U.S, so that is a sizable increase from where we started the year at, and those resets really helped with a lot of our retailers. We did have some summer cut-ins with variety packs, which added to that number as we're heading in - as we're going through summer. The coolers have really helped.
Our team has been working very collaboratively with Pepsi, not only going in some of the PepsiCo energy coolers but also Celsius-focused and dedicated coolers that we've been investing in and placing around the country, so I would say it's a mix. Whatever the shelves or the planograms, the way they were adjusted in the first beginning of the year, I'm not sure we took space from other brands in regards to like mid-year summer resets, but it seems like we did gain incrementally. We are hearing from a variety of buyers, they're looking at further potentially reducing maybe some juice - the juice-coffee category also potentially looking at some CSDs to give more space to energy as they look for the resets in 2024. Got it, thanks, guys. Thank you, Mark. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, Peter. Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, guys. So, John, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but I would love to kind of get some updated thoughts on the international rollout that you outlined last quarter, just any views on potential markets, how do you think about the market-share opportunity over the next couple of years? And just, - it's probably hard to do right now, but just any parameters you can provide in terms of how we should think about the contribution to growth looking ahead, what would be really helpful? I mean - hi, Peter, it's Jarrod. If you use, one of our competitors that you guys have available data for as a proxy, they run about 35% to 40% of their revenues in the international markets, so I think that's a good barometer for the eventual size of the prize. Obviously, we've got work to do to get any kind of scale internationally. We are working with our partner on a number of opportunities to expand across the globe.
We have mentioned, we'll probably focus on the energy categories or energy countries that are more familiar with energy as opposed to trying to go and creating the category. In terms of timing, we're working through a number of things we would expect the launch some opportunities in early 2024, but we're going to hold off until we get closer to that time period before we start announcing plans and in part due to competitive measures, because we got to keep some of that close to the vest for now, but we see it as a big opportunity over the next three to five years. We'll have more data available as we get closer to the end of the year and closer to the launch period. Super helpful. Jarrod. If I can just follow up on gross margin, obviously very strong, but I think back in May, the expectation was for 40% or mid-40% gross margin, so can you maybe - you talked about the drivers of the expansion, but can you maybe just help us on understand the drivers of the upside versus kind of what you outlined back in May. And then looking ahead, I think you mentioned - I may have misheard this, but I think you mentioned mid-to-high 40s gross margin, is that simply conservatism or is there a reason why margins kind of moderate sequentially versus what we just saw here in the second quarter? Yes, when we were back in December or actually last November, we were talking about mid-40s as kind of the target. As we did our Q1 call, we talked about probably on the low end of the mid-40s in the first half of the year and the high end of the mid-40s in the back half of the year. I think we did see some really good leverage across our finished goods, but also I think we had about 100 basis points of improvement within freight, which was very helpful, so I think there is some opportunity to maintain where we got to, now the freight is kind of a bit of an outlier, the goal is to be closer to the freight rate that we were at this quarter, but there is still - that is still kind of a variable that we're not comfortable locking in at the moment, so there could be some volatility there.
We also have some opportunity from a slotting perspective and from a call it a contra-revenue perspective in the back half of the year to push some sales and to push further growth, so that could put a little bit of pressure on the margins, which is kind of why we are pointing to more of, call it, mid-40s back on to that kind of high-end of the mid-40s as opposed to going higher from that perspective. Super helpful. Congrats again on the great results. Thank you, Peter. Thanks, Peter. Thank you. And next, we'll go to Jeff Van Sinderen from B. Riley. Please go ahead, Jeff. Let me add my congratulations on strong metrics for the quarter. How much do you think Q2 benefited from stocking ahead of the summer season or sell through peak and in any sense you have a product inventory level in the channel, I realize that's a really tough question. And then, how are you thinking about sales growth for Q3, where do you think it would moderate because maybe there was a little stocking in Q2 or just the sell-throughs are so strong that there is no reason that it would moderate? So, I will take the first part of that, from a DIO perspective, we're pretty consistent, I mentioned that on my prepared remarks, it would have been less than a $5 million benefit in the quarter. So really the DIO over the course of the quarter when we're looking at Q1 and Q2 was pretty consistent. We would hope that that kind of rate would stay the same in Q3 from a DIO perspective. In terms of kind of growth in depletion and those kind of things. Yes, when you look at where we are, Jeff, I think, look at the second quarter, the numbers, just really solid results all the way around. We saw velocities expand slightly. We saw the distribution grow, number of items per store grow. We're really pushing on a variety of marketing vehicles in the quarter for Q3. Talked about the MLS opportunity that we just recently aligned with, as well as the recent Jake Paul fight all over the weekend, lots of activation, social radiation.
The teams are doing really well. We're in a 100 Days of Summer program, so really excited for the summer. I mean, we're watching it. We'll have to see how everything pans out for the rest of the quarter here, but based on the latest data and scan data that we're seeing, it looks like we'll continue to maintain on trends. Yes, pretty good there, do you have enough production capacity, do you think to meet demand and we did notice a couple of stockouts in the club channel, obviously, a high-class challenge, how are you flexing the remedy where you get sort of I don't think it's a very small thing, I don't think it's happening widespread, but when you're getting those stockouts are you flexing remedy in those. Yes, I think if you look at the percentage of our sales to our inventory balance, I think we're in pretty good shape. When you look at that on a percentage basis as we are maintaining, but right now I have the operation team trying to produce enough product, and I have the sales team trying to out-sell them, but things are going well. I think we got a good inventory balance. I think we did have some short shipments in the quarter, but we're still shipping, 95% plus shipping rates, so I think we're in really good shape there.
Couple of sporadic out-of-stocks during the quarter in certain markets, but otherwise it was all pretty much like over 95% and as we head into summer, we're looking at trying to build inventory at the moment slightly, but we're in good shape. We have about 17 co-packers and partners around the country and we're able to continue to keep up with demand plus. And we just onboarded a couple of co-packers as well, so to get to that 17 number. So we're in good shape in terms of having the capacity and having the co-packers that we need, and will actually look to build out what was once a six-orbit model, we're going to make that more of an eight-orbit model over the course of the back-half of the year. So from a capacity perspective, we're in great shape. We've onboarded some additional partners and so we'll make sure that shelf is stocked in Q3 and Q4. All right, well, keep crushing it. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you, Jeff. And we'll take our next question from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Michael. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Michael. Just as a consumer I have noticed some growing number of secondary placements and including some of the branded fridges, and you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but can you maybe give a sense of how big a push you have behind that and maybe that coupled with just, as you've had - you're three quarters into Pepsi distribution, as you come up on resets another round, are you getting kind of a second push as the momentum has been so much stronger, just - what some of the distribution upside ahead and how much is some of the secondary placements or the branded fridge is a big part of that? Yes, Michael, that's a great question, and you know in regards to building a brand, especially in the energy category, just in the beverage category in general and the competitive nature, we got a lot of great marketing. We're reaching consumers on a top funnel walking them down for - to drive that awareness and then most importantly, we've got to get what they call the lips and create that loyalty, what you get when you connect the consumer with Celsius.
So the secondary displays are extremely critical as we continue to grow within the category. We have a variety of - all of our sales team members are really focused on those secondary placements.
Most importantly, the cold placements are extremely critical. What we're doing is capitalizing on that impulse purchase opportunity that's out there, cold checkouts to create that connection with the consumer. And most importantly, create that loyalty, because we know we have a really high loyalty rate once a consumer tries, which we're really excited about. The Celsius coolers have been a big push.
There's a variety of them out there. I think the biggest opportunity when you look ahead is further gaining additional SKUs in cold placements and a lot of the cold placements are some of the larger chains, maybe in grocery and mass is somewhat limited to only a few flavors versus some of the larger convenience store chains now, we're getting closer to almost a full shelf in a lot of these locations within certain regions of the country. So that's going to be a big opportunity for the cold placements.
So that's what our teams are focusing on. Next year for resets, we're talking with buyers now. We're looking for really to gain more cold availability and secondary placements really within that outer wall of the stores, so you get the higher foot traffic, but that's really critical as we continue to grow forward and we're going to continue to capitalize on that. I don't know if you gone into Circle K, we just launched our Cosmic Vibe. It's been out for a few weeks and we did have chased active space in all Circle Ks which was great. And also the 7/11 has been a big supporter of the brand as well providing secondary placements. Okay, that's great color. And can I just have a clarification question on 3Q? You mentioned some of the greater promotional spending tight to 100 Days of Summer, but I guess two things, one, maybe could you quantify that at all or either way, would we be right to think that if it's a promotional price reduction, we would see that in the scanner data as well, it's not an adjustment from that that we would need to make, right? It's a mix, there is up - I won't get into a gap too deep with ASC 606, there're certain things that you can do from an incentive perspective that gets recorded as a contra-revenue and may not be something, let's say buy two for four type concept. So there is another number of incentives that you can offer through that type of activity that would still be put there and you might not pick it up in the scan data.
I'd say probably the easiest way to look at it is if you kind of - within our 10-Q, which is also filed, so you can pull it now, but if you take a look at kind of the promotional activity, the promotional dollars that we spent relative to - you have to do base upgrade sales that you got to take the promos, add it to our net sales number and that will give you kind of the percentage that we can run it. We've typically been running around 20%, so look for that to go up a bit when we look at Q3. Okay, great, thanks so much. And we'll take our next call from Gerald Pascarelli from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Great, thanks very much for the question. So I just - I had a clarification I was hoping that you could help me with on distributor inventory levels, so just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly, you had $20 million to $25 million last quarter that was shipped into the Pepsi distribution system ahead of summer. I think you called out $5 million on the call today, so just to be clear like is this expected to reverse or is it one of those things like given kind of how new your partnership is with Pepsi? They're still trying to find the right inventory levels and there is a chance that there is essentially no reversal in these, in particular, given how strong your consumer takeaway trends have been, just any incremental color you could provide there would be great. Thank you. Yes, so it's less than $5 million that was just rounding up. So there was - it was kind of de minimis this quarter, so the DIO is very consistent quarter-over-quarter, and that goes back to in Q4 we felt inventories were low, so they are at a level that we would prefer they stay, but obviously, it's part of the partnership so it's not just us.
Now, will that change, it could, again, right now, Q1 and Q2 has been consistent from a DIO perspective. We'd expect that to continue on into Q3. When we get to Q4, I'm not sure if that will stay at, it's kind of what I'll call a preferred run rate or if it would go down that's something that our partner will have to make that decision in terms of how they want to kind of end the year prior to moving into the Q1 2024. Perfect, thanks, Jarrod. Just one more from me on non-measured channels. I know that in club you're getting some distribution with Sam's, with BJ's, which is new to this year, but you really did expand your distribution in Costco over the course of 2022 and I think that where revenues came in for 2Q were a little higher certainly than I would have expected as - in addition to your revenues in Amazon. So maybe just some incremental color on the drivers there. I assume Costco is probably the Vibe variety pack relative to the prior quarter, but any color you could provide there would be great. Thanks. Yes, Gerald, it's jump-in, you're correct, we did have that Vibe pack rollout and it's been really successful. So, now we have two packs in Costco. We also did some promotional activities and then with the rollout of Sam's, that's what you're seeing that club channel, have a really good quarter within the second quarter and we'll see how that progresses into Q3. Perfect. Thanks very much, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Next we'll go to Jim Salera from Stephens. Please go ahead, Jim. Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig down a little bit on the club channel. Do you have any sense for how many of the consumers that are purchasing in club are incremental to the brand, given that it's probably different consumers than it would be the C store or maybe even a traditional FDM, do you have any sense for how many of them are new or have trialed it in a single serve option and are buying the pack in club? Yes, Jim, that's a great point. If you've been tracking the company for some time, when we expanded into the club channel, it was really like all tides rose at the same level. So it has been incremental to our overall sales and we haven't seen any cannibalization. So it does seem like it's incremental to our overall revenues. What would drive - so are they consumers that are new to the brand and/or just buying because I would think buying a larger pack size like of an 18 pack is something that core energy drink consumer would buy, but you guys have done a very good job of kind of reaching outside that core energy drink buyer, so do you have any sense for, is this like a traditional coffee or tea consumer that's trying Celsius because it has a different positioning than a traditional energy beverage. Yes, I think you really kind of nailed it, that's something that's unique about Celsius is where are demographic of 50-50 male-female or 18 to 45-plus consumer. One thing, at the club channel, you're able to gain - we have lots of sampling activities as well as you know and we do see it as an incremental consumer somewhat older as well, we've seen, still getting more data points there, but I think that's one thing that differentiates Celsius from maybe other traditional energy drinks is really when you look at the opportunity we have and different age demographics, the incrementality of the energy category, and then when you look at - I've talked about in my prepared remarks about the percentage of growth within LRB, which is Liquid Refrigerated Beverages, just all of those beverages, we're really a unit growth driver that we saw in the last data, so truly incremental. It's really an exciting time. The club channel has been great business for us and it's something we're monitoring closely. It doesn't seem like it's cannibalizing at all. Great, thanks for the color. I'll pass it on. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Sean McGowan from ROTH. Please go ahead, Sean. Thank you. First, a quick clarification, is that 100% of that legal settlement in the G&A line? Yes, that's correct, Sean. Okay. Then I wanted to get a little bit more color on sales and marketing. I think it would be fair to say that as a percentage of revenue that came in lower than - it seems like it came in lower than you expected to the dollar spent, I mean lower-than-expected or was that in line and kind of give us a little bit more color if you can on what we should expect to see in the balance of the year given some of the comments you've made about promotion that would be a contra-revenue? Thanks. Yes. This is Jarrod. I'd expect some of the - where we would kind of position sales and marketing to be actually up in contra revenue. We have been running between that 19% and 20% as opposed to close to that 22%, so we have been seeing really good leverage come through. Some of that is the sales have exceeded expectations and some of that is we are getting better leverage through the system.
And then the other piece is, from a headcount perspective and a budgeting headcount perspective. We're adding heads, but not at the same clip that we thought we may have needed to. So we will still continue to add headcount, which will drive a little bit of cost, some of that will get moved up into contra.
So we do - we will look in the back half of the year to spend that kind of historical rate close to that 22%, but again some of it will be bucketed up in contra-revenue, and then really we just need to get the headcount into continue to drive the velocity and the drive the business. From a - if you go just specifically to marketing, call it advertising, we have actually been spending a little bit ahead of historical rates.
So it's in some of those other buckets that we would have seen some savings like storage and warehousing and some of the other sales line, where we've been able to really leverage the system. In our DIO, our internal DIO has gone down a bit and so we've been able to leverage that across some of the sales and marketing spend as well. Okay. Thanks a lot for the clarity. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take the next question from Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group. Please go ahead, Anthony. Hi, guys, this is Thomas on for Anthony. Thanks for taking my question. So just kind of you guys just mentioned and you talked about it in the prepared remarks, but on the headcount additions, it seems like it might not be super aggressive in terms of expanding headcount, but just looking to get a little bit more color on where we might expect to see these headcount additions and kind of what you hope to achieve through this? Thanks. Yes, Thomas, thank you. We're looking at applying additional resources as we continue to grow and scale. We're not going to, just a strategic standpoint, identify where we're adding additional resources within our operations, marketing, and sales, but we do have additional headcounts planned for the back half of the year. We will be further building out our teams and I did mention earlier, we did add 170 college university students to our university program that are heading to universities around the country right now. Awesome, thanks, that's it from me and I'll hop back in the queue. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you, Karen. Thank you on behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued support and interest. Our results demonstrate our products are gaining considerable momentum. We are capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends and through the transformation that's taking place today in today's energy drink category. Our active lifestyle position is a global position with mass appeal.
We are building upon our core and leveraging opportunities and deploying best practices. We have a winning portfolio, strategy, and team and a large rapidly-growing market that consumers want. I'd like to take this time to thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. The Company will be attending several upcoming investor conferences throughout the month of September, including Piper Sandler's, Barclays, Wells Fargo, and B. Riley Investor Conferences, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.

Celsius achieved record sales in the third quarter that totaled approximately $385 million, up 104% from $188 million from the prior year third quarter. This was driven predominantly by North America revenue, which increased 107% to $371 million, up from $180 million for the prior year third quarter.
Celsius continues to be the top driver of growth in the energy category, both in dollars and units through tracked channels. Celsius is the #1 dollar and unit growth brand over the last 52 weeks per IRI total U.S. MULOC energy category data ending October 8, 2023, growing approximately $950 million incremental dollars, up 144% versus a year ago while representing 28% of all category dollar growth.
In addition, our unit growth totaled 289.2 million incremental units, an increase of 114% versus a year ago and totaled 39% of all category unit growth. Per IRI, in the 4-weeks period ending October 8, 2023, in MULOC, Celsius is the #3 energy drink brand in the U.S. with approximately a 10.5% market share, more than doubling its 4.4% share in the same period last year. This dollar growth on 10.5% share has not been achieved in the last decade.
We continue to see growth across all channels, both tracked and non-tracked, with our club channel sales totaling approximately $63.2 million for the quarter ending September 30, up 83.3% year-over-year compared to $34.5 million for the prior period third quarter.
Per Stackline on Amazon, over the last 14 weeks ending September 30, 2023, Celsius is now the best-selling energy drink on Amazon with approximately a 21.4% share in the energy category, ahead of Monster at an 18.6% share and Red Bull at a 13% share.
Our third quarter 2023 Amazon sales totaled approximately $22.2 million versus $15.6 million for the year-ago period, an increase of approximately 42%. Celsius is now the #1 energy drink brand on Instacart and continues to outpace that category of growth as the largest and fastest-growing brand on the platform.
We continue to expand our growth opportunities in non-tracked foodservice channels and are gaining more distribution points at colleges, universities, hospitals, hotels, eateries, casinos and more.
Overall foodservice continues to exceed approximately 10% of our PepsiCo revenues, and we see this area as an opportunity for further growth and scale. We are extremely happy with our PepsiCo partnership, and we believe there is a long runway ahead of growth across a variety of channels, including expanding at retail, convenience and at foodservice.
During the quarter in foodservice, I'd like to highlight that Celsius is now available in over 2,000 Jersey Mike locations across the United States, and we've now gained authorization in over 3,000 Dunkin' Donuts nationwide. This illustrates the many unique usage occasions that we are seeing, and our customers are enjoying our Celsius products.
As highlighted in our earnings supplement, per IRI, for the 4-week period ending October 8, 2023, we have increased our market share in MULOC by approximately 138% to a 10.5% share, which has not been achieved in the energy category over the past decade versus a 4.4% share in the prior year period. In MULOC, Celsius grew its ACV to 95.6% versus 72.1% year-over-year.
In convenience, Celsius gained an additional 22.6% of ACV growth versus the prior year period ending and resides at approximately 95.6% of ACV compared with a 73% of ACV in the prior year. This provides tremendous opportunities as we continue to grow customer awareness and our national availability.
International sales grew approximately 56% in the third quarter, totaling $13.6 million compared to $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, driven in large part by successful innovation launches, increased velocity and brand awareness.
The first major international market in which we plan to expand to under the PepsiCo umbrella is Canada, expected to launch in the first quarter of 2024. We believe there are significant opportunities for incremental growth over the next 3 to 5 years as we execute our international expansion blueprint in a handful of countries in 2024, with opportunities for further expansion in '25, '26 and beyond. We expect to provide additional details as we get closer to these dates.
Beyond new markets, we are very excited about a number of our innovative launches that our team has created and have been working through, including our recent launch of our newest Vibe flavor, Cosmic Vibe, a great-tasting sparkling fruit punch flavor, which is out of this world and is now available at Circle K.
In addition, just recently in November, we launched a new 16-ounce line, CELSIUS ESSENTIALS, which is exclusively available initially at 7-Eleven through the remainder of 2023 with a nationwide rollout planned in 2024. CELSIUS ESSENTIALS is formulated for fitness enthusiasts looking to elevate their performance. Each can of CELSIUS ESSENTIALS contains 270 milligrams of caffeine, our essential aminos as well as our proprietary blend, providing you with the combination of enhanced physical performance and cognitive benefits. This new line comes in 4 great-tasting flavors: Blue Crush, Cherry Limeade, Dragonberry and Orangesicle.
Net income attributed to common shareholders totaled $70.5 million in the quarter or $0.89 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $186.5 million or a net loss of $2.46 per diluted share. The prior year losses were preliminarily driven by termination expenses as we moved from our prior distribution network to the PepsiCo distribution system.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 318% to approximately $104 million in the quarter compared to $25 million in the prior year period, driven substantially by revenue growth, an increase in margins and our continued leverage across our SG&A.
Our record non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter represented approximately 27% of sales. This was driven by gross margin improvements, up 860 basis points from the prior year ago to approximately 50.4% of gross profit versus 41.8%.
In addition, we saw a combination of leverage across our sales and marketing totaling approximately 19.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 23% adjusted for distributor termination expenses in the prior year period.
G&A, general and administrative expenses, totaled approximately 6% in the third quarter compared to 14.6% of sales in the prior year period. Jarrod will cover these items in more detail shortly.
Our distribution partner, PepsiCo, continues to facilitate ACV expansion, supporting new customer acquisitions across broad demographics and new usage occasions. Going forward, we expect that our key incremental growth drivers are expected to be increasing our SKUs, our flavors and facings at retail, improving shelf placements, more placements in stores, secondary placements and Celsius-branded cooler placements as well as expanded independent convenience expansion initiatives as well as foodservice and increasing our velocities at shelf.
In recent calls, I've also cited South Florida as an example of what a more developed mature market can look like. Over the last 4 weeks, as of October 8, 2023, per IRI, Celsius in South Florida market share was approximately 24.1%. At the beginning of January of 2023, our market share was 17.7%. This shows the strong market share and growth the Celsius brand has achieved in the South Florida market as well as the opportunities that we see in a broader market as we look for national U.S. availability as we continue to roll out into further locations and improve our placements at retail as well as our velocities.
To conclude my prepared remarks, Celsius continues to lead both on a dollar and unit growth basis in the energy category. The leverage in our operating model is becoming more apparent with incremental growth, highlighted by our 104% sales growth in the third quarter, delivering over a 300% adjusted EBITDA growth. Our customers have been growing the category, both in demographics and usage occasions, increasing their dollar spend on Celsius.
I also want to highlight the Celsius team and the amazing job they're doing. We have added over 200 new full-time and part-time employees during the third quarter. Developing our world-class team continues to position Celsius to execute against our growth opportunities that we see in front of us while driving operational leverage to unlock greater shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Jarrod? Thank you, John. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
It was another great quarter where we continued to exceed both internal and external expectations. Not only are we continuing to benefit from the distribution system of Pepsi, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays and continuous improvement within velocities. We plan to continue investment in our growth in Q4 and beyond. In addition, we have seen the benefits of leverage across our business with gross margins, operating margins and EBITDA margins all improving.
As we announced last week, the company initiated a 3-for-1 forward stock split, and we expect that the common stock will trade on a split-adjusted basis commencing with the opening of trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on November 15, 2023.
Turning to our third quarter financial highlights. Revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $385 million, an increase of 104% from $188 million from the same period in 2022. North American third quarter revenues were $371 million, an increase of 107% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 56% to $14 million as we saw a recovery from the challenging environment that existed in the prior year.
We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter compared to 2022 to several key drivers, including a successful integration to the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in broader availability, increased SKU mix and improved placement. We're also benefiting from robust expansion in our traditional distribution channels and club channels with SKU increases and placement improvements all contributing.
More ever, our products are now found in several new channels within C&G and foodservice. As discussed in the prior year, there was a pipe fill in Q3 2022. We also had growth in inventory at our distributor in Q3 of 2023, which was an offset to the prior year pipe fill. As a result, inventory was not a significant component of the year-over-year percentage increase.
Increased product availability has improved the success rate of our promotional activities. For the third quarter of 2023, the company received updated information related to promotional activity across our footprint and evaluated this data in conjunction with recent trends in activity, which resulted in improvements and adjustments to our promotional allowance accrual. As a result, despite increasing our promotional activity during the 100 Days of Summer campaign as a percentage of revenue, the promotional spend was consistent with the prior year period.
Gross profit for the third quarter increased 147% to $194 million, up from $79 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the quarter were approximately 50% of revenues compared to approximately 42% for the prior year third quarter. The improvement is attributed to lower package and raw material costs as well as improved waste and freight lane efficiency.
Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were approximately $73 million, a decrease of approximately 63% compared to the third quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to prior year costs associated with the termination of legacy distributors as a part of the transition to the Pepsi network. Adjusting for last year's termination expense, marketing and sales investment increased in the quarter, while SKU count distribution and velocity budgets outperformed, delivering good leverage across the sales and marketing expense lines.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 19% compared to 23% in the prior year, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. We plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing with increased planned spend as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter to execute strategic seasonal investment programs with our distribution partner.
General and administrative expenses for the quarter were approximately $23 million, a decrease of 17% relative to Q3 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of timing of legal settlements and the Func Foods brands impairment in Q3 2022.
Moving to a few comments around quarter-over-quarter activity to provide some additional insight into our recent activity. Revenue for the third quarter increased sequentially by 18%, driven by distribution gains across tracked and untracked channels as well as SKUs per location and SKU placement.
In addition to these drivers, we benefited from some inventory building within our primary distributor as well as from adjustments to our promotional allowances with some offsets to our growth as a result of mix within our SKUs and channels. An estimate of the impact of inventory, promos and SKU channel mix compared to Q2 would have been roughly $20 million.
Gross profit dollars increased by 22%, and gross margin improved by 165 basis points sequentially from the second quarter, driven by positive adjustments to our promotional allowance accounts as we maintained our leverage across raw materials, freight and scrap rates. Excluding the promotional allowance benefit, we would have had gross profit margins consistent with Q2.
Looking at the first 3 quarters of the year, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30 was approximately $971 million, an increase of 104% from $476 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, driven by our North American business. North America year-to-date revenues were $931 million, an increase of 108% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 46% to $40 million in the first 9 months of 2023.
Gross profit for the first 9 months of this year increased 143% to $467 million, up from $192 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the first 9 months were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 40% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margin is attributed to lower package and raw material costs and improved freight lane efficiency. As things stand today, we would expect Q4 gross profit margin to be consistent with the Q2 and full year margin profile.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 19% in the first 9 months of 2023 compared to 22% in the prior year period, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. G&A expense as percentage of sales was 8% for the first 9 months of 2023 versus 11% in the prior year.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of September 30, we had cash in excess of $760 million and net working capital in excess of $879 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $136 million for the 9 months ended September 30, which compares to $171 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the same prior year period. The change in cash generation was driven by an increase in net income, offset by working capital and timing benefits of transactions associated with the Pepsi share purchase and distribution agreement in 2022.
Looking at inventory, total inventory in the third quarter of 2023 ended at $199 million, up approximately $46 million from the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This was driven in large part by increases that we saw in our sales volume in addition to increases associated with innovation inventory building ahead of January launches. Going forward, we will continue to monitor inventory to ensure we are able to keep up with the growth we are expecting. At the same time, we do see opportunities to drive efficiencies in our DIO as we move into 2024.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. I guess maybe to start, just on distribution points, any sort of benchmark you can give? Obviously, the growth has been significant. But how do we think about it in terms of where it can go? Like if you look at where Celsius' total distribution points are versus Monster and Red Bull, they're about 50% of those 2 brands. If you look at convenience stores as an example, your current distribution footprint is about 20% less than where Bang was at peak distribution. So any sort of color you can give on kind of where you think the right level of distribution can be, maybe longer term holistically and sort of shorter-term line of sight as you head into '24, particularly given fall and then spring resets? Yes. Thank you, Mark. When you look at the distribution points, if we look at kind of the peers that we're looking up to, obviously, it's Monster and Red Bull. So over time, that is our goal and objective is to achieve those maximum distribution points, which the 2 leaders have in the category. I think we're still in the earlier phase in the -- as we -- in the growth cycle and the opportunities. We'll continue to evolve upon resets as we continue to evolve through 2024 and beyond.
I think when you look at the average points of distribution when you look at -- we're right around 95.6%, really need to continue to work on the total breadth within the distribution points. And we just got finished with NACS last month, which was a great show, probably the best show in company history. A lot of excitement around some of our new innovation of our core flavors as well as further expansion upon our Vibe flavors as well as the launch of our CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line. So that's our peer group we expect over time, and our goal and objective is to have the same points of distribution as Red Bull and Monster. Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then looking at the Amazon, Costco sales in the quarter, they were a little bit slower, I think, sequentially in terms of rate of growth than they were in 2Q. I get it's a bit of a challenge to try to model that from where we all sit. But anything that you can call out there that may have played into that would be helpful, too, please. Yes, I think -- I mean you got to look at each customer somewhat differently in different channels. Also, you're looking at a singular customer versus a category or a channel. So I think modeling it out, it does get a little bit challenging.
In regards to Amazon, when you look at the lumpiness that was in the quarter from Q2 to Q3, when we dove into the data, it really was looking at a prime -- somewhat of a Prime build in Q2 due to Prime taking place June 11 and 12, which was really successful for us. So we did have some lumpiness there when looking at Amazon specifically.
And then when you look at the club channel, which is mainly Costco and Sam's because [ it is ] reported through IRI, when looking at that specifically, there is some lumpiness between the 2 customers on load-ins. It could be some seasonality at the end of the quarter. But both of our businesses are extremely strong in both those channels. And on Amazon, we actually gained over 2 points of share, which is -- last quarter when we reported on the second quarter, we finished our share number at 18.6%, and we just came in at 21.4%. So almost within a quarter, we gained over 200 basis points in share.
So that's a really great achievement. The team has been working really hard, and we had a great Prime Day as well. So that's great to see. Also on the club business, continues to be a really strong business, and we don't really see that slowing down. We see great opportunities to further leverage additional pack sizes as we continue to scale within the club channel. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. I just had a question on Pepsi's current inventory levels. You've been in the system for a little over a year now. It looks like you built inventory in 3Q. Just some color on what you expect to happen with these inventory levels in the fourth quarter as we approach a low seasonality quarter ahead of winter. Do you expect any changes in their number of days on hand? Or is there nothing to suggest that there will be any incremental changes in their current inventory levels? Yes, Gerald, that's a great question. And we're on our -- really cycling our first full year with them with PepsiCo selling their first case in October. But I'll turn that question over to Jarrod. Yes. As we look last year, it was difficult to really kind of peg whether inventories were pulled down or it was just a matter of seasonality. As we look now, we do have some innovation that we filled the pipeline with, so we are ready from that perspective. But at the end of the day, the Pepsi team would have to determine if they're going to do any kind of management around the inventory as they're going into Q1. I will say we are excited as we move into 2024, but there's no guarantees in terms of the inventory management from that perspective. Understood. Next question is just on gross margin. Obviously, it looks like you're going to end the year in the high 40s. Jarrod, I know you've previously referenced a mid- to high-40s kind of medium-term outlook. Does this outperformance that we've seen in the last 2 quarters maybe change your medium-term outlook on how to think about gross margin? Or do you still expect it to remain volatile given that the focus is to continue to gain market share and stretch rate if you need to in certain instances? Any color there would be great. Yes. I think as things stand today, knock on wood, from a raw material perspective, we have captured a lot of savings this year. And so that's been pretty consistent for the last few quarters. We have also maintained our outbound freight number for the last few quarters. Obviously, we know that fuel costs can spike at any point in time. That can cause some pain down the road. So I don't know that I'm ready to call the fuel or the outbound freight line as a lock.
We are pretty comfortable where commodities stand today with what we've seen from a raw material perspective. So I think our raw material costs in kind of Q2 and Q3 should remain steady as we go into 2024. There is still that freight line, though, that could cause some fluctuations. I think the operations team did a fantastic job this year in really cleaning up the scrap and any kind of waste, really have done a great job with the aged inventory, really did a great job really tightening up the cost of raw materials. And they've really managed the freight lanes, especially the last 2 quarters, superbly. So hat's off to those guys for that.
And our goal is to keep it up. Not sure how much more we can squeeze out of where we were going into '24. We'll definitely shoot for it, but there's no guarantees. But we are really in great shape as we're moving into '24. Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Earlier in the Q&A, you commented on the importance of resets as one of the factors to drive continued growth and leverage in the Pepsi relationship. Last quarter, you commented that the conversations were early into 2024, and you talked about a couple of different categories where energy might be sourcing share. I was hoping you could just provide an update on your conversations with key retailers around shelf resets for '24. Yes. Yes, Vivien, and it was -- we're still -- retailers are still defining their sets for next year, but we had probably one of the most successful NACS that the company has had in history. There's a lot of great excitement. I think when you look at what just happened currently this week, when you look at 7-Eleven taking 4 SKUs of our CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line, it just shows you nationwide, chain-wide. Also, if you go to a 7-Eleven right now, you'll see signage in front of every 7-Eleven as well as gas pump activity as well.
So really excited with the way the partnerships are going with our key accounts. We've been -- we have a great key accounts team, best-in-class. We've had early conversations with every one of our major retailers. So we're pretty excited on where we sit heading into the new year on resets. We expect to gain distribution -- expanded distribution in our existing flavors as well as further expanding the new innovation we have in store for 2024.
So the team has been working really hard. We've been working really closely with Pepsi as well to make sure we're going to have really -- this is really heading into our first year of a strategic partnership, really launching our innovation on a nationwide basis versus if you go back last year, keep in mind, we just started with Pepsi late in Q4. Our plans and strategies weren't really aligned with their AOP process. We came in on the very tail end of that, so we're really trying to make up ground all year on the innovative launches.
So we're looking to have strategic prioritization periods within PepsiCo focused within quarters and months. So I think it's going to be really successful. Time will tell. We'll have to wait until probably about March, April to be able to see -- start to see the additional expansion show up in the IRI scan data. But the team feels pretty excited on where we stand, and there's a lot of great excitement. Being the #1 driver of both dollars and units in the category is really impressive to see in a brand like Celsius. Absolutely. Very comprehensive response. Just as a follow-up, 2023 was supposed to be back half weighted in terms of expanding your headcount. Can you just update us on the hiring? Kind of were you guys on plan in the third quarter? Should that accelerate in the fourth quarter? Any incremental detail would be helpful. Yes. We actually -- we have actually our national sales and marketing conferences taking place this week in Miami. We'll have all of our team members are currently -- Jarrod and I are heading down right after our earnings call. And we have about 3 days of great presentation. It's really getting all of our team members excited.
Our plans and budgets for next year is to continue to bring on talented team members, really building out the breadth within our organization, within all departments, within HR, further expansion in finance, logistics, operations, sales, marketing, and really focusing and expanding upon our drill-deep markets as well. I know we've talked about that over the years. And currently, we're focusing on a drill-deep strategy within 23 markets, and we'll be expanding that next year to over 30.
So we're building out our field teams, our sales teams, and we're seeing great results and ROI return when we place these individuals and expand these positions. So that's another thing we're monitoring really closely as well as we're applying assets, making sure we're driving that value and that overall return. So you'll expect us to continue. We are hiring, and we have a lot of job postings up on LinkedIn as well. So we expect that to continue. We're monitoring it closely, though. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Just was wondering if you could unpack some of the margin drivers. You had called out last quarter the sequential dip you were expecting from the higher promotional activity and higher marketing spending. This is EBITDA margins, obviously. But then it went up instead. You touched a little bit on some of the promotional dynamics not coming through quite as you had expected and being a minimal or not a tailwind -- I mean, a headwind. But can you just help us understand some of the other factors in part just to get an idea of what is sustainable and how to think about looking ahead? Yes, I'll let Jarrod dive into some details there. But I think on a higher level, when you look at some of the expanded distribution that we've had, we've expanded into really like foodservice and some other independent locations that just historically, when the cases come through, are somewhat of a lower promotional allowance or cost of doing business in those channels, but we did see some leverage there. And there was also -- we had some timing in the quarter as well.
But I'll throw that over to Jarrod to further provide additional details and answer that question. Yes. So there's, as you said, a handful of things to unpack. I'm going to start from the bottom and work my way up. But I'll start within the kind of well, I guess, the middle of the P&L. So if you look at G&A, we did see some really good leverage there. We benefited from some of that outsized top line growth relative to the spend we have. As we look out into 2024, we -- on a 9-month basis, I believe our G&A is about 7.9%. I think we were pegging roughly 8% for the year. So we did track a little bit better in Q3.
Probably where we land on a full year basis next year, obviously, this year, it will be somewhere in between those 2, but next year would be kind of in between there. Is it going to be in that 7% to 8% range on a full year basis in '24, where we'll see some leverage come through? But good leverage coming through on the G&A line. I think a lot of that is sustainable. There's probably a little bit as we continue to build out our teams that we'll give back as we continue to scale and really try to set our business up.
There's also some international expansion we've been talking about and things like that, where there will be some investment upfront that will drive some costs. And so you won't see the full leverage, but we will see good leverage in the G&A line. On the sales and marketing line, we've been averaging kind of that 19% to 20%. This year, historically, we've probably been in the 22% to 24%. So we've seen a bit of leverage there.
As we look out into next year, we don't think that the competition is going to get any easier. So we will continue to invest into the market and look to continue -- we don't have exact numbers. We do have our budget, but we don't really give out specific numbers along the way, especially since we don't give the sales guidance out. But we would look to continue to invest into the business and really drive the growth of the business, but we have seen some leverage there throughout the year.
If you go up to the gross profit line, we did just talk about that where after Q1, you saw the benefits of really the improvements you've seen in commodities across the board, across both us and our competition. Also, we had rolled off of the international cans, whereas in Q1, we had international cans still on the system. By the time we got to Q2, it was a clean view. And so we've really seen some benefits come through the raw materials.
And also, you've seen really the benefits of the freight lanes that were established. I think we were running about, on a year-to-date basis, 4.9%, whereas last year, it was 5.9%. So we got 100 basis points just out of running better from a freight lane perspective. And actually, if you look to Q3 and Q2, it's been a little bit better than that number. So we've seen kind of benefits on each line along the way really driving that EBITDA margin across the year. That's helpful. Could I just also follow up on the Canada launch? And I know you said it's in the first quarter. Should we expect pipeline fill for that in 4Q? Or would it be a little bit later in the first quarter? I guess the follow-up is really kind of 4Q-minded. Maybe one, is there a Canada impact we should keep in mind? And then maybe any color on how it's looking quarter-to-date that you can give us? Yes. I mean Canada will be, from a build and an impact in '24, it will be kind of inconsequential. We expect good growth. We expect to get in there and start capturing market share. We expect to put forth the investment that's needed to really kind of seed it and grow fast in '24. But it won't be a huge driver of inventory or growth in Q4 or Q1. And the rollout will happen in Q1, but it won't be a 1/1 launch. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. So I kind of wanted to follow up on that, just kind of the international expansion plan. You have Canada in 1Q. I think you mentioned a few other countries. Can you maybe just help us understand how you evaluate the various international opportunities, which markets, timing, et cetera? Are these markets where you're going to be fully aligned with PepsiCo and their partners? Or are there other partners you're considering? And then I guess I would be curious from a profit perspective, as you start to expand further outside of the U.S., how should we think about the impact to margins? Yes. Thank you, Peter. We've talked about this on a variety of other calls in the past as well. I mean we're looking at the largest energy drink markets in the world. So that's -- those are the biggest opportunities we see. When you look at those, you're looking at the U.K., you look at Germany, you look at Japan, Australia. A lot of big opportunities out there, and Pepsi partnerships are really our priority. There will be other markets where we do see other opportunities with other partners, so we can evaluate those as we continue to move forward.
The first market that we're partnering with is in Canada, so the teams are really focused on that. And we have spoken about other markets that we're working on to further roll out into '24 and '25. So I think we're a little bit too early to talk about a lot of those structures. There's a lot involved to make sure you have the right value chain, the right opportunity for exactly what you're talking about, the longevity of profitability as we go forward in these markets.
So we're using Monster international structures and P&Ls as a guideline for us as we look forward to really partnering with our partners and expanding together in these new markets. But that's -- we have a variety of markets we're looking at. But currently, we're rolling out into -- focused on Canada as the biggest opportunity at our hands at the moment. Got it. And then, Jarrod, I apologize, you were kind of running through some of these items a bit quickly. But I think you mentioned there was, call it, a $20 million benefit to 3Q revenue. Can you maybe just run through that again? Like how much was the promotional allowance? Did you build inventory ahead of what you were lapping a year ago? So yes, if you can just unpack that a little bit, I think that would be helpful. Yes, so it was -- if you look at Q1 -- or sorry, Q3 of '22 versus Q3 of '23, we talked about there was a bit of a pipe fill from inventory last year. And then if you look this year, we had a bit of a pipe fill probably somewhere in between that $10 million to $15 million range. And so it wasn't a significant factor in terms of the year-over-year growth percentage from an apples-to-apples perspective. If you looked at Q2 to Q3, it was a benefit from Q2 to Q3 within the revenue figures. So that's the inventory piece.
I mean we're starting to see leverage come through the promo line. So we did see a benefit, and we have updated our estimates around promotional allowance. Just a lot that John mentioned is about the -- we've had significant ACV growth. We've been moving into a lot of, call it, non-tracked channels, but a lot of areas where you don't see promotional activity as deep, and so you start to see that benefit.
And if you look at Monster as an example, historically, you can see where their promo as a percentage of gross revenue or gross dollars improved over time. And so we're starting to see that as well. Now we did invest or add additional incentives in Q3, but the leverage allowed us to more or less have a percentage of revenue or a percentage of gross revenue consistent year-over-year when you're looking at Q3 2022 to Q3 2023. And so that's where that was called out. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. I wanted to ask first about the rollout of foodservice. You mentioned the 2,000 Jersey Mike's, and then I think you mentioned authorizations in over 3,000 Dunkin' Donuts nationwide. What's the timing of that with Dunkin' Donuts? And what are your expectations for further rollout in eateries as you move forward this year and next? Yes, Jon, great question. I think we do see a huge opportunity in foodservice. I think when you look at -- and we've talked about this with Celsius, which is unique, is that consumers really are enjoying Celsius and consuming Celsius outside of that traditional energy drink consumption occasion, which I think is a huge unlock for the brand and the portfolio. When you look at Jersey Mike's, we're really using that and really focused on that as a proof of concept. This is really our first nationwide fast-casual chain, and initial feedback has been positive.
But we're really, really early. I mean you look at it probably only about 4 weeks in, but initially has been fairly excited on the partnership. And we're going to continue to see how that goes. I think that's -- if that's successful, we'll be able to roll that out to other fast-casual restaurants and eateries that Pepsi has access to. And Pepsi has vast access to a large portion of foodservice.
So Dunkin' Donuts was a great addition. Unfortunately, we only have 1 SKU currently that is authorized, and that's our orange flavor, which tastes great and refreshing. I have heard feedback from a variety of new customers to the portfolio that they've actually found Celsius and learned about Celsius because of the distribution gains in Dunkin' Donuts, which was great. So I think the foodservice could be a great way to also bring new consumers into the franchise and the portfolio.
We are in about 3,000 to 4,000 Dunkin' Donuts currently. There's a lot more Dunkin' Donuts to further leverage and grow upon. So it's really that proof of concept and also getting more flavors in. Jersey Mike's, we have about 3 flavors right now, and Dunkin' Donuts is 1. So still in the early phase, but I think when you see the success of our revenue, our PepsiCo revenue, approximately 10% is foodservice, which is universities and hospitals. I think we're all really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Absolutely. You've mentioned ESSENTIALS as a key innovation for 2024. How is that product line differentiated within your portfolio? And is that really a key element of achieving the greater shelf space and facings that you talked about that you expect in '24? Is that going to be more limited to select retailers such as 7-Eleven initially? Yes, it's going to -- the CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line is going to be limited to particular retailers initially. We're really focused on further building out our core portfolio. So that's -- when you look at prioritizations, our prioritization is, number one, our core Vibe offerings, flavor profiles; and then secondary will be our CELSIUS ESSENTIALS that's going after that performance energy segment.
Initial feedback has been extremely positive. And it is designed to be incremental on top of the gains that we're already anticipating we're getting in '24. So -- and we've aligned with our partners on this as well, and feedback has been initially well received. And last one for me. As you think about -- you mentioned kind of the secondary placements. And I think part of that is leveraging your relationship with PepsiCo in terms of coolers, and part of it is your own effort to establish branded cooler locations. Where are you with respect to Celsius coolers this year? I know you had set a target earlier in the year. Are you on track to deliver that? And how much more opportunity is there on that front as you look ahead? Yes, no, Jon, that's a great question and something the teams are extremely focused on, not only within our core team members, but also within the PepsiCo sales organization. So our cooler initiative and program is part of our perfect stores strategy. So that's a way we KPI the team as well. So you're going to get warm placement, cold placement, secondary placement and could include an end cap and then most -- and then also cold placement upfront as well as the perfect store has a Celsius-branded cooler.
So our goal was approximately around 15,000 to be placed this year. We're working towards that. We'll see if we're going to be able to achieve it. We only have a few months left. The coolers -- our biggest win we're working on now is gaining chain-wide national authorization in front checkout coolers at major retailers, where we can really close 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 store locations.
As an example, we just entered Publix stores with expanded distribution in the front end cap -- front checkout coolers. So that was a big win. Although not a Celsius-branded cooler, we do have great placement in those checkouts, and that's going to allow us to continue to increase our availability, increase trial and take advantage of those impulse purchases that we know Celsius can capitalize on. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley. First, a quick housekeeping question. I know you talked about selling and marketing expense as a percentage of sales being up in the fourth quarter. What about promotional allowances? Are you guys in the short term looking for any material changes in promo allowances versus where you were in the third quarter post the adjustment that you made? And then I'll have a bigger-picture question. Yes. For the promos, I'd look more to the year-to-date percentage as we look to Q4. But John, do you want to jump on the sales and marketing or you want me to jump on that one? Yes, go ahead. Yes. So sales and marketing, obviously, it's a little trickier in October, November, December. You've got Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, so you have to come up with a little bit different incentives and different programs. So we're working those through the system. And then, obviously, we're looking to hit the ground running with a number of the sponsorships that we picked up that we press released over the last 6 months.
So we are looking to continue to spend into the holiday season. We found it to be very successful last year when we spent into the holiday season. Part of that was also because our ACV went from a 65 to a 90 pretty quickly. We've been sitting at that 90 all year. So the goal is to really help build those velocities as we work our way into 2024 from a sales and marketing perspective. And especially also leaning into by our reset window. So... Great. And that sort of leads into my next question, which is on velocities. I think one of the big positive surprises over the past year, certainly the past 6 to 9 months, has been the acceleration in velocities as you've rapidly expanded distribution. How are you thinking about the scope for velocity growth over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months?
On the one hand, some new distribution you're adding maybe a little bit less productive, but you are -- seem to be getting some billboard effect and some broader awareness. So big picture, how are you thinking about potential for velocity over the coming year or 2? Yes. I think, Eric, when you look at it, that's something that we're really focused on. And it's going to come from a variety of different areas in order to continue to drive forward. We are entering uncharted territories at north of a 10% share, which hasn't been achieved in the energy category in over a decade. But when you look at some of the great -- what has taken place over the last 9 months this year, it's just really a great achievement to the team and our partners.
I think one exciting news piece we just got recently is from Numerator and the way we're tracking household penetration, and our household penetration more than doubled. So we were right around a 25% household penetration versus an 11.1% in the year-ago period when we tracked it last time per Numerator. And we were -- Celsius was the #1 growth brand in all of sports and energy.
So we're getting some really good traction there. The teams have been doing really great on leveraging our marketing strategies. I think there's a lot of opportunity to further drive ROI out of our marketing programs within our sales programs as well. So where velocities go from here, that's really somewhat an unknown, but we're working to continue to drive that forward.
I think on the resets coming in, when you look at the expansion that we anticipate getting additional shelf space, that's going to allow us to have better presence. That's going to further build out that billboard effect to be able to engage with the shopper at the point of purchase, which is super critical. So time will tell. I guess we'll find out as we continue to evolve quarter-over-quarter on future calls. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to follow up on the foodservice piece because it seems like that would be an end market that would traditionally be for kind of carbonated soft drinks or teas. Do you have a sense for -- are those consumers in foodservice switching from drinking a Pepsi to drinking a Celsius or drinking a tea to a Celsius? And if that's the case, are you able to track that into switches from soft drinks or tea at retail as well? Jim, that's the great question. That's a huge unlock that we're working on. I think we need a little bit more data coming in as we expand into foodservice. What we're seeing with the Celsius consumer, what I think is fascinating, we saw this in convenience and we see this where our consumer is, number one, we're incremental to the category. And also our consumer, we've seen them have a bigger basket ring, i.e. purchasing Celsius with a water or a food item or a snack, which I think is another competitive advantage when looking at the Celsius consumer.
Within foodservice, we have a hypothesis that our consumer is actually getting water or not getting a beverage because they're ordering on potentially Delivery Dudes or another platform where they're not getting the fountain drink. So we're not competing with the fountain. But we need more data on that. What we do see is within some of the apps that initial feedback has been on our set is that we are being incremental to these eateries and fast-casual restaurants within the beverage purchase. Great. That's helpful color. And you might have already kind of addressed this, just saying it's still early days. But just thinking about the implications that, that has moving forward, do you think there's a possibility that if you do see those tea or carbonated soft drink consumers buying Celsius, but not participating in other energy buys, that you could find yourself outside of the energy category in retail and really be placed kind of throughout the store unlike some of the other traditional energy drinks? We're seeing that now in certain locations within our given stores like Ralphs. They're placing us where you have grab-and-go. I know -- and several Publixes and Krogers were placed in -- we have secondary placements in the grab-and-go section, so where people are getting food and grabbing food items. So I think that's a huge opportunity for us. I know I see tons of people, we have a cafeteria or a small eatery right next to our office, and you see people having sandwiches and bowls, and they sell a lot of Celsius there.
So I think there's a huge opportunity and unlock as we grow forward. Just that Celsius plays outside of traditional energy, and that opens up a bigger TAM opportunity. Also when you look at the -- some of the latest data points coming out and you look at total beverage brands, Celsius just made it into the top 10 within total beverages within the LRB, which is liquid refreshing beverages in the overall category, which is another great achievement that the portfolio has been able to achieve in the third quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Just wanted to touch on sort of the fact that you've got ongoing distribution and elevation and SKU expansion. And I guess, how are you thinking about seasonality for Q4 this year, keeping in mind the comparison to the Pepsi launch last year? Thanks, Jeff. When you look at seasonality, it is something in the category that has happened. We started -- we saw that last year. There is going to be some seasonality. We should all anticipate some seasonality within the quarter. And what that looks like as we go into -- finalize the quarter, we need to evaluate that.
But also, you have another -- we've talked about it earlier, a potential inventory -- reduction of inventory within our Pepsi partner, which is our main supplier at this point. So in addition to that and the seasonality, we anticipate some type of pullback in the fourth quarter just with traditional seasonality levels. Okay, that's helpful. And then aside from the ESSENTIALS line, is there other substantial innovation you have planned for 2024? Or is the main innovation engine ESSENTIALS for '24? Or maybe if you could just touch on further innovation plans for '24. Yes, absolutely. Innovation for '24, we have been working really hard. The team has been working really hard. We're going to continue to build out our portfolios between our core fruit [ 4 ] flavor offerings. We have some new great flavors coming in. We'll announce those shortly. We have new Vibe flavors coming out where we're going -- due to the success, this Cosmic Vibe, we're going to continue with that theme through a trilogy. So we'll have some great flavors on that.
I did talk about on the call our CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line, our 16-ounce line, really going after that performance energy category. And then a great opportunity we have, and it's something we don't really talk about too much, is our powders and on-the-go and really going beyond the bottle or beyond the can. We think that's a great opportunity. We have been getting a lot of interest -- further interest from retailers on that portfolio, and we will be bringing out our Vibe flavors into our powder product offerings into '24.
So we'll see further expansion with all of our portfolios. And the team is really excited. We've got some great flavors, and I know you'll enjoy them, Jeff, as you've always been a big fan. So -- but we're excited where we stand. Can't wait to try them. That is all the time we have for today. I'd like to hand the call back to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you, Doug. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support and interest. Our results demonstrates our products are gaining considerable momentum and capitalizing on today's global health and wellness trends, expanding the energy category and driving growth in both dollars and units.
I'd like to take this time to thank our investors for their continued support and confidence in our team. The company will be attending several upcoming investor conferences throughout the month of November and December, including Stephens, Jefferies, Morgan Stanley, ROTH Capital Investor Conferences. We look forward to seeing many of you there.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Paul Wiseman, Investors Relations for Celsius. Thank you may begin. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer. The call will open to questions following the prepared remarks.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Also welcome to Paul Wiseman, who recently joined Celsius as our Senior Vice President of Communications. Celsius is a stellar 2023 fourth quarter, the best earnings year in our company's history. We have achieved nearly complete distribution coverage in the United States, topping 98% ACV was a major achievement. Putting our products in reach of more consumers and more consumption occasions with greater flavors and size options than ever before. In 2023, Celsius set a new yearly revenue record, growing more than 110% or $664 million in sales to finish the year at just over $1.3 billion. Celsius is now truly a $1 billion brand.
Our impressive share gains in 2023 have resulted in Celsius becoming the first company to break the [ Tanger ] barrier in more than a decade. According to [ Cercana ], IRI's recent 4-week read ending February 11, 2024 in total energy U.S. Celsius held a new record of [ 11.5 ] share nationwide and MULOC. The energy drink category is now a 3-team race.
As of January 2024, Celsius had exceeded a 15 share in over a dozen U.S. markets. A few of those, we are within just a few points of our next closest competitor or have already taken them. Our strong innovation pipeline continues to delight consumers whose taste for zero sugar energy drinks has nearly tripled the overall category sales to a zero sugar majority. Although this year, we have launched 2 new core SKUs, Sparkling, Raspberry Peach and Fizz Free Blue Raspberry Lemonade. In addition, 2 new Celsius flavors, Astro Vibe and Galaxy Vibe, which has taken our Space Odyssey, [ Truly G ] even further with the launch of our Cosmic Vibe in 2023 in Circle K.
Celsius also launched Celsius Essential's product line, which has proven essential performance energy with essential Aminos. We are executing our plans to grow the business internationally, taking a methodical approach in each new market we enter. We're very pleased with our sales in Canada after 2 months in the country, consumer enthusiasm and acceptance has exceeded our expectations. We're pursuing disciplined growth in our best-in-class sales and marketing organizations. And just 2 weeks Celsius was recognized with the 7-Eleven's prestigious 2023 Supplier of the Year award in the nonalcoholic category. This is a tremendous achievement, and I want to thank all our dedicated team members on achieving this great top industry award. Best-in-class teams drive best-in-class results.
With nearly full distribution, we are focusing on driving growth through 3 areas: increasing total distribution points at each location, growing in nontracked channels and international expansion over the long-term horizon. Celsius was again the top driver of the energy category in dollars and units sold in MULOC, ending in the fourth quarter, up 126.6% and up 140.2% and for the full year of 2023, supporting a 30.6% of all the energy category growth for the year.
Already this year, we've launched several new and exciting innovations as well as a brand update to our line of Fizz Free beverages, which have a strong and loyal consumer base. A new Fizz Free [ multipack ] is available now in Target stores brings together refreshing selection to our consumers who prefer the noncarbonated energy drinks.
Sales of Celsius Essentials, our new line of performing [ to maintain ] Energy, a 16-ounce beverage products launched in the fourth quarter at 7-Eleven stores across the United States and our 2 new flavors, sparkling, Mango Tango and Sparkling Fruit Burst bring the Celsius Essential line to 6 unique SKUs. As of January 2024, Celsius Essentials has achieved a record 40% AC year-to-date, February 18th, it's at 49% ACV, continuing to see greater acceptance across retailers across the country.
Also in January, our Celsius on the grow [ power station ] claimed the position in the energy powder category according to [ Sircana's ] IRI commanding a 23.1 share, having increased 5.6% compared to the prior period. We have several new on-the-go powder innovations plan for this year and see great opportunities with our [ Versal ] on-the-go product line.
In 2024, spring resets began in January and typically run through May. We are very pleased with the incremental space we're gaining, which will be reflected across the first and second quarters of 2024. As a reminder, planograms used for most of 2023 when our dollar sales grew 140% were created while we were holding and held approximately 4.5 share in the category. For 2024, shelf space planning was conducted with retail partners in Q3 of 2023 when we held a digital -- double-digit share position. Celsius is also now fully integrated into PepsiCo annual planning cycle, and we anticipate ongoing close collaboration with our primary North American distribution partner and expanded key account.
Our perfect store resulted in a 60% increase in display activity across the United States, and we placed more than over 10,000 Celsius branded coolers in 2023. And an increase of over 300% year-over-year. We intend to continue growing our base of branded coolers throughout this year. Non-tracked channels continue to be a tailwind for us as well. Club sales fourth quarter were $77.1 million, up 64% year-over-year. Club sales for the full year 2023 were $254.6 million, representing an $80.6 million increase year-over-year.
We achieved the #1 energy position on Amazon in 2023, finishing the full year revenue at $101 million, a 72.9% increase year-over-year. Our refreshing great taste in product -- on a for the meal occasion, and today, more than 12.5% of our PepsiCo sales is to the foodservice channel. For example, in 2023, we gained distribution in over 2,000 Jersey Mike stores and are authorized to sell in more than 3,000 Dunkin' Donut locations nationwide. We believe there is incremental growth opportunities for Celsius and nontracked outlets, such as vending, hospitals, corporate cafeterias and college campuses and more.
Turning to international. We began distribution in sales in Canada through Pepsi in mid-January. As we had previously signaled, after approximately 1 month of sales, we are very impressed with the results and even more so to delight our Canadian consumers who have embraced our products.
International sales reached $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $54.7 million for the full year. Also in January, we announced a sales and distribution agreement with Suntory Beverage for Great Britain and Ireland, we expect sales in the United Kingdom to begin gradually starting in the Finnish channel in the second quarter. We expect additional international expansion this year. And as previously stated, we're taking a methodical approach to our international growth, and we will be following our international growth playbook in each new market we enter.
Before I hand it over to Jarrod to discuss financial highlights for the quarter and the full year, we have several exciting marketing developments and achievements to be proud of. As recently announced a renewed multiyear global team sponsorship with Formula One's iconic Ferrari racing team. Major League soccer kicked off its regular season last week, and Celsius is a proud league partner as well as key sponsor of multiple teams and players across the United States and Canada. These strategic investments placed our premium brand in the forefront of consumers who share our passion to live fit.
With that, I'll pass it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our fourth quarter and 2023 full year financial results. Jarrod? Thanks, John. We had another great quarter in which we continue to exceed both internal and external expectations. Not only are we continuing to benefit from Pepsi's distribution system, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays and increased improvement within velocities. As we look to Q1 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our growth.
Turning to our fourth core financial highlights. Revenue for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $347 million an increase of 95% from $178 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Driven by our North American business, where fourth quarter revenues were $333 million, an increase of 97% from the same period in 2022. International revenue was 68% to $15 million as velocity continue to increase. As it relates to days on hand with our primary distributor, our inventory turns relative to depletion in consistent with our Q3 2023 turnover.
We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter compared to 2022 to several key drivers, including successful integration into the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in broader availability, increased SKU mix, improved placement. We're also benefiting from robust expansion in our traditional distribution channels [ and club sales ] with SKU increases in placement improvements contributing significantly. Moreover, our products are now found in several new channels within CNG and food service.
Gross profit for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 110% to $166 million, up from $79 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 44% for the prior year fourth quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to efficiencies in raw material sourcing product-based reduction and benefits from improved leverage across promotional allowances. Q4 was the fifth consecutive quarter that we were operating within the Pepsi distribution system, and we expect to continue driving efficiencies while maintaining our #1 goal of keeping the shelf stock to meet strong consumer demand.
Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were approximately $80 million, a decrease of approximately 11% into the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to prior year costs associated with the termination of legacy distributors as part of the transition to the Pepsi network. We continue to invest behind our growth in Q4, incurring sales and marketing costs in line with our [ gross ] rates. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing were 23% compared to 29% prior year adjusted for distributor termination expenses in 2022. We plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing and plan a similar spend as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2024.
General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $27 million, an increase of 24% relative to Q4 2022. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 8% compared to 12% in the prior year as we continue to leverage our G&A against our significant growth. And looking back at prior periods, even with historical growth rates, we do tend to see some seasonality within the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We saw similar activities in the fourth quarter, whereby we are not able to capitalize on our sales and marketing teams as it relates to displays on hand and other promotional activities that we are able to take advantage of during the summer selling season. Even with this, we ended the year strong and have [ well exceeded ] the 10 share marker as noted by John earlier in the call.
Looking at the full year 2023. As you will see in the 10-K issued this morning, we made great in p our relation effors ] around our internal control environment. We were successful in mediating the prior period controls associated with IT general controls as well as creating and delivering a much more robust Costco environment. Although we made huge strides in 2023, there are still a handful of areas where components of larger areas of the control environment needs some additional time to fully remediate.
With that said, I'd like to thank the entire Celsius team for the great effort and in particular, our finance and IT teams for their focus and dedication to this matter in 2023. I look forward to our continued progress in 2024.
Now to the results. Revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $1.3 billion an increase of 102% from $654 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, driven by our North American business. North America full year 2023 revenues were $1.27 billion, an increase of 105% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 52% to $55 million in 2023 relative to full year 2022.
Gross profit for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, increased [ 134% ] to $633 million, up from $271 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margin in the full year of 2023 were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 41% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower package and raw material costs. As things stand today, we would expect '24 gross profit margins to be fairly consistent with the Q4 and full year margin profile, confident in maintaining the great progress that was made in 2023. We are always shooting for the moon but with the uncertainty around the macro environment from both an operational and promotional perspective, we believe that it is prudent to give ourselves some additional time into 2024.
As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 20% in the 12 months of 2023 compared to 24% in the prior year same period, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. This demonstrated the leverage that we can contain within our sales and marketing costs. We made great progress in 2023, but we are now moving to the next level and the next target beyond 10% market share. And to do that, we will need to continue to invest in our growth and our brand, as seen with the multiple Super Bowl activations that we did in February, our recently announced multiyear partnership with Ferrari within Formula One as well as our multiyear MLS partnership.
G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the 12 months of 2023 versus 12% in the prior year same period. We will continue to invest in our back shop and build out a team that is value-added to operations, sales and marketing programs. There will be opportunity to further leverage G&A in 2024 and beyond, but it will be at a thoughtful and methodical pace.
Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash in excess of $755 million and net working capital in excess of $928 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled in excess of $140 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, which compares to $108 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. We will continue to invest in our business. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Two questions for me. One, just on gross margin, maybe talk a little bit about why it stepped back in 4Q relative to 3Q, even after adjusting for the promotional allowance accrual last quarter, meaning I would have expected to see a little bit better. Was there some sort of one-offs in that number? And how do we think about progression of that into '24?
And then the second question, I appreciate the commentary on inventories from a standpoint with your largest customer. But if I take a look at what the sales look like in the scanner data track channels in addition to what you disclosed in the regulatory filings on Amazon and Costco sales, I still get a fairly big disconnect between what it looks like you should have sold in the quarter and what you actually did, meaning that you undershipped somewhere in the channel. So maybe you could help with that, too. Yes. Thank you, Mark. I'll join in on the first part of the question, and I'll throw it over to Jarrod as well. I think when you look at the overall margins, I think we're really pleased with the margins, especially for the full year up 660 basis points. just a phenomenal job on behalf of the team on supply chain and our key accounts team. We're maintaining a pricing promotional architecture within the category.
When you look at the, really the fourth quarter, we did launch a new line, our Celsius Essentials line, which is a 16-ounce line, and we had a variety of innovation launches that were executed during the quarter. So I think we're pretty pleased with where the margins came in, and there's opportunities to improve going forward. But at this point in time, I think that's a -- team did a really good job for the year.
And in regards to inventory by channel, we did have some seasonal impact in Q4 that we did experience. We did have good results on Amazon and within the club channel, but we did see especially impacted mainly in food and really large format. A lot of our volume, we've done a great job on half of our distribution partner as well, really keeping the amount of cases on display up. We're still gaining -- we hope to gain additional placements and additional expansion in the upcoming sets that are being reset. But we do really, heavily, especially in large format on display activity. And when you look at the fourth quarter, we do see a lot of display activity coming from seasonal items that we're competing with outside of the summer or the rest of the year. So there are some headwinds we experienced in the fourth quarter, but I'll throw it over to Jarrod for any additional highlights. Now you're right, John. It's -- when we're looking at kind of just more of a days-on-hand perspective with our largest distributor, we did have the innovations that we filled the pipe with that would offset. I would say maybe some reductions you're talking about, Mark. But on a net-net basis, the days on hand in total for us was in good shape. And to John's point, the Q4 tends to be a little bit of a stress because of the inventory on hand across our retail customers and our mass and grocery customers. Got it. Maybe just 1 follow-up then. If we think about the innovation in your comments you just made about the net-net kind of equaling out, it sounds like you're saying that the innovation offset the legacy products. Is that the case as you think about the shelf resets and incremental distribution, meaning it can't be a 1:1, so you're going to add more space. So why wouldn't the Pepsi system take more of the products, meaning taking innovation plus the legacy because you've got to backfill the legacy sales? Yes. I think when we looked at our #1 customer, we look at their inventory levels, they're fairly consistent with Q3 to Q4. So even though we did take some innovation on. So it's, I think if we look at the scan data, we had really strong scan data in the fourth quarter, and it's -- we'll see how this continues to evolve. Yes, it's a good question, Mark. I think, we can just tell you where we were as of 12/31 and on a net-net basis, in total, our days on hand were consistent and in good shape and as we got to January, we started rolling out all of the innovation that you can see all across the U.S., and it's been very successful and being very good and it has been incremental thus far. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. So I was hoping to get some perspective on how you're thinking about the market share trajectory from here. Obviously, things sort of leveled out towards the latter portion of '23, but we've actually seen some nice improvement to start the year. Maybe just to start, is the improvement we've seen year-to-date, largely a function of kind of that innovation you touched on rather than shelf resets. And then I guess with more resets to come, how would you think investors should think about the share trajectory as you look at to March into the spring. John, you mentioned that you've now surpassed 10%. You're now focusing on a new target. So just any color on what that new target might be from a share perspective. Yes. No. Thank you, Peter. We're not going to give any forward guidance on the future share, but we do look at the current trajectories and where we are currently at within different category -- within a variety of segments and the categories. And you mentioned Amazon. We disclosed Amazon. We're close to a 20 share within the energy category on Amazon. And then -- if you also look at -- I mentioned in my script, we have 12 key markets that we're tracking ahead of 15 share within the category in that MULOC data. So there is a good trajectory there.
I think the biggest opportunity for us when you look at it is really in convenience. And we've built this brand going through the variety of channels. And the last opportunity is in convenience, where you about 56% 57% of all sales are sold. So that's where we anticipate the biggest resets to take place in the coming resets right now in the convenience channel. We are just at a 10 share. So we're really excited about the opportunities you have there versus if you just look at the food category, we're around a 16 share within the energy category.
So those are some recent data points that we have that we've shared within the script as well as in the earnings release. And we've talked before, we're somewhere between the average, as Jarrod mentioned, we're about we closed at about a 10 share, and we're on close to a 20 share within Amazon. So we're working hard. The team is working hard and we're executing, and that doesn't include the new 16-ounce Essentials line, which is just getting started this year, which we're excited about. No, that's really helpful. And then I guess just 1 follow-up just on international. Can you maybe help us understand how we should think about the contribution from a revenue perspective. Are you exploring any additional markets for this year? Or would anything else kind of be more of a '25 narrative? And then just within that, I'm sure a lot of people and you've gotten this question a lot, but just, maybe explain why Suntory was the distributor of choice for the U.K. and Ireland? Yes. Thank you, Peter. I think number one, when we look at international expansion, we just went into Canada. We talked about that into -- on the script. We're really excited on the consumer acceptance. We're also excited about the -- we're in 7-Eleven in Couche-Tard. It's product is doing really well, and we're expanding. So our partner is excited. Canada should be a big market. U.K., did announce Suntory for our partner there. They -- we're looking for the best partners to align with on our go-to-market strategy. One thing that was very attractive about Suntory is their access to the gym community.
And we're really focused on a methodical approach as we expand and grow, really about building awareness, trial, that foundational base of loyalty and then scaling. So as we look to see the size and the timing and sequencing of international, I think that's -- we'll know that as we go through these markets and expand in these markets, and how quickly we are accepted, we can move as fast as we can. But we want to be very cognizant on entering new markets through a methodical approach about building that loyal foundation before we go and overall scale. So those are the comments there in regards, and we're really excited about our partner with Suntory. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You touched on unmeasured channels as one of your big opportunities and gave some examples, [ Corporate Capita University ] pending. There's lots of physical distribution points under all that. And I just would love to get a sense of how we should think about how quickly -- how close the [ handhole ] are, how quickly those could ramp up, kind of what the trajectory might look like for momentum in those areas? Yes. I think everyone is really excited about how when you look at our PepsiCo revenues, over 12% is coming from really the food service. Internally here, we think there's a big opportunity there. We see that sells is much broader opportunity when you look at the [ TAM ] say, traditional energy, we're seeing consumers, consumer consumption increase outside of that energy need state. We're seeing the product being paired with sandwiches and smoothies and bowls and a variety of opportunities for fast casual. So I think it's a little bit too early for us to really know how big that opportunity is. We have a -- we'll probably know we're in the next 12 to 24 months as we further expand some additional quick service as well as expand in additional food service accounts and then universities and [ is as ] well is a huge opportunity for us. Not able to quantify that at this time, but we do see it as an opportunity. Okay. And just on the Canada, U.K. and launches. As we think about margins for 2024, obviously, you'd spend ahead of really ramping those revenues. And so all else equal, should we expect a dip in EBITDA margins for -- or EBITDA for 2024 versus 2023? Or can you just give us a sense of how to think about the spending or what's in your plans for how that looks? Yes. I'll turn that over to Jarrod for additional comments. Yes. So they're going to be a little different. Canada where most of the population is, I think, within 80 miles of the U.S. border and also being so close. We actually already had a co-packer in Canada that we were using as a backup for our U.S. business. So that rollout and that growth, we think, will be at a different trajectory than the U.K., which we're kind of launching from 0. So there will be investment in both markets as we build brand awareness and as we really build out the system. We won't have the same scale and leverage advantages within the manufacturing as we do in the U.S. So there is going to be some costs and some investment there. But it will be, let's call it, it's not going to be a significant component of either our growth or our cost infrastructure this year. So we do believe that the numbers that we discussed on our prepared remarks, we'll be able to help those investments as well. Yes. And I'll just -- in regards to -- when you look at it, Michael, one thing we've noticed is the brand awareness, even though we're not in the U.K., there is underlying brand awareness just associated with the world is really [ surmount ] a one click away. So a lot of our influencers and social media activations are actually being picked up with our potential consumers in the U.K. So we had a little bit -- we have more brand awareness than we actually had initially anticipated based on our research. So we're excited, things going to be a great market for us. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Great. Just 1 on gross margin. Another quarter in the high 40s here. But in the energy category, you've already had a larger competitor take a rate increase. There's sentiment that your larger competitor will ultimately follow suit. So when the event this happens, how do you think about managing your price gaps relative to peers. I guess, just curious on your thoughts around a potential rate increase this year as that would obviously imply upside to your high 40s margin target? Any color there would be great. Yes. Thank you, Gerald, there's opportunities. We want to be a premium-priced product. I think if you look at it per ounce basis, we feel we're very competitively priced. There's a variety of different levers than just taking frontline pricing. So we have our pricing promotional strategy that we realize as well. We just -- we're launching a new line extension as well with our Celsius Essential 16-ounce. And then you also -- you have your pricing architecture by channel as well also in pack size.
So there's ways to navigate that. I think we're very pleased with the way we finished the year with margins and we're really focused on driving share and revenue growth and continue to drive consumer consumption and ultimately, that daily consumption we're looking for. And we're just really getting started here when you look at just now a 10 share in the energy category in convenience. So there's a long runway ahead. But it's something we watch closely, at this point, we're not going to make any comments on future price increases at this time. Understood. Just one more for me. I think your nonmeasured channel revenue came in a little better than expected, specifically related to Amazon at least what we were modeling for with a lower seasonal quarter, your 4Q absolute revenue is almost in line with your second quarter, which obviously benefited from Prime Day. So any incremental color on the drivers in the quarter within that channel would be helpful if you could provide any. Yes. I mean Amazon, we had a great -- in the quarter, it was a great period. And there is a lot of timing as well within shipments and how the Amazon kind of controls or fee inventory through their warehouses based on their algorithms. So we're going to keep shipping them. We're going to -- we're #1 energy drink right now, roughly about a 20 share in the energy category. I don't really have much color than that, but continue to drive further revenue through that channel. It is an omnichannel world, and that's something we really focus here at Celsius. We want to deliver Celsius to consumers when they want it, how they want it. I think it does show too, that there is still opportunity for continued growth within the Amazon channel. So it's not necessarily slowing down suddenly just because we get to a certain spot within that. So I do see that as a continued growth opportunity for us as we look out into 2024. Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with Roth Capital Partners. A couple of quick ones here. On the sales and marketing give some good color on what we expect in the first quarter. And I think that rate of 23% is a little higher than you had talked about for some periods in the past. Is that a good number to use for the full year of '24? I think you referred to Q1 and Q4 in my prepared remarks. And if you look at our Q1 activations and activity, we've got the Super Bowl activations we did that we believe were very successful. We've actually got a Jake Paul fight this weekend down in Puerto Rico with another number of [ interest ] that we support. We kicked off the MLS last week or a couple of weeks ago, we kicked off the F1 partnership. So we've got a number of things that are really rolling in Q1 to keep the mind in going.
As we look at a full year basis, historically, we've been the 22% to 24% range. We were at 20% on a year-to-date basis in 2023. I think those are kind of the data points to stick to. If we've got opportunity to invest ahead of growth, we're going to continue to invest it. We're going to spend our money wisely. John and I require an ROI on everything we do. So we're not going there foolishly. But if we see opportunity to push growth, we'll push growth, if we don't see it, we'll continue to lever. Okay. And then on the Essentials line, could you give us, I mean, that's pretty rapid acceleration of ACV. Where do you think that goes? And basically, more generally, what is the plan for additional SKUs and additional outlets for that line. I'm seeing it in its own cooler or a separate cooler in some stores. Do you think this can double that? Can you get to 80% plus ACV by the end of the year? That's -- well, we've never launched a new line with our new distribution partner, PepsiCo. So I think we have a lot to learn. We are working hard. We think it can definitely be incremental. There is a lot of opportunity in there. That 16-ounce Celsius Essentials has been really well recepted by consumers. What's great. It's not cannibalizing existing sales. So we are bringing in additional new consumers and converting new consumers into the Celsius portfolio. So that has us really excited. It's not -- we're not trading our existing consumers. So the initial data.
It's still early. When you look at it, you're only talking like 8 weeks, 12 weeks of data we have at best in certain stores. So we really need to get a little bit more data underneath our belt as we move into -- get through Q1 and most importantly, see what these resets bring that are coming out. So I think this summer, we'll have a better read on how this portfolio is going to perform the Celsius Central line within our overall global portfolio. Yes. It's a great product. You should get out and taste it, if you haven't yet. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley. Great. So could you give a little bit more granularity as to what drove the step-up in [ pet ] revenue through the foodservice channel. I think it had been running at 10%, now it's at 12.5%. I think [ Jersey ] makes and Dunkin' are still very early days, and I'm not sure if those go through Pepsi, so maybe you could clarify that. But what specific channels are you seeing traction in foodservice through Pepsi?
And then a broader question, in terms of the new SKUs that you're adding, particularly on the Vibes and the core flavors, what are you seeing in terms of incrementality there? How are the sort of legacy flavors and by legacy core and Vibes flavors performing as you're introducing these new SKUs? And then sort of what do you see as the limit for SKU count or labor variety here, you're still a long way from Monster and Red Bull? I'll start with the foodservice one. John can have the -- all the other ones. So foodservice, I look at that as just continued momentum. I mean, if you look at our club program, once we start launching with them, we've got good progress, good momentum, but then you really see the volumes and velocity is growing. We're seeing the same thing across foodservice. We also had the college program fully in place in Q4. So as we talked about last quarter over the summer season, it tends to die down a bit to the college campus is empty out. We're also seeing great progress in the other channels within foodservice that we're in. You mentioned, Mike, you mentioned Dunkin', there's also hospitals. There's a variety of other food establishments. And so we're just continuing to see ongoing momentum across that channel, and we're really seeing that grow and be built out. And our distributor has really been helping significantly with that. So continued momentum, and we're doing great there. But let me throw the other ones over to John. Yes. And just a further detail on that. I think we're also seeing great momentum. And you talked about the step up and Jarrod, you mentioned college universities as a big opportunity and seeing growth there. But also vending. Keep in mind, vending is also going through that foodservice and the vending, we've expanded in vending. We're seeing great results in vending.
And at-work micro markets, we talked about those prior on several calls prior. The at-work micro-market opportunity is really good. I mean you see a lot of opportunities at work locations. So you're seeing the product continuing to scale. And I agree with you, Eric. I think seeing that go from 10% to 12%, just shows you the growth opportunity we have on an overall basis and this nontracked channel opportunity.
Looking at new SKUs, the Vibe line, we're excited about the Vibe line talk about the success we had, I mentioned on the comments on the call earlier that Cosmic, we launched at Circle K and really going intergalactic with the theme of Space -- the Space Odyssey with our 2 new Vibe flavors to have a Space team. We're really excited on rolling that out. We're going to have some events coming up at [ Couch-Tard ] and a variety of neat things to -- that you, guys, will be able to see.
The Vibe line is going to be in separate line to bring out innovative flavors and experiences with every sip. And then our core flavors, the team continues to come out with great flavors. I mean, you look at core, even expanding the core into our no Fizz line as well, where there's Blue [ rater ] Lemonade that we launched at 7-Eleven in Q1 has been phenomenal. I mean the product tastes great and really expands this non-Fizz or non-carb opportunity that could be in wholly another revenue stream and ultimately an extension of our portfolio as well.
So we're monitoring the SKUs. Obviously, you need to do SKU rationalization. So that's something we talk internally at innovation meetings. We'll be doing that each year. We'll cut our, as I call it, our tail or slow-moving SKUs. But we do see consumers looking for new innovation and staying within our portfolio, which is great. So our new Sparkling Peach, Raspberry Peach is phenomenal, great flavor. Eric, try it, please go out and try it. I think you'll enjoy as much as we do. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the coolers because I have been in Cleveland, Ohio, and I was very surprised to see a Celsius branded cooler very prominently displayed the cash wrap of the local grocer here. And so can you just talk about kind of the channel strategy there? How you want to get those coolers placed? And maybe as a part 2 to that question, just any color you can offer on incremental uplift, velocity, repeat rates, trial buys in locations that do have the branded fridges? Yes. Jim, it's a big, big initiative we've had over the years trying to get more placement. If you've been tracking the company over the years, we've been historically sold warm. So we had to build a loyal consumer that would actually have to take the product home and chill it and then drink of the daily lifestyle and routine. And that really goes to the loyalty around the Celsius consumer.
Cold availability is key to the success in order to compete in the energy category, especially with the impulse purchases. That is the biggest opportunity for us, kind of mentioning it prior to the question, when we look at the convenience channel, that impulse purchase is key to the success of where we want to go and who we want to be in the category. So we have -- we placed about 10,000 cool. We are investing in more coolers. We're working on placing more cores. We want to be right at checkout. Eye-level is critical. We're talking to a variety of retailers as well, gain additional checkout coolers. So I think that's a big opportunity. Most recent in South Florida. If you look at publics, we've gained checkout coolers, and we're looking to gain additional checkout coolers on the next reset.
So that's a big opportunity. We do see uplift. If you buy to the register and you're cold, kind of the saying we say internally here, if it's cold, it's sold. So the other thing is stacking high and watch it fly. Some comments we make around displays. But definitely a lift, the exact lift is hard to say because each channel and each store in each region is quite different on the velocity levels, but there is a substantial lift. Okay. Great. And maybe one follow-up on that. Are all of the actual use in the cooler consistent across the portfolio. Or do you guys make changes on that based on channel, local geography? Like could lease a [ central ] lines in there were somebody other product innovations show up in the coolers? Yes. That's a great question. So we do have planograms and progressions we work on based on the size of the cooler. There is a little bit of regional seasonality that based on a retailer, we do exclusive flavors. So like at Circle K, we did -- we did our Cosmic vibe. I talked about 7-Eleven, the new launch with the Raspberry Lemonade Fizz Free. So you will see potentially unique flavors and given coolers, but we do have a standard national planogram that's being followed, probably not always followed to the tea, but that is something we work on as an overall organization and work with our PepsiCo partners to keep the progressions in the coolers in accordance to our planogram.
So the core should be have its own planogram, the Vibe should have a planogram and also our Fizz Free line should have a planogram as well as our Celsius Essentials 16-ounce. So that's kind of how our go-to-market strategy. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand it back to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'd like to thank and close by thanking all of our employees.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Celsius Holdings, Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to hand over the conference call to Paul Wiseman. You may now begin. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;  Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer; and Toby David, Chief of Staff.
The call will open to questions following the prepared remarks. The company released its first quarter earnings press release earlier this morning, and all materials are available on the company's website, celsiusholdingsinc.com, as well as on the SEC's website, sec.gov. As a reminder, an audio replay of this call will be available later today and can be accessed with the same live webcast link used to join today's call.
Please be aware that this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management at this time. These statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. Except to the extent as required by law, Celsius Holdings undertakes no obligations and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.
Additionally, management will share operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures that we use, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of these measures to our results as reported in accordance with GAAP are detailed in our earnings release for the first quarter of 2024.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This morning, Celsius reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2024, totaling $355.7 million for the period, a new first quarter revenue record for the company. CELSIUS alone was responsible for approximately 47% of the entire energy drink category growth year-over-year in the first quarter. And as we reported in this morning's press release, CELSIUS now holds an 11.5% share in MULOC for the 4-week period ending April 14, according to Circana. This is a full point higher than the Q4 2023 and 4 points higher than 1 year ago.
These results on their own are very strong, especially after growing at a triple digit for the past 3 consecutive years. Even so, our first quarter revenue would have been higher except that it was adversely affected due to inventory movements by our largest customer, which is beyond our control. The year-over-year inventory variation is attributable to elevated first quarter 2023 restocking, which we believe was meant to compensate for the fourth quarter 2022 destocking and to prepare for a robust spring reset that were planned in 2023. However, no such first quarter restocking and spring reload in was observed this year. Absent these effects, we would have seen a higher growth rate.
Ongoing inventory fluctuations may be expected in subsequent quarters because our largest distributor constitutes approximately 62% of our total North America business during the first quarter of 2024. While these inventory fluctuations caused noise in our sequential quarterly revenue figures, what's important to focus on here is that CELSIUS is constantly on shelves, stocked cold, stocked high with a 98.4% ACV. And our category across all tracked channels and on track channels continues to grow.
We introduced several new flavor innovations since the beginning of this year, including Galaxy Vibe, which may be our most refreshing and delicious flavor yet, as well as the CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line which began its national distribution in January and has now achieved a 54.5% ACV and a 5.5-point share increase since we last reported in February. We estimate that retailer spring resets were approximately 1/3 complete at the end of the quarter. And once concluded, we're expecting our best shelf space gains in the company history.
The importance of these space gain increases and placements and improvement cannot be overstated. The visual impact of multiple full shelves of cold CELSIUS in convenience stores and coolers and in the grocery shelf as a powerful in-store billboard and showcases our portfolio. The full effect of these shelf resets is expected to be reflected in the scanner data beginning in July.
In March, we launched a new incentive program with Pepsi that further aligns our shared interest within the energy category, including alignment around priorities and delivering a program that will contribute to our long-term goal of becoming the #1 energy drink brand in the world.
As we prepare for our 100 Days of Summer campaign, we are well positioned with the best in-store presence in company history, the most refreshing products and some great marketing initiatives, which I'll discuss later in the call. And as just noted, a strong aligned partnership with our North America distribution partner.
Celsius share in MULOC in the most recent 4-week data as of April 14, as stated, was 11.5 share, an increase of approximately 4 points compared to the year ago period. We're pleased with our continued share growth across all tracked channels. As we shared on our last earnings call, there are 12 major U.S. markets where Celsius maintains a 15-point share or greater, and we are within just a few points of 15 share in several additional markets.
With our growth and expansion, we're adding more talented people. And already this year, we've increased our sales and key accounts team by approximately 85%. By the end of this year, we are expecting to have 3 times as many sales staff compared to this time last year, supporting our growth and the opportunities we see ahead. Our world-class operation teams continue to do efficiencies to reduce freight and raw material cost savings this quarter, contributing to our highest gross margin to date at 51.2%.
Turning to pricing. We have generally maintained flat pricing on a per volume basis across our portfolio while strategically promoting our new 16-ounce line of CELSIUS ESSENTIALS to drive trial. And reduced pricing and scanner data reflects CELSIUS ESSENTIALS' promotions and the increased mix of variety packs into our overall sales, which come with a lower per ounce cost. We continue to consider strategic pricing and promotional opportunities that allow us to maintain our premium position in the category while maintaining velocity. With that said, we continue to review and monitor both our distribution and infrastructure and the commodity environment across the back half of 2024 and into 2025.
Celsius new product innovation this year is the best tasting and most refreshing beverages we've ever created. A new favorite here is Celsius Galaxy Vibe, which joins other excellent 2024 additions in our 12-ounce line, including Blue Rasberry Lemonade, Sparkling, Raspberry Peach, Astro Vibe. We are very pleased with the strong retailers supporting our initiatives rolling out our 16-ounce line of CELSIUS ESSENTIALS, which now has reached approximately [ 54.5% ] ACV as of mid-April with availability increasing across the country.
Celsius On the Go powders continues to perform well with our recent innovation with a refreshing Strawberry Coconut and Blueberry Lemonade, being our top 2 performers. We have more Celsius On the Go powder innovation plan for this year and continue to see great opportunities with this line. Nontrack channels, including club, e-com and foodservice continue to be tailwinds to our overall growth.
Club sales in the first quarter increased 36% to $63 million compared to $46.5 million in the same period in 2023. Sales on Amazon increased 30% year-over-year, $28 million in the first quarter, up from $21.8 million in the prior period. Celsius ended the first quarter with a 20.2% share compared to Monster with a 20% share and Red Bull with a 12.3% share according to Stackline 12-week data ending March 30, 2024. Approximately 12% of Celsius sales through Pepsi in the quarter was to the foodservice channel, with especially strong sales in restaurants, recreation, lodging and gaming locations.
International sales, which do not include Canada, increased 42% in the quarter to $16.2 million. CELSIUS launched in Canada, which began in January, continues to exceed expectations, and we recently achieved a 5.5 share through the first 2 periods of 2024 according to Nielsen. In the first quarter, Celsius announced plans to expand in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand and United Kingdom, executing our stated strategy to pursue measured international growth, balancing investment levels in new markets.
I'm excited to say that as of April, CELSIUS is now officially available in select IMS and retailers across the United Kingdom and Ireland. Sales in Australia and New Zealand, as well as France, are planned to gradually begin in the fourth quarter of 2024, with phased expansion across the countries in 2025.
Finally, we produced some fantastic marketing activations recently, including Celsius COSMIC Desert Event in Coachella, which hosted celebrities and influencers as well as performers by leading artists. Celsius was also featured in a recent Saturday Night Live opening skit, making clear that Celsius is the top-of-mind functional energy brand and pop culture. And just last weekend, we activated our global partnership with Ferrari at the Formula One Miami Grand Prix. Congratulations to the Ferrari team for their podium finish.
I'll now turn the call over to Celsius' Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our first quarter financial results. Jerry? Thank you, John. Celsius delivered another record-setting quarter, exceeding our expectations and producing strong returns while we grew the business and levered in certain areas. Revenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $355.7 million, an increase of 37% from $259.9 million in the prior year period. To put this growth rate into historical context, when Monster Energy achieved $1.3 billion in net sales, they grew revenue 30% the following year. Adjusted for the inventory fluctuations John mentioned previously, Celsius would have grown at an even higher rate in the first quarter of 2024.
North American revenue, which includes the United States and Canada, was $339.5 million, an increase of [ 57% ] from the same period last year. International revenue grew 42% to $16.2 million as velocity continued to increase. We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter to several key factors, including our ability to drive increased consumer demand, strong innovation and excellent in-store execution by our key account and field sales teams. Continued growth in the club, e-commerce and foodservice channels also served as a solid driver of our revenue growth in the quarter, as did strong year-over-year share gains of more than 69% or 4 points in the convenience and gas channel.
Gross profit in the first quarter increased 60% to $182.2 million, up from $113.8 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the first quarter were 51.2% of revenues compared to 43.8% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to reduced freight and raw material costs. First quarter freight costs as a percentage of net invoice sales decreased 120 basis points year-over-year, and cost of goods sold decreased 470 basis points.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we have a number of key drivers that we are monitoring, including fuel costs, which have been rising; other commodity costs, such as aluminum; and our promotional calendar. As a result, we are taking a conservative approach to the remainder of the year and continue to stick with the commentary from February, where we noted that gross margins in the high 40s was very achievable, but that we were not ready to move too far from that expectation until we got further into the year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 21% of revenue. We have hired a significant number of new team members and are on track to fill the remaining open positions by the end of Q2. But based on timing, we did see some benefit in Q1 which was slightly below where we expected to be and 3 points higher than the same period in 2023. We will continue to invest and plan to maintain investment in this area as we expand further into our 31 drill deep markets and internationally.
As we continue to grow, our investment in sales and marketing will remain within the 20% to 23% range. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $23.2 million, an increase of 9% relative to Q1 2023. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 7% compared to 8% in the prior year period as we continue to leverage and due to lower third-party costs, such as legal fees. As we look across the remainder of the year, we would anticipate some ebbs and flows within G&A, but we remain confident that we will be able to leverage this area in 2024. 
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 81% to approximately $88 million in the first quarter compared to $48.7 million in the prior year period, driven substantially by revenue growth and increase in margins and our continued leverage across SG&A. Net income attributed to common shareholders increased 106% to $65 million in the quarter or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $0.13 in the prior year period. We ended the quarter with approximately $879.5 million of cash on hand, which continues to accrue interest and remains available for strategic growth initiatives.
Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $135 million in the first quarter, which compares to negative $14 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year period. We will continue to invest in our working capital as well as CapEx around coolers in our fleet to drive further growth, but we do see a great opportunity to continue to drive strong cash flow growth across 2024.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. A question on inventories as we're thinking about 2Q, maybe how businesses progressed from a consumption perspective in 2Q. But also our inventory is now tight and low as we're going into another 2/3 of shelf resets, do maybe some of the $20 million reverse in 2Q? Can you just give some context around that? Great question. We did state that in her prepared remarks. In regards to some of the inventory fluctuation with our partner. We don't control the inventory levels, but we do feel that everyone is optimizing inventory levels as we move forward, and we'll see how that evolves. If you look at our inventory levels over the last 15 months, looking at the -- especially the cash flow statement, we've optimized our inventory levels as well, about $47 million. So I think every business is going to be optimizing.
I think really the most important thing when we look at it is keeping the shelf stocked, most importantly keeping the shelves cold and just preparing for this the reset season that's underway as we continue to progress forward. And the scan data is really strong, especially last week at the register according to Sircana. So we feel like we're in a good shape. But to predict where inventory levels move is just really difficult for our partner. I don't know, Jarrod, if you have any further comments to add. Like John said, depletions are really good. They're rock solid. But as I look at April, I'd say this is kind of a new normal for us at the moment. We'll see where our partner goes from here, but I wouldn't bake in a reversal of what we've seen. Okay. Got it. And then margins were quite substantially ahead of plan. Was there anything onetime in there? Or is it just sort of leverage off your growth? Yes. Jarrod, why don't you talk about the margins? Yes. I mean you always point to freight as something that fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, and that's definitely been something that if you look back over the last 3 years, it has been. We've been able to keep it within a kind of a set of guardrails, but we did see some good freight rates this quarter. We'll continue to look to optimize that, but some of that will be dependent upon fuel costs as we look out into the back half of the year. We have seen some good activity in terms of leveraging our business and our scale around raw materials. But at the same time, we are moving into a much higher promotional time period with 100 Days of Summer.
So that's why we kind of said we're not ready to put the line in the sand at the rate we were able to deliver in Q1. We're always going to try to deliver that or better, and we do have a kind of a long-term goal that we're looking to get to. But I would say as we look out to Q2, Q3, Q4, we're kind of sticking with what we said at the end of February, which was kind of that high end of the 40s and not quite locking in into the 50s yet. Mark Astrachan from Stifel. I wanted to go back to that last question, the one that we're getting a lot today as far as the timing of this inventory stock. So if I do some rough math, it looks like you've undershipped demand per scanner data recently the last 2 quarters. 1Q, obviously, when you're lumping in the rollout into Canada, would you state that even more pronounced. So I guess the question is, a, what do you say to that? Meaning that we can all kind of see where end demand is versus what your sales are, and your sales are a lot lower.
And two, as you think about how Pepsi is managing shelves, does this have an impact? Have you seen any impact from a service level standpoint on how to stock and whatnot? And kind of how do you work with them to make sure that you prevent that, assuming that you haven't seen it yet but may given where trends seem to be moving? Yes. Mark, I'll take the beginning of the question. When you look at the inventory levels, I think our partners are at really good inventory levels right now. We're maintaining deliveries, we're keeping products in stock. We're seeing scan data. We just broke a record on the share gain to 11.5%. So product is flowing. I think we're both getting -- learning each other, our supply chains, and looking to further optimize.
So I can't speak for our partner, but -- they are maintaining supply levels, servicing customers. We have greater ACV. The resets have gone well, the ones that have been reset so far. So and we're further working on programs with 100 Days of Summer. Working on further displays and NCAP programs. So I think we feel really good where we're at. You're going to see some optimization on both sides. Like I said Kaumil is that we did optimize our inventory as well, about $47 million in the last 15 months, if you look at the cash flow statement.
So in regards to shelves, we're not seeing out of stocks. You're always going to have some that's just part of the business, but always out there's ways to further optimized.And I think we're in a -- we're in a really good place. We have good inventory levels now. We feel confident in our inventory levels and confident in the Pepsi inventory levels supporting our growth. Got it. Okay. And then I guess just staying on the point, was there any change in the inventory levels that Pepsi held through the March quarter that was notable? I say that in part just out of curiosity and partly with the view that distribution points continue to expand. Obviously, you talked about what you did through March 31, implying a pretty substantial increase in distribution points as you head to summer. So would just be odd to me that you would reduce the amount of inventory for Pepsi? And I guess just how do you think about that progression through? I know you talked about April being a little bit weaker. So I guess, sort of related to the first question, but kind of how does the time that work through? Did they hold more at the beginning of the quarter and less at the end of the quarter? Yes. I mean we haven't spoken about April being weaker. I think Jarrod was talking about maintaining inventory levels with our partners, maintaining as we enter the second quarter. We're going to have to see how this how this plays -- how the quarter unfolds. I think with optimizing inventories, we're getting more efficient. We're able to ship product in less number of days. Prior, we're running 14 days. And now, in many cases, we're shipping within 7. So we're just finding further ways to optimize our supply chain. So that's going to impact some of the revenue recognition standards in order as we continue to progress forward.
But I think the most important thing to really look at is what's taking place within the scanner data for the end user and the end customer, which continues to maintain it seems to be extremely strong, and we got good momentum heading in, especially the 100 Days of Summer, double the sales staff, great refreshing innovation and a bunch of great marketing assets and activities. I don't know, Jarrod, is there any more color you want to add on that. I'm aligned with you. I think we're in good shape. We haven't seen any service issues as they optimize their system. As long as they're getting product on the shelf, that's what we're most concerned with. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen from B. Riley. I wanted to circle back to a comment you made on markets where you're getting close to a 15% market share. Maybe any more color you can add on that. I guess what specifically you've done in those markets to achieve that and plans to apply those initiatives to other markets? Yes, Jeff, great question. It's really exciting that now we're in 12 markets, major metropolitan markets in the U.S. right now that are over 15% share. And then we have several additional markets that are getting close to that range. So what we're seeing is just really further collaboration with our Pepsi partners, further building out our sales team and marketing teams. And really using our methodological approach to marketing and activation, which has worked well. It's activating the consumer where they live, work and play, disrupting the path to purchase, building that awareness, getting that trial, and we have such great flavors and a great product and a great brand that we build that loyal consumer.
And when we're seeing our Celsius consumers further increasing their consumption levels as we've further built out our availability, we're seeing category growth or driving category growth, about 47% of the category growth is coming from new to category and Celsius is creating that. So really exciting. It's really about gaining that additional distribution and really closing the gap within convenience, and we've talked about that for many years. We've done well in large format and online and with gyms and health clubs. And now we're really -- next phase is really closing the gap in convenience and getting better placement. You're seeing the share numbers start to increase there. Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to circle back to spring resets as well. Maybe you could just speak a little bit more about where you're seeing the most significant gains. Maybe touch on that in terms of SKUs, spacings, quality of shelf locations, that sort of thing. Yes. I think when you look at the resets, we're really excited. It's going to be convenience as the biggest opportunity. So we're expecting some pretty good growth within the convenience channel as well as our existing accounts. As an example, in Publix, we just moved over from the HPC to the energy category and the energy set. And we've gained further replacement in front checkout coolers, and we're working with several other retailers. More to come on that. We expect full resets to be done by the end of June, but really looking to gain further placements in all accounts. The key accounts team has been extremely positive this year. Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up to that. As far as the cooler scale, what are the plans for coolers this year? And also, is there an opportunity to get into a lot more coolers that are maybe not healthiest coolers at this point? Yes, I think that's a huge opportunity, and that's really partnering with PepEnergy and working really closely with our Pepsi partner gaining more distribution and availability in cold placements. Our key accounts team is working on branded Celsius coolers, that's a big initiative. We're not going to put a number out, but they're a substantial number we're looking to place. And in regards to the first quarter, I think the team's placed almost 3,000 coolers. But lots of opportunities with coolers we expect to really continue the momentum as we go forward. The next question comes from Jonathan Keypour from Bank of America. I've got a couple on margins and then a couple on sales. I guess on margins, just looking at the chart on aluminum, I think it's up pretty meaningfully year-over-year. Can you guys give us any kind of  magnitude of COGS exposure to aluminum and, I guess, a sense of timing about maybe where those higher costs will flow through? Yes, Jon, and then I'll turn it over to Jarrod. Yes. So a couple of things. Let me jump on an inventory question that was asked. Just to clarify, when I was talking about April, I was talking about days on hand is consistent from March into April. So that wasn't a knock-on what we're seeing. In April, as we continue to see our resets happen, we're doing very well and you can see the consumer data. We continue to get more SKUs. We continue to get more space, et cetera. So just a clarity there. That was more of a days on hand comment more than anything.
In terms of the aluminum, you've seen some fuel costs go up. We have locked in a lot of our aluminum pricing. So we're in pretty good shape there. So we tend to lock that in around Q4 of every year. Okay. Cool. On margins, again, just in terms of the amendments to the Pepsi agreement, I guess what are the other implications to the margin from here? What -- is there a benefit? Is it likely diluted anything? Like just a sense of what it may or may not do to margins. Yes. So the incentive program is for Pepsi, it's incentive-based, right? So obviously, we're going to get something for it. So the idea is to really drive what our priorities are, what their priorities are across energy. We want to be the #1 energy brand in the world. It's also really to drive alignment. And so from that perspective, it's an incentive program. So the idea is to really push us to the next level. There is -- obviously, it's an incentive program, so there is obviously a cost of that program. So it's something that I would look to see ramping up across, call it, the first 6, 7, 8 months of the year, and to really be cruising by the time we get to the back part of the year. Cool. And sorry, just a couple more on revenue. I guess specifically in Costco, that became in a bit light, same as on foodservice. Just wondering about the sequential decline in Costco and the flat foodservice, any drivers there that you can point to or what to expect going forward, please? Yes. So Costco, really the club channel, we probably should have called that out last quarter, but we did see a really good Thanksgiving week and Black Friday. So we had the team really activated phenomenally there. So we did get a bit of a bump there in Q4 versus Q1. Q1 does also tend to be a little slower in the club channel. What was the other part? The foodservice, foodservice remains strong. That can be a little lumpy at times. But being up at that 12-ish range is pretty good for us.
And we do -- we are seeing gains in areas like convenience. So we're seeing gains in some of the areas that are, from a scale perspective, bigger. So as we see gains there, you may not see the same percentage growth from 1%, but we are seeing dollar growth. Cool. And then just last one on the shelf resets coming up. So it sounds like 1/3 down already, 2/3 coming, so basically a doubling of what's already been put in the -- or more than the doubling what's been put in the trade already. I guess in the Nielsen, you can see that TDPs in the average number of items looks great. But if it's going to keep moving up from there. I guess, is that going to be -- does that kind of imply new flavors or innovations coming to market by the end of the year? Or is it going to be like double, triple facing that kind of thing? Yes. I think the goal is to gain double, triple facing. So a lot of the resets -- average items per store might not increase show up in the scanner data, but we're gaining those secondary third placements and better placements within retailers. So as an example, like within I mentioned Publix, moving from HPC into the energy aisle, also gaining additional availability and placements in cold checkouts. That's an example of a transitional move. And also, we're looking at other retailers as well.
So we do have innovation coming in this year, which we're launching. We launched a CELSIUS ESSENTIALS. We got Galaxy Vibe, a variety of other great flavors. But we're really -- I think the bulk of the resets are going to be seeing them by double, triple facing within stores and gaining a secondary placements. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Just wanted to come back to the inventory for a minute. And I think you've been clear not to expect a snapback or an inventory restocking. But should we expect any more destocking? I know you said the inventory levels feel about right, but how low could it go? Is that something we should watch out for? Yes. I mean I can't control that or we can't control that. I think it's -- sales are flowing, sales are strong at the register. So it seems to be like the balancing has been finalized. But who knows what next week or the week after happens? But I think right now, it seems somewhat stable as we ended the -- ending March. Okay. And just back on the incentive plan, you've given some color on that. I know you don't want to be too specific. But can you maybe touch on what the rationale was? What prompted you -- what problem was it fixing because, obviously, there was great momentum in place? What does this change qualitatively that makes it seem kind of worth changing the terms? Yes. I think when you look at the partnership, we're heading in really at a great point within the -- where Celsius is within the energy category. We just broke that 10 share. You're looking at ways to further partner and incentivize our distributor and our partners. And we do that with our employees. We do have retailers and our distributors. So this is like a standard practice we've done in the past. So I don't think it's added anything out of our standard course of business. We've done a variety of incentive programs. And it's -- this further aligns us with additional prioritization within Pep Energy. Also solidifies this -- as more incentives, we both win together. And it really achieves our long-term goals. We feel really confident in where we are and what better way to incentivize both parties to continue to drive Celsius forward. I don't know, Jarrod, do you want to add anything else. I agree with you. It's really about making sure we're all fully aligned together to take that next step and to really go after the #2 and #1 players in the market. We need to do it together. Yes. The next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Peter, are you here? Our next question comes from Jon Andersen from William Blair. I just wanted to ask about the category growth that you're driving. I mean, you're driving half of the growth in the category, energy category. And I'm curious to know to what extent you're seeing that come through? As kind of new consumers into the category, to what extent you think you're driving buy rate through new occasions? And then how the brand is performing overall from a household penetration and the kind of repeat rates you're seeing? So just digging into some of the metrics underpinning the growth that you're seeing both for the category that the brand is driving, but all to your brands. Yes. No, great question. And it's exciting because we're -- when you look at like brand shifting, we're not seeing a substantial amount of our growth coming from brand shifting. It really is incremental and it's increasing the user intensification. Our core consumers are consuming more. And then it's about 35%, the latest day we had, is intensification of more consumption of our core or base. And then new to category for us was 42%, and this was as of the end of March. So really seeing the 23% brand shift.
So we're expanding the category. We're changing the way consumers think about energy as well. And we've seen that talk about Jersey Mike's and Dunkin' Donuts, and really the partnership with Pepsi allows us to take advantage of this opportunity. We have some of the most refreshed -- we feel we have the most refreshing energy drinks in the world. And it's showing. We're bringing new consumers. We're growing in a category. We got a lot of great attributes within the brand. We look at better-for-you trends. Celsius has over 7 essential vitamins.
If you look at how we all want our foods and beverages to have more function, Celsius delivers on that with our thermogenic properties. And then you also look at fitness, this health and wellness trend, and we're all about live and fit and living life to the fullest. So I think we're really well positioned. And we haven't really seen that change within the user intensification as well as the increase to new to category over the last, really over the last 6 to almost a year now. Great. That's helpful. And on these 33-or-so drill-down markets, can you talk about what you're doing there -- or 31 drill-beat markets, what you're doing there that's different at present? And kind of what you're expecting in terms of, I guess, maybe share results as a measuring stick? Yes, I think you talked about household penetration and that shows -- as we've continued to drive forward with our triggered marketing programs and as well as our distribution games, our household penetration has reached an all-time high, most recently at a 29.7% household penetration. So really proud of the team and all the hard work they've been doing.
We take an approach of a drill-deep strategy. We're not going to get into specific strategies because a lot of competitors are listening on the call. But we have a proprietary blend of a special formula here which starts with the employee and a great product that we promote and market. And it's all about touching consumers where they live, work and play, creating awareness, creating trial and then creating loyalty. Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can hear you. Excellent. All right. Cool. So I guess just a couple of follow-ups here. Just in terms of the inventory dynamic, Jarrod, can you just remind us what we're kind of comping against from a year ago perspective? Like I guess you might not have visibility on what types you might do or how will manage it sequentially. But when we just think of how this dynamic evolved last year. I think it kind of held in 2Q, grew again in 2Q. So just should we expect kind of this gap versus standard data to kind of continue as we move through the year? Or would you expect it to kind of be more aligned at this point? Yes. I mean, remember, we were just getting started last year and so we're still learning each other. And obviously, as everybody in CPG, it's all about optimizing the supply chain to make sure we're spending our dollars wisely. So we did see some buildup in Q1 like we talked about, roughly $25 million. Across Q2 and Q3, we saw some minor buildup, and it kind of stuck steady for kind of Q2, Q3, Q4. To Mark's earlier point, there was some innovation in there, so that could have -- maybe there would have been some inventory taken down in Q4 if it weren't for that as they were optimizing. And then across Q1, clearly, there's been some optimization occurring again.
No issue with having product on the shelf. And we do have KPIs that we work together to maintain in terms of service standards, and so we have no complaints there. And we're fully -- believe they're fully committed, we're fully committed. So we're very happy with how things are going there. But if there's opportunity to optimize, like John said, we'll do it and they're welcome to do it, too. So I think what I mentioned with April is the days on hand that we saw kind of in March, kind of were maintained in April. But the consumer is there, if they can maintain inventory levels,and keep the product on the shelf, then that's -- we're comfortable with that. Okay. Great. And then just following up on kind of the shelf resets and kind of the market share metrics you mentioned. I think you said 1/3 of the shelf resets were done by March. I mean when did those actually take place in 1Q? I'm just trying to understand whether there is a benefit, including kind of these 4-week share figures that you mentioned on the 4Q call. I think it was the same 11.5% that you mentioned in the latest release today. So shares kind of, on a monthly basis, held steady.
And then I think as we look ahead, is there anything you can share in terms of the phasing of the benefits? I know you touched on but we won't see the full benefit until July. But kind of where are we now in the first week of May? What's really the progression look like? And is there really any way to put into context what you actually expect in terms of track growth or market share performance as these resets happen? Yes, I think [indiscernible] to 11 5. I think the last poll, maybe been in the last couple of weeks is more like 11 8. So we do continue to see the number climb as we go through April and into May. So we are seeing good progress. As those resets continue to happen, we'll benefit. Once they're fully baked in, we'll really see where we are once we get to early July once everything is baked in. So we continue to be on track.
There's been some rumblings out there that it's been a little slower in terms of resets this year versus prior years. But we're going to have the best space gains that we've had in the history of the company. We're super excited about it. We're -- our key account team and our sales guys are working diligently with all of our customers. And we're going to have a phenomenal back half of the year once we get all these resets in place. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand back the call over to John Fieldly for final remarks.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Celsius Holdings, Inc. Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Wiseman, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings Second Quarter 2024 Earnings webcast. Joining me today John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer; and Toby David, Chief of Staff. The speakers will take questions following the prepared remarks.
The company released its second quarter earnings press release earlier this morning, and all materials are available on the company's website, ir.celsiusholdingsinc.com, as well as on SEC's website, sec.gov. As a reminder, an audio replay of this webcast will be available later today and can be accessed with the same link used to join today's webcast.

With that, I'd like to hand it over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all cracked open a cold Celsius to kick start our early morning start time this quarter. Celsius reported record second quarter 2024 financial results this morning across revenue, profit, gross margin that broadly reflect our positive momentum in an otherwise challenging macro environment. .
Despite systematic and unanticipated category growth pressure in the second quarter, Celsius was resilient and delivered delicious new innovation, expanded in-store shelf presence and continued to bring new consumers into the category, contributing 47% of all category growth in the quarter, making Celsius the clear category growth leader.
Total revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 23% year-over-year to $402 million, and 2024 first half revenue increased 29% to $757.7 million. International revenue increased 30% in the second quarter to $19.6 million. Celsius achieved fantastic shelf space gains during the seasons, shelf resets, increasing our average SKU sold per store by more than 35% according to Circana's last 4-week read ending July 14, 2024 compared to the last 4 weeks ending December 3, 2023.
Within the convenience channel, our average SKUs selling per store increased 43% across the same period. While we achieved strong space gains, we also began to feel the effects of the same macroeconomic factors that are pressuring same-store sales and affecting consumer purchasing habits. Just last week, 1 of the largest convenience change noted their same-store sales were down more than 4%. These and other factors contributed to the second quarter energy drink category slowdown.
Competition within the energy category has never been greater, which is why we continue to add resources across sales, merchandising, key accounts and field marketing. The full sugar energy category subset has stagnated for several years, and the growth fight has moved to the sugar-free sector, which is now approximately half of the category.
Celsius is the second largest brand within the sugar-free energy subset, and it is from here that we are driving the entire category's growth this year. We believe that we have set our business up for long-term success, but we see short-term impacts from competition and macroeconomic factors along the way.
The combination of macroeconomic headwinds, delayed resets and programs and increased competition applied a lot of pressure to our business in the second quarter. Despite these pressures, Celsius still grew at a 10x the category growth rate in the second quarter. We responded to pressures during the quarter and saw our market share stabilize.
Now as we begin to recapture lost share, we're moving aggressively to gain our growth and momentum, and we believe that we have great programs for the back half of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. We also expect that macroeconomic forces will continue to impact the category. With a solid set of programming, promotional programs, incentive programs and cash in the bank, we are eager and ready to take on the challenges ahead of us. Additionally, we are formulating several fantastic programs for 2025, including new innovation, new channel and product opportunities, international expansions and new partnerships.
Our partnership with Pepsi remains strong. The added incentive program announced last quarter continues to percolate through the system and is expected to be fully ramped in the second half of this year, where we have fully incentivized our partner to lean in with us.
Celsius share in MULOC in the last 4-week period ending July 14, was 11%, an increase of 1.4% compared to the year ago period and down 0.5 of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter. Beginning this quarter, we're going to reference Circana's new MULO+ geography, which includes tracked channels captured in MULO and adds online retailers and club channel. We believe that when coupled with the convenience store geography, this measure better represents today's consumer purchasing habits and patterns.
In addition, we have seen some shifting among the channels, and this metric will provide a more holistic category view. Celsius Share in MULO+ with convenience is rolling 4 weeks period ending July 14, 2024, was 12.04%. The energy drink category has always been highly competitive and right now is no different. Celsius is disrupting the category status quo and we remain resilient in our pursuit to become the world's #1 energy drink brand by growing the category through leadership, high-quality innovation and premium marketing.
Our field marketing team grew by 50% in the past year. They are a driving force behind our drill deep marketing strategy, which focuses resources on the most important markets for our growth. We currently have 16 markets that are above are within 2 points of a 15% share, and our drill deep strategy is driving force behind our growth.
Looking ahead, we are implementing several programs across the back half of 2024 to invest in our growth, such as shopper marketing programs, promotional programs and investments across our marketing platforms. Similar to the top 2 competitors in the category. We believe that there is room for further pricing, and this is something we believe will benefit us in 2025, and act as an offset in commodity inflation, freight lanes, our distribution infrastructure and our supply chain infrastructure.
Celsius launched 3 new great-tasting flavors, very refreshing, perfectly timed for summer, including Celsius Sparkling, Watermelon Lemonade, Sparkling Kiwi Strawberry and Sparkling Cherry Cola. I'm sure you'll see these great new Celsius Flavors poolside and a backyard cook outs throughout summer and beyond. Also Celsius Sparkling Green Apple Cherry launched in Canada last quarter, making 6 delicious flavors now available in the country. Three of our most popular Celsius Vibe flavors launched as Celsius On-the-Go powders in the second quarter, adding Peach Vibe, Tropical Vibe and Arctic Vibe to the very portable and customizable energy powder form.
We are also working on some very interesting concepts for the first quarter of 2025 and more to come on that. Nontrack channels, including club, e-commerce and food service, continue to be tailwinds to our overall growth. Club sales in the second quarter increased 30% to $88 million compared to $68 million in the same period of 2023.
For the 3 months ending June 30, Celsius' sales on Amazon increased 41% year-over-year to $39.9 million, up from $28.2 million in the prior year period. Celsius ended the second quarter with a 19.7% share compared to Monster with a 21.8% share and Red Bull with a 14% share according to Stackline last 14-week period ending July 6, 2024.
Celsius performed exceptionally well on Amazon during July's Prime Day, pushing our share in the energy category on the platform to 22.1% in the last 4-week read ending July 20, and we recaptured our #1 position compared to Monster at 21.5% and Red Bull at 13.8%, according to Stackline.
Approximately 12.1% of Celsius total North America sales to PepsiCo in the quarter was to the foodservice channel with strong results in workplace, restaurants, recreation, lodging and gaming sales. Celsius increase in international revenue in the second quarter was driven by improved velocity and brand awareness. Growth in Canada continued to exceed our initial expectations, and the product is performing well across all platforms with notable strength in the club and convenience channels.
We are running our new marketing entry playbook and building a solid foundation in gyms and fitness communities as well as making new entries into the foodservice category. Sales of Celsius began in U.K. and Ireland in the second quarter, and we're following our international expansion playbook to see product launched with a key retailer and grow into national launch. Similar to Canada, our progress in these new global market is exceeding initial expectations.
Our plans for Australia, New Zealand and France remain on track for launches later in the year. We're expected to continue to grow our global growth strategy this year by pursuing favorable distribution partnerships and opportunistic energy drink markets.
Here in the States and abroad, Celsius marketing and sales teams are spreading the Celsius Live Fit messaging and supporting our customers' pursuit on their own health and positive fitness lifestyles. Our 100 days of summer programming is meaningful increasing the number of eye-catching in-store displays featuring exciting Celsius marketing activations like our Ferrari F1 tie-in promotion, which is designed to increase customer trial and loyalty.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in our marketing and sales to drive continued growth and to be the most valuable beverage partner to our retail customers. In the last 12 months, we've grown our field sales team by more than 250%, and we're still hiring to drive growth and opportunistic markets.
I'll now turn the call over to Celsius' Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans. Thank you, John. Celsius delivered another record-setting quarter, producing strong returns while we grew the business and levered in certain areas. Revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $402 million, an increase of 23% from $326 million in the prior year period. North American revenue, which includes the United States and Canada, was $382 million, an increase of 23% from the prior year period.
International revenue grew 30% to $20 million as velocity continued to increase. We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter to several key factors, including our ability to drive increased consumer demand, strong innovation and excellent in-store execution by our key account and field sales teams, offset in part by inventory timing movements or days on hand associated with our largest distributor.
During the quarter, we publicly stated that the impact of the inventory movements during the middle of June was approximately $20 million to $30 million. As we closed the quarter, we saw a slight uptick in the days on hand, and as a result, the impact was at the lower end of that range. Keep in mind, the energy drink category second quarter year-over-year unit sales volume was flat.
Celsius unit sales volume increased 30.6% in the same period, increasing our unit share by 2.8 points versus a year ago. Strength in the club, e-commerce and food service channels also continued to serve as solid drivers of our revenue growth in the quarter, as did strong quarterly year-over-year share gains of 34% or 2.5 points in the convenience and gas channel.
With that said, the category overall softened in Q2 and has impacted the overall growth trajectory of the category. We have a solid foundation, and we look to continue to drive the category through innovation, bringing new consumers to the channel and increasing consumption opportunities.
Gross profit in the second quarter increased 32% to $209 million, up from $159 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the second quarter were 52% of revenues compared to approximately 49% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to reduced raw material costs and freight costs. Second quarter freight costs as a percentage of net invoice sales decreased 81 basis points year-over-year, and cost of goods sold decreased 236 basis points.
The first half of the year showed the strength of our business and our ability to leverage our supply and distribution systems. As we look to the second half of the year, we have a number of key drivers that we are monitoring such as raw materials, including the specific commodity cost of aluminum and fuel. In addition, we will invest in growth with a wider promotional incentive calendar. As a result, we are sticking with a conservative approach for the remainder of the year and target gross margins in the high 40s to 50 range in the back half of the year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter came in within our targeted range of 20% to 23% at 22.6% of revenue. We continued to hire across sales and marketing in the second quarter and would look to these new employees to assist us in further driving growth and share gains as we look across the back half of the year and into 2025.
As we look to Q3, with the timing of some of our programs, we anticipate that our spend will likely move above the high end of the range for the quarter as we further train our newer workforce and implement test market and test market some additional tactics. Based on the success of these tactics, we will adjust our spending across Q4 and into 2025.
General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were approximately $24 million, a decrease of 24% relative to Q2 2023, when we incurred a $7.9 million legal charge. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 6% compared to 10% in the prior year period, as we continue to leverage and due to the lower third-party costs such as legal fees. As we look across the remainder of the year, we anticipate some ebbs and flows within G&A, but we remain confident that we'll be able to leverage this area relative to the prior year.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to approximately $100 million in the second quarter compared to $78 million in the prior year period, driven by our solid top line growth and gross margin profile.
Net income increased 55% to approximately $80 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to approximately $52 million in the prior year period. Net income attributed to common shareholders increased 63% to approximately $67 million in the quarter or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $0.17 in the prior year period.
Revenue for the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $758 million, an increase of 29% from $586 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023. North America revenue year-to-date was $722 million, an increase of 29% from the same period in 2023. International revenue grew 36% to $36 million in the first 6 months of the year.
Gross profit margins in the first 6 months were approximately 51.6% of revenues compared to approximately 46.6% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margin in the first half of 2024 is attributable to favorable freight and raw material costs. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 22% in the first 6 months of 2024 compared to 19% in the prior year period. G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 6% in the first 6 months of 2024 compared to 9% in the prior year period.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 48% to approximately $188 million year-to-date compared to $127 million in the prior year period. Net income increased 70% to $158 million in the first half of 2024 compared to $93 million in the prior year period. Net income attributed to common shareholders increased 82% to $132 million in the first half of 2024 or $0.55 per diluted share compared to $0.31 in the prior year period.
We ended the quarter with approximately $903 million of cash on hand, which continues to accrue interest and remains available for strategic growth initiatives.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. I see that on the 1st of August, there were some new sort of employment agreements, which included an amendment related to change in control. Can you maybe just talk about what the purpose is or what's different there? Yes. I hope everything is going well. We did have some change in regards to change of control, which the compensation committee conducted a review to standardize the executive team in accordance to similar standards within change of control associated with the employment agreements that we have. Yes. So just add a little bit more clarity on that. John and I had agreements in place. And as we're expanding globally and shifting some of the responsibilities with our team, you'll have seen earlier in the year, where we announced some changes in the leadership with Tony Golfo taking the Chief Commercial Officer role, Paul Story taking the Chief Supply Chain Officer role, Kyle Watson taking the Chief Marketing Officer role, and then we've also added Richard in Q4 of last year taking on the CLO role. So it's really more -- I look at it as more of an administrative thing of getting everybody up to par with where John and I are in terms of the severance packages and change of control. . Okay. Great. And you mentioned some specifics on stabilizing of market share and such. Could you maybe just give us some more details on July or what you're seeing specifically? Yes. When you look at the quarter, as we mentioned on the prerecorded or the prior comments, we saw some share loss on the weekly data and data that come in through 11 to 10. There's been a lot of competition in the category and also the consumers challenges we're seeing in the environment. I talked about on the script, prescript about 1 of the largest convenience store chains seeing sales down 4%. So there's some challenges within the overall consumer. We're really trying to understand that. We're going to put some additional investments, strategic targeted investments, both on top line and below the line to continue to drive growth within our portfolio.
When you look at the share in a weekly reads, but it can be manipulated or not, but you're seeing a lot of there's a variety of timing of promotions, prior year cycling, as well as innovation from some competition there. So when you look at it, we are still the category driver at 47%, and we're looking for the category to continue to grow. We know we are in a growth category. We have a great portfolio. We're leading the sugar-free growth movement, and we're confident in the strategies we have. We're driving over 10% growth compared to the category.
So July, we did see further softness within the category within the Circana scan data. We're watching that closely. And there's a lot in the fourth quarter to pick up and get back into growth mode. But that's a little bit further out, and we really need to be cautious as we go forward and really continue to drive new consumers to the Celsius portfolio. We have 1 of the most refreshing brands and portfolios and new flavors in the category we feel. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Yes. I guess first question is probably 1 that we get most frequently, which is why is Celsius growth meaningfully ahead of the category, yet your market share has contracted. If you look at the last 6 weeks as an example, I think Celsius is something like 15% in the expanded Circana data, that compares to 1% growth for the category and yet market share is down, call it, 20 bps in the last couple of weeks versus the 6-week average. Is there anything that you can highlight there that you think would impact those numbers given, obviously, that you're growing faster than the category as the share suggests otherwise. Yes. I think when you add, it’s like what you're looking at when you look at the other brands within the category, especially when you look at Red Bull. Red Bull had some great launches and gained some share points recently. So when you look at -- there's such a large dollar as a percentage of the total category, even though we're growing 10x the category growth rate, 1 share growth or 1 share growth kind of on the mix of that will impact those figures. . Okay. And then maybe thinking about things a bit longer term, does that normalize, does your market share stabilize, start to improve? I know you don't want to give guidance, but I'm talking more big picture kind of directionally. And then like related to that, is there anything in your data that you're seeing to suggest that consumers are switching from Celsius to these other brands? Yes. I think when you look at -- everyone is very focused on the 1 week, we're watching 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks. I mean we're watching the data very closely. We're seeing -- there is a variety of innovation that comes in. It does get trial, but we do see consumers come back. So I think we have a really strong loyal consumer base. As consumers become more price sensitive, how does those promotional pricing strategies that the other brands are doing? How does that impact the consumer as we're entering at this point?
If you look at LRB, water is up. There's a variety of things that are happening in total LRB, within the categories as well. So we're seeing indicating that private label sales are up in other categories. So I think we're optimally cautious as we go forward. But I think when you look at the brand positioning, you look at the tailwinds we have, the functional ingredients, the position in fitness lifestyle or great flavor innovation, and the consumers that we're bringing into the category, we're still driving great value for consumers and within premiumization in the energy category.
So the share number goes, we're keeping eye on it. Obviously, we want to grow share. When you look at where we are on Amazon to where we are holistically on track channels, there's a huge opportunity. And then if you look at other markets, we're over a 15 share. That gives us great confidence and the ability to close those gaps, especially with the largest resettlement that we just received this settle in these resets and continue to build upon that. We got great relationships with our retailers. And we're driving excitement. I mean our retail partners are really excited about the Celsius portfolio and what we offer. And just on the share, not to put you on the spot, but could you wager to guess when you might start to see that stabilization there and sales and market share kind of look the same? . I mean we're not going to provide forward-looking guidance on that, but we've exceeded 10 shares. We said and you look at the Amazon number I assure you our teams are looking to close the gaps. We're looking to bring more markets over the 15 share target. We're expanding our drill each strategy. We're further focusing on additional markets to really give those through. We have a variety of markets that are within 2 share points of closing that gap. So we're working on that, especially during the 100 days of summer. There's so many other variables on the share number that happen on a weekly, 4-week, 12-week reads, but we're confident in the long position and the trajectory of the company. to be a leader in the energy drink category, both domestically and abroad.
So I think that's the trajectory, how quickly we get there. that's timing and sequencing. There's a lot of other headwinds that we have against us as we go forward. But what we do know, sugar-free has now been 50% of the energy drink category for the first time. So the tailwinds that we have are moving in that direction, and we're looking to be a leader in the sugar-free segment. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. I might just start with a follow-up on Mark's question. I appreciate that percent year-over-year growth and the 1% or so percent year-over-year category growth is year-over-year, so it's kind of an apples and oranges to the sequential share moves. Your year-over-year share, of course, is up very nicely. But on a sequential basis, the care momentum is -- even if it's a little lumpy, it's certainly slower.
How then, I guess, do you think about pricing? You mentioned that is slated to come maybe later this year or early next. And I appreciate the aluminum cost pressure, but with a sugar free portfolio and you get some relief on sugar costs. I guess what's just some of how you think about the pricing approach and any more specifics you can give there? . Yes. I mean, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 2 of the top competitors are taking category -- taking pricing. We're going to maintain our premium position in the category, but we're also being cautious about that as well because we're keeping a close eye on the consumers, where they're shopping. And the patterns that we're seeing. So from promotional, our pricing, promotional strategy and architecture is really key as we go forward.
As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a variety of retail marketing programs we're working on, working closely with retailers and increasing our investments in the third quarter as well. So I think as we continue to move forward, the teams are doing a great job. We're building out our sales force and our staff, and we're going to continue to -- our main focus is to drive share and drive share profitably and continue to build this brand and take it to more consumers looking to live a healthy active lifestyle and resonate.
If you look at some of our partners we've expanded with like Noah Lyles did an amazing job with the race over the weekend, World Champion, living champion, gold. Our brand is resonating, and it's resonating with a broader consumer than ever before. So we're getting some headwinds in regards to the environment that we're in. but we're going to prevail and come out strong on the other side. And we see great opportunities ahead. No, that consumer traction is certainly clear we see that. Just as we've heard from a lot of companies, how that -- at least certain consumers, certain cohorts of consumers are under some pressure. Assumingly, that's part of what's driving your strength on Amazon, where it's a bigger bulk pack at a better value per can. Have you seen that shift -- C-store obviously is under pressure. Amazons your kind of best performing channel. Are you seeing that accelerate? Was it just sort of prime day related that might have given a boost there. Maybe just help us understand some of the channel dynamics and what you're seeing? Yes. I mean, it is interesting. We were doing -- when you look at Amazon and even the club business, Club business is doing really well. That's a larger pack size. So on a per can basis you get some value there, but it's also a big dollar rate on a unit purchase. So when you look at that. So those are things we're understanding. We're trying to understand the change in consumer patterns. I think what you saw for the first time, when you look at like sales mix, the MULOC Plus convenience, which includes Amazon and club and all reported channels, convenience as a percent of total energy drink sales were down again.
So it seems to be consumers are purchasing and expanding channels. And I think what's great about Celsius, when you look at those other channels that were club and also Amazon, we overperformed there. So we have embraced an omnichannel world from the beginning and consumers wanting when they want it, how they want it, and we've embraced that.
So I think we're in a great position as consumers look to adapt to their purchasing patterns and some of the channels that they're purchasing in, and we're going to capture that. But those are dynamics we're looking at when the consumer is challenged, maybe you think more -- maybe go to more a unit purchase, right, a lower dollar basket ring versus a larger. So those are things we're watching closely and you're spot on. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Keypour with Bank of America. So the first question I have is about shipments versus consumption. On the last call, you guys pointed out that there was a $20 million drag from Pepsi tweaking its inventories on efficiencies. And then you said there would be a similar drag in 2Q, and then I guess, after a conference intra-quarter, you mentioned another 20 to 30. So I think people were coming into this quarter, expecting there was some kind of drag from shipment timing. I'm just wondering if you guys can size that for us so we can get a sense of what it actually ended up being in the quarter? Yes, Jon, I'll let Jarrod kind of dive into that because we do see in regards to our main partner as well as retail shipments. We do see some fluctuation. We've experienced last several quarters. We talked about that. So this quarter will be no different, but I'll turn it over to Jarrod. Yes. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks and back in June that there was kind of a potential $20 million to $30 million headwind because of the DOH changes. So that ended up on the back half of -- so the lower end of that range, so more in the 20% to 25% range as opposed to the higher end of the range. So that's where we ended the quarter when it relates to that piece. . Okay. And should we expect anything -- I guess, it's going to be the continuing 20 that you guys mentioned in 1Q, that will carry through 3Q and 4Q as well, correct, on a year-over-year basis? Yes. I mean we'll have to see where it ends up. It's from a fair perspective. They're the 1 managing their inventory. So we'll have to see where they end up where we are today. I think we're in pretty good shape. . Cool. And then if I can, it looks like based on the Nielsen data, at least, shelf resets are done, I think you guys mentioned that they were -- but so the question is like when you look at the velocity data, it makes sense that you guys are getting new shelf space, TDPs go up, so velocity comes down, that's mathematically sensible. But now that the shelf resets appear to be done, we're still seeing sequential velocity decline. I was just looking at the recent 1 week Nielsen data that came out. It looks like the decline continues, and it's a little bit steeper than the category itself. So I'm wondering if there's anything you guys can point to about why -- I don't know if it's a timing. I know that the shelf resets were pushed out. I don't know if it's an activation thing and maybe August will kind of recover some of that. Just anything you can give us on potentially why the velocity has been somewhat sluggish to date and what we can expect going through the rest of the summer. Yes. I think there's a couple of things. It's timing and sequencing. You saw something similar back at the end of '22 and the beginning of '23, when we saw some pretty big pickups as we moved into the Pepsi system. So unfortunately, the Celsius bus doesn't pull up and dump out all the Celsius consumers right away when we see the reset. So it's something that there's some timing and sequencing there. There was some delays in some of the resets which also delayed some of our promotional activity, but we've got a really good promotional incentive calendar in Q3 and Q4 in the back half of Q3 and throughout Q4.
So we're looking to get those velocities turned around now that we've got the space. We didn't want to start pushing a lot of stuff and a lot of activity before we got the space because then that would just do the math, and we want to make sure we're getting the ROI on these activities. So we do get a lot of good programs in place so that we can start pulling the Celsius us up to the curve and start getting the velocity improving. Yes. And I think when you -- you just got to be cautious, there's a lot of noise in the weekly data, right, and the weekly read, especially you need to pay tension to what promos were prior year. There's just a lot of noise there. I think we got great strategies. We've got great positioning. And we've been holding right around that 11% share. It's been going up and down. So we're holding. We need to continue to take it to the next level. And that's what the teams are working on this summer. . Got it. And it sounds like you guys have -- you mentioned some of your sponsorships and things like that. It sounds like you have a lot more in the pipe than you did last year. So it stands to reason that Q3 and Q4 should see probably more resilient velocities in shares than last year. I mean, last year from September through December, there was a little bit of a drop-off makes sense. It seems like that's probably less likely this year. Is that fair to say? I mean we're focused on driving share. When you look at it at this point, when the category was it last week, it was down for the first time on that weekly read. So those are challenges. We're driving the category growth rate. The category is not growing. We're over-indexing with new to category. .
So we need this category to get back to growth rate, and that's a big area we're focusing in on. And we want to drive more consumers to the category. That's what we're working with our retailers on doing that. We got some great programs coming out this summer, talked about refreshing barbecues, some great new flavors, crack-a-cold Celsius, a variety of marketing programs that we have and new tentpole programs wrapping that around with retailer and new consumer segments. So we're confident in our position. And as the back half of this year, I think it's going to be an exciting time for Celsius. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist. just a little bit more commentary about kind of the -- and I know this is kind of a best guess, but the slowing of the overall category, any thoughts of why that's happening now, what you're seeing? Is it consumer preferences to other categories? Is it weather? Just trying to understand why the overall category is starting to see some softness over these past 3, 4 months? Yes. No, it's -- when we're looking at total LRB data. So that's what Liquid Refrigerated Beverages, and you look at some of the segments from energy to CSDs to water, sports drinks, teas and juices. We're still seeing the pressure of decreases coming from juices and coffee and tea. Sports drinks has picked up the last -- if you look at July 14, starting to see more growth in sports drinks. .
And then water, we saw growth as well as CSDs. So in the energy category on a 4-week read looking at July 14, was up about 2%. So much slower than the growth rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and obviously versus the prior year. So those are things we're seeing. It looks like overall, the category is consumers are maybe taking a pause.
There's a lot of pressures from interest rates. We know the pressures are out there within the news and you guys are watching the consumers extremely closely, just like we are. I think at the end of the day, the energy category has a massive upside potential to grow and to continue to grow. It is truly a functional beverage that's aligned with lifestyles these days and Celsius is positioned to capture that. So I think we're just -- we saw your cycling growth -- great growth rates in the energy category from last year as well. So we need to be cognizant of that. and see how this plays out in the back half. I think a lot of people are optimistic for Q4, but time will tell. Okay. Great. And then just as you're looking and you might have touched upon this kind of the growth year-to-date. Have the newer flavored products been as incremental as you would expected, better than expected? Just trying to understand what's driving the growth? Is it kind of the core offerings? Or are you really seeing kind of expanding the usage with some of the new offerings? . We've got a variety of new flavors out there. We use -- it's a combination. We have a total portfolio play, so that we're leveraging. We do have -- we talked about some of the new flavors, the sparkling watermelon lemonade , which is amazing, the Kiwi strawberry and our cherry cola. So it's a combination of how that portfolio works together. We're driving the total portfolio, not a specific flavor, but we do have lead launches with key retailers on flavors, although like a cherry cola launches. It's at AMP as a lead launch. So it's a new flavor also available on Amazon and Vitamin Shoppe.
If you haven't tried it, I suggest you try it, it's a really great flavor. But as we look at it, we're really driving our total portfolio and then you have our Celsius Essentials as a great innovation in 16-ounce offering. That's performed very well since launch, and we're going to continue to grow upon that. The next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Maybe 1 housekeeping and 1 bigger picture question here. I mean maybe just to start going back to Jonathan's question, just the Pepsi inventory dynamic. Like I just want to be clear, should we expect another headwind as it pertains to 3Q to kind of take what we're seeing in the track data and then kind of backed that $20 million headwind? Or would you anticipate that track data in your reported sales would be more aligned. I just wanted to clarify that. I know there's a lot of moving pieces in 3Q and 4Q. So I think just unpacking that would be helpful. .
And then just bigger picture, I guess I would love to get some perspective on innovation and kind of future shelf space. I mean you touched on Essentials in the release it reads pretty positive, but the share data has kind of largely been flat for some time. And you touched on some new innovation. But with total company share performance flattish or down sequentially, essentials kind of flat how does what you're seeing now inform your view on how much shelf space you may get looking ahead? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you see shelf space evolving, whether you're confident retailers are going to give you the incremental space for innovation that you intend to bring to market, just given the trends we're kind of seeing today. I'll let Jarrod talk about the inventory, and I'll take on innovation. . So like I said, it was 20 to 30 when we were talking in June, ended up closer to the lower end of that range. Time will tell as we get to Q3 in terms of where we land. I think in mid-June, we were at a good point in terms of providing what we expected. I think we'll have to see where we go. So unfortunately, I can't predict what our partners will do. That's really up to them to continue to optimize their system, if it's fully optimized, then we'll be in good shape. But there's still some flexibility within that system for them to further optimize, we'll have to see where that goes. In regards to innovation, Peter, really setting it up for next year. I think what's really key is that we continue to drive the category growth rate, right, and outpacing the category. I think as we continue to do that, you have a really good selling story to retailers that you're -- number one, we're incremental. We have data that supports that. And you're driving the category growth rate within sugar-free. Those are megatrends within the category. .
We have a lot of great innovation planned for 2025, which we're really excited about. And we're actually just started initial discussions with a variety of key retailers for next year, so that have been fairly positive. So we're just kicking some of those off. We're really close to our retailers. And so I think we're in good shape as it stands now. There's a lot of time left before now and the resets for next year. But I think we're in a really good position, and our selling story is really strong, why retailers need more Celsius and what we offer and bring to them.
Also, when you look at innovation, our on-the-go powder offerings, huge opportunity there, done extremely well in a variety of national retailers. And we're going to continue to build upon that. So we got great innovation coming for 25. When you look at on the go beyond the can and the growth within water bottles and Stanley cups and a variety of other packages out there as consumers move beyond plastics. So we want to be part of that and offer that energy offering. And it's been great to acceptance within that. I will now turn the call back over to John Fieldly for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for attending our webcast this morning. Our comments today convey the confidence we maintain in our company's strength and long-term growth potential. No other brand in the last decade has disrupted the category like Celsius and we are as well or better positioned than anyone else to capture new consumers and remain the energy drink growth driver. We have excellent high-quality products that outperform with taste and refreshment a long runway, both domestically and internationally, and this season's strong shelf resets are tailwinds for us to capture greater share.
Thank you to all of our employees, investors, our partners and our customers for their unwavering effort and achievement and a vision to become the #1 energy drink brand in the world.
To all, have a safe and healthy summer. Grab a refreshing Celsius and lift it. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.","we appreciate you joining us today for the second quarter 2024 Earnings webcast . the speakers will take questions following the prepared remarks . this discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts and expectations .",0.0
