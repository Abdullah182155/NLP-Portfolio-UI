At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Roblox Q1 2021 Earnings Q&A Session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I'm now going to hand it over to Anna Yen, Roblox, Head of Investor Relations. Anna, you may begin your conference. Thanks, James. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox's first quarter 2021 results. With me today is Roblox's CEO, David Baszucki and CFO, Michael Guthrie. Before we start, I want to remind everybody that yesterday, after market close, we published a shareholder letter and earnings results on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com. Since the letter provides a lot of details, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions. For our webcast participants, please note the question icon at the bottom of your screen, where you can type in your questions. We'll do our best to take as many questions as we can today.
On today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements, including statements about our future growth rate, and business and investment strategy. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterization of future events including financial projections, future market conditions or the impact of COVID-19 on our business and on the economy as a whole is our forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements and we make no obligations to update our disclosures. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued yesterday as well as risks described in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, particularly the section titled Risk Factors. This information can also be found on other filings with the SEC when available. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued yesterday as well as in our supplemental materials, copies of which can be found on our IR website. Finally, this call is being webcast and will be archived on our website shortly after.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to David. Thanks, Anna. And thanks for everyone for joining us today. Before we start taking questions, I want to begin by saying that our hearts go out to the people around the world who are still suffering as a result of the COVID-19. It appears, we're making progress and it's also clear that this virus is still a global challenge.
Like everyone, we want to put these risks behind us as soon as possible. Just this month, at Roblox, we're going to begin to open our offices on a limited basis and we hope that by mid-September, our offices can be fully opened. This is our first earnings call, since our direct listing on March 10. Yesterday afternoon, we posted our earnings results and a letter to all shareholders as well as supplemental financial and metrics data on our Investor Relations website. We hope this information was helpful insight into our performance in Q1. It's been an exciting period, and we're looking forward to answering your questions.
With that, we'll turn it back over to the operator. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us your update or thoughts on sort of longer-term growth, specifically in the press release you did highlight great accomplishments in terms of international expansion ageing up, which I know has been a more near term and consistent growth driver for you. So when you look longer-term, like what expansion such as music, you know advertising, any kind of other sort of partnerships. What other sort of extensions do you see as more achievable sort of in the intermediate term? Thank you. Yes, thanks for your question. Let me just start by saying in the near term and in the longer term, we still see incredible opportunity in the core growth drivers, which is to continue to expand the business geographically and to grow the user base in terms of the age demographic. So we feel like we're, nowhere close to being done on those two growth factors and that is still our short-term goals press and substantial long-term goals for us to continue to expand. When we look at geographic expansion, in particular in Asia, we have a long way to go, all across Europe and we're still very optimistic about the potential for increased growth in North America and in some of our core markets, like the United Kingdom and in Scandinavia. So we still see, if we were to say, sticking to our knitting on user growth aging out and geographic, those are still really big growth drivers for us over the next few years.
In terms of platform extensions, we still are, we're obviously very excited about where the platform can go. We haven't given any specific numbers around brand partnerships or music, but you've obviously seen some progress, we talked about in the shareholder letter and we certainly see longer term potential for those expenses to our platform as well. I think, just listening off Mike, this is Dave. In Q1, or over 13 DAUs grew by 111% and our hours are up 128%. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, the first one on China, just curious, I know it's very early, but any sort of early learnings from China and just sort of as we sort of think about this opportunity. Are there any material differences that you see in the China potential user base that could cause the slope of penetration or payer growth to be different than other regions? And then secondly on aging up. David, it was good disclosure on the age up, you just mentioned, users and time spent. Can you just give us some examples of some of the content that's really driving the aging of the overall user base to sort of really realize that opportunity? Thanks. Yes, a couple of things just to share. First, in China, we do have a license. We are live and we've seen very early signs of what do you hope to happen, which is, we've seen some developers in China breaking the past [indiscernible] in the world market. And many, many world outside of China does are now live in China. The other think you know we've seen consistent growth in South Korea, in Hong Kong, in Russia, in Brazil and really in all around the world. So we can't make any forward-looking predictions on China but we see a lot of love we've have is out there. As far as aging up, we continue to impress by the quality of the content and the creation that our developers are making and more and more of the content is helping drive this exciting trend, which we're close to passing. It's not passing. Mike can chime in. I, having more of our users being 13 and over then under 13.
I'll highlight the fun and exciting and iconic game KBD [ph], which what our - which is extremely appealing to players on our platform of all ages. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. First, could you talk a little bit more about the investments in personnel of R&D made this quarter, specifically which areas of the product road map are you investing for now? And how should we think about Roblox's investments in R&D for the rest of this year and over the mid-term? And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the April bookings that you guys disclosed. Is that a good way to think about the rest of the second quarter and how are you thinking about engagement of bookings cadence through the rest of the year? Thank you. Mike and I will both answer this. I'll talk of the high level about where we're investing in R&D, then I'll kick it over to Mike for the numbers and then for April. This is an exciting thing about our platform is the breadth of technology, that supports what we're doing and we go all the way from a mobile client to 3D immersive cloud engine to developer tool-kit to back-end infra. It's an extremely broad surface area and part of our Roblox philosophy in the way we think about the company is, we need to be innovating in many, many areas is what has brought us to where we are today and what we're doing right now behind the scene is doing that again for five years out. So some of the things we've highlighted in prior calls publicly, safety and feasibility, not just being defensive but really leading the industry and creating a civil society in our platform on that all the tech behind that. And now AI including our Human Austin team of over 2000 moderators getting into the future of communication, which includes safe and civil, not just text but voice and no ship dates there but lots of great work to come there.
Our advertisements, which we've had some early announcements on some of the tech. It's really an early signal go for an advertising identities [ph]. Everyone who they want to be, whether it's the fashion model or soldier, traditional Roblox's character, coaching character. We have this wonderful mix of our clients and our infra working together to really provide these immersive experience and a lot of work going on there. So covering the place where we're investing, it's really, we do invest 80% of our, probably invest, we are staying true to the notion that about 80% of our people are working on product and engineering. We see this going into the foreseeable future. I've touched on about four times the areas, I am not going to go into all of them right now. I will take it over to Mike go-to-go more into the numbers. Sure. Hey, Mike. So, couple of things, when we did forecasting work inside the company for direct listing. Basically underlying assumptions were, we looked at all our core metrics. We obviously we're looking at it, at a time when there was sort of right in the middle of COVID and we've seen pretty big risks in our business and we made some assumptions around COVID, basically as a global situation being out of the system by the end of the second quarter. So in fact, we picked an end date so the pandemic, if you will, when we did our forecasting. Now, that hasn't happened and so there is obviously still in the second quarter. There is a combination of just core metrics and core growth and improvement in the business and so, obviously the influences of COVID are still in the numbers as well. April bookings overall, were very strong. Definitely higher than what we expected and somewhere around, I don't know, 45% to 47% of the consensus numbers for the quarter. So, April numbers were really strong. When we look at, put in the medium and longer term, I just say the following, when the pandemic started, we immediately saw engagement go out, right.
We had a substantial user base of the time when we really had more time, more time on the platform and then we grew users very quickly and those user have the ability to engage very quickly as well. Because of that we started to see really strong conversion-to-payers and really strong monetization and that's obviously reflected in the step-up in bookings that we see over the last several quarters. If you look at April, what you will see is bookings looks to be the highest growth of all of the numbers. Partly that's because bookings took a while to get going, vis-à-vis users and engagement last year and partly, I think it's because we just have, when you get down to that, those are the most clearly, the most engaged users are the ones that end up becoming payers and so we're just seeing really high conversion and monetization characteristics as we head into the rest of the year. Great. Thank you very much, Dave, Mike. Much appreciate it. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Given your experience around improving payer conversion outside of the US and Canada during 1Q, can you discuss any early observations around? What is work thus far and as economies re-open, how you are thinking about monetization overseas progressing as we move through 2021? And then secondly, the developer exchange be average about 18% of bookings in the last several quarters and your comment in the shareholder letter around returning nearly $500 million to the developer community this year, just based on 1Q the math would suggest about $2.7 billion of bookings this year. Does that make sense or how would you push back on that assumption? Thanks guys. We'll do this in the same quarter. I'll speak a bit about the stickiness of our time in and I'll take it back to Mike on the DevEx fees. We developed our DevEx economy over five years ago and when we did it, the philosophy was to create a system that connects our people, our platform with our developers and allows flexibility in our developers to create amazing content and then to monetize that and balance in premium way with our player base for the people on our platform. We, this system has turned out to be enormously powerful and as different countries have come online, whether that's the US and Canada, or whether it's Philippines, Brazil and Russia, in all of these companies over time, we've seen the combination of amazing content and the players becoming more embedded in our platform and driving higher and higher bookings per DAU. So there are no big markets that we have been turning except to provide programming tools where developers are making it increasingly high-quality content, and that's been driving the engine.
We have made some small adjustments over time and we continue to move as much money as we think is financially prudent that to the developer community. An example, in March, where we increased the engagement-based payout rate by approximately 75%, which is driving the money we're transferring to developers based on timing the new platform. So no future predictions on where Roblox is going, but this general philosophy is we want to run green business, as much as money to our development as possible. I think we'll just do that going forward and now over to Mike for the rest. Yes, one on the outputs of the engagement base payout model has been to get some economics to developers that are maybe not in the top 100, 200 series and framework. We're seeing out in that. I don't know, I going to call a long tail that we're seeing, developers are seeing early in the monetizing the platform. This is a real boost to their economics and in some cases virtually all in all, that you can simplification-based payout and that's great because it keeps them engaged in the platform and as they get better and better building amazing content that is appealing to a broader user base, but you get some feedback and economic feedback from the market, which is really wonderful. So we have high expectations of the productivity game-based payout over the next few years.
Related to your question on development expense. I think what we're really looking at is the Q1 number was almost $120 million, if you multiply $121 million times, $280 million. When you're in a company, we often have these big goals and I can remember, we did an upside, about two years ago where we really challenged ourselves to get you have $400 million of engagement-based payout, actually several years from now. And now we're in a situation, now where it seems like the right way, it could be a $0.5 billion dollars this year. So I'd say rather than giving ourselves a goal of $480 million, we like to go with $0.5 billion. Yes, I just roofing on that with Mike that goal at the outside was for total of the money through developers. We do believe long term engagement-based payouts will hit that $400 million, their piece of the total development. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Yes. Hey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Just in terms of identity, so advanced training related to clothing animations, I think you've heard some of the things you that we're pretty excited about around the directly in. Can you talk a little bit about what new technologies such as, those I mentioned, what that enables for the platform for the users and for the developers and maybe how that ultimately flows through the model financially? And then second question. It's very encouraging to see the order in the international users, continue to grow nicely, pretty remarkable, the marketing, the loan around $50 million last year in 2020. So can you maybe talk about the level of investment? How that may change in 2021 going forward as you expand your brand awareness and those areas, the required digital - I mean required a dedicated sales team, or is it more traditional channels? Thank you. Avatar, Mike you do that part. The things we shift right now are very early tax components that ultimately form the foundation for our vision around the identity and Avatar. Our vision and we shared it publicly before is, we really believe to everyone on our platform will ultimately be who they want to be and who you want to be. Avatar is very important. It's whatever we can imagine. So our vision is everything from cartoon characters to classic Roblox blocky Avatars to ultimately AAA Avatars that we see around a wide range of immersive 3D experiences. What we're building internally is technologies that allows combinatorial [indiscernible] and exclusive system where any piece of clothing works on any Avatar and also where ultimately motion integrated with this system as well, including both caption and motion as well as you can see with our acquisition of Bloom AI, a vision for ultimately including your own version to drive the face of your avatar. So it's still early and this complements our vision that ultimately our whole Avatar system including clothing bodies, face, hair animation is 100% UGC supported by our creator community. You're going to see over the next year more and more developments along this and I personally believe it's going to really expand the vision of what Roblox is. Hi, Ryan. On the economic size, that too when - the perspective that we did Investor Day, we talked a lot about the characteristics of universe and we are getting out of the importance of identity and Dave gave you some of the technical investments. It's a really good example of how investments in the platform and the power of the community come together is what we see is a spending identity, right now. It's happening with avatars so three and half years ago our split between Roblox inexperience versus on investments in Catalog and investments in the identity. So the 820 with the experience we're getting 80%,20% in the Catalogue. Since then we made the Catalog user generated and made all these investments in the platform, the technical and investments in the platform and we've seen it slowing from 80%, 20% to actually not fully to 75%, 25% and in the past quarter, it's actually about 70%, 30%. So we see users are choosing to spend more of their Roblox on their identity and still spending, or they are still growing their spend and experience, but it's clearly important to them if it on the Roblox platform to invest in their identity and if we make more investments in technology and product, what is possible, it's just going to increase. So I think we're going to see continued strong investment in the identity on the platform.
As it relates to marketing spend, you know we've always proudly focused on building great products and believing that there is on the product market fit and if you go back to the underline economic model, we generally talk about four areas of investment. There is for the big cost buckets, there is there is end processing, which we've talked about. There is personnel, which is 80% engineering and product people. There is the money we share with the developers in the community. And then as trust and safety and infrastructure and then everything else we're just really, really careful about spending and that model is really efficient for us over the years. It's been a really great new economics and we've, I guess in a situation where we haven't had to spend a lot of money to drive user growth. That organic signals is one that tells us that the product is doing well. And so I don't think you should expect to see us change that over the next few years. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Go ahead, please. Your line is open Hey, good morning. David and Mike. Couple of quick ones from me. I guess is there any way to talk about or quantify or give us any color on kind of what the pipeline looks like for branded experiences, for music experiences in a year maybe now versus where we were, I don't know six or twelve months ago. Any color there? And then, just secondly around subscription, I guess the question is, are we still kind of moving up into the right in terms of mix and anyway to gauge maybe what inning we're in terms of getting subscription. So I guess kind of hold, kind of trade, kind of run rate. Any color would be helpful as well. Thanks guys. Yes. First on the pipeline around immersive experiences. We can't announce anything but historically, if one looks at what we've done starting with Lil NAS X, going to Ava Max, going to One World Together, going through Royal blood at the Bloxys. There has been enormous progress there and we're very optimistic that in the future being together in immersive 3D concert with friends is different than watching on a screen. And as we come back together following the pandemic, I think we've all learned how amazing these types of experiences can be. So we're very optimistic about this. We're not going to announce anything but more and more technology, those the invasiveness, the ability for IO to be station, ability to top one again in is going to support more and more amazing experiences. I'll talk a little about subscriptions and I'll take it over to Mike, on the numbers. It's also, we have a vision that ultimately and once again those ship dates, the types of experiences in the measures are going to be supported by engagement, they're going to be supported by transactions and they're going to be supported by advertising.
And when we look at some of the types of experiences that we can imagine on the platform, there will be some of the experiences that are more and more subscriptions supported, just like many of our experiences, our premium right now. So there is a range of functionality that we will be rolling out over the next few years to support those types of experiences and it's very, very early in where we see subscription lying. That said, our current people who have Roblox premium retain amazingly well. It's a wonderful source of virtual currency for Roblox and even subscription that we have them right now are wonderful, really ways for people to buy Roblox and to retain. Hey Matt. On your questions with pipeline of brands and uses and the answer, we are not going to be able to share specifics around pipeline. We made some comments in the shareholder letter on both brands and music, and I would expect to have in most quarters over the next several. We will be making some references to things that we're doing. If you were to ask [indiscernible] and his team, my guess is the pipeline of brand, there are more and more brands are interested in the platform of our size and scale. That's a way to reach a user base that's large and growing and very engaged. So there is no doubt the brands are quite interesting. We gave two examples, three examples, in the shareholder letter, I think one of the things that I like the most about it is that the brands are working with our community to build their experiences.
So that's just a really great way, another way for our developers to build cool stuff and see some economics, and so that's just great. Your question about subscription. The only thing I would add two comment on subscription is that if you're looking at the sources of Roblox purchases, the rate of growth in subscription is faster than the rate of growth of [indiscernible]. Both are still very important to us. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the brand's question that you just had prior. Can you talk about two things, one, the role that robustly, specifically playing in shepherding these brands and media companies onto the platform and as brands do come on, is that a discrete revenue opportunity for you and how do you think about sizing the overall advertising opportunity on the platform? And then I have a follow-up. Sure, well on, we talked about the brand. We do have a dedicated team under credit organization that is responsible for brand partnerships and that is those quite honestly, inbound but also proactive calling and coverage of businesses in retail, media, entertainment et-cetera. They do a great job, again as a platform that will be attractive to advertisers, I think we have certain characteristics that are very interesting. Ultimately, the way we do advertising will be largely different than I think anybody else, we expect it to be different, a CPM kind of a business. So there is a dedicated team. They are active in the market talking to brands about our platform and what it means, our user community, our level of engagement. This is a user base, it's hard to reach, especially in the digital world and when you're - it is not the right way to reach this audience as well or is it not a growing way to reach its audience.
So ultimately, we're really optimistic, but it's still really early and so when you ask about sizing the market, I mean there is a lot of other companies are pure advertising model you probably used to build the model but for now, I just wouldn't be putting a lot of revenue in the business - in our business plan. We're optimistic about where to go but right now we're, it's not as though, there is a certain deliverables for that team for 2021. And I just riff on Mike at this. Looking more forward without giving anything specific from a vision point of view, an exciting thing about brands connecting with people in immersive platforms like Roblox, is it's a non-interrupt model. It's a native immersive experience where right now people on our platform, in Eugene products, were right now without stopping or without being interrupted, our players have team branding from, for example, Scooby Doo [ph] movies. So there is a whole different way of advertising, reaching consumers without interrupting and with experiences that feel natural. Ultimately, my hope is the size of the opportunity is related to the total hours of immersion we provide. And in April that was over $3.2 billion hours. So that is one way to think about what this might be. Okay. And then, just a follow-up on DevEx. We talked about the 75% increase in engagement-based payouts and presumably that to help like the real UGC creators that are the core Roblox. But there is also been a professionalization of studio being built on your platform, it's being backed by a lot of venture money that's come in over the past year. And does that put any pressure on you to also change the Roblox exchange rates, especially there is actually pressure on those studio to dollar return and pay employees in dollars and not Roblox. And then also on DevEx, to what extent do you see competition playing in your payout to creators on the platform? Yes, great question. Over the last four to five years, every year, as we track what development number, one developer, ten developers, a hundred developers, thousand make. We've seen all of these categories continue to grow and the total amount of money now going to each of those categories just continue to grow and I believe will keep growing. So the developers coming to our platform looking for can I support or can we support a studio. And our largest studios now are in individual hobbyist. They haven't seen the 10, 20, 30, 40 professional debts and that's part of why we're seeing all of this money flow into the platform. All of this developers and creators earn Roblox are UGC creators, whether it's developer number one or developer number 1000 in the pipeline. And so there is a complementary system where even way down that develop their number 10,000 as Mike mentioned earlier, there is an organic effect when that shift shows a surprisingly because that experience, that is really experimental.
We believe there is an interaction with that developer where it's motivational to create content on our platform and it contributes to the funnel of the developer there rising the ranks to thousands, 251 and ultimately number one. And so even our top developers participated in engagement-based payout. The other thing is to note, we never would announce a future increase in our DevEx. That said, historically, we have done it several times over the years as our P&L and balance sheet makes it prudent. So our top line philosophy is to move as much money into the hands of these developers as possible. Hey, Brandon. Remember also when we look at the value proposition for developers on our platform, it's a little bit different than in other places, we use our tools, our servers, cost of operation, safety, customer support, billing, collection and obviously a large audience. That's really what you get when you come on the Roblox platform. To your comment and correct insight that you do pay developers in dollars. In 2018, the developer community made $72 million. In 2021, as we said, we have a goal, we hope that we can get $0.5 billion. So the growth in $72 million to potentially $500 million is a lot of incremental dollars. And so we're trying to build the biggest pool of capital that can support the biggest audience of engage and excited developers as we possibly can. And in terms of just the multiples of the dollars available on the growth rate of those, I think that Roblox is tough to beat. Great. Thanks very much. Thanks, Bran. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Yes, thanks guys. Couple of quick ones for me. Early, you talked about the mix shift towards virtual items for identity and the Avatar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the payout economics there, a little bit lower. So, that seems like that would be accretive to margin all those contracts we make sure that we have that right and then just secondly, I was wondering if there is any movement, anything you could say about, you're getting Roblox onto PlayStation switched some of these other the platform. Just any movement on those, on those fronts? Thanks again, guys. Yes, I'll take the Matthew's question, then I'll turn off to David. You are correct in that, the ratios are different. On the other hand, given the size and scale of the business in the investments that we're making, I would just caution everyone against looking at margin leverage, immediately happening or in the next few quarters. We obviously to get the unit economics of the business are quite positive and we're happy with the cash flow that the business is generating. On the other hand, we see our role right now as investors in this business are not as optimizes in the margin and I don't mean in the majority sense, we have such a big opportunity. We are so far from the user base and the scale we want this business to be. We have so many things we want to invest in product and technology that will enable more and more developers to build incredible content and bring that's a broader set of users that we still much more focused on those investments.
Again, hiring more people. It's great to be have over 1,000 employees and it's amazing how we've grown our employee base over the last few years. But the investment of the business, I think you're talking about $1 billion of users, will take us thousands and thousands of employees. So we had a long way to go in terms of investment in growing the headcount in the business. And as we've been talking about the economics for the developer community, if we keep our eyes focused on that. I think generally, that will just same time dividends because will ultimately drive greater growth in the top part of the business. And then listening on devices. There is a wonderful historical context to this, I guess, all the way back, there is a life were prior to that acute dimensional html content was not consumable on mobile devices and all of a sudden with the - what you can see on your desktop was the same as what we can see on the phone and was pivotal. We've the same vision for the immersive 3D multiplayer cluster of the Medivir's and we believe this should be accessible on all devices both from giving as well as interaction. And we really innovated around on this, on phone, tablet, computer and Xbox console, showing that developers can create content that when pushed to our cloud runs on all of these devices as well as auto translates into multiple languages. So absolutely long-term switch PlayStation Quest, all of these platforms make perfect sense for Roblox. What you've seeing right now and is an incredible focus on the phone by us, which we believe is an incredibly difficult form factor in the most difficult form factor for that immersion, but these are all logical platform and at the same time we won't share any ship dates for them. Our next question comes from the line of David Gibson with Astra's Advisory. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Thank you. Just further on your April DAU trend comments, you said the growth was some 37%. Can you give us a sense of how that is different amongst the major regions like US, Canada, Europe, APAC, rest of the world? And then secondly thinking as you emerge from COVID. Have you seen different trends that our countries that don't have much COVID like Taiwan, Australia and others, that is different will give you an insight into how you think US and Europe will play out in the future? Thank you. Hi, David. Thanks for the question. If you go to the supplemental materials on the website, we break down users by region and by age. And so those regional numbers in Q1 and those trends that you've seen over the last few quarters, pretty much translate into the April numbers, I don't know, if it's absolutely exact but my strong expectation is when you look at it will be pretty similar meaning. The highest growth regions will be Asia-Pacific in Europe and slightly trailing in terms of growth in year-over-year growth in April will be the US and Canada. Okay. Around the world, it's hard to get a great signal to find a country that is representative of the rest of the world where you saw a big COVID spike in 2020 and then you vaccinated or you have herd immunity or whatever it is. Analysis is now you don't have COVID, which is really difficult to get an absolutely clear signal. What we do see around the world is continued high rates of conversion. That's probably the one thing that seems characteristic of countries even as COVID isn't as big an issue as it was prior. But I wouldn't say we have a project signal. Right now, the US is 65% of the bookings, and so we're just still elevated in the United States. And so I, we don't get that much signal from other parts of the world. Haven't actually looked at Taiwan specifically, so maybe will go off and do that homework and see what that tells us. Okay. And then, just generally, how should we think about the seasonality of May and June versus April? I mean I know it's like a pre-COVID world. We see the normally grow anyway or do they slowdown? How should we think about those? Yes, normal seasonality, David, is that April has Easter and so it's a little bit bigger than May. And then in June, your seasonality is better than May because basically schools out. And so we see normal seasonality, we see a big, a big jump in June versus May and we got to decline May versus April. We didn't have that seasonality last year, right. We were just growing straight through it. So we will be very interesting to us to see if we see some of that seasonality, I wouldn't be surprised if we do. Last year there was no way for seasonality to come through. This year, I would suspect that's what you'll see slight sequential decline in May, and then June probably picking up. That's the normal seasonality. Okay, that's great. Thanks very much. Yes. No problem. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Anna Yen for some webcast questions. Hi. All right. First one is from Ryan [ph]. How do you think about Roblox in potential and education? Have you considered creating educational programs for high school? Do you see this is an enormous opportunity? Great question, Ryan. And even when we started the company Roblox, we have the vision that the best way to help learning was to build a very high-quality consumer platform that was free for everyone with the notion that there is enormous educational opportunity. The educational opportunity on our platform is really a stack and it starts with maybe the more traditional expected learning to create, learning to code, learning to be a designer, learning to be an artist, learning to be a producer. We already see this manifest at both within schools, within summer camps and more and more we have a vision that learning computer science will be happening on top of emerge platform by Roblox. It is just so fun and it's so organic, and we have over $8 million creators right now on the platform, who are really learning all of this stuff because it's fun to create stuff and share it with friends. But going beyond this, we go to the next level where as we start to think about what went on in COVID, the ability at times is not be together on the platform. With certain educational opportunity that started to parallel books and video and we use the classic example when we're studying ancient room, in the future we'll read about it, we'll watch video about it but cautions will do the ancient rooms together and immerse in it and we think these will all be viable ways about learning and emphasizing and understanding.
Way out in the future, we're very optimistic about people who don't have access to certain schooling or education either geographically or for other reason. Really using the measures to participate substantially in learning activities and so this such a bright future around supporting education on all of these level. We're starting to support external vendors as well as our own internal curriculum and we think there's a bright future there. Thanks, Dave. The next one is from Justin. Can you discuss any plans you have regarding video content integration in some live experiences and do you see video as a potential extension to attract new users and to further monetize the platform? Yes, great question. And for those of us that participated in the One World Together experience on Roblox. You got a little sense how we view video. We are creating and supporting immersive 3D experience. With our friends, we can go places together, we can go to a concert, we can play together, we can work together, we can go to school altogether. And just in the real world, when we go to concerts and there are videos stream, then there are performance live. Video is going to be very common in the [indiscernible]. So the primary to us right now of all of our work around video is mimicking the work, the real world and making that video available within the experiences. Why don't we can imagine a lot of other interesting video experiences on our platform as well with streaming things that typically happen right now on partners like YouTube or Twitch and there is a huge video ecosystem around Roblox with our influencers, it's just not on our platform right now. We don't have any future forward-looking statements around product in that area. And I think we got time for one more, one or two more. Roblox has shown impressive growth in our international market and what is driving that? Is it technology? Is it content? Or is it the flywheel? Can you comment on that? Great question. Yes, yes, yes. And what has driven our growth historically has been a dual loop and it's unique to this class of platforms is a loop around great content. The higher the quality of the content, the bigger the economy. The bigger the economy, the larger teams are able to make content mix it up and coming UGC creators. And better content, the more people come to the platform, but that content then serve as a foundation for a second viral loop, where the more my friends on the platform, the more exciting is your need to come to the platform and hang out play, work, learn experienced entertainment within that content. So it's yes to all of those. All of these work together in to viral loops to drive our growth. Right. I think we can wrap that up. Cool. Well, team, thank you all. Really appreciate it. And thank you for all of the great questions. I just want to thank everyone out there including members of the Roblox community for joining us today. And it's really exciting building this [ph] metaphors, we're really excited about what's ahead for us. And finally, reach out to the world, we are, really reach out for all of the countries that are working through COVID and we hope we're done with this as soon as possible.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session.
[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator's instructions]. I'll now hand the conference over to Anna Yen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox in second quarter 2021 results. With me today is Roblox's CEO David Baszucki, and CFO Mike Guthrie.
Before we start, I want to remind everybody that yesterday after market closed, we published the shareholding letter earnings results and supplemental materials on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com. Since the letter provides a lot of details, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions.
For our webcast participants, please note the question icon at the bottom of your screen where you can type in your questions. We'll do our best to take as many as possible.
On today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements including but not limited to statements about our future financial performance, growth rates in business and investment strategy and plan, development of new technologies, investment in and payments to developers, our ability to bring new brands, music, and recording artists to this platform, investments in international growth, the development of the members, the outcome of any litigation, and the success of and plans for recent acquisitions.
Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events including financial projections, future market conditions, or the impact of COVID on our business and on the economy as a whole, is a forward-looking statement and based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements and we make no obligations to update our disclosures.
For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued yesterday as well as risks described in our filings with the SEC including in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed for the fiscal quarter ended March 30th, 2021, and other filings and reports we make with the SEC from time to time.
We will also discuss the non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non - GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued yesterday, as well as in our supplemental slides, copies of which can be found on our Investors Relations website.
Finally, this call is being webcast and will be archived on our website shortly after. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. We'll start with Mike Guthrie [Indiscernible] and then I'll chime in later. Just before we hand it over to Mike, welcome everyone to our Q2 call. Reaching out to everyone out there and your families in the midst of a lingering COVID situation. We hope you are all doing well. It's been an amazing quarter for us.
A year ago, we were in the midst of lockdown. It's the first quarter when we started to see a little light at the end of the tunnel. We're extremely proud and excited with our results. Mike is going to kick it off, and then I'll follow up with some comments. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday we published for the Q2 numbers. And we also published key metrics for the month of July, so you can see how we're doing as we start the third quarter. Just so everyone understands, we'll also be publishing August metrics in the second week of September. Look for those as a bit of an update in the quarter in Q3.
And secondly, we want to go over -- it's still booking versus revenue, and completely understand that it's confusing. Booking, the best way to think about booking is the value of Robux virtual currencies purchased within the quarter. And then revenue is taking into account the deferred revenue as a result of the bookings.
And you recognize our bookings generally over a 23-month period which is the average life of a pair and those numbers can change with -- the life of pair will change over time and we will adjust our deferrals as a result of that. We've seen certain things in the process comparing our revenue number to our bookings number and it causes a little bit of confusion.
We currently understand the adjusted Clarity bookings in the quarter were 665.5 million. And revenue -- GAAP revenue was 454.1 million and that was up about 127% year-over-year of bookings, number was up 35% year-over-year. Anyway, sometimes in the analyst models, people call it bookings and sometimes people are referring to it as revenue.
I believe if I look at all the model, I believe with the analysts mean is bookings in all other models and some of them refer to that as revenue. If there's any confusion, feel free to ask questions on the call and we will go through with everybody.
The other thing we want to just get out is that when people were going through their models, we have $52 million accrual in the quarter for litigation settlement with some of the labels and publishers in the music industry. And so if you're doing adjusted EBITDA or cash flow number just make sure that you understand that accrual is in there. And we believe that's one-time in nature.
And so I just want to make sure that that is properly accounted for in your models. If there's any questions, feel free to ask about that. Overall, we ended the second quarter really stronger, mapping COVID, obviously, this quarter continue to grow the business and really started off Q3 strong with July. So looking forward to talking more, and before we jump into questions, I'm going to return back to Dave. Yeah, just a couple of highlights. Looking at our core user base, once again, very proud with our 29% DAU growth year-on-year, specifically because we've been lopping that super lockdown quarter in Q2 a year ago. Jumping to a bit of a vision we shared with all of you over the last 6 to 9 months about the future growth vectors for Roblox, one thing we're really excited about is our virtual [Indiscernible] growth.
We have passed having the majority of people on our platform be 13 and over as opposed to 13 and under, which is a huge benchmark for us. And in Q2, we saw 46% 13 and up DAU growth year-on-year, which is a great bellwether for where we're going. Internationally, in Q2, second big thing, part of our vision of really bringing the whole world together, we saw 42% DAU growth outside the U.S. and Canada, which we think is spectacular.
And we've also seen in response to this, a broadening and acceleration of the diversity of content on our platform which has been very satisfying as well. In Q2 last year, 58% of the remarks were coming from the top 10 experiences. That curve has flattened a bit as we have a wider array of content, and that number is now 37% in Q2 of this year. Lots of fun stuff. Looking forward to diving in with your questions. And we'll turn it back to Anna. Great. Actually, I will turn it over to the Operator. Operator, you want to start taking questions? Yes. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Hi. This is David Karnovsky for Alexia. I will start with the Guilded acquisition. Dave, can you maybe discuss how you plan to integrate their platform with Roblox? Do you see Roblox users on Guilded communities now? And if so, how do you see that impacting their overall experience? And then how do you plan to maintain support to the non-Roblox communities that are on Guilded? Thanks. Yes. This really goes to a bit of our vision here. And when we speak about Roblox, we are an immersive 3D, metaverse platform Company. There are complementary product categories.
Gilded within one, we might call that the social communication and community platform area. We're really interested in the way these types of product work together. We see our -- people who play Roblox use various apps sometimes to hop from place to place and communicate outside of those apps.
Even though, internally, we simultaneously are hard at work on immersive spatial audio for people who are in 3D. Gilded, we came across in an amazing team. They're also extremely innovative in a lot of their ideas [Indiscernible] developing in this area of social communication platform.
It gives us the opportunity in an open way to experiment with the various ways these classes of applications work together. More to come on that in the future announcements, but it really gives us the opportunity to experiment with APIs and how these products work together. Okay. And then I was just hoping you could expand on your shareholder letter commentary on Roblox in China so far. What do we learn? How are users engaging with the experiences there relative to what you might have seen in other launch markets? And just as a follow-on, how do you evaluate the current or future regulatory risk in the market? Thank you. Yeah. A couple of things we've started to see that we [indiscernible] can see, and one is, with this vision of a worldwide platform that simultaneously is compliant with local customs and regulations, and things like that. We've seen a few things.
One is we've started to see amazing content come out of China and start to get the worldwide platform. Livetopia coming out of China and it's one of the top 12 experiences on Roblox, which is amazing. We've also seen very great success with a lot of the U.S. global content going into China, which is also a bilateral network effect.
We're really excited about the traction we've seen in China with respect to just the initial user growth. And especially in China, education is so important, both learning to code, learning to create, that we think there is amazing opportunities there to adapt and be beneficial there.
I just saw some stats in South Korea which shows how well our platform is working, in that the top 10 experiences in South Korea are somewhat different than the top 10 in the U.S. There's a lot of overlap with some of the very top U.S. experiences but we can also see South Korea -created experiences emerging into that top 10. And it's -- our system is working.
We're seeing both cultural affinity mixed with global hits. We're very excited with the growth we've seen in China so far. It's been really gratifying to be live there in both the iOS and the Android, coupled with our partner Tencent and a government license. I think great opportunity and at the same time consistent with our values, we take a very long view in China. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is: In the second quarter, it looks like U.S. and Europe, DAUs were down quarter-over-quarter. You talked to us about sort of what you're seeing in July and August in the U.S. and Europe DAUs and sort of some of the drivers of that DAU decline? And then secondly, a bigger picture one on the competition for developers, specifically the highest quality developers.
Dave, maybe talk to us about how you think about continuing to bring on and retain the highest quality developers for the ecosystem, in particular now that you have some other social networks with large budgets and capability to invest to build a metaverse potentially offering developers even higher take rates or higher and better economics, etc. Okay. Got it. First, on DAUs in U.S. and Canada, year-over-year in Q2, they were up about 5%. I think you're referring to engagement which was down year-over-year. First of all, largest market, most users to begin with -- I think in the second quarter, it's pretty clear that as we have referenced and anticipated when we went public and we talked about the only guidance we've ever given, we expected that during the second quarter, COVID -- our modeling assumption was that COVID would go away during the second quarter.
And then we would return to normal curves on sign-ups and retention conversion in monetization. That's very similar to what happened in the second quarter. By the end of the second quarter in June, there was a lot of ""reopening"", especially in the U.S. and Canada and the United Kingdom, and some of that has reflected in engagements, though, substantially higher than it was in 2019 on a year-over-year basis.
Flux was slightly down and then now in July, it looks like some of those trends are reversing themselves. The overall growth in the quarter was definitely driven by Asia-Pacific and rest of world which includes South America and Eastern Europe. I think that's just to make sure that we get the trends exactly right. And then this is Dave chiming in on the take rate and just a little bit of our vision going forward. For 15 years, we've been building this platform, and we've been supporting that with three major tenets. One is driving innovation, really participating in inventing and shepherding in the
metaverse and in an innovative way. And what's got us here so far is many, many innovations, and we have to keep having those in the pipeline and we're trying to scale that linearly as we grow our employee base.
Last year at this time, we had 750 employees. We're over 1,200 this year at the same time. The second thing is, historically, we've been a [Indiscernible] of secure play for the last 15 years. Everything we do piles into making our platform better, and we iterate that with 14 groups every single day in shifting new and interesting functionality.
And third, we're in a really unique position with the foundation of stability and safety and learning. And we're growing from there. And we think that's a very positive place for people to come together of all ages, and it's a great foundation to build a really big Company on.
On the check rates, in Q2, we have upped our engagement-base payouts. We -- as you can see this, I think we announced a 129 million to devs in Q2, so that's on a great track. In general, we much prefer money flowing to creators systemically as part of the self-service UGC architecture, as opposed to any hand-given grant-type program.
And that number is going to keep going up. You can also see with how much cash we're generating when you look at our bookings, cash flow-type accounting, there's a lot of ring there. We're not making any announcements on the increases to our developer rate.
But generally, we want to maximize the amount we're using for our employees and for our creativity, as well as what's flowing to our developers. And more to come there without any future announcements. Got it. And just to clarify that, Mike. This is from a modeling perspective. The July DAU trends you're seeing, are you saying you're seeing U.S. and Europe DAUs up quarter-over-quarter, or is that more driven by rest of world? Just so we can understand the modeling. I'll double-check, Brian. I think it's driven by all regions. Okay. Great. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. You guys have made a ton of progress in diversifying your experiences and edging up your user base. I was just wondering if you could talk about a few of the drivers that have led to that and how that strengthens the durability of the business.
And then as a quick follow-up, I was just wondering if you could preview some of the takeaways that you'd like the investment community to get from your Investor Day later this year. Thank you. Yeah, this is Dave. I think what we're going to be showing at our Investor Day is as much transparency as we can with respect to those and what we're shipping right now, as well as our future vision. And hopefully give a glimpse into the architecture of the Company and the architecture
we built to drive innovation. So look forward to some coverage, hopefully, of the whole product stack, went all the way from our apps on multiple platforms to our game engine, to our developer tooling, to our -- the technology we use to make experiences run all around the world.
All the way into our platform and in through, which allows us to run a high performance and high reliability at low cost. We're hoping to show as much of this as we can and enhance the vision in all of these areas without at the same time announcing any public shift at Investor Day.
Great stuff to talk about. We're actually in the middle of it, and we've been talking about it for 3 or 4 years. And a lot of the visionary stuff we put in place 3 or 4 years ago is what's been driving this position now where over 50% of the people on our platform are over 13.
The -- that includes often personalized search and discovery, it includes increasing the version of our 3D engine, and it includes also a lot of things that we've spoken about that haven't quite shift now. We've given highlights that our Avatar system has a lot of opportunity.
And it's going to go full UGCU, which will radically increase the diversity of the types of Avatars on our platform, which is super exciting. We've given handset over time. We would expect maybe for those to be more familiar with the movie industry, not R rated, but PG and maybe PG-13-type similarities and some of the experiences we do.
And we've also been very, very hard at work with the philosophy that we're building a unified platform that has been a safe, civil, and educational for a 6-year-old, while simultaneously very interesting for 22 year old. That goes all the way from our branding to the performance of our app to the way people find content, to the way we matchmake people. So it's actually something we're right in the middle of.
The amount of white space in the 13 and under market relative to our TAM is enormous because we've gotten to where we are very heavily on a very small sliver of the world population 9 through 12 year old. We think a lot of these early signs for 13 and up bode well for us. Okay. Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Hey, this is Anthony Duplisea on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Wanted to ask about content expansions outside of gaming experiences. You talked about how the pipeline is evolving with music, cars, to labels.
Are there any -- is there any momentum with PDS Studio networks and online market companies? And then how and when could these Company expansions start to have an impact on financials? Thanks. Yeah. So I love that you brought up online learning. It starts internally, we have a very big vision around education on the Roblox platform. And it goes as you -- I think my hint at way beyond learning computer science, it goes into learning all topics.
It goes on to learning about history immersively, all the way to learning about physics by jumping into a physics experiment. So we are hard at work. We've gone on educational vertical segment and more to come on that within Roblox.
Really, when we think about the metaverse and what Roblox is, we do think it as a utility where there's going to be a lot of use cases that we can't even imagine right now. The Gucci Garden experience really for us was really interesting.
It's not really a concert, it's not really a game, it's almost like going to Norma and going to an art installation. It's really the first Roblox experience my father really liked and -- just the ability to go around and see what's going on there.
And that couples with Netflix's Stranger Things experience on Roblox which is much more around letting fans participate in an experience immersively, rather than watching it. And then that jumps to our vision that our hopes for the future of music where for artists and musicians today who are very creative, they need to support their careers, it's primarily live concerts or recorded right now.
And those live concerts are wonderful and they're immersive, but it's hard to get more than 20,000 people or 50,000 people into a live concert. Whereas with a Zara Larsson Launch Party, for example, we've been able to go well over 4 million. And those numbers go higher still.
We're very optimistic about our future where musicians can use immersive 3D with live participation that feels very different than watching video. It's with other people. We're very optimistic as a third monetization area for musicians to interact with their fans. And, Anthony, I'll just point out that in the -- in things like Gucci Garden since we're monetizing today in very traditional ways. There's purchase of virtual goods, there was a store that launch point of Gucci Garden, and it was obviously getting complimentary with users who purchased millions of dollars of virtual items. So today, their traditional funds and monetization in the future, we obviously can imagine just the things that we can do with the brands to expand that and with the developer community as well. Of course. Thanks, Mike. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike, wonder if you could drill down a little bit further on the monetization of the up-style metric that you disclosed. It seemed to flatten out in 2Q. Can you discuss some of the puts and takes on that metric? And then, Dave, just to circle back on the brand partnerships in music experiences, can you talk about any observations you've made in terms of how that's impacted new user growth and what you've seen in terms of retention/engagement trends for that cohort? Thanks. Hey, Drew, in 3 thoughts on monetization. One is we talked earlier, there was a clear broadening of content on Roblox over the last year. As more experiences are part of the monetization engine, some of those experiences are early on and then curves of learning actually how to
monetize. And so it's not unusual. A lot of things we do with Roblox, you can model through the experience curves. And so -- and some of these experiences are on the platform for longer periods of time. The developers will learn better how to monetize and users will be more
engaged and they will want to monetize better. So that's one. The second thing is geographic diversification in our base. Obviously when you look at growth in Asia-Pacific and other parts of the world, again, some of those parts of the world are similar to slightly lower GDP per capita.
You might have more monetization in those parts of the world. You also have early-payer cohorts. Those payer cohorts, as they get older -- and we've seen over many, many years on Roblox is payer cohorts tend to increase cumulative bookings quarter after quarter after quarter.
We still have -- if we can go back to 2016 and look at Q1 2016 payer cohorts, and the cumulative bookings of that payer cohort is continuing to grow at a very consistent and healthy rate. Some of these new users and new geos are early in their -- as payer cohorts, and they're early and maturing and overtime, they will increase cumulative booking and bookings overall.
My third comment on monetization is simply, just be careful when you're comparing ratios. We can have very strong bookings and very strong user growth and app DAU can go down. So is the ratio.
If your users are going faster than your bookings, that would lead you to understand that in the future, you got some really powerful tailwinds around bookings but the users might just be growing faster right now. Similarly, if you look at just July, hours of engagement was really strong. 3.8 billion hours, quite honestly, was a big number.
It's probably more than we expected to come out. So if I happen to be looking at bookings per hour, I might have looked at that number as having gone down in July. And I can tell you, we're very happy with bookings and are very happy with ours.
So when you get to the ratio you just might have a little bit of movement back and forth. So in time and within ratio is we should just be careful and make sure we deconstruct that into the growth in the numerator and growth in denominator. But, overall, I think all of those things are weighing in, Drew. Thanks. Yeah. And, hey, this is Dave, just following up on the brand partnerships. I'm really excited about the brand partnerships and at the same time, our core growth is driven primarily virally, well beyond the size of the user traffic we're getting from those brand partnerships.
And that is organic word of mouth growth. People talking to friends coming to the platform, being referred by friends. I think we have a bit of a vision starting all the way from our foundation, that Roblox ultimately is a platform that people will use every day to play, to work, to learn together, to communicate together, to be together as a utility when they can't be together in person.
And some music and concerts are an exciting way of possibly bringing people to the platform. But the retention comes from staying with friends and socializing with friends and playing with friends, following that. I don't -- it might be a little controversial.
We don't need music events to grow this business enormously large. And we don't factor in -- them as a traffic source. The business is growing organically. But they are a wonderful thing on top of our core organic growth. And I think ultimately, there's a vision where these concerts and experiences will be more and more self-service.
We're really focused on building the tools and technology. Just like games and experiences, concerts are built by a wide network of intermediaries. And we also have a vision ultimately that they're going on all the time, just as play is going on all the time right now. Your next question will come from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a big-picture one to start. And one of the more interesting parts of earnings this quarter was when Zuck said that Facebook is now a metaverse Company.
And I wanted to get your perspective on how you think a broader metaverse will play out in the future. Do you see a distributed metaverse like the broad internet or one dominated by a few key platforms like social media? And do you think companies like Facebook will have a real place in the metaverse, or do you think metaverse native companies will be the only real winners? Yeah, that's a wonderful question. It goes to what we've been doing for 15 years. And I'll start with a couple of comments, just big picture comments. The technology is very complex.
The technology to support ultimately a 50,000 person concert where we all feel like we're there, we can talk to our friends next to us, we can wave across the stadium, it feels photo-realistic.
The audio is awesome, and there's 50,000 people doing that. That's a huge technological challenge. And side by -- so that technological challenge, I just want to put that out there in that it's very exciting that there's so much work to do.
And we're pretty far into this. If we look back to second-line [Indiscernible].com, this started a long time ago so there's a lot of fun stuff to do. Our focus for the last 15 years has been on innovation, and invention, and really shepherding in where we feel the metaverse is going to go.
Whether it's when we had 4 people and now we have 1,200 people, that will continue. There is a wonderful focusing effect for a Company like ours when we're only working on one thing. And everything we do piled into making this single platform better and better.
We do have this Roblox benefit of extreme focus with now 1,200 people on that growing. The other thing that we believe that long term for a metaverse utility, it must be a civil and fixed platform that welcomes 6-year-olds, and at the same time welcomes 30-year-olds who are working together.
This is very complicated and it's -- this takes -- I think it's much easier to start from that stability and safety combination and then open up the freedom, than to try to reel it back in and go the other direction. And so we really think that's a wonderful opportunity for us as well. I think as far as openness, we're signaling that with our acquisition with Guilded right now.
And we do think the various components that people might create and use as part of their metaverse experience, including the way a social community communication app interacts with an immersive 3D spatial audio app is very interesting. And I think there's amazing opportunity for creativity on that integration. So those are a few hints at how we view, what we're doing for the last 15 years and what we'll do for the next 15 years. Well, maybe just a follow-up on Guilded. And I saw that voice and video were a big part of that. I wanted to ask if you move from more tech space communication to integrating voice and video for communications, from -- how much harder of a problem is that from a safety
perspective and how prepared are you for the explosion of those form of communications on Roblox? We take it -- it's really our top priority. Civility [Indiscernible], whether it goes to how we filter text, whether it goes to thousands now of live human moderators out in the field, whether it goes to the ML that we use to filter, it's always been our top priority. And doing this for voice and video, ultimately is very complex.
It's something we take very seriously. But we -- we'll come at it from that safe foundation that we've always had. On the audio side, to clarify, I believe there's two classes of audio. What Guilded does is -- think of it as team audio.
It's the audio, maybe like in a phone call, really that groups of players use that they opt around various experiences. And I think we've in our Guilded announcement, we haven't done anything with Guilded, that they will still not keep working with other platforms as well.
There's a lot of people from many, many gaming communities on the Guilded platform. Simultaneously, we have a vision of metaverse audio. It's what we shared with you, and that's what we do at our Company holiday parties. It's what we've been prototyping internally, which is really true 3D immersive audio. We think these are going to complement each other in a wonderful way. Thank you. We'll now take questions from the webcast audience. Okay. The first one is from Richard J. (ph). Can we talk about the trends, particularly usage and spending trends, between the over-13 and under-13 audience? I'll pass that over to Mike. Yeah. They're incredibly similar, is the short answer. If you -- share engagement and monetization in -- whether under 13 or over 13 is actually quite similar. And the follow-up to that was being curious if we're seeing partnerships with Gucci helps stimulate demand for Avatar personalization? This is a really great, big question. The demand is everywhere. And when people participate in an immersive 3D environment, It's so important. We all want it, and our younger players want it, and our older players want it.
Everyone wants to represent themselves in the metaverse in a way they feel proud of and they feel comfortable with. And when we look at how we work in the real world, I was very picky today on what shirt I picked out, what shoes I wore, how I cut my hair.
This all applies in the digital world as well, and it goes to body, clothing, hair, clothing, hair, makeup, accessory, glasses, everything.
So building a system where we can have a vibrant market, where people can mix and match, where clothing items work on any Avatar, where people can have anybody they want and any face they want, is super important to us. And I think it's worthy. It's really been part of Roblox since we started and there's an amazing opportunity there. Great. We've got a lot of questions coming in about China, particularly, what is our response to the government's comments on the dating case. Yeah. We're -- one of the reasons that Tencent and Roblox was so excited about going into China is how focused parents and kids are in China on education, and how focused they are on learning to code, on participating in creation. And that thread, it has been very, very powerful to us.
The other thread that has been very powerful to us is, country by country, we're building a distributed worldwide platform that is policy aware in software of the rules and regulations of any country. And if a country has a certain set of laws, we will abide by them.
And our developers are also very understanding that the content they create will, country by country, either be applicable or not. We have a very long-term view in China. A lot of the play on Roblox is both educational as well as social that goes way beyond gaming.
Our response is really no response. It's to keep doing exactly what we've been doing. We have a 10-year vision there. We know it's going to be big and interesting.
And we're in this unique position with our Tencent partnership and government license live on IOS, live on Android, and bilateral network effects; the great, global content going into China as well as great China content starting to hit the world market. So our response is to keep doing what we've been doing. Okay. Great. The next one comes from [Indiscernible]. Can we provide color on the trajectory of expenses versus bookings growth over the next couple of years? Obviously, there's going to be some catch-up in building the platform, but any insight into the trends? So we've been really clear in our discussions around investment but we have a real focus. The first is hiring the best engineers in the world, tracking down great product professionals through Roblox and we will continue to focus on that.
The Company is laser-focused on recruiting and growing. We're around about 1300 employees today, which is fantastic, but our ambitions require a significantly larger group of professionals working in the Company.
The second thing is to increase investment in the creator community and developer community on Roblox and continue to share a greater percentage of economics with them over time.
Both of those, in a factor, are circulating back into faster and more prolific product releases, which tends to drive more content, which tends to drive higher bookings. Generally, we view our business as having the kinds of cash flow margins where our ability to invest is relatively unconstrained. And we're very fortunate to be in that situation.
We produce a lot of operating cash flow. And even though we continue to invest in the infrastructure around the world on Roblox in states [Indiscernible] India that we talked about in the letter, we've still been able to go to the long run and generate a lot of free cash flow.
And so we have the ability to invest more aggressively because, ultimately, what we're interested in is a billion users. Not high 40 million daily active users. potentially, a billion hours of engagement every day on the platform, not -- obviously, a much smaller number today.
We'll continue to invest at heavy rates. We believe, ultimately, the bookings will support that, but we do have a lot of flexibility in terms of margin and we view that as really fortunate -- that's a fortunate outcome of our business model. And ultimately, we're trying to get to our end goals of growth and scale as quickly as we can. Those are the major areas that we'll be investing in. Yeah. And this is Dave chiming in and riffing on what Mike said there. Kudos to our core platform and infrastructure teams to build such an amazingly high performance, low cost, high-reliability network around the world.
We've got over 24 edge VA centers now. We've got 4 in China, we've got 3 primary zones. It's really -- that is all money that we're able to funnel back to employee growth and our developer ecosystem. Okay. So the next question talks about July. Great July month. Can you talk about the underlying drivers as the performance? And also specifically how maybe give some color on how August and September last year, with the trends we're given the seasonal impact of back-to-school, in terms of DAUs, booking, and monetization? Yeah, I'll take the second question first. If seasonality of business is a typical speaking that would be the summer peak is July, August people start going back to school, and in September, it is back to school.
So sequentially, it's a bit high in August, it is lower in July, and September is back-to-school time. If I were, I would look very carefully at year-over-year growth rates in this business now. We're starting to come back to a more normal seasonality which means, I think, that year-over-year data is insightful.
And I think we're also comparing into our expectation and belief, and certainly what's embedded in our financial expectations, is that notwithstanding Delta variant. Schools are opening in September. Offices are reopening. That's what we all hope for, personally, and that's what we're expecting.
I think those normal curves will prevail in the third quarter and in the fourth-quarter. Again, the typical seasonality, we talked about this before, is that October, there's usually a pick up from September and November. Eventually, you get to start the holidays and things pick up in December.
It's always very outside in terms of that month. And that's -- that hasn't changed, and that's very normal. And we talked about that before, and I think that's what we'll see in the back half of this year. The question on what do we attribute the trend in July. It's -- we're very happy to report monthly metrics.
It's a great way for everyone to keep up with the business. The trends don't change very much month-to-month. We have been -- I've been the CFO of the Company for going on 4 years, and we've been talking about international growth and aging of the platform and making those investments for the entire -- my entirety here at the Company -- we're making progress on those for my entirety at the Company.
And I think what you saw in July possibly that there's little bit of COVID impact between June and July, where things were definitely up ending up in June and July, and it is a little more questionable. On the other hand, there's some of the other trends that are going on inside the business that I think drive, growth, and performance, that it's hard to just separate into one of those. Again, much more content on the platform, a diversity of concept on the platform.
Users growing really fast in places like Asia Pacific and rest of the world. some new players coming onto the platforms that were early in their payer cohorts. There's a lot of different things I consider that are -- that feed into the numbers.
And I would -- I just always caution people month-to-month. I'm not sure that the trends change dramatically. Unless there's a really big macro shock, you should believe that we're doing the same things to grow the platform with an incredibly long-term perspective. Okay. Can we talk about the investment strategy in more detail? Are we investing enough on the creator side to differentiate roll-off studio relative to Unity, Unreal, and other games? Yeah. I want to highlight and then I'll kick it over to Mike. Once again, our belief in system-wide investment, which means it's self-service, we have 2 ways that our developer community does business. The first is on the Robux economy.
The second is on engagement-based payouts. We are really proud with what the engagement-based payout system has done in that over time, more and more developers down ranking 1000+ are starting to make a living on our platform without even thinking about it, and this goes to hobbyists or new developers.
We really focus on the depth of that pipeline and getting people successful early on so they can make a decision to jump onto the platform. We increased those in Q2.
There is a lot of room to turn those knobs, even though we're not announcing anything as we look at where our cash is right now. And we would always prefer to turn those knobs rather than doing manual by-hand type investment programs.
Our top developers now, whether they're organic on the Roblox platform, where outside companies like the companies that are coming on platform to dill experiences. It's getting very pretty serious business.
Tens of millions of dollars a year, larger and larger teams with VC back teams. I think you can see, say, the future for us will continue to be UGC and really system-based, and there's a lot of room there. I think that [Indiscernible] can attract [Indiscernible] 2 years is up by about 5x and that will continue. Then, Mike, I know -- would you like to add on to that? No. I think in the first half of the year it's about just under $249 million. We talked a little bit about where we hope that will be on our last call and obviously, it's on track.
Again, we really remain razor-focused on our investment, infrastructure, talent inside the Company, and the developer community. And outside of that, actually, we're really careful about our investment. We really are quite focused.
The only other significant investments that you're going to see within our numbers in the quarter of the back-half of the year will be a little bit around tending improvements because we're growing and we need more space and then that's a good thing. We've got on a great campus [inaudible] they're very well located.
So we'll make some investments there, but we're incredibly careful about where we put our capital. And I think we're in a really privileged type because the business, over the 15 years that it's been in existence has -- most of the cash that we see on the balance sheet is generated by the business.
And so, again, it's the flexibility to continue to invest at high rates. And, historically, those investments have proven to be productive in terms of -- from the top line of the business, that's been -- it's been a really great match in terms of the financial model. But that -- we'll continue to do those things. And then I think 2 more. Quick one, fraudulent credit card usage accounting for 5% of bookings. Has it been a persistent problem, and how are we planning on tackling this internally? We have a whole team that's focused on fraud. The numbers have bounced around a little bit, but I know I would have seen that -- you're going to see that number ticking up and causing us any significant issues.
But we're focused on it, absolutely. We're laser-focused on making sure that fraud is as low as it possibly can be. Okay. And then the last question is on the slow burn. Can we talk about the traction we're seeing with new developers, professional studios, and higher-quality content coming up? Yeah, this is Dave. I'll chime in. I think [Indiscernible] is a great example. It's out of the team in Shanghai, and they broke into the top 12. We have this vision; both the current people on our platform are right now growing into studios that are competitive with any external studio.
The top 5, 10, 20 teams on Roblox are big, they're talented, they're out recruiting on universities through programming talent, they stand side-by-side. And we're really proud that we've grown these internal studios.
At the same time, external studios, whether they're VC backs, whether they are backed by other larger studios, we're seeing those as well. So great traction. China, Shanghai studio breaking into the top 12 on Roblox. Great. We'll be signing up. Great. I think that's all the time we have for today. I will now hand it back over to David. Yeah. Just certainly back. Wishing you, your friends, your families, the Roblox community, a hopeful and safe emergence from this COVID situation. And thank you for all your support. Great. Operator. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","Roblox sharesholding letter earnings results and supplemental materials on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com . today's call may be making forward-looking statements including but not limited to statements about our future financial performance, growth rates in business and investment strategy and plan, development of new technologies, investment in and payments to developers .",1.0

And good morning to both our Roblox shareholders, as low as the whole Roblox community around the world. We wish you are well. We hope you are all coming out of COVID and getting back to normal as much as possible. And we look forward to answering your questions today where we will talk about our Q3 results, as well as the month of October, which we've also shared. I do highlight that in a week from now on November 16th, we have a live-streaming Investor Day at, I believe, 8 AM Pacific Time, where we'll be spending several hours diving into our product stack across the Company. With that, we welcome your questions and look forward to speaking with you today. Thank you. Operator, ready to take questions. At this time, if you would like to ask an audio question, [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan, please go ahead with your question. Thank you. This is David Karnovsky on for Lexia. Following the outage, can you say what user trends look like on the platform? Did you see an immediate recovery in engagement and spending? And then, maybe related to this, could you just remind us of a typical monthly cadence in Q4? How does November compare to October, and then kind of how much of a ramp do you historically see with the holiday period? [Indiscernible] Dave. I'll lead with the outage, which was an event that we're going to publish an analysis of publicly to share what happened, as well as all the steps we're taking to make sure that such a thing doesn't happen again.
We were quite gratified to see the support of the Roblox community as we worked through it. And we're also quite pleased to see when we came back live, essentially in a loss of users and continuation of our user trends. I'll pass over to Mike for any future comments. Hey, David. First week of November looks really good. Basically, recovery back to where we had been. So we didn't see -- we're fortunate in that we didn't see any lasting impact on users. So we're obviously happy to see that. As it relates to seasonality, Q4 is generally our biggest quarter, and it's back-end loaded because of the holidays. So no great surprise. October and November, generally pretty similar.
So that's just going back many, many years and looking at the two months, we see a bunch of pickup as you would expect around Thanksgiving, when people are home a little bit more. Generally, I would say we had a good solid 27 days of October and good trends. And when we came back up, it looked like we -- users came back with us in next step. Okay. And then with the platform now majority 13 prosper DAUs, I'm wondering if you would expect the percentage of experiences that qualifies aged up to move to that level over time? In a meeting, are you seeing developers react to this mix and build more mature content? And then, how much do you think that can accelerate with tools like voice chat or the rating system you previewed at [Indiscernible] say? Hey, this is Dave. We have -- we've been building this platform for over 16 years and one of the keys is that it's powered by user created content, millions of creators who make everything on Roblox. As we've grown up too, as we've improved the quality of our personalized search and discovery, more and more, the people on our platform are finding amazing content that is very aligned with what they're looking for. And our creator community is very responsive to the wants and needs of the player community.
Interesting a year ago, approximately 10% of our top thousand experiences have more over 13 players than under. But recently that number has gone to 28%. So 28% percent of the top thousand experiences are now more 13-plus. So the developer community is responding, creating amazing content for all ages, for people around the world, for interest. There are niche pieces of content. There are very broad-spectrum pieces of content. So what we wanted to see happening is happening. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just have 2. First with APAC and Rest of world particularly strong from an engagement perspective, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any initiatives that Roblox is executing against from an international expansion perspective. And whether there are any experiences that particularly resonated with the international users. And then I have a quick follow-up Thanks. Yes, I'm going to kick that over to Mike first because we had a great Q3 and APAC highlighted by Japan. So maybe Mike, if you want to speak to that, and then I'll follow up with what we do to support international growth and acceleration. I don't think we could point to any specific piece of content or pieces of content that we're just dramatically different in Asia-Pacific. Generally, you have a decent amount of overlap around the world. We are seeing increasingly -- increasing amount of affinity for local content in certain markets. As developers are growing in and around Asia-Pacific, as in the rest of the world, they will start building, or have started building content that is relevant globally and relevant in those local markets.
And so there's no specific spike this quarter. I think it's just a much longer-term trend that you've seen developing as the database has become more global, we'll talk a little bit about this at the Investor -- Investor Day next week. But it's just a good solid compounding of the trends that we've been seeing of local content becoming of a more content developed around the world and some of the affinity for local content increasing. And then one thing that is -- that drives our international growth is the extent to which we can dynamically and automatically translate experiences as they are created. And the extent to which developers, if need be, supplement that with hand translation, and that technology is continuously improving both the quality of the translation, as well as, the percentage of the experiences that by default have this on. So that is a contributing factor more in strategic international growth. Great. Thank you for the thoughts and I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the traction with brand experiences. You mentioned vans world in the letter, are these brands participating on the platform in the same way that others do in a UTC or self-serve capacity or are brand experiences higher touch right now and does that change over time? Thank you very much. Yes. This is Dave. Long-term the vision for brands is the exact same as games or play experiences, in that we imagine an ecosystem where there are thousands and thousands of these experiences. They are created in concert between brands and possibly creators and developer communities. But just as 16 years ago, gains in play experiences were new on Roblox. This is relatively new for some of them. So there is some touch now in our Investor Day next week, we'll be sharing the parts of the road-map we're working on this year to make that as self-service as possible.
And that includes the creation of the way they deal with IP and assets, how they may if they choose to monetize. The high-level vision we have is just as print and just as video have been and continue to be interesting ways for brands to interact with their audience. Immersive is really immersive way for brands to interact with their audience. And as you noted with Vans World, which had over 40 million visits, people who visited Vans World we're able to wear Vans, go skate boarding, check out the shop, see what new items Vans had for sale. This is a really immersive way for brands to connect with their fans. Great. Thank you, Dave. Thanks, Mike. And one from the webcast Thomas Reiner from [Indiscernible]. Can you discuss the monetization trends internationally versus Canada and U.S. year-to-date. You've invested a lot in localization and in back-end is monetization internationally growing faster than U.S. and Canada. Thanks Thomas. Off at the back-end, what's at the rate of change of monetization? I'd say right now we're in the part of growth internationally where it's very much driven by user growth and over time, going back many years in our core markets, we've seen users. They retain on the platform. They spend the cumulative amount of time. Some percentage of them convert and become payers. Once they become payers, and are retained as payers, they tend to increase their spending levels. I think that's happening faster now in international markets for whole variety of reasons, primarily because you've just got smarter creator basis with better content.
And so people are becoming payers faster and starting to increase their monetization faster. Right now, again, we generally are looking at bookings growth as driven primarily by user engagement growth. We get the question a lot about the ratios between monetization per user and I'll just caution that when you have high bookings growth and high user growth, just the rate of change in the numerator and denominator can make numbers look like they're going up or down. Generally our trends of monetization over very long period of time are that those payer cohorts tend to increase on monetization over a very long period of time. So we go back to core markets like U.S. and Canada.
We still have growth in our payer cohort. It's going all the way back to 2016, and we expect that we're going to see the same behavior in international markets and particularly in Asia-Pacific. When I look at the high growth markets in the quarter that we just completed, The really high-growth markets of Southeast Asia, East Asia, which is mostly Japan, and Korea. Western Europe, as we've been talking about a lot, France and Germany, Spain, and others, and then Latin America. And so in some of those markets you got a very wealthy user base and other markets you have slightly lower GDP per Capita so there will be a real mix.
And I guess I don't know that we'll be forecasting exactly that ratio for a while, but we'll be looking a lot of user’s engagement and the result in bookings. And that's really where we're all going to be focused. Your next audio question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners, please go ahead with your question. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one, you highlighted the aging up and the number of experiences that are 13+. And I was curious if cultural events like Squid Games or -- squid game that is for 21 Pilots, bringing even older users, and whether those stick around? And generally how you thought about your aging up, do you think it's going to be or has it been so far just adjacent to your core demo? Or are you bringing in older users? And then I have a follow-up. So, great question. First, I want to highlight, right now we don't have any only-13 and up experiences. We have 28% of the top thousand experiences, having a majority of 13+. But those are still experiences that are open to all ages. We talked a lot about aging up. We're right in the middle of it, and we're right in the middle of very solid growth in our 17 through 24-year-old cohort. The exciting thing about these older cohorts on our platform, is there's a lot of whitespace there.
We've historically started with younger players. It's been an amazing advantage to us because we've had to focus on being a civil and safe place. And now we see growth in two areas. One is the existing Roblox player base is growing up with us. So that is a retention opportunity to bring them with us. But as you correctly note, we also bring other people in. Squid games, the concerts, both examples of events that we believe most likely reached some new audience.
In the case of Squid Games looking for -- and that's singular Squid Game, people looking for a place to experience that brands side-by-side the awesome show. And so they came to Roblox where they could see that. So, I do believe those things add to the retained people that come into our platform and stick with us and bringing new older players to a platform. Yes. And we just had a quick that -- we knew -- we know that Gucci Garden had an older demo for sure in the month of September. It was quite a bit of an older demo. Each of these individual pieces of content, I think contributes to an overall trend of broadening the aged demographic around the Company. So it's a receptive market when you do something like Twenty-One Pilots or Gucci Garden. But clearly their music is a good example, where an artist that has an older following, it's quite likely that they're going to have an older following inside Roblox and it's going to attract some of those users.
We have been tracking aged up demos for years and for a long time, 13 to 16 was our fastest-growing age demographic, and I think usually adjacent and that's exactly what it was. It was adjacent to our core, 9 to 12 market, and it was our fastest-growing age cohort for quite a while. Today, the adjacency has continued in right now, 17 to 24 is the fastest-growing. It's demographic on Roblox. So I think it's not any individual event or piece of content. I think it's a combination of everything that's going on and then certain of these things are finding big audiences and contributing to, again, this broadening in age demos. I just want to rip one other thing on Squid Game and implicit in what happened on our platform in various countries around the world where there's a lot of attraction and attention about this, it highlights the velocity at which both the combination of our cloud tools, our development environment, and the creators on the platform are able to respond and create interesting and immersive content. And we weren't talking months. We were talking days for functioning experiences that could go hand in hand with the TV series. Yeah, I want to stick with Dave for a second and I know -- I think you said earlier you might touch on this in the Analyst Day. But is there a way to directly link the brands and [indiscernible] companies to help them maximize the impact from this high velocity of UGC creation that's going on around their business on the platform? I think more and more of this is right. This was more an organic situation, more and more, I believe we will see intentional situation. A couple of days ago, for example, one of the top experiences on Roblox Jailbreak announced an intentional partnership with NASCAR which is an awesome brand experience. There is already a great place on Roblox, where people are driving cool vehicles around, all of a sudden we have NASCAR vehicles. So I do think over time, we will see both organic experiences as well as intentional experiences. Even though this one is organic, I don't want to speak for Netflix, but I have seen quotes about their appreciation almost in a way that this media sensation, in a way has manifested itself in other way, on an Roblox. Another intention category another that you mentioned in the letter, again with Netflix was with Bakugan. So that's another example of something that was quite intentional to stream that [Indiscernible] went up a seller on the platform. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question. Hi, guys. It's Matt (ph) on for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess -- there have been some headlines in recent weeks about some smaller companies that are basically building ad businesses that helped place ads inside of Roblox experiences. And I was wondering what your philosophical view is on those sort of avenues for brands to come to the platform and then how you see them fitting into the broader branding and advertising opportunity in Roblox. And then just secondly, on closing the loop to maybe offline transactions.
It seems like there's a big opportunity for people to interact with brands on Roblox and then make purchases of physical goods. So if a kid is playing with Hot Wheels in a Roblox game, they then go buy actual real life Hot Wheels cars. Can you talk about your thought process and your efforts to maybe start to link that brand experience to offline dollars? Thanks. Matt, this is Dave, I'll speak on the advertising first and I'm going to go more long view on this rather than the specific. The long view is we have focused primarily to date on the engagement and the satisfaction of our users more than monetization on the platform and we've built systems, including our virtual economy and engagement-based payout that have already created a very rich and vibrant developer community with large businesses. Some of our developers making tens of millions of dollars a year.
Advertising is an enormous opportunity, and at the same time our vision for advertising is immersive, it's native, it's around high-quality experiences and over time, we'll be working on rolling out. But the standards around this, how this is supported globally and we do think there's an interesting and big future and at the same time, a very high-quality branded advertising type future. So super, super optimistic about that. On your second question, I believe about brands, maybe Mike [Indiscernible] you want to take that one? Yeah. We see the same exact opportunity not that you're describing and are in the very early stages of talking to brands about that. For now, they're promoting their brands directly with the user base. I think it's logical to all of us that eventually you would have a user who is not only interacting with the brand in a virtual world or even buying virtual goods using maybe Vans again, as an example. Maybe has Vans clothing on their avatars and ultimately saying they would like to own those shoes or their shorts of those T-shirts and so we see it as well.
And we ultimately do think in fact it's a big experience, a big opportunity. It obviously -- for the brand, it would take all of the returns of being on Roblox up to a different level. And so, yes, it's -- I don't think there's any doubt in the long run that's where we'll end up. Maybe a first sign of this was our partnership with Chipotle where this wasn't a full-on buying your Vans shoes on Roblox, but there was a physical digital connection there. And just want to reiterate our outage was in no way affiliated with the popularity of that event. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go with your question. Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So given the recent developments in China, can you share any updated thoughts around the Company's strategy in this market? And then separately, understanding you're saving more explanation around the cost of the outage for later date. If you're willing, can you discuss how these influences or changes where you direct resources and investment spending going forward? Yeah, first, I'll go to China. We take a super long view in the Company and we have a vision of a platform that connects around the world where content created anywhere is able to be experienced by people anywhere and we keep our head down around the world in all countries including China there. And we're continuing to build out this system that make that possible. And once again, we have a wonderful partnership in China with Tencent and remain diligent there. On the outage I -- what I will share is that what we saw in the outage is really the value that we have at respecting our community.
And a lot of highlighting around how big Roblox is a part of people's lives, and how they use it and depend on it to be together. I think it's fair to say as part of our analysis and then as we share what we'll be doing to make sure this never happens again. There may be some adjustments, I think minor. We have an awesome team. I have complete confidence in the team and we have an awesome infrastructure. There may be some adjustments that we take and just to follow up on that analysis. Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, good morning, David, Mike and Anna. I guess just first around subscription of -- the subscription is creative to engagement and retention. And given some of the App Stores, the fact that they've lowered the take rate on subscription does the unit economics get better for you guys? Is there opportunity to maybe drive-up subscription, or accelerate subscription in the mix thus being able to return more dollars to developers? So a little bit of a win-win there. I'll start there and then I've got one follow-up. Just quickly answer. Subscription is it creative to retention and for monetization? There's no doubt about that. Then I'll riff on the second part. We -- great partners with both Apple and Google and all of our other partners, Microsoft, is that provide routes for people to be on our platform and support monetization. We, as much as possible, would like to move money to our creator community. And I think as any changes occur on any of these platforms and as those rates change, we would take that opportunity if made available to us, to move more of that virtual economy through our Company to the creator communities. So long-term, yes, it's those out store rates happen to change, won't move the majority of it to our creator community and provide them even greater economic benefit. Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I guess maybe a two-part housekeeping question. Can you remind us, Mike, you talked about November recovering your post outage and being off to a solid start. He kind of remind us normal seasonality, November and December. And then you guys did 3 small acquisitions in the quarter. I guess anything you can say, what contribution those without have been to bookings. Thanks guys. Yes. Maybe the second question first. Very exciting and strategic transactions. We're pleased to have some great people on the team that came in with those transactions. Some entrepreneurs who had started really interesting businesses and it's great to have them at Roblox. They contributed $0 to the bookings of the Company. It was really IP, and capabilities, and people, and we're delighted with all the transactions. In terms of November, as they said earlier, November in October, pretty similar. One fewer day in November, obviously.
But I'd have to look at the weekends if I was trying to forecast the number. We always do a little bit more on the weekends. And then obviously around the Thanksgiving holiday, that's a big bump up for us in the month of November. You can look at the last year's data. October-November was pretty similar and December was not quite double the October, November numbers, but pretty close, probably 80% higher or something like that. So you'd have a great big backend in Q4 with December, and that's just been true forever. Your next question will come from the line of Clark Lampkin with Piecyk BTIG. please go with your question. Hi, good morning. I the tech related question first. You guys talk about infrastructure expansion to reduce latency at RDC. I'm curious if you could help us think about, one, how much might accelerate over the next few years and whether something like ITS could scale as you keep growing due to AI? And second, what sort of relationship or elasticity exists between user growth and latency reductions for gross add or retention standpoint. And separately Dave, I think nearly everything on your list of five-year goals was checked off with the exception of the president mentioning their avatar on camera and I guess a portion on the toys sold item.
You filled out in time on both of those, but I'm curious whether you started drawing up the next version of the list and whether you might share with us what item or items are sitting at the top now. Hey, yes. Thank you. Great question. And that is a list that I've been presenting every year at our Roblox Developer conference that started 4 years ago with a set of 10 predictions that amazingly many of them have come through, including over a million concurrency and a Roblox place more creators outside the world than in. There are a couple ones, as you know, we might not hit, including the president mentioning their Roblox avatar live, but we still have about 11 months so we'll see what we can do there.
Getting to infrastructure, a couple of things. We've architected Roblox to reduce latency even in an avatar interaction between a player in Germany and a player in Japan. And underlying that tech is a hybrid distributed physics system where some of what you're seeing is happening local on your machine, including your avatar motion. And then some of it's happening in the cloud. And then we're time slicing it along with the player that's remote. At its core, we've really worked to reduce that latency.
Now the way we've accelerated that is we have many, many data centers all around the world. We have one in Poland, we have -- we're building one in India. We have one in Singapore. And whenever possible, we connect people together at their nearest data centers. These are high-performance, high-reliability data centers that we support and build at very, very low cost. And as you correctly note, given that we operate this infrastructure, there's a lot of opportunities we have that we have not tapped yet to improve latency reduction. An example, we have been amazing collection of CDN vendors out there that distribute content. There could be a future where some of that content comes straight from our data centers.
We have a lot of bandwidth around the world so that people who are connecting, perhaps in Japan and need to hop over to Ashburn, do it on our network rather than on the IP network to give them more high speed and a reliable connections. So underneath Roblox, there is a fairly substantial infrastructure cloud. We're close to 10 terabits of external bandwidth, which is a sign of how solid our infrastructure is. And, we have other things we're looking at to reduce latency as well as part of this cloud influence that we've built. But appreciate the technical question. There are no further audio questions at this time. All right. We're going to take some from our virtual listener. First the question is, as Roblox grows and becomes mainstream for older audiences, how would you prevent inappropriate content from the younger players? We're already doing this and I see the metrics every week. They are already really good and they keep getting better and better. It's really the top priority on the platform. I feel we're in really good position and that we're starting from a difficult place, which is create a civil society for people of all ages. And then as we bring more and more older players onto the platform, we're carefully adding some amounts of freedom in certain situations while always respecting our core foundation of safety and civility. So it's a top priority. We're already doing it. We already have a lot of older people on the platform. Over 1/2 of our people are over 13 plus and so this is something we're doing and we will continue to. You knew the offering of play to earn or play to own, which is popping up in blockchain base gains, like [indiscernible] and infinity. Is it something you would consider app adoption over time? We're focused on social connection and engagement at Roblox. We're focused on supporting people doing things together, whether it's playing or learning or working, or experiencing entertainment. And our focus is on supporting that naturally and virally if people want to come to our platform just to be with their friend. Speaking of game mechanics, we right now do not allow any experiences on Roblox to ultimately payback Robux to the players. So we don't have any plans to do that. The next question from Thomas Sawyer (ph) from O [indiscernible] Capital. Hi, David, could you share your vision on retaining developers and creators? How are you looking at the developer and creator compensation in the future? And how is the general developer and creator feedback on the current state of things regarding how much they make out of experience and items? Yes. When we think about this creator of community, we've evolved over the last 10+ years from a thriving hobby community to the introduction of our virtual economy, to individual s starting to make a living on the platform to larger and larger studios making tens of millions of dollars a year to now in the news, a fair amount of VC funding of Roblox studios to grow and accelerate so that progression is an indication of the health of the community. We focus primarily on growing user engagement and the quality of that experience. To grow the platform.
As our platform has grown year-by-year, whether it's developer number 1, developer number 10 developer, and 100 or developer 1000. We think constant increase is in their participation in the economy and we're hopeful and we expect that to continue going forward. So the primary means of retention for developers on our platform is a thriving growing ecosystem, larger opportunities for developers, existing developers being more and more economically successful, and more opportunities for new developers. So I think it's fair to say our retention is based on the long view, quality, size of opportunity, opportunity for debt, rather than specific retention mechanisms. And that long view also goes to the quality of our toolset, because the search and discovery built in the platform is built into the 200 million plus people already on the platform and ability to gain new audience. Yes. I just without -- we're -- we've been so vocal about moving more and more of the economics, the developers, as we get efficiencies around the Company and around the platform in any area of cost. We try to move that out to the developer and the synergy between the growth in the platform and the payout to developer has been fantastic. The quality of what the developer is able to produce has yielded such great economics. Few years ago, in the third quarter of 2019, the entire developer community earned $26 million. In 3Q of '20, it was $85 million and in 3Q of this year it's $130 million. So that's 5X in 2 years.
And, so we're thrilled to that kind of growth, and we're just going to continue to put our heads down and work on ways with the community to grow that number. And, if you've followed us from the time we did our listing -- actually, if you followed us when we were a private Company, we've talked incessantly about pushing more and more of the economics factors of the community and we will just continue to make progress against that every quarter. Francisco Olivera from Arevilo Capital is asking is there any particular acquisition strategy you're targeting? There is, and it's a strategy that really goes through the basics and goes again to our long view vision, which is finding amazing groups of people, and amazing technologies that we can generally integrate into our Roblox platform. We're in an enviable position, I believe where there's a lot of growth available to our Company with our -- the current growth vectors we've shared with everyone, which is around the world, all ages. And new interesting ways that people will interact on Roblox learning, working, consuming entertainment.
So that puts us in a position where everything we do focuses on the core platform. Given the range of technologies on the platform, you can imagine the various areas we're looking for amazing people and great technology complement. I think we have maybe time for two more. One is from [Indiscernible] from [Indiscernible] Can you comment on the road map, for education experiences. How is [Indiscernible] Yeah. We're going to share our educational road map at our Investor Day in a week and Rebecca will be guiding into that. We're excited in that we're going to be announcing some partnerships through our Roblox community fund, where Roblox is being used not just to learn computer science, but also to learn stem, to learn creative, constructive ways of learning, and you'll see some partnerships with some very notable educational institutes that won't be talking about on in Bellis. It's an amazing group of people and Bellus technology was around helping us find especially creative and problem-solving type people to join our Company. And we're using it right now live-in production as we start to bring amazing people to Roblox. And the last question comes from Dan Sang (ph), from Angle Capital. Can you provide any learnings from your spacial voice tests. And what our [Indiscernible] investors should look for as we move towards voice communication over the time. Yes, the learning started well over a year ago when we -- I guess almost a year ago when we did a holiday party on Roblox and in the midst of COVID I was able to hang out with a bunch of the people and I'm at the bar in a holiday party and -- and I -- it was a great connection. I had missed it so much. We can see it now in the adoption of spacial voice amongst the experiences on Roblox, as we carefully roll that out and open up the availability to the various customer base. We'll talk more about this as well at our Investor Day.
But we think this is a huge part of Roblox's future, which is allowing people to come together in a natural way, especially in groups, especially on our Roblox Company meeting, have impromptu conversations, like they would in the real world, and ultimately work, play and learn together. More to come at Investor Day on this. That's all the time we have for today. Yes, just once again, thank you all, to our shareholders, and to our Roblox community. We appreciate your support and we look forward to seeing you in a week for our Investor Day. Thank you. Operator, thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Roblox Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Anna Yen, you may now begin your conference. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox' Q4 and Fiscal 2021 Results. With me today is Roblox' CEO; David Baszucki; and CFO, Mike Guthrie. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that yesterday after market closed, we published a shareholder letter and earnings results on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com. On this call, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions. For webcast participants, please note the question icon at the bottom of your screen where you can type in your questions. We'll do our best to take as many questions as possible. On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, our expectations of our business, future financial results and strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements, and such risks are described in our risk factors included in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-Q filed for the first quarter ended -- for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued yesterday as well as in our supplemental slides, copies of which can be found on our IR website. Finally, this call is being webcast and will be archived on our website shortly afterwards. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. Thank you, Anna. This is David Baszucki, and I'm joined by Mike Guthrie this morning. We'd like to welcome our Roblox community and our investors, both large and small. Great to be with you all today. And we're wishing you and your families all the best as hopefully, we're emerging from COVID. Last year at this time, we were heavily buttoned down. Today, we have many of our Robloxians live in the office. We appreciate your partnership as you're joining us in our mission of bringing 1 billion people together with stability and optimism around the world. A couple of quick highlights before we dive in with some additional facts that were not shared in our shareholder letter. In addition to our January user growth, our 17 through 24-year-old segment in January grew 51% year-on-year, which is a wonderful validation of our vision to bring people of all ages together on our platform. And internationally, in addition to strong growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, 2 countries that we have a lot of focus on, Japan and India, both grew over 100% year-on-year, which is wonderful for us. As we start to look at expanding the uses of Roblox, our community fund is live, and we have, as we've announced, some exciting partnerships, including with FIRST Robotics. And we continue to do branded events and concerts almost as fast as we can go as we move towards our vision of making these types of experiences completely self-serve. And I would highlight our recent partnership both with the NFL and Zara Larsson. Over 40% of the top 100 experiences on Roblox right now are using voice, and we are working thoughtfully and carefully as we expand this rollout to our 13 [new] validated users. And as always, we'll do this with safety and stability. And we have a lot of wonderful stuff in the pipeline that we can talk about today on the product side. With that, I'd just like to highlight our core value is always safety and stability. And that's where we put our primary focus. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mike Guthrie to see if he has any opening remarks. Thanks, Dave. I just want to -- wanted to end on some of the things as Dave said. In addition to the high rate of growth in 17 to 24 year olds, that age demographic did comprise 20.5% of all DAUs in January. So it's not as though as it's a small segment for us. It's a large segment, it's growing quickly. As Dave also mentioned, we're basically 7 quarters into COVID. The first 4 quarters, our business grew dramatically, and we had quarters in which our top line was tripling year-over-year. And even this time last year, it was 2.6x what it had been the year before. So we're obviously lapping some fairly significant growth. What we do know, for sure, is that we're jumping off into '22 and into a period where the, hopefully, the world is reopening, in a place where we just have never been bigger or better positioned. We are at peak users on the platform. We are at peak engagement, having been over 4.2 billion hours and over $4 billion for the first time. We have never had as many payers on the platform. And most importantly, we've never shared more on the economics of the developer community and had a stronger set of incentives for developers to build amazing content. We've never worked with more artists on the music side or brand on Roblox. And last and certainly not least, we have never had more incredibly talented product and engineering professionals in our company excited to build amazing things over the next few years. So we couldn't be more excited about jumping into 2022 and beyond, and we really look forward to taking questions this morning. And with that, I think we'll open it up. Over to you, Audra. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view on the impact of gift cards in the quarter, particularly in December? And how that may have impacted January bookings? Mike, thanks for the question. We had a huge Q4 gift cards. Gift cards grew incredibly quickly. What we've learned is that it's an incredible channel. It's very powerful, getting gift cards in front of more people as they're in the physical world, its the highest priority for us. And we just grew at a really accelerated rate in the gift card business in December. You target such a great gifting item. It's certainly possible that users came into January with Roblox balances. We've been doing a little bit of work inside the company trying to figure that out. I don't have enough good data to suggest that there might have been some deferred purchasing in January. So I don't want to -- I really don't want to make that statement. We're going to continue to do some work, but what you should take away from this is our prepaid card team looks at the store value product as a really exciting one, and we are going to be putting quite a bit of resources behind growing that in 2022. Great. And if I could just have a quick follow-up. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see the bookings growth evolving throughout 2022 and then into 2023? I mean, we don't give formal guidance, as you know. I always look variety of data, but I look at our bookings charts and our DAU chart a lot. I look at them over like a 12-quarter period. And obviously, on an absolute basis, the business has been really up into the right over the last, well, 12 quarters and even before that. The point of that, though, is when I look at the growth rates that were in 2Q of '20 and 3Q of '20 and 4Q of '20, the first 4 quarters of COVID, we just had immense growth 3 times the rate of growth in some of the quarters. Between the first quarter of '21 and the second quarter of '21, we went from 161% bookings growth to 35%. And what that really represented was comparisons. We were finally in a period where we were comparing against our early quarterly results when COVID started. When we look at Ebola, a lot to see, is that a onetime bump in our business? Or are we retaining those users? Are they becoming engaged users on Roblox? And as we open things up or as the world opens up, are they staying with us? And the answer is yes. We probably most clearly see that in payer data, where just the raw number of payers has been growing sequentially for a long time and now it is at peak levels. What we also know right now is that the big difference in bookings, separate from users and engagement. It's -- the biggest in the growth in bookings really has to do with the rates of growth on weekdays and weekends. So if we just look at the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular, when COVID started every day, Monday through Friday, we had super high growth because people weren't at work or at school versus our normally high rates of growth, mostly focused on the weekend. Now we're kind of unwinding that trend that people are going back to work, our growth rates necessarily is going down on the weekdays. But the weekend growth is still significant. And so that gives us confidence to say that as we lap we believe that we'll be returning to high rates of growth as a great consumer internet business. So that's what we're focused on doing. The difficult compares really when we look at last year, it's right after April, in that May, June time frame that we talked about. And just having looking at that data as you're coming down the other side, I would expect that growth starts to accelerate. And as we look to late this year, then we're going to start getting more normalized comparisons and that should be an indication of what we think we can do in '23 and '24. But overall, when we look at that data, we also look at a lot of other things like changes to our product, things that we're doing and how we're investing in the business. And as a company focused on getting to 1 billion users, we're nowhere close to that. So we're quite optimistic about growth, especially as we expand the platform into other areas. We'll move next to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Mike, maybe just a follow up on your prior comments. As it pertains to U.S. and U.K. specifically, right? Do you see January sort of representing, at this point, a normalized level of post-pandemic spend and engagement for weekdays? Or do you expect just a little bit more further readjustment as these regions head toward a full reopening? David, good question. We've watched this trend for a little while. It's hard for me to peg exactly the date we will be absolutely sort of back to normal. As Dave mentioned in his comments, we're in the office today. It's a big team of folks in a conference room for the first time in a long time. And so I think the world is adjusting to that. And my sense is it's going to -- it will take a few more recent months. But in a sense, every country is a little bit different. I mean the U.S. has had it's own cadence of openings and closings and different policies going state by state. The U.K. has been different than we have been. Scandinavia has always been a core great market for us, albeit smaller from a user perspective because people are very fluent in English, it was an early adopter of Roblox. But they had a very different approach to curve it than we have had from a policy standpoint. So it's not easy to like pick the bottom. So I think we'll see these kinds of trends going for a little while. And in a sense, it's such an -- COVID is such an odd externality for businesses to deal with, it's -- I think it's possible that almost every business in '23 will be, hopefully, it's [dispersed] by two year in about 3 years because you just had an impact of either having it shutting things down or then reopening. And I think, obviously, we're still -- all optimistic that '22 is opening -- we're open for business, so it's not far away. When I look at the year-over-year numbers, I sort of peg it as somewhere between April-May, May-June, but that's still a guess. Okay. And then Dave, can you maybe expand a bit on some of the actions you're taking to make the platform more scalable for brands? And then for companies like Nike or Vans that are running persistent experience on Roblox, I will be interested to know the feedback so far and how they view the platform as a channel to reach their consumers? Yes. Thanks for asking that. Whether it's Gucci, Vans, Nike or the NFL, the vision we have is that immersive 3D interaction is ultimately an amazing way for fans to connect with brands, possibly even more than print or image or video. And we shared some of the numbers with Gucci. I don't think we shared Nike or Vans numbers or the NFL numbers. What we -- we can see a future where brands come to our platform, they use our Talent Hub to connect with our community. The Talent Hub is live to find partners to help build these experiences. And ultimately, the building of these experiences is very similar to building a video spot. We are working now additionally in ways for brands and artists to validate their accounts. So we know it's the real brand or artist so that they can boost traffic internally to their destination if they want. So on a single day, for example, they can use facilities on their own without a partnership with us to boost traffic to those experiences. And then finally, ways -- just based on our core technology to make it easier and easier for a very scaled, highly complex experiences to work at super high performance on all devices, phone, tablet and computer where ultimately the technology we're building will be akin to video or camera and that is more and more people can make these things very easily. We'll move next to Clark Lampen at BTIG. I have a quick question on user growth and the impact that international mix is going to have as that sort of grows over time. I was wondering if you could help us think about how much localizing the Roblox software and developers kit has on growth? I think you guys cover a little over 40% of the world's population in their native language. And I'm curious how that's benefiting consumer onboarding, developer growth, velocity creation, things along those lines? I'll go first with a high-level product vision, and then I'll hand it over to Mike. The -- we have a twofold vision. Like any other traditional software product, we want our clients and in certain countries, Roblox Studio to be available in the local language, and we continue to expand those languages. But the second thing is when a creator makes content on Roblox, in addition to pushing that content one time to any device, on tablet, computer console, we also want that content to push automatically to multiple languages at the same time. And this is how we run right now. We continue to add languages, Japanese, for example, Russian and other languages to make that happen automatically. And in addition, we always bring up live ops, trust and safety as well to complement the live operations of that in multiple countries. So yes, as we add more languages there's increased coverage, hopefully, with the exact same quality we have in our native English first language. And then I'll let Mike -- Clark, does that get to your question or was there a more specific financial part to it as well. Yes. No, nothing specific. I guess I'm just curious if you guys have seen as that happens that there is a significant uptick in developer onboarding or consumer onboarding and engagement. And it sounds like it's just kind of across the board, it's helpful. Yes, that's right. I mean we do look at data where we look at what we call affinity. So it is a local affinity for content in that language. And there generally is, which means to the extent that we are successful in growing a local developer community in those markets, that content will probably find a really receptive market. On the other hand, it's also been true over the years that Roblox set -- popular global content is pretty popular around the world. Localization tends to help. But some things are just universal, which is cool. But I don't think it ever hurts us to have a growing and healthy local developer community because some of that content will just find a really receptive audience. We -- and just a final wrap-up on the developer community. We have a recent blog post where we identify the ranking of where we see Roblox developers. In order United States, Brazil, Russia, Philippines, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Mexico, Turkey, South Korea. There's really a variety of organic creators and developers coming on from around the world. Next, we'll move to Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Rather than talking year-on-year, I think it could be helpful to talk about sequential a little bit, just given sort of the noise in the year-on-year comps. It looks like North America daily active users were down sequentially. Could you just talk about what age group is driving that, which one is declining versus not growing as quickly sequentially? And then are you seeing North America DAUs up in January versus December? And how do you think about the sequential growth of North America DAUs throughout the rest of this quarter? Yes. Brian, DAU in the fourth quarter, it's not unusual to have a decline. Just think a little bit that Q3 is July, August and September. July and August are just peak for us. Like this is absolutely high-level time of activity. September back-to-school and things slow down, it's a shorter month. And then October and November are actually pretty quiet for us until late, and things pick up, a little bit of a bump on Halloween. So -- and it really picks up around December, obviously, for the holiday. So Q3 has been bigger than Q4 in many years. It's not really unusual. The other effect that’s on DAUs, daily active users, is this frequency issue, right? The number of accounts, I don't have that off the top of my head, it's probably not down year-over-year. It's just that daily activity is coming down because, again, people are back to school, back to work and it's incredibly difficult to compare with a period where everything was shut down. We've just never seen anything like that in our history. So in January24.12], we'll see what happens overall in Q2. But the comparisons actually will also affect the sequential data. So January still down versus December? I’ll get – I’m going to look around the table and get the data for you, and we’ll come back before the end of the call. We'll go next to Brandon Ross at LightShed. I have a few. First, as we try and sort through this noise that COVID has presented, if you look at the -- on a 2-year basis, U.S. DAU growth is -- the CAGR is like 25%. Should we expect that number to be similar as we approach like real normalization going forward? Is that a good way to think about future growth on a normalized basis? In the U.S.? In the U.S., Yes. I'm not -- I don't know if specifically 25% is the right number. What's going to happen over the next few years, is that number is going to be defined much more by an older user base. So for example, right now, if I get back to Brian's earlier question, my strong sense is that 17 to 24 is actually not down sequentially, and we know the year-over-year growth rates are really substantial. So in the U.S. market, generally, what we're seeing right now and we expect to see in the next few years, is that growth will be defined primarily by older users, and those numbers grow the user base.If I look at 13 to 16 and 17 to 24, those growth rates are pretty high right now. 9 to 12 and even U9, we have a huge user base there, but we also have a very high percentage of the population. So we've been incredibly successful. Our strategy and expectation with that market is to continue to penetrate that market, but we're getting to a point where obviously, additional penetration is going to be hard to do because we have such a good foothold. And our focus will be to make sure that we don't leave that market, and we're continuing to -- we continue to focus on what has been our core market. The growth is going to be driven by older users, and that will be when Dave talks about the percentage of experiences that are aged up experiences or percentage of experiences where we have, boy, those are age-verified older users. Those are the kinds of things that are going to drive growth in the United States. Now again, if you look at our numbers right now, growth is also being driven outside of the United States at pretty aggressive rates. And that's just necessary, right? We're going to be growing -- we're fortunately growing Asia Pacific, Latin America, parts of Europe. So overall, if I cut it into pieces, the slower growth would be core markets, U.S. the core age demographic in the U.S., the under 13 high growth and aging up. And then really, we should be high growth in the rest of the world for quite a while. And I'll turn it back over to David. Yes, I just want to highlight one other. For a long time, we were a monthly active user company, and we don't share those results, I believe, public. But those numbers highlight a traditional type of behavior on Roblox, especially weekend behavior where those numbers are supported by weekend behavior. As we move to DAU behaviour, and Mike has shared that, we capture usage on everyday. And one thing to note, a lot of the product vision that we are working on right now for Roblox in addition to engagement is DAU type product behaviour, spontaneous communication, voice, communication, faster frequency of the product. So there are a lot of product functionality, things that we're working on that in a world where MAUs were growing, we would expect DAUs to grow even faster based on that product functionality. And then before bringing another question, sorry, I just want to respond to Brian's last question. So Brian, DAUs in January are -- in U.S. and Canada are up sequentially in January over December. It's actually a pretty nice bump. So just to close out your prior question. So Brandon, sorry, let's -- back to you. Before I get to a big picture question, just kind of extrapolating from what you're saying overall, are monthly active users in the U.S. in more established markets continuing to grow despite the decline in DAU as it's been less of a daily habit moving to the weekend? Yes, it's probably -- the other trend was to go back and look at it. We're not -- it's very difficult for us to report that number and answer your question because we know we have duplicate accounts in that number. So it doesn't really do me a lot of good to give you that number if I'm not totally confident. However, what I will tell you is conversion of -- in our -- when we look at our numbers, the conversion of DAUs to MAUs is actually growing. The right -- I think the question you're trying to get at, Brandon, would be accounts. As we looked at accounts, are accounts growing or contracting, I definitely don't have that number off the top of my head. But my guess is that number is still growing in the U.S. And again, with older users growing as quickly as they are, I'm almost positive of that. So that's the number that we should go back and take a look at. But the MAU number, because it includes all the counts, it's just a little more complicated, but we know the conversion rate is going up. So that is good. There is a frequency there. It's just a frequency compared to a period of time. It may sound like a broken record. Everybody was locked down. And so it's very, very hard to compare to a period where people aren't leaving the house and really didn't have a lot of alternatives. Yet, we're still quite a bit bigger than we were then. So that's really the thing that we're working through right now. Okay. Great. And then you talked in the letter about learning a lot from the brand experimentation on the platform. And as you look at the brands that have built experiences for your platform, which ones do you believe have been the most successful experiences and why? What does it take for brands to succeed on Roblox right now? I'll start by saying, I think we love all of our children equally. I don't like to say [Indiscernible] brand is -- its so early, I mean we had an discussion, it's just so early, we do love seeing the experimentation. Brands and heads of marketing of different goals and different approaches to interaction with the user base. And I think I'll let Dave respond. But I think we’re really in a very cool experimentation phase. So we love the fact that people are testing. One of the things that so different is the sheer level of engagement that brands may be able to enjoy on our platform versus anything else that, like -- Yes. I think it's really early. I think without giving any forward-looking thoughts on future product functionality. One can imagine just as in video advertising and brand, its such a large market, one can imagine the size of that in immersive 3D. Once we start moving into 3D human co-experience, we start to see things that mirror the real world. And so when we walk through Gucci, that is an experience that is virtually visiting, installation and purchasing things, and we've actually seen some interesting trading of those items, just like in the real world. Following that with Nike and Vans' experience, wearing that clothing, taking your skateboard out, hanging out with your friends, something we do in the real world. With the NFL interacting and playing with your friends around virtual football league and all of those kind of things. So they are all our children. We want to highlight right now that we are focused on the scalability, the self-serve, the elegance of the experience and the engagement of those experiences while reserving all of the long-term monetization. So we are more focused on DAU, user engagement growth with them than trying to monetize them heavily. But we're very optimistic. There's a lot of flexibility and creativity for brands to take what they would do in the real world and mirror it in our digital world. We'll go next to Matthew Thornton at Truist Securities. Maybe just following up on the brand's commentary there David. I guess, how far are we from seeing commerce enabled on the platform with a first step maybe being a partnership with someone like a Shopify or comparable. I'm kind of curious, any thoughts there. Secondly, coming back to the U.K. and the DAUs question. I know sequentially, the -- they've always been down historically. But I think year-on-year, if we back out the outage, I'm curious if that would -- if you have any idea as to how much impact that had on the year-over-year comparison on the DAU? And then just relatedly there, I guess, Mike, I'm not sure if you have any data on the under 13 cohort and particularly like the 5 to 11 type demo because, obviously, vaccination has really just kicked off in November there. So I'm curious if that's kind of coming into play there as well. Any thoughts there would be great. I'll highlight that we do watch USA 9 to 12 as well as 17 through 24. We do not publish the MAU numbers, but it's pretty well known that in USA 9 through 12 on the MAU side we’re a cultural phenomenon with very high usage, there's a lot of headroom on the DAU to MAU ratio. And so when we look at future DAUs in the United States, as that ratio gets better, as Roblox -- the headroom Roblox is a utility that's used daily for a wide range of things, communication, play, learning. There's a lot of headroom on that ratio. So that is the vision of how those USA 9 through 12 DAUs can continue to grow. On brands, there's -- as you correctly note, future areas of monetization include digital shopping, one of our partners, someday their 3D destination in addition to a try-it-on brand experience, people will be buying from those experiences, and having those items delivered to their doorstep, although we're not going to announce them when and how that will work. There is, obviously, a full brand immersion type of advertising that we're starting to see early signals of. There's also a dynamic advertising opportunity that we’ll be exploring -- which includes the use of teleports to go from place to place to launch people into individual places, includes the use of dynamic display ads that instead of getting in front of the experience of delaying the user are immersive and native. So the highlight here is we've got $3 billion or whatever the right number, Mike, of cash in the bank. We're hiring a lot of amazing engineers but we are primarily focused on safe and civil quality user engagement growth and DAU growth right now on the platform with a lot of opportunity for gentle increased monetization that doesn't get in front of our users long term. Yes. And Matt, what -- sorry, go back to your second question, it was about U.S. and Canada DAU, and you break up something of that, I just didn't track. Yes. Sorry, Mike. I guess I know they're always down sequentially, but I guess year-on-year, are you able to quantify what impact the outage had? And then just relatedly, if you think about the 5 to 11 demo, obviously, vaccinations really just kicked off in early November there. So I'm curious if you have any data to kind of maybe talk to what kind of impact that could be having in that cohort in 4Q and as we go into '22? Yes. What I can tell you on the U9 cohort is that on a global basis, it's growing quickly and it's falling to -- 1 second, I don't know. Yes. So U9 , right now on a global basis is just about at the average growth rate of DAU. It's just a little underneath it. So U9 is still growing quickly. U.S. specifically, I don't have it in front of me. I'm not sure. I'm not going to actually get to that level of detail. But you asked about the outage, we talked -- in our November release, we talked a little bit about it with 3 days and the timing. I think we did a pretty good job of estimating it. So I'll go back and take a look at that. Yes. Okay. But I know for a fact in January over December, the overall U13 is growing sequentially. The year-over-year data I don't have in front of me, and I don't certainly have U9 versus 9 to 12, but U9 is less penetrated than 9 to 12. [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Mike, I was wondering -- I appreciate the breakdown between weekends and weekdays. I think that's really helpful. Is it possible to give a number for what weekends grew at in either 4Q or January for bookings? There is not. But thank you for asking. I'm just not going to get into that. [Multiple Speakers] Exactly, what’s the number on that -- Yes, go ahead. Yes. And I understand you want to keep the friction low for brands to experiment on the platform. What's the signal you guys are looking for, though, to know when the right time to focus on monetization really is? With brands what is the right time to turn on monetization? Yes. I'll give you a quick overview, and then I'll let Dave talk more about it. It's incredibly subjective. Right now, last year, we had 12 great successful brand experiences. In the beginning of this year, we started off at a higher rate. I think the metric for 2022 is the sheer number of great brands that just do something with us so that they're looking at the platform and experimenting. And as we watch what they do and how they do it and the value that they get, then I think we can start having those discussions. I think to do it otherwise, it would be to add a lot of friction, require long negotiations and really slow down that part of the platform, which I think would be a real mistake. I've had conversations in the last few weeks and months with some of the developer community. Many of them are getting very, very sophisticated. These developers are really building sophisticated businesses. They're not just hiring developers, they're hiring business people. They look at the brand opportunity. They're really excited about it. The recent brand experiences are built by our community. And they're really excited about that opportunity. The economics of that is a great pairing to what they're doing on their other creations and building of gaming experiences. And so we want to let that really grow organically rather than try to cut that off and slow it down. Yes. And then this is Dave chiming in on what you might see, once again without giving any date, that is a functionality on our platform that supports both brands and developers. For developers, we're seeing more and more VC-backed developers, developers taking a bigger risk and many of these developers, just as they do in other markets, want to initially bring people to their experience as they test, as they grow and boost themselves. And so we have a primitive system on our platform. We are refining that, so that is much more sophisticated. That concept of boosting and really essentially paying to bring people to a destination in a nice way is very similar to a brand in the traditional TV spot where they want to make sure they get a certain number of eyeballs on their, in this case, video, but in the future in their 3D immersive experience. So you will see us working on ways for brands. If a brand wants to predictively have 5 million people in a week, for example, come to their experience at some point -- and once again, I'm not sure what the right number is, whether it's 100,000 or whatever, have a way to do that and guarantee they can bring that type of exposure. We'll go next to Drew Crum at Stifel. Several larger entities have expressed ambitions around or an intent to develop a metaverse. As you reflect on last year, did you find that this competitive push created any challenges for Roblox, including your ability to recruit and retain intellectual capital? And would you anticipate this changing in any way in 2022? Yes. I'll comment on this. The metaverse concept has been around for 30 years, and this has been consistent from the initial mention in Snow Crash through some products in actually the early 2000s through Roblox. We've been doing this for 16 years. We have a cool -- bunch of things that are really foundational to us, including being 100% UGC platform, a foundation on safety and stability and really a company based on innovation. We've seen absolutely 0 friction on the recruiting side as we continue to grow and show our vision of where we're going here. And next, we'll move to Omar Dessouky at Bank of America. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. You presented a compelling feature release road map for the first half of '22 at your Investor Day in November, including spatial voice, UGC, 3D-layered clothing, Avatar heads, faces and bodies and facial expressions, for example. Which of your feature road map would you consider continuous improvement of the platform versus a step change improvement in the technology? And also, how would you think about your acquired technologies such as human and Guilded in that respect? Yes. So a couple of highlights. We presented a really wide road map at our Investor Day. I don't think we gave any shift dates for that. And at the same time, we're live with spatial audio, and I think the layered clothing and UGC bodies are -- I can see where they are in the pipeline. I'm really excited and optimistic about that. But I wouldn't -- we would never give shift dates on anything. On our acquisitions, we tend to make 2 types of acquisitions. We are traditionally bringing people on board who are experts in certain fields, whether it's Loom.ai, as you mentioned, some of the others that have expertise around Avatar or other types of our platforms, social with Bash. And then on the case with Guilded, this is a wonderful parallel category. I would call that the social communication platform and there's several other well-known people in this area. We do believe there's opportunities for interoperability for connection between these types of platforms in what we would call Roblox as an immersive 3D co-experience platform. So 1 of the things we're doing with Guilded is using that as a way to look into the way these types of platforms can connect openly. And when we do that, we will make those available to other social communication platforms. And we have no further questions in the phone queue. I'll turn the conference over to Anna for the web questions. Great. I think we've got time for one more from Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies. Dave or Mike, can you discuss spending trends relative to new users versus repeat and by international versus U.S. Canada? Sorry, spending trends? Yes. So you’re saying for new users versus -- Versus international. New users versus repeat, international versus U.S. Canada. Yes. Payers tend to, over time, increase their rates of payment and new payers always tend to be on the low end of monetization. So as we add new payers, they tend to come in low and grow over time as a cohort. Returning payers are pretty predictable as a cohort. They tend to grow really consistently for very long periods of time. So we have really high payer retention on the platform. And it's been true for forever that the new payers are dilutive to overall monetization of the existing payers we are continuing to add. International monetization, it very much tracks GDP per capita. You look at the wealth effects of countries and the spending will look very, very similar. So if you took the U.S. as a unit of 1 and look at GDP per capita in the other countries, and you'll probably have a pretty good sense of where monetization is around the world. Great. Audra, I think that wraps it up for us. Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","we'll make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, our expectations of our business, future financial results and strategy . this call is being webcast and will be archived on our website shortly afterwards . we'd like to welcome our community and our investors, both large and small .",0.0

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Roblox First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Stephanie Martone, Director of Financial Communications. Ms. Martone, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox Q1 2022 results. With me today is Roblox's CEO, David Baszucki; and CFO, Mike Guthrie.
Before we start, I want to remind everyone that yesterday, after market close, we published a shareholder letter and earnings results on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com.
On this call, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions. For our webcast participants, please note the question icon at the bottom of your screen, where you can type in your questions. We'll do our best to take as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted today.
On today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, our expectations of our business, future financial results and strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements, and such risks are described in our risk factors included in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued yesterday as well as in our supplemental slides, copies of which can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, this call is being webcast. And as a reminder, for those participants, you can enter your questions in the top right side of your screen. The webcast will be archived on our website shortly afterwards.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Welcome, everyone. We welcome all of our investors in the Roblox community. I'm going to share a few notes before we dive in on the Q&A, especially for those who maybe didn't deeply read our shareholder letter.
Reiterating on our growth, daily active users were at 54 million for Q1, which was up 28% year-over-year and our highest ever. And our hours of engagement were up 22%. Bookings were at $631 million for Q1, which was 3% below Q1 of 2021. And I want to highlight, we generated over $150 million of net cash and $100 million of free cash in Q1.
March, we believe, was our most difficult month lapping COVID. And what is really exciting is all of the user gains generally we accrued during COVID, we've kept. That said, our as expected, really, our bookings are highly correlated with hours of engagement, and our hours have decreased in some cohorts as we've emerged from COVID. I'll give an example, which is the USA 9 through 12 cohort, which is an extremely dynamic part of our numbers. And pre-COVID, we had 2 million DAUs in the 9 through 12 cohort spending less than 5 million hours per week.
In the middle of COVID, that jumped to 3 million DAUs in that same 9 through 12 cohort spending 10 million hours per week. We emerged from COVID with that same 3 million DAUs, but now spending 8 million hours per week. And once again, this is highly correlated bookings and hours of engagement. It partially explains our year-on-year bookings number.
For those of you that read our GAAP results, you'll notice that we're going to move to accruing revenue with an average user lifetime moving from 23 to 25 months. This will essentially increase the time we decrease or near out our revenue. But I want to highlight, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased user retention, which is very positive for us. We have enormous headroom even in the U.S. 9 through 12 cohort, because we have a lot of room on our frequency there. We do not share our MAU numbers right now, but there's a lot of room there.
I also want to highlight that in our 17 through 24 cohorts in the core markets well lapping COVID, we are still seeing solid DAU growth numbers year-on-year. And in Q1 end quarter, we saw 6% year-on-year. Internationally, I want to highlight two countries. The first is India, which has enormous potential user activity. We saw in Q1 of 2022 India grow 160% relative to Q1 of 2021 at under 1 million DAUs with a lot of headroom there. And then Japan, which is a potential for enormous economic activity. In Q1 of 2022, we saw growth of 3x relative to Q1 of 2021 with 183,000 DAUs. So that market is just in formation.
We continue to drive innovation up and down our stack. And a couple of innovations that I'll share with you that have emerged in Q1 that we talked about includes spatial voice, our layered clothing and fashion system, our age verification system that is working hand-in-hand with spatial voice. We've introduced Roblox Cloud and the ability for developers to access really the whole back end of their experience through their own APIs, if they so choose.
We have migrated to our own internal Roblox translate system that has shown better long-term engagement growth than other translate providers we've used from the cloud. We've added a data center in India, which is part of the very rapid growth there, and has decreased latency by 50% in India. And we're in our first steps of our facial animation data in Roblox Studio now.
We continue to believe that part of the long-term growth for our company is continuous innovation. And in addition to these, we have many more in the pipeline.
We have shared in our shareholder letter the enormous opportunity for us to lean in on the efficient frontier on the economy on Roblox. And we are taking steps up and down our economy stack to nudge towards optimizing long-term retention and engagement with the revenue flowing through our system and the ability for our developers to build larger and larger teams, as they recognize more economic activity. A few I'll highlight that are underway at Roblox include both on game experience discovery and marketplace discovery. We're well into projects there to balance long-term engagement and retention with the monetization of the various experiences.
We're adding validated accounts and including the ability for people to trust that the items they're buying are from the real Nike or the real Vans. We are in the midst of shortly releasing the ability for brands and developers to boost their experiences through discovery on our homepage, and we started work on our immersive advertising system, which is really long-term the vision we've had for really a parallel economy that supports brands, bringing traffic to their experiences.
I want to highlight anything we do with advertising will be consistent with our values, will be consistent with the ages on our platform, will be consistent with all laws and regulations around advertising, but there is enormous economic opportunity here. And then, just highlighting before we jump into the Q&A, and you'll have to excuse my voice as I go through this. We have a lot more great brand experiences, including the NFL. We launched NFL Tycoon with McLaren and Alo Yoga, American Eagle and Chipotle, who all launched experiences on our platform.
And on music side, we hosted Grammy Week, we hosted The Brit Awards, we hosted David Guetta and with Sony, we did a 24kGoldn virtual concert. As your CEO, I'm still -- just want to highlight in closing the bullishness we have within the company based on the ultimate size of this market. We have a very healthy amount of cash even as we are in the midst of generating cash. We are unique in our developer community and the foundation of stability that we really rest our business on. And we have enormous network effects that drive our growth.
So with that, thank you for joining us, and we'll move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open. Okay. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So Dave, in your shareholder letter, you discussed innovations that are currently in beta testing, specifically custom materials and dynamic heads, have been impacted your KPIs? And when do you expect these to go live? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. In custom materials, we're actually live with parts of that right now. It's a more subtle feature in that it affects -- more diversity and the look and feel of experiences on Roblox because right now Roblox has done a physically based rendering paradigms, so there will be different types of brick and different types of brass and we will be able to customize that. I think one long term Roblox developer and I’m going to quote them for quoting the developer rather than making my own statements that Roblox is doing gods work with custom materials. So I think our developer community is really accepting thing.
On facial animation, we're launching the beta in Roblox Studio and developers have access to that right now. We're not sharing a date on the longer-term launch. As you can imagine, we want that to be as soon as possible to get that into every game so every avatar on Roblox is animated, so both of these will have more subtle long-term effects rather than direct KPI effects. Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, Mike, the April bookings were up high single digits month-to-month. Setting COVID aside, which would create some distortion in the numbers, can you remind us historically what the shape of 2Q bookings looks like and what you're anticipating as you progress through May and June this year? Thanks. Yes. Hey Drew. I'll remind -- well, I'll comment on what the shape of the curve normally looks like. Normally, April is a very strong month for us. It was incredibly strong in '21. It was one of the last super high year-over-year growth rates as COVID last year were starting to wane and reopen. So, we had expected year-over-year growth to bottom in April. Right now, it looks like it bottomed in March, which is good. So sequentially, our year-over-year growth rates in April were better than they were in March. And on an year-over-year basis, I expect that to be true in May and again in June.
In terms of the overall shape of the curve, normally April is higher than May, and then June is higher than -- sorry, May is lower than April and then June is back up higher than May. And really, the opening of the summer season where normal seasonality starts to kick in. Last year, '21, we didn't see the normal seasonal curves because we were going from heavy COVID period early in the year, first three to four months to much more of a reopen period May, June, July through the summer. This year, we're open. And so, we expect more normal seasonality to take hold, meaning, we do expect the summer to be strong vis-à-vis where we are in the spring. And so we'll see that in June, July, August. So we're glad to see the sequential improvement, but expect that to continue in May, June and into the third quarter. Thanks, guys. Thanks. And we will take our next question from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start, just high level, why is now the right time to be leaning into monetization and gives you the -- what gives you the confidence that consumers are willing to spend more on Roblox right now? I'll answer this. And I want to highlight earlier said about, values consistent and efficient frontier. I'll give you a highlight of the opportunity we have, and I think this is more of an opportunity than consumers spending more money. We right now for example, in search and discovery historically have made no real difference in how we feature experiences with the same engagement and the same long-term retention, even if one of those experiences monetizes 10x which the other one does.
So I think this is a more of a consumer value of highlighting experiences that historically consumers have liked to spend Roblox in rather than new kind of ways of trying to pull more money out of consumers. I would say the same is true of our catalog experience, which there is a lot of room for optimization.
One thing, we're doing in our catalog that I'll just – I'll dive in a little bit more deeply on, we're moving our catalog to be 100% user generated and that includes clothing, bodies, heads and faces But a second part of what we're doing in our catalog is enhancing the trading efficiency and really the dynamic nature of our catalog. So we have a range of free items and rare items. This historically has been something Roblox has done very well with Roblox-related items. And we've been doing this for over 10 years. And Roblox economy has gotten to the point where we have items that trade for US$20,000 or 2 million Roblox as they become rare.
We want to add that level of fun and dynamic nature to our catalog. This is actually something our community wants is more opportunity to really work in that kind of trading economy. So everything we do for our economy is consistent, with engagement first, but it is we believe an opportunity to realize the efficient frontier. Understood. And then moving onto advertising knowing that it's still early days in thinking through the opportunity. As you're thinking about what advertising is going to look like on Roblox, is it possible to have a performance marketing piece on advertising in addition to brand marketing? And then if there is performance, would that call to action only be based on experiences within the Roblox metaverse or goods as well, or could it be – translate to the real world as well? Yeah. I will – I don't want to speculate on any dates or any times. I do want to highlight that everything we do is values consistent and within advertising guidelines and appropriate for the various ages. One can imagine advertising units that appear as in-game billboards, in games teleport that all developers on Roblox can choose to use. So this creates a dynamic ad server rather than with 2D image or video pre, well, these are in-game 3D units. You can imagine brands using these units to bring traffic to their own brand experience. We've highlighted in the past brands like Vans and Nike have built brand experiences. We would never claim that they would use this form of the advertising of the other types of brands that might do it. And then as fans are hanging out in brand experiences, you can imagine a wide range of activities within those experiences that includes acquiring virtual items, just like in the physical world, that can include drops, that can include limited numbers of those items that our community would be interested in acquiring. That can include items related to stars, celebrities, athletes that our community would like to acquire virtually.
And then I think longer-term, that gets into the virtual item is tied with a physical item, either through traditional shopping or possibly, in the future, those virtual items are bought, those virtual items can go off our platform wrapped in an NFT. And that NFT is really the equivalent of owning and redeeming the physical item. So I think it goes way beyond performance into the whole life cycle of a fan with the brand and wanting to own part of that brand virtually or physically. Understood. Thanks fore taking the question. And we will take our next question from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. I want to come back to the topic you raise in the shareholder letter around the innovation in user safety. Can we get a better sense of how we should be thinking about spend behind user safety in 2022 and a wider lens of how you think about spending on user safety beyond 2022? And then maybe one quick follow-up would be, you call a lot of examples of how user safety drives, continued momentum on the platform. From our position from the outside looking into the company, how should we think about user safety as driving sort of narratives and momentum around the broader platform you're trying to build for the longer-term and measure in terms of business performance? Thanks so much. Yes. I think we should nuance this in that on user safety, we would imagine as user growth continues, as engagement continues, as the various ways people use Roblox, whether it's expanding to learning, education, working school, concerts, we believe safety and stability is a competitive advantage and something that consumers will just assume is there. So in a way, it's a hidden function that we believe consumers will expect and it's almost think of it in reverse as we set very, very high targets for all of our internal safety and stability metrics, because we believe we then enforce the expanded growth on the platform.
We're doing a lot of work in ML. We're doing a lot of work in recognizing that behavior automatically, doing a lot of work in our ways of detecting both bad content as bad conversations. I think these are things that we just view as a foundation of the company and supporters of really our reputation and the fact that robot is a safe and civil environment. I think that's how we view them as accelerators of long-term growth rather than maybe the more traditional metrics of what is our intention or what is our hours per user. Yes. And Eric, it's Mike. In terms of modeling, I think in the short-term, modeling it in a consistent percentage of bookings is probably a decent assumption. It's not an area where we are looking for great amounts of operating leverage. We're looking for high-quality and safety and breakthroughs for the user base. Having said that, as Dave mentioned, they make the platform better and you can argue they actually make monetization easier and better, if people feel like they're in a safe and civil environment. So in the short run, I would say it would be relatively similar as a percentage of bookings is what you've seen in the last few quarters. If there is leverage there, it's because top line just grew a little bit faster. But overall, as an area of focus, for aggregate dollars, this one is high on the list. Yeah. And then I'm not going to say anything contradictory to what Mike said. But a big part of what our safety and stability team is doing is as we automate tasks that human moderators and human reviewers do, without making any forward-looking prediction on that, one can imagine our safety and stability system actually becomes more efficient. And so we are both not claiming any long-term increases in efficiency, but simultaneously seeing great gains internally on our ability to automate task that human moderators do. Great. Thanks for the color. And we will take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you. David, in the shareholder letter, you noted some changes to product functionality to drive higher frequency and retention for that 9- to 12-year old cohort of US users. Maybe just walk through what some of these updates are? And then are you already seeing the impact of that in your Q1 US, Canada DAU figure, or is the increase there kind of more from aging up? Yeah, this one is tricky because we do not share MAU numbers. And so you cannot discern our DAU to MAU frequency. We've historically not just through COVID, but over the last three or four years made gains in these frequency numbers. And at the same time, there's many more people on our platform monthly than there are daily. Frequency goes up and down the snack. It goes all the way from what is the -- it might seem counterintuitive, but what is the raw launch time of our mobile app, what is the raw launch time of getting into an experience. That influences how quickly can someone get into gain. We've made gains technically so that if you are in the middle a Roblox experience and on your mobile phone patch switch out to some other app and then come back in, you don't lose your context. Longer term, we believe anything around improving the usage of Roblox as a spontaneous communication medium for shorter conversations, maintaining context with friends will drive that frequency. And we're -- I guess, I'm personally optimistic we have a lot of headroom there. Yeah. And then just, David, on the question about the breakout between age demos. In the US, in 9 to 12, when COVID started, the highest rate of penetration was in the 9 to 12 age demo, higher than 13 -- anything 13-plus. And so when COVID started, we had the highest number of users immediately increase their frequency really overnight, lots of hours and subsequently lots of associated bookings. In '13 to '16, '17 to '24, similar dynamics, but on a much lower rate of market penetration and so in those markets, we had more consistent growth in frequency and bookings than we had in 9% to 12%, where we jumped up quickly. And then depending on where we were at lockdowns, you'll see those numbers go back up. And as we reopen, users are still growing, but the frequency just changes as people go back to school.
In the older age demos, though, again, we're getting a higher percentage of new users based on the base in which we started. So those age demos today are caught back up with peak basically, whereas the 9% to 12% is still below. We assume over time, as we, again, continue to add users in 9% to 12% and get higher levels of penetration and as frequency improves based on product changes and other things and just lapping these incredibly high periods of frequency in COVID that will return to growth throughout US. Okay. And then, Mike, maybe just one on margins. I wanted to see if there was any framework you'd be willing to provide for the balance of the year. And just given normal seasonality, should we assume some positive operating leverage as you kind of get into your heavier bookings quarter? Thanks. Yes, good question. Pre-COVID, as a private company, we would routinely in the low double digit EBITDA margins and very high free cash flow margins. And it was a simple -- a company who is self-financing, and we generated a lot of free cash just as a private company over $1 billion. And as we saw the step function in top line during COVID, obviously, you saw a lot of operating leverage really across all cost areas in Roblox, and we went from that low double-digit, maybe mid-teens EBITDA rates to low 30s. And at that time, we felt a keen opportunity to keep investing in the business. We were not -- it was not a goal to maintain margins at 30%.
So we continue to invest in hiring great people. We certainly continue to invest in our developer community, trust and safety and infrastructure. So we continue to make investments for the long run to build the platform. Today, we come into the market with $3 billion of cash. So we're incredibly liquid. And the question is, should we continue to invest in the business for the long run, or should we try to manage our margins? We are not going to test anyone’s comfort levels on liquidity. We’ve a very liquid business. But in the short run, I don't think we're that focused on trying to maintain very high P&L margins. If it happens, that's fine. But right now, the investments that we're making, we see very high returns on in the long run, and we're very liquid. So we're going to be much more focused on doing the things that we think add value, and we'll let margins play out.
Again, if bookings grow a little bit faster, that will be beneficial to margins. But I don't think we want to let that constrained investment, especially in hiring the debt community, trust and safety and infrastructure because the unit economics of this business have always been very strong. And if we needed to dial back some investment, we certainly could do that. I don't think that's really the posture that we're taking right now. We see this as a great opportunity to keep investing. Thank you. And we will take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just around sort of the shape of the year into next year. I think in the fourth quarter letter, you sort of had some commentary about as you go throughout the course of the year, the comps become more normal, the growth rates and bookings and users should get closer and that the exit rate for the year is sort of going to get over 23. Can you just talk to us about, is that still the way you're thinking about the shape of the year in 2023 and sort of puts and takes of where you could over perform or perhaps face more challenges around bookings and user commentary from last quarter? The first one. And the second one, the developer fees as a percentage of bookings did increase a bit in the quarter? And maybe, Mike, you just answered this question in the last one. But just talk to us about how about developer fees philosophically, how is the mix changing? And how should we think about developer fee deleverage for the year? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Overall, what – again, when we came into the year, we thought we would bottom in April in terms of year-over-year growth rate of bookings. Again, last year, bookings were very high in 2021 and it was the last – sort of the last big quarter before the economy started to reopen and people started to go outside again. So we saw in May, June and July actually declines much less year-over-year growth a year ago and actual declines in our users in the US and bookings coming from the US even as we're growing internationally.
So this year, I think we have the opposite impact. We're already open, and we think normal seasonality will return. And so what we had hoped to see is that, we would have sequential improvements in the year-over-year growth rate of bookings. We thought April would be the bottom. It turns out, I think maybe March was the bottom, which is great. April was a little bit better than March. We suspect that May will be a little bit better. And that will continue as we go through the summer, and that ought to shrink that gap between user growth numbers and the rate of bookings growth. And that's our expectation, especially as we go through the summer.
Now if user growth continues really, really strong, then we'll close the gap but we're not going to necessarily catch up with that number. But that's fine. As long as we're improving sequentially and the comparisons are, in fact, getting easier, that's really what we're looking for is that sign.
And again, this time last year, we actually had almost negative seasonality from would expect. This year, we expect much more normal seasonality. So that's a good setup for us for improved – continued improved growth year-over-year growth as we go from April, May, June, et cetera. And then, before it's too long, we will have this sort of COVID – hopefully, the COVID distortions out of the numbers on a year-over-year basis.
On dev fees, we're making investments in the dev community. We have both our normal rates of take from transactions as well as engagement-based payouts. In the last year-plus, we've really leaned into engagement base. We think there have been some real benefits from that. And again, I don't think of the dev community is a place where we see short-term operating leverage. We see an opportunity to keep investing in an incredible developer community. What we want is developers feeling like they can continue to invest in Roblox and build their businesses on our platform. And so it's not an area in which we see we're going after leverage. We're still – we have talked several quarters ago about moving into the 25% of bookings range. I think we were at 23% this past quarter. So we're in a very comfortable range right now. And so I don't – I think that's a good way to model it out, if you will. I just want to highlight that with the current place our developer fees are at, we see more and more big organic brands coming to the platform. The Sonic experience on Roblox was highly organic and not an experience, where we go out and really push for that to happen. The Spotify experience once again, highly organic. So this goes to our vision of having an economy that we migrate from the individual hobbyists to small companies. So we will pass – I believe we already have 100-person studio working on our platform, to VC-funded studios now working on our platform, to brands creating experiences on our platform organically, which is – is kind of a validation of our developer fee structure. Got it. Thank you, both. Very helpful. And we'll take our next question from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I have two of them, one on layered clothing and one on your development strategy and philosophy. So, in terms of layered clothing, since you released it in March and more fully in April, has adoption been ahead or behind your expectations?
On your blog, you described layered clothing as a steppingstone technology. How much time does that need to spend in production, or what milestones does it need to reach before you feel confident about releasing UGC Avatar bodies and dynamic ads? And have your learnings on layered clothing to-date caused you to pull in or push out when you might release those two derivative technologies versus your thinking as of late last year? And I'll follow-up with my second question after your answer. Yes. I'll share maybe a little bit of internally what you would hear at the company, and that is we -- I personally believe that as we move to user-created bodies and heads, the long-term impact of that could be bigger than layered clothing because, ultimately, who you are is your body and your head, and that's underway right now.
We had really good adoption of layered clothing. I think roughly 30% of our daily actives are wearing it right now. The -- but bodies and heads, we believe, will be a much more -- I personally, I don't want to quote whether it's going to move our metrics, but my own personal thing is it's just as big, if not bigger. And that is well underway. We've talked about it before. We want to get that out as quickly as possible. Okay, right. So, then it's more of a strategic question, just to finish up. Could you tell me why your strategy of developing new technologies like layer clothing to be compatible with previous generations of digital matter is difficult for competitors to replicate and how it might create barriers to entry as competition begins to -- competitors begin to launch their Metaverse-like platforms geared towards your similar core demographic? Yes, this is a great question. I want to highlight that long-term, when we view what makes Roblox competitive, it's a holistic collection of things. It includes the momentum and size of our very large creator community, it includes the quality of our development platform and tool set. It includes the foundation we have on safety and stability. It includes the innovations we're making right now, including UGC bodies and UGC layered clothing, but it also includes our ability to continuously innovate and release big innovations over the next one to five years, just as we have over the last 15 years.
So, these are all part of what I believe makes Roblox extremely competitive, but ultimately, it's our ability to innovate. We have a unique stack that we vertically control all the way from our game engine, to our cloud, to our clients, to our developer tools that operates really as a consistent whole. So, I think our long-term competitive advantage is much more a holistic mix of all of these. And one could think of those as moat. We typically think more in terms of long-term innovation, as opposed to relying or depending on anything we might think of a moat.
Basically, innovation is moving forward. And the best way for Roblox to get to 1 billion monthly actives is not to simply defend what we might think of as moat. It's really to continue creating our vision of the metaverse, which still very early, and we feel we have a unique handle on what that's going to be. Okay. Thank you, Dave. Yes. You’re welcome. And we'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with Lightshed Partners. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple. Earlier in answering, I think it was David's question, you spoke to the high ROI on your investment spend. And I guess, throughout the call in the letter, you've spoken to platform features that have rolled out and the past several quarters.
Is there any way for you to quantify or explain the impact of any of these features on engagements and/or monetization? And will we see some more tangible impact from the likes of voice and layered clothing as this year goes on? And then, I have a follow-up. Yes. I want to share, what you're mentioning is something internally we try to do as much as possible. And I'll highlight also -- Mike, you can jump in if you want. In the past, through periods of rapid growth and just as we have rapid growth right now in many cohorts in many places around the world, we've tried to analyze the contributors to that and analyze the last year of product releases and tried to create statistical correlation. And we found that, that's difficult to do.
I think, with some of the innovations that we have coming right now, like spatial audio, we will be able to measure the time that those users are engaged in audio communication, rather than text communication.
And I think that will be a good signal going forward for that. So we will try going forward with some of these big innovations, whether it's spatial audio, our avatar system, our translate system, our developer cloud to share as much as we can about what makes those users possibly more engaged or possibly more retained.
Generally, when we find users that are more engaged and more retained that does contribute to the growth of the overall platform. So where we can, we will try to share those metrics with you. Yes. And Brandon, having said that, I think any point in time a three, four, five-year window of this business and look at the users engagement and the bookings growth of the business and the platform, the growth rates have been very significant.
The investment areas have been very consistent: investment-grade engineers, we have a product road map that we -- as we're ushering in a category, we make calls on what we think will make that better for our developers and our -- and for our users.
And generally, the output of that has been very high growth, more users around the world, an older age demographic, more and more developers building great content, enormous amount of engagement and huge growth in the top line of the business.
So any specific decision is meant to continue to advance things that we have very good proof of generating high rates of return over time. And so, of course, every time we launch something, we want it to be high return. But generally the business and the business model that we have has fantastic unit economics, and so we're always trying to improve those. And over a very long period of time, the return dynamics here have been excellent. So we're going to continue to make those kinds of decisions based on a lot of historical good decision-making. And in the lack of saturation, which we don’t believe we have anywhere, we're quite comfortable that those will generate high returns in the future. Yeah. I'll share a few just tidbit metrics on layered clothing as of the end of March, I believe, over 200 million items and have already been acquired by the players and people on our platform. On voice, we're rolling this out in a very values consistent and conservative way for validated users to start using our new validation system. And for those users that we've rolled this out to, they're averaging 20 minutes roughly per daily activity using spatial audio. Great. And then just -- I was kind of comparing in my mind the approach that you've taken with outside IP holders with that of Epic. And it seems like you've really taken more of a hands-off approach outside of maybe music, while Epic has really aligned themselves closely with some key IPs such as Disney and then Lego as a way to kind of widen the funnel. Why is your approach better? And does it make sense to closely align with key IP holders for you? I think this is a really good question, and this goes to the core of our Roblox division and how we build a platform. Over 15 years ago when we started our work on this category, what sometimes is referred to as user-generated content, or UGC, internally we refer to as self-service. And self-service is really difficult. It's hard to build a platform where everything from a small individual hobbyist all the way to, as I just referred to, Sonic the Hedgehog shows up on Roblox. It's hard to build a platform when those things happen without a custom compiler, a custom build, without a biz dev process without a lot of close interworking.
But we believe what we've seen in games and play will more and more move forward in brands, in music and ultimately in custom IP on our platform. So this is a vision for us. I don't want to comment on Epic or Lego or what they're doing. We -- I personally believe there's enormous scalability in building a self-service platform in all of these dimensions, a single unified platform where ultimately a brand like Lego would build a Lego experience on top of Roblox, and more and more be able to present that as their unique experience. So this is more the direction we're going. We believe it's very, very scalable. And at the same time, I think there's a lot of different ways that people have at looking at this. Great. Thank you. And we have time for one more question. And that question will be from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. I have two. The first is on engagement. Dave, I wanted to come back to what you had said about US nine to 12 cohort performance. if we maybe go up a layer and think about the sort of 2.3, I think it is, hours that users are spending on platform right now, do you expect that to sort of stabilize at kind of an above pre-COVID rate going forward? And as we think about sort of bookings and hours over time, is that -- does the incremental hour generation come from growth of the overall user base, or do you see upside to the average user sort of time spent on platform? And then I got a follow-up on OpEx. Yes. I think I shared earlier, there's a lot of headroom in our -- one of our core cohorts, such as USA nine through 12. What I would like to share is internally, there's room on the monthly active. They're not huge room. We have such a big portion of the nine- to 12-year olds in the US already on the platform, but there's room there. There's a lot of room on frequency, which is our DAU to MAU ratio.
And as I shared earlier, that cohort is spending slightly less time as we've emerged from COVID as they were within COVID. I would say our focus will be on more of the DAU to MAU ratio. We believe that's correlated with retention. We believe that focus will ultimately drive even bigger MAU ratios. And we believe that's where we're going to be heads down a bit more than hours per DAU, especially in that cohort. Just on, Clark, on hours per DAU, we did see a trend. Obviously, pre-COVID at certain level, very high. Then during COVID, we went very, very high hours per DAU. During COVID, we've come back down a little bit as reopening has started. But -- so we're down below peak coated hours per DAU, but we are higher than we were hours per DAU going into it.
And so as users have come into road blocks, spend a lot of time, even as we've been growing the user base, there is an even higher level of overall engagement. And that's really true around the world. So in all of our regions, we see the same behavior. So we do feel like we're starting at -- as we've reopened it, at an accelerated level vis-a-vis where we were coming into the pandemic. That's helpful. And then just on hiring, Mike, most of your employees are sort of engineering talent. That hiring backdrop has gotten a lot more competitive. I know in the past, you've talked about wanting to increase headcount pretty significantly versus sort of late 2021 levels. Are you having any trouble in this market either finding talent, or is really the byproduct of what we're seeing right now mainly higher cost per head inflation? Yes. What you're seeing, it is a competitive market and everyone has seen costs of talented folks go up for sure. Right now we're ahead of our internal plans, which is great. It was a good first quarter in terms of recruiting. We continue to feel like we're a fantastic place for talented engineers and product professionals and even those in the G&A functions to build their careers. And we expect to continue to grow our talented staff. And so far this year, we're doing great against our targets. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Thank you for joining us today. And Abby, that's a wrap for us. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.","Roblox's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call is being recorded . today's call may be making forward-looking statements, including our expectations of our business, future financial results and strategy . on this call, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the time for your questions .",1.0

With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thank you, and welcome to our investors, and welcome Roblox community. I'll share a few quick highlights and then we'll take questions. We had a solid Q2, and then we followed this up with July, which was absolutely the biggest engagement month in Roblox's history, including all peak COVID times. And the month of July was a peak across regions and across demographics.
I want to share a few highlights. In July, our DAUs were $58.5 million, up 26% year-on-year. And our hours of engagement were 4.7 billion hours across the whole platform, up 25% year-on-year.
I want to highlight that, this year-on-year growth and this peak engagement also included our core US Canada market with DAUs up 15% year-on-year and hours up 23% and bookings up 14% year-on-year in July. We continue to see accelerating growth in our over 13 DAUs, which were up 36% year-on-year globally and as greater than 13 users on the platform become more prevalent. This is a good harbinger of the potential size of this market and why we continue to be so optimistic.
And then finally, we exited June booking, up 8% year-on-year and July bookings, up roughly 8% to 10% year-on-year. This is powered by amazing content and our amazing community and continued innovation on the technology side.
On the content side, we are approaching 50% of our top 1,000 experiences with more over 13 than under 13 players and our developer community with our developers producing experience that gained over 1 million hours per month is up 32% year-on-year. We continue to see great brand experiences side-by-side, the amazing roadblocks experiences that has traditionally been on our platform. And more and more of these are self-served.
I'll highlight some of the brands we shared with this last quarter, including Gucci Town, which had over 30 million visits since March. We saw Tommy Play from Tommy Hilfiger with over 7 million visits since June, Wimbledon released WimbleWorld and Spotify Island was released, which is a persistent space with artist appearances.
I want to highlight that we are getting to the point where our 17 through 24 cohort is going to pass our 9 through 12 cohort in size. Now the 17 to 24 cohort is larger. But once again, this is a great signal of the potential size of our market across all ages. This growth, in addition to being powered by our amazing content developers and our amazing viral community is supported by our innovative tech, some of which is iterative and measurable, including improvements to our Roblox's translation system, including the quality and personalization of our search and discovery system, and even including things that might not be ratably noticeable, such as the speed that our mobile app and game joins occur in is raw performance.
On the vision side, our layered clothing system is just a first step to very highly personalized avatars across the platform. Our voice system is rolling out and is a great sign of really the future of how people will communicate on platforms like Roblox. And our physically-based material system is widely acclaimed by our developers as the next step in taking Roblox to a more realistic look and feel.
Finally, I want to highlight that we continue to work on innovative, immersive native monetization systems, and we do expect to be rolling out a test of our immersive advertising system sometime later this year. You'll notice in our announcement, we are making investments in infrastructure. We are building a worldwide cost performance and reliability, we're leading infrastructure including active performance around the world. And I want to highlight that infrastructure performance contributes to our growth with an example of the recent data center we deployed in India.
Finally, we continue to hire at the same rate we did in H1 and are optimistic about continuing to bring great talent into the company.
With that, we will move on to your questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Drew Crum from Stifel. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks. Hey, guys, good morning. So Dave, in your shareholder letter and in your preamble, you noted your fastest growth demographic in the US and Canada was that 17- to 24-year-old segment. Can you remind us how this cohort monetizes relative to others on the Roblox platform? And then I have a follow-up. Hey, Drew, it's Mike. Just getting into the numbers. In the last -- in the month of July, that 17- to 24-year-old cohort in the US, and we measured this on a bookings per hour basis was actually just slightly ahead of our core 9 to 12 demographic, which historically has been our peak monetizing age demo. Now we've expected that. Over time, we would say that the older users who have more direct control over their spend become more prominent in the market, they would monetize better, and we certainly saw that in July. Got it. Thanks, Mike. And then, Dave, maybe more broad question. During this current earnings cycle, several video game publishers have cited weaker trends across mobile gaming with Roblox being a free-to-play model, what are your thoughts on how the business should perform during a period of economic weakness? Thanks. Yeah. I want to highlight one of the wonderful things about Roblox is we're not a game and we're not really even a game platform, we're future human experience platform. And a lot of what people do on Roblox is to come together, to be together, to connect, to socialize. We're starting to see people supporting educational experiences. We have traditionally been neutral, i.e., immune to these types of economic cycles. We have a robust economy. We've been through these cycles before, and we've been relatively immune to them. We'll move next to David Karnovsky at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could just discuss the ongoing rollout of voice chat, how developers and players are responding to it and how that might be impacting frequency for some of the older cohorts. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned a test advertising later this year. Just wondering if you could expand on the scope of that and what that potentially implies for rollout or when you might be able to update investors on kind of the longer opportunity there? Yeah. I want to highlight consistent with our values and the way we run Roblox since the early days, safety instabilities high priority here. We are rolling voice out. It is partially rolled out now with older players with validated IDs and which we're opening that aperture. We can measure increased engagement from the people using voice. And so we're very opposite about what's happening there. The vision of immersive advertising has been around for a long time, and this is both performance as well as brand advertising. We are going to be rolling out tests ultimately along both of these lines. And it's the notion that in an immersive 3D space, it's a lot less -- there's a lot less friction when we see appropriate advertising, just like we would in the real world of billboard ads, for example, which we can scale across all the experiences on Roblox. But we're also optimistic now that we see many brands establishing a presence in Roblox that some of these brands will also want performance marketing, which is a way for – in the appropriate case for people to be able to go to one of our brand partners directly from someone else's 3D experience. So we're really optimistic about this, and we love the idea of in a gentle way, complementing our already very healthy economy with an additional potential revenue source. Thank you. We'll move next to Clark Lampen with BTIG. Please go ahead. Thanks a lot. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the sort of success that you're seeing with 17-plus users just because we are seeing a lot of signs of success with aging out, both in terms of aggregate DAUs and engagement. Could you give us more of a sense how those users are engaging differently versus younger ones? Are they spending time in different experiences or are they monetizing more passively or using different hardware? Any color you could provide would be appreciated.
And then Mike, just given you guys made some comments around sort of CapEx trends over the balance of the year. Could you give us a sense for infrastructure investment projects? Is this really a 2022 endeavor, or is this something that we can see sort of stretching into 2023 and beyond? Anything you can say about cash flow and CapEx would be appreciated. Thanks. Yeah, I'll start off on the experiences. I noted that, the top 1,000 experiences on our platform, 481 now have more 13 and up players than under 13 players. Our developer community is amazingly responsive. The quality of the content that they're creating is getting better and better, both based on their sophistication, the size of their teams as well as our tool set and our infrastructure. And we can see more and more experiences in those top thousands that are very heavily targeted to older players.
So like any healthy market, given the size of our developer economy, we are seeing developers respond with those experiences. And in addition, we have a pipeline of experiences that are very aligned with the types of things older players might want to do coming through our game fund.
I want to highlight that across our platform the vision for a platform like this goes way beyond playing games. We know right now, for example, in the midst of COVID, people use robots as a communication tool to be together when they can't be together physically. We can see partners like First Robotics now getting ready to launch educational experiences for people who can build Roblox with the physical kits. And we ultimately, all of our brand partners, including our music partners are using Roblox as a way for people to go to concerts together. So the vision of this category is bigger than play. And as you correctly note, there's a lot of difference, the use patterns we see across the platform. And Clark, CapEx will be spread across the balance of this year and next year. So, we'll certainly be investing in infrastructure across both periods. Timing of spend, we give a rough estimate of what it looked like for the back half of the year, but we'll definitely have incremental spend in 2023. But we view it as incredibly productive and is partially driven by just a substantial growth in our user base and a desire to get to more – even more economical infrastructure. So, more performance, more reliable, and more efficient for us. Thank you. We'll move next to Matthew Cost at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, one for Dave, one for Mike. Dave, just there's some language in the letter about key investments and product initiatives that drove a positive impact for July. You touched on it in the prepared remarks, but I wonder if you could just give any more detail about what specific products you think were the most impactful for July? And then for Mike, just wondering how should we think about the pathway for margins from here as you continue to invest in new hires and infrastructure? Thank you. Yes. Our growth is powered by the content created by our community by the core virality of our product, which is great content, coupled with a viral loop and then with innovative technology, all of the things I measured are early signals. Our layered clothing system is an early signal towards hyper-personalized avatars that more and more might look like you might be of various styles that are sorted by our creator community. So this is a first step.
And on voice, once again, would highlight long-term, we see more and more people potentially using voice as we roll this out. There are also under the covers coupled with the visionary type we're working on, constant iterative improvements on raw performance, how quickly can you join a Roblox experience. So we can see our translate system. We can see search and discovery. We can see raw mobile app performance. We could see our game engine performance, all contributing to growth as we go forward.
And up and down our product stack, there continues to be big things we’re working on. We'll share some of these at Investor Day, but we have a lot of other visionary things in the pipeline. We've said publicly that this doesn't really stop until we're supporting a 50,000-person concert at photorealism in real-time was simulated audio and video. So there's a huge runway for technical innovation in this space. And then, Matthew, you asked a question about margins. So let me address that, and then I want to make another comment here. During sort of peak period, so we look back prior to the scaling that we saw during COVID, the business tended to run in EBITDA margins in the mid-teens, pretty consistently. And as we scaled up during COVID, those margins basically doubled, and we found ourselves in the 30% range.
And we were really clear at the time that was not steady-state margins for us, and we saw an enormous amount of opportunity to invest. But the top line is growing so quickly that it's very difficult to almost bring the margins down. What we’ve chosen to invest in are the things that we see incredibly high ROI, hiring great people, pushing more in the economics for our developer community, which is clearly bearing fruit today, and we'll continue to do so and the investment in infrastructure.
Today as we've been incredibly consistent in our investments and the top line has flattened as we're coming out of COVID and now that started to pick up again. Obviously, margins are going to move around. What's consistent is that we're investing for the long run and that we have the unit economics and liquidity that continue to do that. I suspect that when we get into 2023 and we're no longer dealing -- or hopefully, no longer dealing with COVID comparisons or non-COVID comparisons, we'll start to see the top line grow at a rate that will allow us to produce a really healthy EBITDA margin. We will, however, continue to invest in infrastructure next year. So free cash flow margins will be down, but overall, operating margins, I think, will go back up and we'll be in a healthy place. But we'll continue to invest for the future.
I just want to make one quick comment. You had -- in your note this morning, you said that you expect elevated SBC will continue to drive scrutiny on the risk of dilution from new higher retention background. I just -- maybe we'll just removing scrutiny. We've been really clear we were in the latter. We've been tracking this as a management team as operating executives, and we're spending an enormous amount of time structuring our compensation plans and our recruiting plan.
We worked with our Board. We saw this coming, and we've been really clear that we would keep share dilution under 5%. The good news here is you've got shareholders on the side of the table. And so we are a dilution-sensitive as any shareholder who is out there on the call. So we're going to continue to recruit great talent. We're going to continue to compensate our people and we're also going to watch the dilution and keep it under 5% and hopefully do even a little bit better than that. So I don't think there should be any undue speculation or concern there. We'll move next to Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Okay. So can you please give me an update on the level of adoption of layer clothing among your players, number one. And number two, back in March, shortly after its launch, you had showed that the purchases of layer clothing items did not cannibalize purchases of existing 2D and 3D clothing items and that was at the GDC. I wanted to ask you whether that is still the case. And number three, do you have a sense yet for when 3D layer clothing will be coming to the community at large, the creation of 3D layered clothing will be coming to the community at large, and I have a follow-up question after that. I'll go highlight and then I'll see if Mike has the numbers floating around on that. Taking a step back and peaking at the vision of where this is going, it's ultimately every avatar every head, every piece of clothing on our platform is created by the community. Historically, almost all of this was created by Roblox, and we're just about through that transition where everything is made by the community. The final one that you're going to see rolling out is Avatars themselves being created RTDs well, and that will bring us full circle and you'll see an amazing new look.
So we are very optimistic that this is not viewed as a necessary cannibalization situation as much as where is the future here. And the future is everyone has a hyper-realistic avatar. It looks just like them. You can imagine all the ways we might build in avatar, including using a camera on a device using ML, using developers themselves, there's a lot of interesting and exciting ways in the future, we'll build avatars, coupled with a lot of clothing that is more and more created by our community. So this is the right direction. It is the big vision. Ultimately, all of the clothing on our platform will be 3D clothing. And there will still be an opportunity for users to create clothings, but it will be painting on 3D clothing rather than long-term using our traditional 2D clothings. I don't know, Mike, if we are sharing any numbers on the adoption, but ultimately, we expect 100% of users to be using layered clothing. Yeah. So I would give you a couple of quick numbers and just some trends. I think that's the most important thing, but it's a good question. So as of June 30, we had over 100 million users that had actually acquired a layered clothing item. And we've been doing test to look at the economic output of those users and how they behave. And we've clearly seen it being accretive to bookings and robust spend.
So we'll give more data as that becomes a bigger and bigger part of the business. But so far, the early indications are high levels of adoption and high performance within the user base that does acquire the items. Okay. Thank you. And then along the same kind of topic, you released dynamic heads towards the end of June. And I was wondering, and you also said, I believe, in the release that dynamic heads would be available in the avatar store at some point in the fourth quarter, which is new information.
Can you give us a little bit of an idea of what the plan for monetization of dynamic heads is like? Will the heads developed by a curated community of creators, sort of, beyond sale there? Will users buy heads with a subset of emotions that are animated on their faces? I guess, exactly -- what exactly will the buyers on Roblox be buying? Yes. Let's take a big visionary step here. And we acquired a company called Lumi over a year ago, and you can check out the types of demos and the technology they create, but it ultimately drives towards the vision that, for those users who so choose on our platform, in addition to having their avatars to be more personalized and more animated like themselves, the opportunity to actually have the heads and faces of those avatars to animate in sync with optionally the use of the camera on your device or lip syncing.
We shared demos of this. I've done meetings this way. It's absolutely immersive and engaging in the future of where this is all going. Dynamic heads one part of this. And the rollout will occur in various steps.
One is developer tooling. The next step is very simple things like emojis and really emotes actually and the ability to have a pre-canned animation on your head and ultimately full tracking of that.
We always think long term, first and foremost, about engagement, retention and really frequency and making our experiences better. Because our bookings tend to scale with bookings per hour, we expect the more engagement we get; the better this is going to really be on top.
So, I think, we're not as much -- there is huge opportunity for dynamic heads in our marketplace. And at the same time, I want to highlight that we're primarily thinking about this long term as increasing engagement. But it's going to be overall positive in both dimensions. And then, I don't know, Mike, if you want to share anything on top of that? No, I think, we'll report more as we have more data and maybe touch on this at Investor Day next month. Got it. Thanks very much. Thanks, Omar. We'll move next to Bernie McTernan at Needham & Company. Please, go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start, if you could talk about the product improvements to search and discovery. You spoke about on the last call, and I think it helped with some of the age of content this quarter. So if you could just detail when the improvements happened during the quarter and if there's still more improvements to come, just looking for the full quarter benefits in the third quarter. Yes. I want to highlight that one of our vision -- values is take a long view, but one of our values is get stuff done. These improvements are happening every day. They are not forklift drops. There're a constant weekly improvement in the way we do search and discovery. There is so much opportunity here because as people come to our platform from different regions, from different ages, from different interest, there's an amazing opportunity to personalize the types of experiences they see when they both first join our platform as well as when they become mature users, and we have a lot of signals that you might not find on a traditional platform, including what are your friends doing, what do people like you do, what have you done in the past. So, this is constantly improving. We are more and more getting personalized.
We are ultimately trying to share experiences with everyone on the platform that will keep them engaged as much as possible and ultimately drive the long-term enterprise value. And this is occurring both in cold start as well as a warm start from more mature players on the platform.
So, to go full circle on your answer every day, I will add that one of the things we have done in the last quarter, we shared that we were going to do it is more and more move to the efficient frontier where we have historically been 100% engagement based on our discovery and search. We believe there is an efficient frontier where engagement is balanced with monetization that drives the overall health of our platform.
And really, when we have two experiences that are both retaining well, that are both predictive about the same play time, we are nudging towards that experience that monetizes better in that type of situation, which is what the efficient frontier is above. Understood. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, in the past, you've spoken about the weekend versus weekday usage, and that gave you confidence in to be able to grow following the tough COVID comp. Can you just talk about what you're seeing for weekday versus weekend usage now that you're at peak engagement again? I want to just highlight that our long-term growth has so much opportunity, it's not predicated on weekdays or weekend. Even in our most healthy long-term cohorts, which would be US, Canada in nine through 12, there's a lot of headroom there given that traditional Roblox users aren't using Roblox every day as a communication tool. So, there's a lot of room on frequency within our traditional audience.
As you can see, the growth rates in our 13 and up and 17 through 24 cohorts, that cohort of 17 to 100 is much larger than the cohort of nine through 12. And so there is also an amazing headroom amongst the older players on our platform to complement the headroom we have in our traditionally strong cohorts based on frequency. Yes, just adding to that, we --when COVID started our core age demo spiked up very quickly and especially in terms of engagement. And then as we started to lap and reopen, obviously, especially in the US, that nine to 12 was actually filling our bookings growth numbers down, but we were making up for in other places.
We've now gotten to the point where we crested back to the point we're on an absolute level. Those cohorts are now growing around the world. And importantly, in the US and Canada because that's where there's a more significant amount of wealth and spend. So, we are now at peak levels of daily active users and engagement and bookings in those nine to 12-year cohorts in the US and benefiting from growth in 17 to 24, 13 to 16 on all the older user bases. So we're in a great position. We're finally now on an absolute basis.
Now on where all of that growth that we benefited from during COVID were absorbed. We've, obviously, retained the vast majority of it, and we're now growing on top of that really across all age demographics. So that's true on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Saturdays as well. So yeah, I think we're -- hopefully, if we all stay helpful and go on living our lives will be more or less done with COVID comparisons here pretty soon. Great. Thank you both. Thanks. We'll move next to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe talk a little bit about what you're building on the advertising side as another means of monetization. And how should we be thinking about to make sure both investments on the advertising side, building relationships with advertisers and what you see as some of the revenue output of that as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much. Yeah. I want to highlight the opportunity on our platform, both for traditional experienced developers who are new developers creating new games and experiences on our platform as well as brands who are establishing presence for people to interact with clothing, people to interact with music, people to interact with beauty, people to interact with a wide range of things and potentially even monetize within those experiences.
So traditionally, a lot of these experienced developers and brands have been saying, how do I boost more, how do I get more traffic to my experience? How do I do a test? How do I reliably bring one million users to get this experience? And this is the wonderful opportunity for native immersive, non-intrusive advertising in our platform.
Imagine we are at one of our most popular Roblox experiences. Imagine a AAA partner had a small pop-up in the town square and players will be able to choose whether to stop by, use that pop-up or portal or door, you name it to jump over to one of our brand experiences, experience something new, pick up some free merchant and back, pop back to the experience that they're playing.
So this is a very scalable potential way to incorporate gently, both paid as well as performance and brand advertising Given that we did 4.7 billion hours of engagement in the month of July, even at a very conservative gentle way is an initially trying this with top-notch brands, you can see the potential there relative to the advertising per hour. So I said it before, this has been always a visionary type of advertising. It's exciting because it doesn't get in the way of a user or add friction like some other types of advertising. And we believe it will last in a fun and positive way that will complement our experiences. And you ended up your question on, are we scaling up the team internally to covering the brands? Is that the last part of your question? Yeah, I'll take two things, and then Mike, maybe finish. We are building traditionally what has powered Roblox is the notion that at its foundation we built self-service. And self-service is always more difficult to build than bespoke things. Our Roblox's success is we are a self-service platform for experienced creators. The product direction for this advertising system will also be self-service but it will be complemented by our amazing brands.
We have a great team. It's scaling. We have amazing people who are working with the Gucci and the Tommy Hilfigers to us in this new form of advertising to the platform. And we expect to continue building this amazing brand team. It will not be a sales team, it will be a consultative team to help people who are doing self-service and exploring our platform. Yes, I'd just add, it is a thing that's been in place for a while. These discussions with brands have been going on for quite a while. And we really do see it above and beyond just at sales organization is very strategic. And we've been talking with brand about the overall benefit of immersive engagement on our platform in multiple ways. You've heard us talk about this before. We have had incredibly high-quality brands more or less experimenting on our platform in a new medium, which is really exciting. We've not raised to monetize these too quickly. I think we've learned the time and the team has done a great job and the quality of the brands that we've been working with has just been first class. We'll move next to Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, David and Mike. This is Steve Parke [ph] on for Matt Thornton. Two questions, if I could. Can you talk about how we should think about the incremental monetization efforts laying and impact in the second half of 2022? Samples being sponsored or commercial pads and commerce. Also, how should we think about what normal seasonality is for August and September? And any growth comparisons you would call out for the second half of 2022? Thank you. Hey, Steve, let me take the last questions and work in reverse. So we noted in the letter that there was Omicron happened in Q4 of last year. So we're just making sure that everybody is aware in doing their own homework as we go into the fourth quarter. Obviously, we've got a lot of momentum from May to June, June to July. We expect that to continue, the normal shape of the curve in terms of the third quarter is what you saw last year, which is that from July to August, specifically, August is flat to slightly down 2%, let's say, off of July that sort of the normal seasonality. And that's really because, of course, people start to go back-to-school.
And so later as the month goes on, you start to see the absolute numbers going down. That doesn't mean the growth rates will go down. It just means the absolute numbers will go down. And so it ends up being somewhere around 1% to 2%.
September is full-blown back-to-school and on a sequential basis, typically, last year, as an example, we were down 15%, September from August. But that's totally normal seasonality completely expected. So you can -- I think the shape of the curve this year will be very, very similar.
Q4 last year, we had an unusual October. So I just want to make sure everyone goes back and does their homework. We had an outage. So you've got to look at the numbers. We reported a lot of information on October last year. November, things start to pick back up around Thanksgiving and then December is obviously a huge month with the holidays. And I suspect that we're going to see the exact same trends this year because generally, those are business seasonal trends that we've seen over the years. Yes. I just want to highlight, we'll be testing our immersive advertising system sometime this year, we believe. Right now, we don't expect that to contribute to our bookings. We do -- I do want to highlight the things I have mentioned that are iterative improvements that we're constantly making, including translate quality, search and discovery quality efficient frontier, those types of things may have small incremental improvements, but that's something we're doing all the time. We'll move next to Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead. Thanks. Brandon Ross. Just looking at your DevEx fees, I think this is the first quarter that they actually went down as a percentage of bookings, as far back as we have a window into. Can you talk about what you expect the cadence of DevEx to be overtime? And how much pressure you feel as perhaps, Epic rolls out the next version of Fortnite Creative and have potentially more significant creator splits. How much pressure do you feel to match or move towards those splits? Then I have a follow-up. So our DevEx numbers as a percentage of bookings have been pretty consistently growing overtime as we suggested for literally years. We wanted to share more and more of the economics of the developer. So, I'm looking at the supplemental materials that we posted on our site. And if you look at that over the last three years, as a percentage of bookings, good numbers have gone from about 15% to 23% in Q1 and 22% last quarter.
Honestly, I wouldn't read much into a 100-basis point movement in a 90-day period. I mean there's mostly DevEx is a variable cost that is driven with bookings. So, it goes up as bookings growth on an absolute dollar basis, it could come out a little bit as bookings comes down. But generally, we've leaned in pretty heavily to this.
The sheer growth in our developer community is [indiscernible] all the sheer amount of creativity, new content. It's absolutely phenomenal. The economics for our developers is clearly getting better and better. When you look at the amount of currency earned by the 1,000th developer on the platform, those numbers are growing incredibly robustly.
And so, we can just see a bigger and bigger community making a full-time living on the Roblox platform, and we're incredibly excited about that. We have a unique value proposition with our developers. It is not -- we talked about this a lot. It's not about absolute take rates. It's about the level of the service and the quality of that service. And we just continue to build great relationships with our community and we'll continue to push more and more towards them overtime. We have -- I think, a few quarters ago said that, we would be pushing towards 25% and we're obviously in that zip code right now. Yes, four years ago at the Roblox developer conference, I made a wild conjecture that we'd see a developer studio with more than 100 people. And it actually has come through much sooner than we thought it would happen. And we're going to continue to see these larger studios go well beyond 100 people in the studio, which highlights the economic support they're getting from creating on our platform, as well as more developers down around 1,000 or even 10,000, who are starting to make money, and filling out that super long tail of talent that's starting to build on our platform. Great. And then in your letter, when you mentioned the highest, the most engaged and most profitable cohorts that you have, I noticed they were both male cohorts. And it got me to wondering what the overall split is between male and female on the platform. And what would take what you need to do to bring females up to parity with male engagement? Yeah, I want to highlight long-term, I don't know the exact ratio at the top of my head right now. I don't think we've ever shared it. But over the years, Roblox has more and more converged to exactly 50-50 on the platform. And the reason is these types of platforms support everything from traditional game play to their social game play, to things spanning from sports to fashion to beauty, to vehicles, you name it. So we're pretty optimistic that long term, the direction continues to be towards 50-50, with a wide range of types of activity on a platform like Roblox. And I think that shows in our internal numbers. Thanks, Dave. Thanks. We'll move on to the next question from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Two questions. I wonder, if we could start with, it seems like there's a lot of announcements in the last month or so of new brands getting involved in Roblox and the metaverse. And I'm curious, are there enough developers out there to support all these inquiries from the various brands? Yes. What I believe we're seeing right now, and we saw this with print a long time ago. We saw this with video more recently, and we're going to see this with immersive 3D going forward is, there is a traditional structure of service bureaus, of developers, creators who help either with graphics and video or 3D production.
Our talent hub is serving the purpose of bringing these brands together with our creators. They have an active market for people to connect here. And many of the brands that are starting to shop on our platform are doing it unannounced, which means they're doing it in a self-service way, they are finding developers out there either on their own, or through our Talent Hub, to help them or they're developing that expertise in-house.
We think this is – this highlights the future where our traditional developers have been 100% experienced developers for play or for social, but there's an emerging class of developers who are brand support developers, who will complement those traditional experienced developers. Yeah, Eric, I think these are just a classic behavior of the market in a sense. It's a great question. And right now, we would hope almost that there's more demand than there is supply, because that will be a signal to the community that, this is a business that they can expand into. I was talking to venture capitalist the other day, who has now invested in a Roblox studio, which again, is a dynamic that we feel is very healthy. Part of what they said was there's a really interesting balance between their investments and the experiences that they've build and in support of brands. And that's the dynamic that we want to see, and as that demand comes from brands that will spur on more developers. So if we are potentially capacity constrained on developers right now, that's just the market dynamic that will obviously clear itself up over time. And that's a really good signal. Yes. And we can see some of these larger studios hiring new college grads with computer science degrees, bringing them on board and training them in their corporate best practices for using the Roblox platform. I wouldn't be surprised to see agencies offered this as well. Well, that was going to be my next question. Have you had any discussion with the big ad agencies about maybe even setting up some type of metaverse development studio? We'll have to -- I can defer it to Craig Donato. Maybe he'll address that on Investor Day. It’s really surprised about I know there have been inbound conversations with agencies, whether that specifically is where we've gone probably not, but why don't we defer that for next month, and we'll dig into that. Thank you very much. Thanks. And we have no further questions in the phone queue. I'll turn the call over to Hans Gunawan for web questions. I think we have time for one more question from the web. Dave, this is a question for you from Harco Patterson [ph] from So Far So Good Incorporated. Are there any plans to collaborate with educators and local departments of education to integrate actual great, appropriate supplemental education tools that may or academic focus and lesson plans throughout the school year. Hey, great question. Thank you. The vision for platforms like Roblox goes beyond coding and computer science, and it gets into simulation and ultimately, allowing people to be together and realize -- I'll highlight one example of a partnership that is so appropriate for Roblox and it will help so many students around the world. And that is our partnership with FIRST Robotics. So FIRST Robotics has traditionally been an activity that involves creation of Roblox testing them, competition and it requires hardware, it requires kits for building road blocks.
What we are doing with FIRST Robotics is partnering and they're creating a simulation that mimics Roblox robot construction and testing and competition virtually on Roblox rather than in the real world. So this is a great example of an educational opportunity for many students around the world who may not have had access or opportunity to participate in a FIRST Robotics activity that cannot do it on a platform like Roblox. We're really optimistic about the range of educational opportunity. Well, that's a wrap for us. Thank you all for joining us today. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Roblox Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefanie Notaney, Director, Financial Communications. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox' Q3 2022 results. With me today is Roblox' CEO; David Baszucki; and CFO, Mike Guthrie. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that earlier this morning, we published a shareholder letter and earnings results on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com. On this call, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions. For our webcast participants, please note the question icon at the bottom of your screen where you can type in your questions. We'll do our best to take as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted today.
On today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements, including but not limited to our expectations of business, future financial results and business and financial strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements, and such risks are described in our risk factors, including in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued as well as in our supplemental slides, copies of which can be found on our IR website. Finally, this call is being webcast, and it will be archived on our website shortly afterwards.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you, Stefanie, and welcome Roblox investors, Roblox community. Some quick bullets before we dive into your Q&A. We had a wonderful October, as we mentioned in our letter, $701 million bookings in Q3, up 10% year-on-year. And on a currency-adjusted basis, up 15%. Also, we've shared October 27 day numbers so you can do compares to last year, and the first 27 days of October on a bookings basis were up 13% on an adjusted basis.
I want to really highlight to the Roblox community on the revenue side, where in Q3, we showed up 2% at $517 million that we follow GAAP accounting principles, and we defer revenue over the life of our payers. And in our letter, we highlighted we've increased that lifetime from 25 to 28 months. That is a very, very good thing that relates to the retention of our player bases. And we would ultimately want that number to be as large as possible, the more we retain our customer and user base. Without that increase, our Q3 revenue GAAP accounting would have been $628 million, $111 million larger. So actually, watch us continue to try to increase that lifetime to increase retention.
On a DAU basis in Q3, our DAUs were at $58.8 million, which is a 24% year-on-year growth rate. And highlighting October, those numbers in the first 27 days were $57.8 million, up 14% year-over-year. I want to note, we still have difficult compares relative to opportunistic regions from last year. But you're seeing our core and strategic users with the bookings start to lap COVID. Our developer community, once again, number of developers with experiences gathering over a 100,000 hours, up 54% and number of developers with experiences with over 1 million hours, up 47%.
A couple of things for our large Roblox and investor community, I really want to highlight. As you look at our business, we run the business internally as 30 separate cohorts. That's five age ranges. We look at gender, and we also look at the region around the world and we have a lot of headroom in many of these cohorts, and I'm going to comment on that a bit. I also want to comment that we run the company as seven product groups and we have product groups directly responsible both for retention or frequency, for engagement and for monetization. I'm going to highlight a few of those numbers as well.
Before we even went public, we've been sharing with all of you our vision of building a platform that optimistically brings people together around the world of all ages and for a wide ranges of uses, including playing, learning and working together. And I'll highlight a few of those as well. Around the world, in the U.S. and Canada we're showing 17% DAU growth in what has historically been our most early and saturated region just showing the amount of headroom we have in our core market there. In Europe, our DAUs are up 30% year-on-year. In APAC, our DAUs are up 40% year-on-year.
Talking about aging up, highlighting that our over 13 segment grew 34% and now accounts for 54% of our DAUs and also 17 through 24 is our fastest-growing cohort growing at 41% year-on-year. There is a lot of room for us in both our 17 through 24 cohort as well as our 24 and up cohort is -- and that is why, once again, we ask all of our investors to look at us as a wide range of businesses across all of these cohorts based on age and region.
I also want to share some of the drivers of our business that highlight our optimism around Roblox' ultimate evolution to be a utility that is used very frequently. We started to share some signal on frequency, which is the ratio of our DAUs to MAUs. And I want to highlight that relative to September 2019, our frequency is 20% higher, and our frequency is at or above levels we saw in '20 and '21 during peak COVID.
The other thing I want to share, the same with engagement, our engagement levels, which are hours relative to DAUs are now nearly 20% higher than pre-COVID September 2019, slightly below peak COVID times, but in a great direction.
And then finally, just highlighting the extent to which our brand experiences has started to grow and expand. We're participating with Elton John in a new persistent world called Elton John Presents: Beyond the Yellow Brick Road that premiered last Thursday on November 3. I think it's just showing the extent to which Roblox brands have become really ubiquitous in the music and brand industry.
Finally, we shared a lot around our product progression during Roblox Investor Day. We thank you all for participating. I want to highlight just on one small detail and that is we have started rolling out early versions of our immersive ad product, and we are casting now with some publishers and brands. And we will keep iterating on that.
With that, I will ask Mike Guthrie, if he wants to add any other comments. And if so, welcome, Mike. If not, we'll go straight to Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I think you covered it. The secular trends that we talked about in aging up, our core markets and strategic markets are really, I think some of the key financial points. So why don't we turn it over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you. Dave, as you noted, the fastest-growing demo is 17 to 24. I was just hoping you could speak to some of the drivers of this growth. Are these last players that are coming back? If not, what are the types of experiences that are bringing these new users? And then one for Mike. Just hoping you could remind us of your typical seasonality in the year-end. I think you've seen some pretty strong step ups in bookings the prior two years, but I feel there might have been some COVID factors that were helping with that. Just want to get a sense of how this has looked over a long period of time? Yes. I want to highlight the 17 to 24-year-old growth has been a continuous improvement over the last three to four years. And our whole stack is contributing to this. We continue to make exceptional gains in search and discovery, both cold start and warm start, which means when an older player signs up and joins Roblox, they see more and more experiences that are tailored to them. We continue to make improvements in our game engine and our cloud game engine as far as raw performance. We have made amazing improvements in our avatar stack with layered clothing and the ability for older players to more and more have avatars that they can identify with.
We are seeing developers respond with more and more content that is interesting and applicable for older players. We introduced experienced guidelines and shared that with you at our Investor Day, which we will start over time having some experiences that are ultimately 13 and up and 17 and up type experiences. So this is pervasive throughout the stack, throughout the seven product groups. We really all are working on this. And it's many, many factors that have contributed to drive this growth. I'll turn it over to Mike on the seasonality. Yes. Great. Hey David, thanks for the question. So we're in a period right now, September and October, when we were coming down off of the summer. Peaks in the summer, July and August. We saw that seasonality occur in September, down from August. October is pretty similar to September with a pickup then right around Halloween. We had a really strong beginning of October of this year, a lot of special content around seasonal content that was quite popular.
Going into the rest of the quarter, November is typically up a bit from October. And then, of course, December is the big month in the fourth quarter. So like a lot of companies around the holidays, like for example, November, we usually see a pretty big step up around Thanksgiving, and then we're into the holiday season. So December is always the biggest month by a long shot. And we -- so far, seasonality seems totally normal to us. I think what we're probably most excited about is this growth in the payer base. And so you saw it in the third quarter, all-time peak number pairs at $12.9 million. That's a really good signal for us. And one other thing you may have picked it up in what I just said, and I'll circle back to the aged up growth. Thank you, Mike. You hear how we always lead with raw product, quality and virality. But I do want to pay notice to all the wonderful brands and music producers out there, the intermediate agencies creating some of these experiences and our own brand team, that is also contributing to growth.
So Wimbleton, WimbleWorld, 11.8 million visits. Our Tommy Play experience, our Chipotle experience has had over 20 million visits. Our FIFA World just started, millions of visits. Our Chainsmokers concert, once again 8 or 16 million visits. So there's also a lot of potential traffic being driven by our brand and music partnerships on top of the raw product virality that we focus on. Your next question is from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey guys. Wanted to ask about something I don't -- I think that the market doesn't appreciate enough about how transformational limited items will be to the platform in 2023. Can you explain why it will fundamentally change behavior among users? And which of your KPIs should see the biggest inflection? And also among which of your 30 cohorts do you expect to see those metrics inflect the most pronounced? And I have a follow-up after that. Yes. Mike, I'll do an early one on the cohorts. All 30 of our cohorts are doing amazingly well, and Mike will comment more on that. Very early on in Roblox, we started building Roblox items with the vision that ultimately, we want our user and community based to be really the provider of all UGC items, both clothing, avatar items, avatars, all of that. And the final step of that, that we are in the process of completing is a limited marketplace.
What this means is a creator such as, I'll use Gucci, as an example, can be validated. They can have a blue check mark next to their profile. And if they so choose, they can make 10 of something rather than an unlimited number. Those items can be indexed. And just like in the real world, where we have both high volume items, I always call white T-shirts the example of a high volume low brand item. Just as we have that, we're moving to an economy where top brands will have limited index items.
The items that Roblox has made, which we want our creators to make that we've done in a limited fashion, for example, our Domino's crown trade at $20,000 on the platform. And we believe we will see similar trade value, similar things that we see in the real world with scarce items with some of these. We believe this is going to be really fun, really good for engagement and will ultimately expand our economy. So it does look more like the real world, and we have very high priced items as well.
The metric this affects is bookings per hour or monetization. And when we affect bookings per hour, it affects the whole platform because we're driving those hours and raises monetization. I'll kick it over to Mike as to whether you want to comment on any cohorts. Yes. Yes. So Omar, thanks for the question. I -- because it's going to be an open marketplace, I think the answer is it's going to be all cohorts. There will be content that is appealing to younger users and older users. I agree with Dave that you're going to see it mostly reflected in monetization as a core metric, though I also expect frequency engagement to also move up because it's a better experience for the user.
I also believe, it's something we don't talk enough about, is that will also affect all genders as well. So the cohort is not just age cohorts, but content will be appealing to male users and female users as well. So I think that's also really exciting. Yes. One way to think about it. One cohort that this effect in the real world, who buys high-priced jewelry, rare artwork and Ferraris, those cohorts, I think will be affected on Roblox as well. Awesome. All right. Looking forward to that. So then the second question is I wanted to ask about when some incremental revenue opportunities may hit, namely dynamic heads and game fund. So in June, I think your blog said that dynamic heads would be in the avatar store later this year. It's November now. Are you still kind of on track to have those in the avatar store this year? And if so, kind of what's your monetization model there? And then on the game fund side, I think you showed game fund examples throughout the year. When will those start to go into soft launch, number one? When will they launch in earnest, number two? And do you expect any of them to be come like top 10 hits in the next year? Yes, I can comment on a couple of things. I think for our investors, I would ask you to consider dynamic heads as not just a monetization product, but ultimately, the future of Roblox as far as immersive conversation. And we're moving from a world -- when we think about where all of the people in Roblox are primarily using text chat with static heads, so the demo I showed at Investor Day, where more and more we show expression, our faces animate just like we do with our camera. And we're communicating by voice as well. So we have dynamic heads in the catalog. The vision ultimately is everyone and every head on Roblox is dynamic. And we ultimately get to the point where everyone can animate their avatar.
We've not given a specific day on this, but this is slowly rolling out and will roll out continuously over the next year. There is a blog post on our blog for those that are interested that we published at the end of September called funding future Roblox creations that shows some of the progress in the game fund. I think some of these will be transformational. I don't want to comment on which and when. But if you see the general pattern of the game fund experiences, you'll see they're primarily aimed at older players. Many of them involve older avatars. And many of these are getting ready to launch soon, and we have more in the hopper. So I won't comment on them, but I will comment that we have some fairly seasoned developers building very professional experiences for older players. And Mike, I don't know if you want to rip at all on that at all. No, I think it's perfect. I got nothing to add. Great. Thank you. Thanks Omar. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead. So thanks. Good morning. So Mike, in the shareholder letter, you noted that you intend to target an EBIT margin -- sorry, EBITDA margin below 10% through at least 2023. Is there any change to what's driving that figure relative to the updates from earlier in the year? And how are you viewing this metric beyond next year? And then, I guess, for Dave, you briefly touched on the immersive advertising efforts. Any early observations you can share? And any update on how and when you intend to deploy that across the platform? Thanks guys. Yes. Hey Mike, I want to quickly lead first on the earnings and EBITDA long-term. And I know, right now, there are a lot of companies doing layoffs and I want to highlight a couple of unique things about Roblox. We are going to continue hiring through 2023. We have an exceptional talent base that we are constantly adding to and improving. And we're going to do this in a way that keeps really stock-based comp in really good range. And I think this is highlighting our drive to continue innovating and the ability to do this with $3 billion of cash in the bank and a good forward-looking cash position in the company.
So we are in innovation mode. We are in thoughtful, balanced hiring and growth mode. We run the company in a very thoughtful way, looking forward, modeling forward several years in advance. So hopefully, we're moving the tiller gently and thoughtfully towards driving this type of innovation. And I'll let Mike comment a little bit more on the earnings as a result of that. Yes. Hey Drew, there are really, again, four big areas of cost and investment in our business. Payment processing is one because that's what's changing or it hasn't even changed. Payment processing has generally been coming down a little bit as a percentage of bookings or we've been getting a little bit more efficient there, which is great, not massive moves, but comfortable improvements over time. And then there's three big investment areas that Dave has really highlighted that revolve around being innovative. And that's our infrastructure and trust and safety, personnel and the investment in our developer community.
All of those are -- there's really, nothing has changed in terms of the waiting, the emphasis, our desire to make investments in those areas. We have the ability to do it. We have a lot of liquidity. We feel like we're adding long-term value into the business. We've grown them all in really sustainable ways. And so we see this opportunity as one of sort of optimizing investment in the near-term. And coming out of this maybe after '23 into '24, with an ability to see real leverage in the cost structure across really almost all of these areas.
So nothing has changed. We're not -- what we haven't done is ramped up investment in marketing or any other things like that. User base and top line are still very much organically driven by great product and improvements in that product. So we are really taking an opportunity to continue to innovate and build the best business with the most defensibility and sustainability that we possibly can. Riffing on -- thanks, Mike. Riffing on immersive advertising and the opportunity. One of the things we've always done at Roblox is built, you can call it UGC or self-serve and that is build platform and products that everyone can use and that treat all of our developers as well as all of our partners equivalent. That is the target for next year, hopefully, in the first part of next year to get this rolled out for everyone without a specific ship date. That said, we are testing right now. So we are testing our immersive advertising technology right now with some brands and with some of our developers. So testing now. Next year, self-serve for everyone. Your next question is from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So just looking at the bookings in September and October, there's a pretty meaningful acceleration going on there in terms of year-on-year growth. And I'm just wondering, Dave, earlier in the Q&A, you were talking about some of the platform improvements that you've been making, which makes a lot of sense. Were there any specific user behaviors or types of experiences or new platform features that were kind of needle-moving and behind that reacceleration you saw in the past two months? And then just separately on frequency, given that you're running kind of at levels of kind of DAU to MAU ratio that you saw during COVID, I think you said at or above, how much headroom do you see going forward in terms of boosting that ratio? Thank you. Yes, from a product architecture and the way we work on Roblox, this is really a wide technology stack. We have amazing product and engineers working on our user experience, on our social graph, on the access points, mobile, console. We have awesome people working on our growth team, search and discovery, our core creator tools, the 3D simulation engine that powers Roblox, the economy that drives not just monetization, but actually the fun on the platform, the core cloud infrastructure that supports this. And of course, the very wide-ranging safety and stability team that make Roblox a welcoming, safe and optimistic place.
There's so much stuff going on that historically, growth has been driven not by single big needle movers, but by many, many needle movers all being developed in parallel as quickly as possible. And I'll highlight, some of these things are things most people don't notice, including gains in the raw performance of our game engine, or kudos to the game and simulation engine team, gains to the raw -- to the time and how quickly people can join these experiences, which most people don't notice but actually drive growth as well. So there are a wide range of things we've really done across the platform that improved search and discovery, have improved all areas really of the product.
On frequency, I am personally so bullish, even in our core nine-through 12-year-old U.S.A. market around the headroom there because I think as we saw during COVID, people used Roblox as a utility to connect and be together. People used Roblox side-by-side with video and phone and text as a way to hang out together. And this is a utility use that goes beyond play that I think we'll see people migrating to more and more higher frequency numbers. I can't share specifically what they are, but there is a lot of headroom in USA 9 through 12 DAU. Yes. And Matthew, it's Mike. I want to just add a couple of things to what Dave just said. As regards to bookings and acceleration, maybe just point you to Page 27 in the supplemental materials, which is the payer community. If you look at Q2 '22 and Q3 '22, that sequential growth in payers is as high or higher than I think we've almost ever seen. So there was a big pickup in the number of payers and we talked about the ratio of payers earlier in the call, and you can see that in the second or third quarter and so obviously, September is a part of that. Similarly, you would expect that we had pretty good payer numbers in October. So that conversion rate is really a very good point right now. And we talked about it in the letter -- earlier in the letter.
There's a whole bunch of reasons for that. One is there is a very positive mix shift going on, as Dave suggested, in our core markets, U.S., Canada. We are back to peak levels driven in all age cohorts, and we are aging up very quickly. And so as the rate of number of payers, it's increasing in the U.S. and Canada. It's also increasing as a percentage in the strategic markets. Opportunistic has slowed down a little bit. They do have a little bit of a tougher COVID compare right now. So mix shift of payers is moving towards areas where there's more monetization.
One question was why are we seeing that conversion rate? And for that, you have to look at our other core metrics, frequency, our retention and our engagement numbers, and those are all moving up as well. And that impact starts at the highest level with your users and then flows all the way through until you get the payers. And so we're seeing improvement really across the board in all age cohorts, all demos and more and more payers and again, very good sequential growth in payers in the third quarter.
There was a question earlier around seasonality. To me, that speaks to really healthy movements as we go into the rest of the seasonal -- rest of the year in the fourth quarter. But I really would look at that number as an output of a whole bunch of core metrics that we are focused on that start with frequency goes to engagement, goes to monetization. That conversion rate has just been -- has really held up post COVID at very high rates. And so I think that's why you're seeing that acceleration. Great, thank you. Your next question is from the line of Clark Lampen with BTIG. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I have two on the developer community and advertising. First, Mike, you talked about secular dynamics with aging up before. Are those as prevalent on the developer side such that you're bringing on more 17- to 24-year-old developers and the content that they're creating is helping you drive what seems like a more recent inflection in growth of other users and also monetization and payer conversion?
And then second question on advertising. Understanding that, that sort of vector of monetization is really early stage right now. We did pick up some good feedback intra-quarter from marketers that basically said, we'd like to spend more on Roblox over time. There's demand from our customers or from us ourselves, but one of the gating factors right now is measurement. And I'm curious is building that sort of performance framework is part of the roadmap for the ads business? If so, is it possible that you could give us some color on the timeline for introducing something like that? Thank you. Dave, do you want to start off with the ad question, and I'll take the first one then? I'm really excited about the potential for measurement of both brands as well as action-based type advertising here. And we are going to be providing both of those types of things. There will be two types of immersive 3D ad units on the platform, those that are brand where we will be able to measure views, amount of dwell time. And really, this is the creation of a set of new types of measurement for immersive 3D advertising.
It's almost as if in the real world, it's really hard to measure how many people saw a billboard on a bus when it went driving by. But in an immersive 3D world, we can actually measure how many people saw that. So there's the potential in digital to measure things we can't do in the physical world. More and more of the experiences we believe in platforms like Roblox will be teleport-type ads where brands that we highlighted today want to bring fans to their experience even for a short amount of time to experience the brand, to possibly acquire items from the brand and to pop back out and come back to where you were. And these, of course, will be fully measurable as action type units once again with a measuring the -- ultimately the time and the experience as well.
There is an even longer-term thing that we're not going to comment on or promise. But ultimately, the ultimate long-term thing is we hear anecdotally about people who have been in our experiences then migrating to the real world and wanting to go into that same store. We've heard that anecdotally around our Vans experience, where the ultimate would be to figure out a way to measure the players on Roblox' connection to visiting that 3D experience and then visiting the real experience. And there's a lot of savvy people out there starting to think about how we might do that.
So yes, this will be measurable. It's early. And I think there's potential for types of engagement that just cannot be done with video, that cannot be done with print. I'll kick it back to Mike for the other piece of it. Clark, your question on developers is a really interesting one. So we are seeing a dynamic with older users wherein they are monetizing very well in what I would call the top experiences on Roblox that may or may not be aged-up experiences. However, we also see that same user base experimenting in other experiences that are much more aged-up content. They're not the most popular experiences right now on Roblox but they're much more aged-up experiences. And in those, the older users are spending quite a bit more.
Now it's early, and it's on a smaller base, but that indicates to us that they -- that the older users have a really high affinity for aged-up content. Our belief is, of course, that most of that aged-up content is also coming from an aged-up developer community. So to answer your question, I don't know -- I don't have numbers specifically with the same level of precision on growth rates, but I suspect they're pretty similar and we're seeing more and more aged-up content that's starting to break through.
I think there's a long way to go there. And we'll try to pull together some metrics that we can share on that. But we definitely see that behavior with our older DAUs and time spent. They are finding cool aged-up experiences, and they're very engaged, and they monetize very well in those experiences and those are going to get bumped up over time. And again, there's almost no doubt those are coming from an older developer base. Yes, and we don't -- I don't -- I think Roblox, long-term combines the best of long-tail discovery, young developer starting out as a hobbyist. On the high end, though, as our larger studios go beyond 100 people and are earning tens of millions of dollars a year, I think the top developers ultimately and very quickly mirror top game developers on any platform, or experienced developers, we're seeing that mature very quickly. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Sticking with the theme of aged-up cohorts, do you see different behavior by geography in aged-up cohorts? And I'm curious if you do, how that informs elements of what you want to invest in the infrastructure or the product development over the long-term? And then even away from just geographic SKU among aged-up cohorts, any sense of how you continue to think about partnerships on the content side and bringing more original content into the platform that can be consumed via partnership or licensing over time to sort of drive up higher forms of engagement as well? Thanks so much. Yes. I feel as if we're doing our job right, we are building high-performance immersive 3D infrastructure as the utility, pools with amazing search and discovery and an amazing creator base. So just as with other forms of immersive media of which we're very immersive, but whether it's video, print or whatever, we're providing a high-performance platform in all regions of the world that our developer community can respond to more than we respond to technically.
So we focus very much on what's latency in India. We have a new data center in India. Do we have edge data centers around the world to provide high performance? Are we doing awesome search and discovery in South Korea or Japan or India to help drive growth there? And then what we can see is when we go to various regions around the world, a mix of what we would expect. Some classic Roblox experience top in many, many countries using our dynamic translation facility but also regional experiences just as we would expect in various countries. I think this is what philosophically is driving our growth in Japan now, which is driving our growth in India right now, which is our awesome infrastructure, coupled with great really content from our developers.
From a partnership standpoint, our goal is to make this self-serve. Our goal is to make it so developers can couple with brands. And we're seeing more and more partnerships on the platform that we have not been involved with, which is exactly where we would ultimately want to get to which is the spontaneous partner ecosystem. And then kicking to Mike, if you want to add anything on the partnerships, Mike? Not on the partnerships but your question on aged up. I just want to make sure I got it right. You're saying by geography, do we notice any different behavior with aged users across the geos? Meaning does an aged-up user and -- 17 to 24 year-old user in the U.S. behave differently than in Germany. Is that what you're asking? That's part one. And if so, does that inform any elements of how you think about product development or platform development over the long-term? Yes, I would -- so basically, by geography, what we're seeing is similar in each geo, meaning aged-up users are now engaging at basically the same rates, if not even higher, in some cases, of younger users. They're monetizing at now at higher rates than younger users, and that's pretty consistent around the world as we look at it. So they -- we're seeing the same kinds of dynamics within each geo. And if I were to say an aged-up user in the U.S., the rate of monetization above an aged-up user somewhere else in the world is about the same as it is with the younger user. So it's pretty similar. But within a demo, aged-up user is now pretty much the same frequency, pretty much the same amount of engagement and higher monetization. Yes, and maybe a philosophical way of thinking about this, we saw different behaviors with aged-up people in Germany relative to the U.S. We would take a look at that and build platform infrastructure that supported both of those, so that our developers could respond to the differences rather than us having to split the platform. So we're always trying to build a worldwide utility that works in all regions. Okay. We have time for one more question, and then obviously, we're going to be available for the rest of the day. Operator? Thank you. Today's final question will come from the line of Mark -- one moment, will come from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning, David and good morning, Mike. Maybe two, if I could. First, Mike, on expenses, as we think about 2023, I mean, should we go back and look at kind of what the OpEx-centric lines have done in terms of sequential dollar growth over the past four quarters and kind of extrapolate that forward? And similarly, should we look at kind of where we are right now, when you look at the two more variable type lines and again, kind of assume that we kind of hold there through next year. Is that a reasonable framework to thinking about the expense base and expense investments through 2023?
And then just second question, more on just what you're seeing from a macro perspective. I'm just kind of curious, you guys have a global footprint. I'm kind of curious what you're seeing, if anything, in terms of any type of changing behavior as macros gotten a little more challenging, specifically in certain regions and perhaps certain demos. I'm kind of curious what you're seeing, if anything? Thanks again guys. Thanks, Matt. On costs, I mean, again, let me just sort of point people to the supplemental materials. Looking at Pages 9 through 12, those are the big cost items. Cost of revenue as a percentage of bookings or payment processing fees as a percent of bookings has generally been flat to down. And I think flat is a good way to model it. We hope to see a little more efficiency. Prepaid cards have definitely helped us take that number down. And we are growing our prepaid card business. There's a lot of demand for it out there. It's done incredibly well, and it's a really efficient channel for us. So that could help us lower that cost over the next few quarters in '23.
Developer exchange fees have been running 22%, 23% of bookings. We're not looking for leverage in this area right now. So I would suspect they will stay in this range throughout '23. And if they went up a point or two, we would be okay with that. But flat is probably a good way to estimate it.
Personnel costs, exclusive of stock comp as a percentage of bookings, the last few quarters, this number has been going up as we have been hiring and investing. I think it will hold at around the 2Q, 3Q numbers for most of the year. While we are going to continue to hire, as Dave has mentioned, we're probably not quite at the same rate of hiring next year, but we're adding quite a few people into the company. But I think as a percentage of bookings, that number will be closer to what you see in Q2 and Q3.
And in terms of infra, trust and safety, we made a really healthy investment here over the last three quarters. There will be leverage in this number eventually. I wouldn't look for too much of it in '23. We're still making significant investments, but we're also -- with all of our teams pushing to make sure we're doing things in the most efficient way possible. So I think if you model it out in the last -- where the last couple of quarters have been you're probably in pretty good shape.
As it relates to the macro, I'll start and Dave, any other comments. We look a lot -- other than the fact that, obviously, currencies continue to move against the dollar. When we look underneath the currency changes around the world, we're seeing really healthy behavior. Users are growing around the world, hours of engagement are growing around the world. Our retention looks good. Our conversion rates look very good. Pure monetization around the world looks quite good when adjusted for those currencies. So I would say, we all know the macro environment is a little bit challenging. Where it is most pronounced for us is translation of currencies back into dollars. But overall, the behavior of the user base seems fairly healthy. I wouldn't say we've seen anything significant. I don't know, David, do you have anything to add to that? We're going to wrap really quickly. I'm going to add two lightning bullets. One, if you re-watch our Investor Day, you'll see a wonderful presentation on how our infra ultimately is moving to active-active and there'll be amazing leverage there. We're right now doing a 2:1 infra build. And as that gets to four to three and five to four, you'll see amazing cost savings there.
I think long-term, also, we pay all of our wonderful engineers and product people in U.S. dollars right now. So you'll see a long-term move from us just to make sure we're absolutely tightening up exchange rates in our platform when we collect Roblox as well around the world. But I'm feeling very positive about the macro trends that we see around the world on the platform. Yes, just on the infrastructure spending since Dave brought it up, we'll spend a little over $300 million on PP&E this year. The Lion's share of the big infra investment is done this year, although we'll spend another $300 million next year, there'll be a little bit of a shift. A little bit less of that will be on infrastructure and a little bit of incremental will be around real estate. So we are still growing, we're moving into some new offices and so we have modeled in some investments in real estate. So overall, PP&E will be basically flat year-over-year but the amount of -- that's around infrastructure will actually be down next year as we have taken most of that this year. That's great color. Thanks Mike, and David. Okay. Operator, I think we are ready to wrap up, Dave, any closing comments. No, just once again, thank you to the Roblox community. All of our wonderful investors, we love working with you and appreciate your support. And thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference call. Once again, thanks for your participation, and you may now disconnect.","Roblox's Q3 2022 earnings conference call will be webcast . a question-and-answer session will be held at the end of the call . the call is being webcast, and will be archived on our website shortly afterwards .",0.0

Finally, this call is being webcast. The webcast will be archived on our IR website shortly afterwards.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you very much, and welcome team. Welcome, Mike. It's a pleasure to be here. Welcome to the Roblox community, and welcome to all of our investors. We continue to focus on innovation, and we're very pleased with our results from Q4 and the early signal on January. We have enormous headroom in our business. We have the whole company focused on one product one platform. And in the midst of a fair amount of turmoil over the last year, we continue to hire and build an amazing team with amazing people. We're focused on our four growth vectors. One is bringing people together all around the world. One is expanding our platform to encompass people of all ages. Third growth vector is we continue to see expansion into education, into concerts, into communication. And finally, our economy is vibrant and growing as we'll share in our call.
A couple details, Q4 bookings, $899 million, up 17% year-over-year, or 21% on constant currency and highlighting this is around the world, including U.S., Canada and APAC each at 19% growth in Q4, some slight acceleration in 2022 going into 2023 with December 20% year-on-year, January 21% year-on-year. And this is highlighting our global growth in January with Europe and APAC up 29% year-on-year. For older users, which is an enormous opportunity for the platform sometimes referred to as aging up, this is not a new thing for us. We are in the middle of aging up. And in January, we saw our 17 through 24 year old segment grew at 39% year-on-year for bookings.
Going into usage and DAUs, we're proud to report that in January we had our highest ever DAUs at 65 million DAU and Q4 DAUs continue to show really strong growth: Europe 24%; APAC 21%, U.S. and Canada up 19% in Q4 DAUs. Amazingly, well, not really amazingly because we're so focused on innovation, we burned almost no cash in 2022, roughly negative 0.5% cash, which we're really, really proud of. And on an adjusted basis, in Q4, our EBITDA was $183 million or 20.3% of bookings. I want to highlight that underneath all of this progress, we focus very heavily on key drivers around sign-ups, retention, frequency, engagement and monetization. And all of these numbers continue to be near or at all-time highs, even as we've emerged from COVID. Long-term, we remain singularly focused on ushering in this new category of immersive communication.
And we continue to see what we believe are the benefits of this new category as we start to rollout voice and facial animation, including the ability for people to be virtually in the same place as they communicate the ability to pick up many queues around human interaction, including eye tracking, arm tracking, which we don't sometimes pick up on the phone or on a video call, the ability to stimulate more and more of the audio that we see in the real world that helps our communication. And finally, of course, what everyone does on Roblox in addition to communicating doing things together. This vision we think has enormous headroom for us.
If you've been with us on our Investor Day or some of our calls at RDC, we believe this is the next generation of communication following from audio phone, video calls, texting, messaging. Behind the scenes on our innovation stack, there is a lot of metrics that are moving that to our average user are invisible, but are very, very important and go side by side with our innovation. We're constantly making improvements in the performance of all of our apps in the speed at which people can connect to Roblox experiences in the performance of our cloud around the world and the performance all around the world as we roll out new edge data centers. And of course, the more visible parts of our innovation continue to be visible as well.
We continue to roll out voice. We've had over a million experiences, so far enabled voice chat. And as we continue to roll this out, we're very pleased with the adoption and the level of immersiveness that this has brought. We talk about dynamic heads and facial animation because we're in the middle of this rollout. But we believe very soon we will assume this is just a core part of Roblox and we will stop referring to dynamic as it will just be part of an active avatar. This is the same with layered clothing with over 100 million – 115 million people adopting layered clothing so far. This will transition to just being called the clothing system on Roblox. And finally, we're well on our way. I believe we've passed 90% of our catalog now being UGC. We're well on our way to that being 100%, including all of the avatars on the system as well. And finally, we're really pleased from the safety and stability standpoint to roll out experience guidelines in Q4, which is really discontinuing our vision of building a platform for all ages around the world.
Our active developers are up 33% year-on-year. We've had 70 experiences now past one billion visits at the end of 2022. Brands continue to come to roadblocks as this is a new form of bringing people together with brands. We're proud to welcome the NFL, FIFA, Netflix and of course, Elton John, Mariah Carey. We have a lot more coming in 2023.
And something really near and dear to my heart, just given my prior company was an educational software company, we're really proud to see institutions like the museum of science in Boston, start to roll out large immersive educational efforts such as their mission to Mars Roblox interactive experience.
Finally, safety and stability is a foundation for us, and we were really pleased be the first tech company to support the landmark child safety legislation in California last year called the California Age-Appropriate Design Code and we're hopeful more states will adopt it.
With that, we'll either turn it over to comments and let Mike have something to chime in. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I just want to add a couple of thoughts before we open it up for questions. As it relates to cash flow, as Dave mentioned, we did continue to take an investment posture this year, we're really happy to see high returns on those investments and to see margins coming back into the business, really driven by top line growth.
We spent over $400 million over the course of the year, investing in infrastructure, primarily related to our data center in Ashburn, Virginia, and still we're able to run the company effectively cash flow neutral for the year, which was a goal of ours internally. Those capital expenditures related to infrastructure will be down significantly in 2023, somewhere between 25% and 30% lower this year.
Dave also mentioned our focus on frequency, engagement and monetization. I also just want to point out, we had incredibly strong results and you can see it in our supplemental materials around payers on the platform. So in the fourth quarter, we reached an all-time high of 13.4 million payers, highest amount of returning payers that we've ever had, which means, obviously, people are sticking with us, which is great.
And we added more new payers than ever before with the exception of the very first quarter of COVID. So we had incredibly strong growth in payers. And at the same time, the monetization prepare in the fourth quarter was up significantly and as strong as it's ever been. We're also seeing very, very healthy what we refer to as payer conversion. So more users are becoming payers than ever before, and that's pretty much true across the globe.
Each individual region is reaching its peak in payer conversion. They did at least over the holidays. And so when we look at that on a seasonal basis, that looks very strong.
So again, as Dave mentioned, a great end of Q4, a nice start to 2023 and why don't we pause there and open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. Everybody is talking about ChatGPT; it's being asked of all the big companies. So I wanted to ask, how does the availability of this new technology maybe accelerate or not your time line towards inexperienced creation tools? And what proprietary data sets do you have that could break through – domain-specific – that could create breakthrough domain-specific applications using the GPT3 models? Great question. And this is a wonderful area. There is going to be a block post from our CTO, Dan Sterman, coming out tomorrow sharing really the wide range of opportunities that you could imagine ML will accelerate and stuff we've been working on for quite a while. Going through the whole Roblox virtual universe, we can, of course, imagine code acceleration and the amazingly large data set of Lua code that all of our creators have built on the platform that sits in our cloud that we can accelerate.
Of course, we can model, imagine 3D model acceleration and something very near and dear to the heart of every player on Roblox is their own personal Avatar. Traditionally, Avatar have been created in many, many ways, including mixing and matching parts, moving sliders, but we're going to see more and more a range of innovation around Avatar creation that’s much more natural and natural language-based creation.
And behind the scenes, in addition to this, there is another wide range of opportunities around customer service, around how NPCs perform around the performance of search and discovery, around the creation of 3D materials. So there's many, many ways we're going to harvest and tap into ML here. We have a lot of data and feedback from our users. And stand by, and read more, please, on Thursday. That’s wonderful. Okay, we’re looking forward to that, reading that blog. I guess first for a follow-up and a separate question, you've talked about the kind of transition, you've talked about the transition to a limited items, economy and exclusively limited items, economy on Roblox. I just wanted to hear how your thoughts have evolved on that and what you see timing might be, whether that would be phased or if it's already in progress and when it would kind of be complete?
Also, I guess, as part of that process, will you still be having items created primarily by UGC creator program? Or will it become open by the time of the completion to the general public and the general user base? I will share the long-term vision. You are going to see pieces of this rollout throughout the year. With long-term in the real physical world, there's no constraints on who can create the items that we use in our everyday life. New people can enter that market at any point in time. And we have a wide range of pricing and activity in the real world. We have generic items like white T-shirts, we also have very expensive items like Gucci purses.
We're working as quickly as we can to mimic the range and expressiveness of the commerce we see in the real world and potentially go beyond that. So this is actively under development. We're moving to a UGC economy where there is no limits, where everyone can participate and where robots doesn't make everything – anything really our community makes all of it, where the economy is very vibrant where more and more creators can make a living, creating items on Roblox, and we have a wide range of pricing that makes economic sense.
So, look for more and more things during the course of this year and more and more innovations that mirror how the real world economy works in a virtual world like Roblox. Thanks, Omar. We'll catch up with you in about an hour. We're going to move to the next caller if that's okay. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hey, thank you. Dave, on the prior call, I think, you mentioned that 17- to 24-year-old users were mostly monetizing in the top experiences, but we're experiment in the aged up experiences. So I wanted to see if you could update on this, whether those older users are starting to migrate further into the mature content and what opportunity sets for next year?
And then, Mike, just on expenses, there was real moderation in cost growth quarter-over-quarter for R&D and infrastructure. Just wondering if you could kind of discuss how you're thinking about investment for those OpEx lines in 2023. And if that growth pace we saw in Q4 is kind of reasonable to assume going forward. Thank you. I'll give a general highlight. When we say mature experiences on Roblox, as of now with our experience guidelines, we do not have any 2017 enough experiences. So the experiences on Roblox are nudging in that direction. We are seeing more and more things that I would say are exciting for older players. It’s interesting that the core genre in Roblox has really perked up in the last three or four months’ experiences like doors and others have become very, very popular. Many of the experiences on Roblox even for all their players cover all age ranges as well. And just as in the very early days of Roblox, we saw the market really respond to the opportunity of that player base. We’re seeing that with our game fund as well. So there’s more and more aged up content showing up on the platform. And so yes, and David, on costs, maybe just back up a little bit. We really – if you look at our cost structure, there’s really four primary areas of costs in the business. The first one is, of course, COGS and payment processing, which is more or less strictly variable, though, has been coming down as a percentage of bookings, primarily because – we’ve been really successful with prepaid cards and other alternative payment methods that are lower cost. So that’s one.
The second one, of course, is the investment in the developer community. And in a sense, we have been leaning more heavily into that. We think that the returns are now – we’re seeing those returns in more content, better content, which has historically been a part of the flywheel that’s driven Roblox for years. And in a way, the savings in margin that we’ve seen in COGS has more or less moved into over the last few years into the investment in the community, which we think is great. Those are variable costs.
On the fixed cost side, it’s been infrastructure and people, as you rightly point out. We made a lot of investment in human capital over the last few years. This year, we’re slowing down the rate of hiring, but we are still hiring quite a few people. We’re making a huge investment in great engineers. We still need them. We still have ambitions that are large and a lot of work to get done. So we’re going to continue to make that investment, but we are slowing that down just slightly over the last couple of years. And some of that is also digestion and bring in a more senior team to help manage and onboard and grow the engineering teams, which is great.
As it relates to infrastructure investments and trust and safety, those are high priorities. They really tend to be driven by the growth in our user base. So the users have an amazing experience. But we do – over a long period of time, we expect that is going to be a high – an area of high operating leverage. I’m not prepared to talk about the growth rate of expenses. I’ll have to go back and take a look at Q4 and reference exactly what you’re talking about. But I would expect to see us to continue to invest because we think the investments are high ROI. But to the extent we are driving healthy growth in the top line, we have operating leverage, which is what you saw in the fourth quarter.
So normally, just in terms of trends because I know this question will come out. Fixed costs tend to continue to grow throughout the year as we hire and invest in infrastructure, again, albeit at a slower rate possibly this year. But overall, as the top line keeps growing, we think that’s the right way to show operating leverage because we do believe the investments we’re making are very high ROI. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking questions. The first one is on the January trends for bookings, a 3-point acceleration ex-FX. So I was just curious in terms of how to parse that out. You guys also mentioned the Lunar New Year coming in January this year. Is that typically an uplift to bookings or a drag? So any color in terms of what that trend looked like before diluting the year would be helpful. Thanks. Well, December bookings is probably a good guide before the Lunar New Year because it was before Lunar New Year and the growth rate was pretty high. So that’s probably a good way to look at it. What was – and so what was the other question about?
Yes. So January, Yes, January accelerated a little bit over December because the business is accelerating. There’s more content. There’s better content. We’re seeing growth. It really is basic stuff. We’re seeing growth around the world, as Dave talked about, specifically incredibly strong growth in strategic regions. So I think Western Europe and East Asia, we talked about that area being a secular tailwind of the company, I think, in the last earnings call, and that continues to be the case.
As an example, just in the month of January, within the strategic region alone, bookings grew by about 37%. So – and that’s now becoming a pretty big part of the bookings. Opportunistic regions, Latin America, Southeast Asia, et cetera, grew at 23% in January. So again, huge part of the world, lots of population and also healthy growth. The other thing that’s continued to allow us to drive bookings growth overall is the fact that in our core markets, U.S., Canada, UK, Scandinavia, ANZ. Those are the parts of the world where we had highest rates of penetration, biggest businesses going into COVID, obviously, they popped up very high during COVID because we were so well established there.
But we are now through that and now growing above the peaks that we had in terms of the user base in COVID. And in particular, our younger users continue to grow, even though that’s the most highly penetrated part of the market. But really, it’s those aged up users that Dave referenced, 13 to 16, in particular, 17 to 24-year olds. And now we’re seeing really interesting growth and substantial scale in the 25 and over user base. So really, its strength around the world and strength in all age demos, but in particular aged up. Helpful. Thanks, Mike. And then just one on the EBITDA margins. It was 20% in the fourth quarter, any update to your prior commentary that EBITDA margin should be below 10% in 2023, especially with the strong bookings growth in December and January. Or should we expect any upside to bookings kind of reinvested back into the business? Thanks. I think what we hope everyone takes out of the fourth quarter is that over the course of the year, we were really, really thoughtful about what we invested in. We believe that we had a business that had a very, very long way to go. We took a really long-term perspective. We believe that hiring great people was the right thing to do.
We believe that investing in the infrastructure was the right thing to do. And that the best way to show operating leverage was to grow the top line. And so we were – I know the concept of efficiency is being talked about a lot, which is obviously very, very important. And you can get there in a couple of different ways. You can get there through cutting costs, you get there through growth in the top line, you can get there by doing both. We chose very strategically last year to invest in the belief that the top line would grow, and we would see that kind of leverage.
So my only update to what I said last year is that we are thoughtfully investing this year. We were fortunate to bring in a lot of very talented engineers over the last couple of years and talented employees in general. We can slow that growth this year a little bit, but we’re still out investing. And our investments in infrastructure are supporting an ever-growing user base. And those users are converting at very high rates into payers, they’re doing what they’ve always done, which is as they stay on the platform, they find great content, they make friends, they find a community, they end up being very valuable. And then – and Dave, as a follow-on. Reiterating on what Mike is saying, there is enormous long-term headroom in our business. We’re focused on getting to 1 billion DAUs on the platform. The largest segments in our business are 2017 enough and those are growing at enormous rates. And we really are focused on the appropriate balance of growth, innovation and efficiency. Our infra is amazingly efficient. We’ve built our own cloud, which continues long-term to bear efficiency benefits. And we have a fair amount of control on our headcount, velocity and growth. And simultaneously, we’re trying to move as much money as we can to the developer base. So we’re taking a very balanced approach here to the velocity of innovation as well as our efficiency. Great. Thank you both. Your next question is from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just wanted to hear win on Western Europe and APAC. Just any additional color you can provide in terms of why the acceleration is happening right now from either engagement perspective or content perspective that or anything else that’s driving this? Some of the countries in APAC and Western Europe are not as mature as the U.S. as far as our user growth. But I would highlight the U.S., which has been traditionally where we got our start continues to show amazing growth and continues to show growth in the 9 through 12 segment, which is really where we’ve got our start. So there’s underlying growth that is worldwide as we focus on frequency.
And as we focus on engagement, we focus on the quality of our product, even for our core market, but on top of that, Germany, France, less mature than the U.S. continuing to grow in January in Germany and in France, we saw DAU and hourly growth both north of 20%, so there’s a lot of room there. And we ultimately, once again, as part of our vision of innovating the way people come together. We are ultimately trying to get every country in the world to the same level of engagement as the U.S. And so some of those countries are just earlier on the growth curve. Yes. And Bernie, just as you’re doing the math, maybe two thoughts. One is, I think David talked language is getting better and better everywhere around the world. So where there is translation. I think that certainly is helpful. But the other thing is because as Dave mentioned, in the U.S., we started off with a younger age demographic. Through that age demographic became very, very popular there and then the older age demos started to come on board.
In some of the other markets in Europe and Asia, it took a while for Roblox to sort of get there. And when it did, it was almost like we have much more content to all of the ages same on the platform almost more so at the same time. And so we get growth from U-13 and over 13, almost at the same time in places like Western Europe and East Asia. And I think that has – that affects the math as we see the platform really gaining traction because it’s doing so across all ages in those markets at the same time. One final risk on what Mike said and also, refer on AI. One other thing behind the scenes is we continue to improve on our own natural language translation facility, which is getting better and better the higher of the quality of that system, the higher is our experienced quality around the world because our developers traditionally develop in one language and we auto translate into many, many languages for them. An example would be Japan, which we believe we started to hit the level of product quality both on our app as well as the experiences to drive viral growth there. And in January in Japan, our hours and our DAUs were growing at over 100% year-on-year. So there’s a little bit of a leverage as we improve the quality of our translation technology. And we do see signs of different kinds of content being popular in different parts of the world, and that obviously speaks to massive developer community. And when you have that – again, that flywheel of content and users, it’s very powerful. So what we see being very popular in Japan is slightly different than what we see in other parts of the world, slightly different than Europe, slightly different than the U.S. There’s generally a certain measurement of local affinity. And so the more we lean into the community, which we certainly did again last year, significant investments in our creator community, the more content that’s appealing to more people around the world, and I think we’re just continuing to see that leverage. That’s great to hear. Thank you. And just as a follow-up to one of the previous questions on fixed costs. If we look at R&D and trust and safety, is there just a rough breakdown the rule of thumb we can think about for how those buckets are people versus infrastructure? I can go very high level on that. Trust and safety, we believe which is our top priority over time, has a lot of headroom around automation. And our view as we add more ML and more automation to our trust and safety systems, we’re optimistic this is going to scale well below a linear type rate. Whereas with R&D, we have a fair amount of more control on the more engineers we hire, the faster we can develop product and so tend to balance that independently. But look for trust and safety to scale below linear as we grow. And Bernie, we can spend some time on the model, but let me make a comment. I hope is helpful and let’s see if I get towards your question. On trust and safety, most of the cost today is headcount related. I think over time, it won’t all be headcount related, but that is more of a fixed cost in the short run number where you get leverage over time. Infra is about running data centers and the cost of the data center. So think of those as more like fixed cost investments where they get absorbed over time as the user base grows. And as the user base monetizes, you’ll see absorption of that and then leverage on the model. So the infra is almost all the cost of the data center is very few people cost and trust and safety is the opposite. Understood. Thanks guys. Okay. Your next question is from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Your line is open. Hey. How are you? Thanks for taking the questions. Kind of sticking on the cost theme here. I think in response to David's earlier question and a few times throughout the call you talked about reinvestment in the community. And you paid developers more than ever in Q4. But if I look at it on a percentage of bookings basis, DevEx came down to, I think 20%, the lowest it's been in five quarters. I was wondering if you could – that doesn't feel like an area that would benefit from leverage. So just wondering what your thoughts are on the trajectory of how you're paying the devs community on a percent of bookings basis and what you see going forward as we kind of clean up our models? Yes, Brandon, so it's not intended to go down as a percentage of bookings. Bookings grew very quickly in the fourth quarter. So we had a little bit of, again, absorption if you will of the cost. And so – but generally, if you look at that over the last three or four years, you're going to see a shift of a few hundred basis points. So December was – Q4 in general was a little bit unusual because of the spike in the growth rate of bookings. Our intention is to continue to move more of the economics towards the dev community.
Our intention is to continue to find innovative and cool ways for the devs to monetize on the platform through various sources of bookings and monetization. And yes, normally, I would expect that, that's one number that I can tell you will go up as a percentage of bookings this quarter and throughout the course of the year. So I'll go back up to where we have been, which is like that 22%, 23% range, and we'll still try to push through higher numbers. So what you're seeing in Q4 was unintended leverage because of the top line.
Does that make sense? Yes. Essentially, it's timing. It's like you're timing. Timing okay. That's right. That's a good way to put it. Just simple... In the month of December, that number – the amount of capital at the dev community was an all-time high. And obviously it's a seasonal number because it's – because we obviously have high bookings and it's largely variable. But we noticed, as we did the math that if the run rate at December, you – we can see it in the near future where the market availability for debt is $1 billion plus, which is really exciting for us. Great. And then I wanted to dig in a little bit on brands and advertising because that was a highlight at RDC and your Investor Day. So couple of questions there. How of the ad test gone that you've been – that you've been executing on? And do you expect advertising to be any kind of real contributor this year or next?
And you mentioned brand experience the likes of Elton John, which actually caught my attention because the fan base for Elton is obviously much older than probably your typical user. And so, have those been successful from an engagement perspective? And how – to what extent our experiences like that driving this age up that we're really seeing from you guys? Yes. They are a part of it and for performers like Elton John, we see millions and millions of people visiting their experience. But that's just a part of it, there's continuously more and more high-quality content that is a daily, weekly, monthly place where our older players come to visit as well. We are in the very early innings of advertising right now. We are – we have our eyes right on the target of making this a self-service platform above and beyond the early experiences we're doing with brands. And we believe there's a huge market for on-platform advertising for brands who want to bring people to their experiences to engage.
We've been very, very conservative on the forecast this year as far as the contribution from advertising. But when we look at other platforms and whether it's print or online, web or video and we look at the level of engagement on those platforms relative to on Roblox, obviously the opportunity is really, really large. So you will see us this year rolling out more and more self-serve capabilities for advertising but we're being very conservative on the contribution. And Brandon, we're going to move on, just because we only have time for one more question, but we can catch up with you after. Thank you for the question.
All right. We have time for one more. Your final question comes from the line of Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks guys. Two quick ones, I guess, for me. Dave, I guess, just to clarify, was there any contribution from advertising or a meaningful one in the first quarter or in January, I guess, I should say. And could you comment maybe a little bit more on sort of what's working or not working? You talked about the ad units, sort of teleportation and then also more static units last quarter. Anything, I guess that you would call out in terms of advertiser or more to [indiscernible] response so far?
And then, Mike, if there's time, could you remind us, I guess, given some of the lumpiness with sort of COVID and comps over the last year or two, what sort of seasonal patterns maybe we should expect for either the duration of metrics reports for the next sort of quarter or two? Thanks. Yes. We are working with a select number of brands as part of our early experiments with advertising. I think any contribution that would shop essentially shouldn't be considered right now. We've got our eye on the prize of self-serve this year, at which point you'll start to see the contribution. Yes. So Clark, on comps, we're largely, I think, through COVID comparisons, which is nice to say. This time last year we were basically coming out of Omicron. And so we don't really – other than in emerging markets, we don't see too much of COVID variability in our numbers. And I think getting through that in December and January has been helpful and has cleaned up the analysis for people. So I think going forward, I'm optimistic that we're more or less through that. I would – it seems to me like December and January performance would indicate that we're done with that. So anyway, so I assume for the rest of the quarter we'll feel the same way. We shouldn't see anything around COVID meaningfully affecting the numbers.
Again, some of the emerging markets are a little bit behind where we are in the U.S. and Europe. But we don't really see that. We look through our trend data; we don't see big swings related to COVID anymore. Yes. And keep an eye on our year-on-year numbers, which in effect, neutralize seasonality, Q4 always tends to be bigger around the holidays. But keep an eye on our year-on-year numbers which kind of take care of that. Thanks so much. Yes. I think we're going to wrap up here once again. I just want to thank our investors and the Roblox community. I appreciate you being on the call with us. Thank you for joining us today. And Brent, thank you for being a great operator, and that's a wrap for us. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, and that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thank you. Hey, and good morning, everyone. We are going to start with a prelude. And I want to talk a bit about bookings acceleration and the generation of cash, which is really exciting for our business. We're going to talk about our future bookings growth rate relative to cost of sales, infrastructure, and compensation expense, which is also a wonderful story. And then, finally, we'll touch base on innovation and what we've done since the start of this year.
Our revenue in Q1 grew 22%, to $655 million. Our bookings grew 23% to $773 million. And I want to just highlight bookings is how we run the business. We run the business based on cash. Our bookings growth rate year-on-year over the last five quarters have gone from negative 3%, to negative 4%, to plus 10%, to plus 17%, to plus 23%. We believe this is being driven by eight quarters of innovation and awesome engineering that have expanded our platform. And our platform is growing in all directions, and I'll touch on that.
GAAP loss was $268 million, while cash from operations was positive $173 million. We generated over $100 million of free cash and operational cash in the quarter, and this just highlights the difference between cash and our GAAP loss, which is driven by deferred revenue and other factors. Finally, our cash has been steady relatively over the last six quarters, and we have approximately $3 billion of cash with no external financing.
On the user side, our DAUs are up 22%, with an all-time high of 66 million DAUs. Our hours are up 23% year-on-year, once again an all-time high of 14.5 billion hours of engagement in Q1. All regions are up, and I want to highlight that our 13-and-up segment is growing 31% year-on-year, which bodes very well for our future growth as that's an amazingly large available market for us. On the developer community, money flowing to our developer community increased 24% year-on-year to a record $182 million in Q1.
We have some exciting things happening in our business. Our bookings growth year-on-year is already exceeding our cost of sales growth year-on-year. And we believe, in Q3 of this year, our year-on-year bookings growth will exceed our infrastructure year-on-year growth. This is a testament to the efficiency on our infrastructure spend and the way we have built out our redundant datacenter in [Ash] (ph). I want to highlight that we spent almost $400 million of cash on infrastructure over the last year, and we're still showing positive cash flow in Q1. Finally, we believe, in Q1 of 2024, our year-on-year bookings growth will pass our year-on-year compensation expense growth through just operational excellence.
We have not suffered layoffs. We continue to highlight that we're being very thoughtful in hiring the best and growing our headcount efficiently. On the cash side, once again, I highlighted we're in an awesome cash position. And on the innovation side, we continue to innovate. Our vision is to bring together a billion people every day with optimism and civility, and we're very bullish about this vision. We continue to feel very positively about this opportunity. In the last eight quarters, we've driven a lot of innovation. I want to highlight on the innovation we've really executed on, since January 1 of this year.
And that innovation falls in categories of cost control, revenue acceleration, AI-generative creation, international ageing up, and our vision of social communication. We've got a 15-year history of innovation. And we believe innovation is once again contributing to our bookings acceleration. On the cost efficiency, we've been using AI and machine learning for quite some time to drive the efficiency of our safety organization, which is really the primary focus of our business. And we've got to the point where we're highly automating reviews of 3D objects, audio, and images.
On the revenue side, I want to highlight that our advertising system is now in test. We have over 200 developers that are participating. We're not going to share the number. We will make a small amount of advertising revenue in Q2 of this year. And I'll quote what the NFL shared with our advertising system is that, ""Portals have helped the NFL reach and convert a high percentage of new users into their experience."" We're really excited about this. It is a new ad format that complements image and video that is very immersive and native to Roblox.
We've launched two AI-generative accelerators to help our creators create better and create more quickly. First is a material generator that allows developers to create any type of 3D material purely by using a few words. If a creator on Roblox says, ""I would like a brick wall that's a little bit covered with moss,"" that's enough to generate a 3D material. We're proud that we did this early this year. And we're also launching code generation. Roblox has an amazing repository of Lua code. And we're using this to train a code generator that won't just help people auto-complete, but really helps create and script on Roblox.
On the international side, we continue to drive the vision that Roblox is a platform that will work around the world. And also drive the vision that anyone's creation can go live in many, many countries. I want to highlight Japan, which is now growing at over 100% year-on-year on daily active. It's been driven by some advances we've made on semantic search and the quality of our translation. We continue, behind the scenes, to drive the quality, the performance, and efficiency of our Core 3D engine. And we've made enormous strides on our vision of social communication as well.
Since the start of the year, voice on Roblox is now being used by almost 10% of over-13 daily users in the U.S.A., 9% to be exact. And we've rolled out lip sync as well on our journey to fully animating avatars on the platform, either using lip-sync or ultimately camera. A fun other thing just to highlight. By day seven, based on all the work we've don't on contacts and friend-finding, people are finding 10% more real-life friends on the platform in the first seven days than they were a year ago.
Just want to once again recap, and then we'll start answering questions. Long-term mission is a billion users every day connected with optimism and civility. We're focusing on driving bookings growth with innovation. Behind that bookings growth, we have an enormous focus on operational excellence and efficiency. And once again, we believe, by Q1 of next year, bookings on a year-on-year basis will be growing more quickly than cost of sales, infrastructure expense or headcount compensation expense. And then finally, the cash that we spin-off, as much as possible, we want to really share with the creator community to drive innovation.
With that, we'll open up for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Andrew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open. Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. A lot of discussion around slowing investment spending, I'm assuming or I did not hear anything around Developer Exchange fees. So, Mike, I guess, is the 24% as a percentage of 1Q bookings, is that a good quarterly run rate for the business over the next several quarters or does that continue to move up? And Dave, as you think about this line, curious if there is a competitive response to Epic's Unreal Editor for Fortnite in terms of the economics the company pays out to its developer community? Thanks. Yes, I'll go, and then I'll let Mike talk about long-term exchange. Developers are flocking to Roblox right now. In March 2023, the number of developers, who earned something on our platform, grew 63% year-on-year to over four million. And the money to our community increased 24% year-on-year in Q1 to $182 million. There's an enormous economic opportunity on Roblox, and we see that continuing to grow with a lot of developers moving to our platform. I'll let Mike comment on the Developer Exchange rate. Yes, on the rate, we're pleased that we have continued to increase the rate of growth in Developer Exchange over the last few years. We continue to look for efficiencies in our business, not only to drive our bottom line, but also to drive increasing economics to the developer community, and we'll continue to do that over time. We've been very steady in our approach of increasing that number. And as we garner efficiencies in the rest of the company, it really gives us the flexibility to balance increased investment in the community with a little bit of increase in the bottom line for the company. So, we'll continue to take that approach. Okay, thanks, guys. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and good morning. I wanted to maybe double-click a little bit on that Fortnite creative question that was just asked. As you can see some in the investment community have seized on it as a source of competition, even though the platforms are very different. So, I wanted to ask you, given the early stages of development of the metaverse, how would the emergence of a second ecosystem, over time, actually be beneficial or symbiotic to Roblox and its developers? And I have a follow-up after that. Hey, Omar, great question. And I want to share a bit about how we think of innovation at Roblox, and how we have for the last, really, 16 years. As you correctly note, it's still very early in the creation of the metaverse. We see it in a place where Roblox can have a billion daily active. We think about innovation as inventing and creating things that have never been done before to help drive this vision of the metaverse. And one of those is UGC creation, which we launched over 16 years ago, that we do believe is part of this vision. There are a lot more innovations that are coming from us, and we shared the vision around social communication, we shared our vision around AI-driven acceleration. We shared our [driven] (ph) around an ad platform. We're just very bullish that it's going to take a lot more new invention and the creation of many more long-port pull technologies to get to that billion daily actives. And that's what we focus our engineering and product teams on. Okay, all right. So, maybe a follow-up to that, I noticed that a studio that got its start on Roblox recently raised a $25 million Series A venture capital round. So, as the most successful studios in your ecosystem become larger and their IPs and services are capable of standing on their own, how does Roblox think about incentivizing them to keep monetizing on platform rather than through some social channel or another creator platform? I want to highlight that's not really a future-looking thing. That's something that exists right now, and that those incentives today are already massing, and continue to grow. Our top creators create experiences that generate tens of millions of dollars. And you could see, as they're starting to raise money, the size of those creators is getting larger. What I shared earlier, which is continued bookings growth, continued economic activity, operational excellence, so Roblox runs as lean as possible, both on cost of sales, on our headcount expense, and on our infra. What that means is an efficient utility that pushes as much money back to those creators as possible. So, we think those incentives are already there. And we think it's all about operational excellence, and moving as much economic activity and an enormously large platform to that developer community. Great, thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hey, good morning, Dave. And good morning, Mike. Maybe two quick ones if I could. I guess first, any color on trends that's you're seeing in April into May, and maybe just how we should think about what a normal second quarter looks like for you guys seasonally because, obviously, we've had a couple of really weird years? So, any color there would be helpful. And then just secondly, I think, Mike, last quarter, you guys talked about -- maybe it was two quarters ago, high single-digit-type EBITDA margin for the year. Is that still the way we should be thinking about 2023 or has that evolved at all? Thanks again, guys. Hey, Matthew, thanks for checking in. We did our last monthly metrics presentation in March. And I think we're all excited and glad that we did it, and are glad that we're done doing it. There's two years of pretty good, healthy data out there that reflects seasonality, and COVID, and reopening from COVID. So, I think there's plenty of data out there. The benefits of Q2, of course, are April was really strong with the Easter holidays, and June is strong because school is out and it's the start of the summer, and summer is always a big time for the platform, as it is for lots of companies.
In terms of margins, we talked a ton about it today on the call. Again, it's really about efficiency, it's about coming to a point in the company's history where we have returned to really substantial bookings growth as a result of making incredible investments in people and infrastructure. And now being able to allow that growth to creep up to a level where it exceeds our investments in people and infrastructure. So, we feel really, really excited to combine growth with operating leverage over the next few quarters and years. And that's really what's important us.
So, I just would say expect to see a business over the next few years that is really high growth and high operating leverage. We are excited about that, and we'll continue to make the right investments in the company for long-term value. We feel really strongly that the investments in people and infra that we have made over the last couple of years allowed the business to grow and hold on to a substantial growth that happened at the beginning of COVID. And now, we find ourselves with as Dave said peak users, peak hours of engagement. I think a business growing faster than almost anything in digital entertainment, gaming, social. So, we are really satisfied with where we are. And feel like we are in a place where we can make a really nice combination of investments in growth and leverage. Great. Thanks, Mike. I'll hop back in the queue. Your next question is from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two here. Maybe the first one for Dave, just looking at the over 13 age group in the first quarter, I think it grew a little over 4 million DAUs, up from the fourth quarter which looks like one of the biggest increases that you've seen. I guess is there any that you would call out that those older users are engaging in? What is driving that uptick in over 13 DAUs?
And then, I guess just for, Mike, on the margin side, I think in the press release there is a comment about seeing some improvement on gross margins as a result of prepaid cards as we talked about in the past that there was a comment in there about credit card. Is there an element of direct-to-consumer payments that you are working on in the mobile aspect that might is driving some of that leverage? Thanks. Yes. Hey, first off on our vision and we have been sharing it in the sense since before we went public is this whole vision of our product platform and category is for all ages around the world. And, we have been working on this for many many years with the vision that younger people, older people play on Roblox will learn of Roblox will start to connect when they are at work, will go to concerts on Roblox, and a wide variety of these types of things.
We're really pleased with the older growth as we continue to improve the quality of our engine simulation. As we improve the quality of search and discovery, we are seeing more and more developers and creators start creating experiences that are exciting for people all over the world. 17 to 24 is growing very, very rapidly. We are seeing experiences like frontlines which are really been funded by our creator fund and are driving much more high quality type experiences that older players are flocking to. We think there is still enormous headroom in the older player base as people start to use Roblox as a way to socially connect as well.
So, we're really bullish on the long-term size of that cohort. On the credit card thing, I just want to highlight what we are seeing there. We are seeing that our bookings year-on-year growth rate has already passed our cost of sales year-on-year growth rate because there is so many ways for our community to spend money on Roblox. They use prepaid cards. They can use credit cards. In addition to, of course, to our partners like Google and Apple. And as that expands, we're seeing the leverage we get as bookings grows faster than their cost of sales. Great. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to bookings acceleration. Curious if you guys could provide a general sense for how maybe that's going to be balanced between user growth relative to monetization initiatives now that we are seeing more product coming out of the development pipeline? And maybe bigger picture as we are thinking about the sort of diversion in bookings and OpEx trends, is it reasonable for us to think about sort of 20% as reasonable rate maybe over the balance of this year and to next year? Hey, Clark, on bookings we've multiple things that drive our bookings. We start with a user base and we look at the frequency of the user base. How often do they come to Roblox. That gives us our daily active users. Then we look at how much time those users are spending with us. Hours per DAU that number has continued to grow, and has been really healthy across most parts of the world and most age groups. And then, we look at how much capital is being spent per hour of engagement on the platform. And again, over the last few quarters, we've seen really healthy growth in our monetization. So, it really is a combination of more users spending more time with us and spending more money on the platform as well. If you look at the monthly unique payers in our supplemental material, you'll see that primarily the growth -- the bookings growth is being driven by more payers, but there is slightly increase in the monetization per payer.
And if look in the monetization by region, which we broke out for the first time, so bookings per DAU by region in the supplemental material what you'll see is good year-over-year growth in all regions expect in Europe where we simply have had high growth in eastern Europe vis-à-vis western Europe. On the other hand if you look at the peaks of monetization in the U.S. and Canada, we are starting to see is this maturation of payer cohorts that we know over time they can run for very, very long time and they tend to monetize more as time goes on. And so, in the U.S., we have more of those cohorts. You are actually going to see higher peaks in terms of monetization even when we were at the peaks of COVID. Other parts of the world, we think we will actually get there as well over time as their cohorts become larger and more mature. So, right now like in the U.S. we have an incredible mix of older payer cohorts and new payer cohorts coming from older aged and was powering a lot really good growth.
So, generally right now, most of the top line growth is just driven by the fact that our users continue to grow. If you look at our DAU charts and our engagement charts, they have really been up into right over the last four plus years. But we are certainly seeing healthy signs of people spending -- especially the users that have been with us for a while spending incrementally. And maybe if I could follow-up really quickly just on the sort of topic of gift cards and prepaid cards, is that something that we should expect to be driven more by international markets? Or, is there higher propensity there? And if adoption does sort of pick up in the international markets, does that have a positive implication for margin in those territories too? Thanks a lot. Thanks, Clark. It has positive implications for margins anywhere in the world. And we continue to look for places where consumers don't have access to prepaid cards to make sure that they have access to it, because it's just a low friction very much in demand source of currency in our user base. We are definitely growing internationally. There is probably a higher propensity for store value in foreign markets that we are excited to continue to find places where there is growth, but there will be growth throughout literally globally. And our team is highly focused on growing the prepaid card business and actually just doing an excellent job. I'll give an example complementing over 100% year-on-year growth we are seeing in Japan, Roblox gift cards are now available in 65,000 different convenient stores in Japan. Your next question is from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham. Your line is open. Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Dave, you mentioned frontline, so I was wondering what types of content you are seeing that are most popular for older age demos? And is it always the highest fidelity games, and reason being how do you think generative AI tools could impact the amount and content that is really geared towards age up to age demos? Yes. Hi. I want to highlight that Roblox is a place where new types of experiences that people have never seen before have been created and become huge favorites with billions and billions and billions of players. And frontline is little more traditional high resolution type experience. But many of the experiences on Roblox and you name the favorites Adopt Me!, Jailbreak, Brookhaven have huge older audiences as well and really become international favorites as well as all age favorite.
So, I am just really, really proud of that. We are uniquely poised to accelerate our whole platform with AI-generative technology, and you're seeing early signs of it now on material generation and code generation, but ultimately, it means 3D experience generation, it means avatar generation, it means the quality of real-time language translation, it means the quality of search and discovery, and because of the size of our user base and our 60 million to 70 million daily active users, we have an enormous opportunity to really reinforce, train, and accelerate the quality of our AI. So, keep an eye on that. We are really proud with the early signs from our code generator and our material generator, but we're really building a platform to use this throughout robust. Understood. And just a follow-up for Mike on the commentary on infrastructure and compensation leverage, is this a change in prioritization for margins, is it a higher booking outlook, just trying to think about what's driving this better outlook now for some of this cost leverage? Hey, Bernie. Well, one thing to start with these bookings growth rates over the lat five quarters, so it's probably modest, to our attention that we are back over 20%. The investments that we've been making over the last couple of years is also geared towards keeping and growing a massive audience, and getting through COVID and the reopening, and still growing on top of that. So, we thought like those investments were very high ROI, we've driven out with return to bookings growth.
So, we are now at a much higher level of bookings growth. We have higher top line growth. We just got more room for operating leverage, and so, we feel like it's a good time to allow that growth to outstretch the growth in new hiring, and in infrastructure and investments. Those are decisions that we've made relatively recently. So, they don't happen overnight. We will start to see benefits from that as we talked about in the back-half of this year, and early next year, and then as we go into '24 and beyond. So, very much a result of getting things done, getting teams to a certain scale, getting infrastructure to a certain scale, and ensuring that our top line was back at the high growth. Understood. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Dave. Your next question is from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hey, thank you very much for taking my questions. We really appreciate the DAU by region, and the entirely models, it's going to make life lot easier for us. On that data though, could you just give a little bit of color, like, it's interesting that Europe is not a much higher rate than, say, APAC, so just if you could give us a little color around, one, where you think those numbers could go, can they approach U.S., Canada? And then if you would kind of break Europe down between, say, Western and Eastern, what those trends look like? Hey, Andrew. So, in terms of the monetization levels, I think it's still -- let me just -- I'm going to pull something left in front of me, you basically look at U.S. data first, and what you see is, Seattle, in the fourth quarter of '22 their monetization was actually above any of the prior fourth quarters even at the beginning or in the middle of COVID. Again, that has to deal with the length of the time payer cohorts has been with us. So, adding lots of new users and new payers, but we are also really benefiting from these over cohorts that have been with us for a while, between these monetization over time. That's a really great turn.
Regions like Europe and APAC were still newer markets for us, in a sense, our level of penetration in these markets were fairly lower, and we are still building a payer base that will compound over time. In Europe and in APAC, those markets are more aged up at the beginning than as U.S. has started out with the younger user base, and then ultimately aged up. And you can see in those markets, we still have not gotten back to where the monetization was at the peak of COVID. Yet, pretty good growth in APAC. And again, as I said, Europe is just a mix of between super high profiling than in Eastern Europe. And so, we work closely in Western Europe, and those two were diverging in terms of the economic benefits.
Ultimately, in certain markets in Europe and Asia-Pacific, yes, the monetization should be fairly close to the West in that part of the world. We should track GDP per capita pretty closely. In places like U.K., and ANZ, we've seen very similar monetization to what we have in the U.S. and Canada. So, there are other parts of Western Europe, where I think that will be ultimately true. In Asia-Pacific, Southeast Asia is very different than Japan. So, earlier Japan was going very quickly, it's still relatively small amount of our APAC user base engagement, and monetization, but over time that trend will move very much towards what we -- you know, in Japan we moved very much closer to what we see in the U.S. and Canada. So, we will just have to watch it over time, but it will definitely move up over time. And I will call it out that even the rest of world is a much slower number. We've sort of built a dominant user base and engagement base in places like Latin America. That has served us incredibly well, it is fantastic growth, and we have strong bookings cohort there as well. Got it, appreciate the color. And then, I guess just one follow-up for David. On the advertising product, I know it's really early, what's been the reception from brands, are they gravitating towards a certain type of ad? Are you finding brands that would normally engage with Roblox, but now they can't because you have a short form opportunity here, just kind of curious what the early commentary is, and how your views have shaped around advertising? There's two types of advertising visions that we have on Roblox. I would say, one is traditional, which is Roblox is a platform where an image from a brand -- you can shop on a virtual billboard, in any experience anywhere. So, imagine one of our partners is introducing a new movie, and so, one or two days they want people throughout Roblox to see some movie posters, something like that. What is much bigger and more disruptive is the notion of gently offering advertisers the ability to bring people to their experience, and explore it in 3D.
We have already shared some of our partnerships, Nike, Vans World, Gucci Garden, the Annabelle Experience, these are called Portal Ads, and these allow in a native non-invasive way for users who are hanging out on Roblox who might want to jump into that experience to go there and experience it. This is a new ad format. It's a format where people go and experience something in 3D spatial reality, where they go to Gucci Garden, where they go to Vans World. This is what I'm really excited about, given how disruptive it is. And this is where we're seeing early great signal. Once again, you saw the quote from the Annabelle. So, we will keep you up-to-date on it. We are very bullish on it. We'll essentially be creating this new type of advertising market, and we are fortune on Roblox that we have so much engagement, 14.5 billion hours in Q1, that it's a referral place to really launch this, so, more to come, but great early signals, especially on portal ads. Got it. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Hi, this is Jim on for Tom. Thanks for taking the question. I have one for David on picking fund. Can you talk about the progress here? How much funding has been used in inception to-date? I guess we're familiar with fund lines, but it's sort of like to rate high enough that we should expect more game funds, or something similar in the future? Thanks. Yes, I will have Mike dig up the numbers well in chatting if we can find them for you, if they're public. I want to highlight that the primary way Roblox has grown and always will grow is self-service. And I want to highlight that the primary way we've gotten to where we are, all of it, the majority of experiences on Roblox and we are familiar with all of them, have gotten there with literally no intervention. We've used the game fund, and I want to highlight we also have an educational community fund to jumpstart certain areas.
In the case of the game funds, we wanted to help developers take the risk of creating experiences that might be more attractive for older players. I want to highlight side-by-side, we are doing the same thing in education. So, the work we have done with FIRST Robotics, we work we have done the Boston Museum of Science are somewhat similar, and we are jumpstarting educational experiences. I don't want to quote where we may go, but you could imagine, in addition to experiences for older players, for education, there is the opportunity for experiences around mental health, there is the opportunity for experiences around working together in a 3D office. There are also things that we may fund some day. We are going to pull up the numbers and see if we can share anything with you on the actual numbers. Yes. So, Jim, the fund is earmarked at $25 million. We have not spent all of that capital. But to Dave's point that we are very happy with some of the performance, and the experiences in the game fund, we do track it all the time and we look at it on a weekly basis. The vast majority of these experiences on the platform are self-started, and it just exists on the economics of our platform. Great, thank you. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Kees from Daiwa. Your line is open. Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Dave's commentary about the ads. The two types of ads, more specifically how that's going to be delivered. The self-serve, how you guys have been conservative in terms of pubmed, its contribution to the top line, and kind of push up more towards 2024? So, I just kind of interesting you're not talking about a testing of that in -- currently going on, will make a contribution in Q2 albeit nothing material. So, can you give us an update in terms of the ad rollout, self-service specifically, and when you could be contributing something materially? Yes, I will comment. We expect this year to rollout self-service on this, essentially a full ad server for both image and portal ads, something that allows advertisers to on their own publish these types of experiences to Roblox. We are being very conservative on this. We do expect to make, I don't know if we call it significant revenue, Mike, I will let you comment on that, as far as what our internal things are, but we are not sharing our forecast externally. Yes, I mean there will be something in the second quarter, and we will talk more about it after that, but I certainly wouldn't be changing models for 2023 based on advertising today. Got it, that's helpful. And if I may, this one is more of an update, you talked about layered clothing, the number of users, just wondering what the number of users are for this last quarter? Yes, we will see if we can diagnosis it out. I want to highlight the bigger thing that's happening here, which is this year the migration to everything on our platform being created by our community, and that includes clothing check, avatar check, and it includes the migration to the point where every avatar can be animated, and have facial animation as well. So, view layered clothing as the first step towards a highly user-created UGC avatar system with what we believe will be a big enhancement on the diversity and breadth of the type of avatars on the system, and layered clothing is maybe what we call first metric on that. Once again, we are pulling up some numbers to see what we can share with you. Yes. Jonathan, this is actually current numbers. So, living in May, but 267 million users have acquired at least a single item as layered clothing. Great, that was helpful. It was a big jump too from last quarter too. So, thanks a lot. Thank you. We have time for one more question from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to end the call kind of where it started, with this cost discussion, and this is maybe an unpopular strengthening with the investment community, but it just sounds like you have so many opportunities, especially when it comes to things like generative AI. What are you leaving on the table by actually taking some margin and not investing more? Are there opportunities that you could be speeding up? Or, expediting in any way or uncovering? And especially in the wake of the competition that was discussed earlier from Epic? Thank you. Yes. I want to highlight that we continue to hire rapidly. We have got a very mature product engineering platform right now. And we are going to continue hiring all the way through the end of this year, next year, and the year beyond. We think where our really almost optimal hiring rate starts to intersect our bookings growth in Q1 of next year. So, we don't believe we are leaving anything on the table. Hey, Brandon, it's Mike. Interesting question, we appreciate the question. It's really helpful to look at the business over the last maybe three years or so. That covers the beginning of COVID and where we are today. I think we tripled the number of people, more than tripled the amount of spend on infrastructure. I think we spent over $7 million on growing and improving our infrastructure. And probably what you heard today was the fact that bookings growth has reaccelerated allows that growth rate to exceed the rate of investment in headcount and in infrastructure. Not that we are in any way reducing dramatically those investments. We have always tried -- if you look at the history of the company, I think it's one of the best examples of sustainable growth that I have ever seen. It's a consistent investment in things that made the business great and differentiated.
It's organic growth, never trying to accelerate a user base letting the product drive the user base that we deserve, and confident investment and innovating, and expanding our lead cost of investment in the developer community so that content is growing and getting better all the time. Those things are just so much a part of what we do that we are not taking any dramatic steps. But we do find ourselves at a point right now where the bookings growth has really reaccelerated. And so, we feel comfortable that that number can be ahead of the key investments. But we will always be focused on innovating and staying a step ahead. That's just who we are. So, it really is a balance. And I love the way we have ended the call and appreciate the question on both sides of this because there really are two sides. There is investing to stay ahead and there is also proving that you have a business model that is long-term sustainable.
If anything proves that out, just look at the last six quarters in the business. We have literally been $3 billion of cash over the last six quarters. Continuing to invest, continuing to spend almost $0.5 billion over the last six quarters in infrastructure. And yet, cash neutral because the business itself generates so much operating cash. So, we really feel like we have balanced it very well up until now. And hope that we will continue to balance those things over the next few quarters and next few years. But that's the way we have always run the business. And ultimately, we think that drives the most long-term value. So, we appreciate the question. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. And that's a wrap. Bret, you can close it out. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of strong growth across all our key metrics, and we welcome you today. Bookings were $780 million, up 22% year-on-year. Our DAUs were $65.5 million, up 25% year-over-year. And our hours engaged in Q2 were $14 billion, up 24% year-over-year.
We generated $28 million of operating cash, our cash is now north of $3 billion at $3.025 billion. We showed a GAAP loss of $283 million and covenant adjusted EBITDA at $37.9 million. These results powered by all of our investments in innovation. And as we discussed last quarter, we continue to be on track with our bookings growth and our expense control to generate positive operating leverage.
We highlighted in the first half of this year that our bookings are growing faster year-on-year than our cost of goods sold. We continue to expect in Q3 of this year that our bookings growth year-on-year will be faster than our infrastructure growth year-on-year. And we continue to expect in Q1 of 2024 that our bookings growth will be faster than our head count expense. We expect to return to double-digit covenant adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 and 2024 as a whole.
Let's dive into the business. We're driving continuously to our vision and mission of 1 billion daily active users and it's part of our four-part growth strategy. I want to highlight some results in all areas, including international, all ages, really the utility of Roblox and driving towards a daily product for everyone and our economy and ecosystem.
Let's start with international. And I want to highlight that many of our huge international cohorts are really big and growing faster than our overall bookings and DAU rate. Let's start with some key geographies. Germany DAU's 25% year-on-year growth. Korea, 34% year-on-year growth. Brazil, 38% year-on-year growth, India DAUs 40% DAU growth year-on-year and Japan, one of the largest consumer gaming market space is DAU growth of 107% year-on-year. A product highlight supporting this, we mentioned Semantic Search last quarter for Japan.
We turned this on everywhere in Q2. This improved search for out of catalog searches and pop culture terms. And we've seen a significant increase in global click-through rate because of this north of 3%. We're no longer talking about aging up. We are a platform for all ages. Our 13 and over cohort is 5 times larger than our under 13 cohort. And our 13-and-over cohort is growing at 33% year-on-year for DAUs. Our '17 through '24 cohort is growing at 36% year-on-year for both DAUs and hours.
And I do want to highlight that we introduced experience guidelines this quarter. You can read about it in our blog. Around the world, '17 through '24 and '25 and up cohorts consistently show higher bookings per hour than other age cohorts.
Let's take a look at our Dev ecosystem. We are on track for our developers to earn $800 million in 2023. Our DevEx payouts in Q2 were $165 million, up 16% year-on-year. And I want to highlight the growing variety of content on our platform. In the last 12 months trailing, the 10 highest earning creators earned an average of $27 million each. These are growing and larger significant businesses but at the longer tail developer number 1,000 is now growing 2 times faster over the last three years, and is making $64,000 a year. That's thousands and thousands of people making it living on Roblox.
And as far as content variety versus a year ago, within the top 150 experiences, we're seeing 9% more variety of new experiences created in the last 90 days this year. Cool feature that we introduced for all Dev is product analytics. It's ways for developers to monitor user acquisition, performance, benchmarks and I want to highlight, in the last six months, use of analytics by the top 10,000 devs has gone from 22% to 40%. We think this is a good signal. This is 10,000 developers with 40% of them paying deep attention to analytics to help, we believe improve the quality of their experiences.
For those that are deep into our ecosystem, I want to highlight that the anti-cheat technology we acquired from Byfron is live now. It's made a significant impact in the quality of experiences on our Windows platform, where a lot of our more serious gamers are playing and really significantly reduced exploits and bought activity.
As we're moving towards our vision and mission of connecting 1 billion people daily. We're making significant advancements in our products to make Roblox a daily utility. And I want to highlight, we believe we have significant headroom even in our core market where we got our start, which is USA 9 through 12.
Highlight, we introduced Meta Quest on beta. We saw a 1 million downloads in the first five days on that platform and it highlights our vision of Roblox being available everywhere, and it highlights the vision that when a creator makes an experience on Roblox, it immediately runs on all platforms and is immediately dynamically translated into all languages. We believe that's part of the DAU growth we've seen around the world.
Getting into utility, high-frequency communication on our platform. In the U.S.A., we now have 12% of our 13 and up daily actives using voice and 2 million voice DAUs worldwide as of the end of Q2. This is a 30% growth over the last six months. And we have strong evidence that as people become more immersed with voice, it has uplift in key metrics, both on our spend and on Roblox.
Facial animation, we just turned on for 100% of voice users. I want to highlight this, coupled with voice, we believe makes Roblox communication much more connected and realistic. And we also turned on animated heads for everyone using voice. We have some great stuff coming on animation as well.
On the social side, I want to highlight, we've been hard at work improving the way people connect and the way real life friends connect and we've seen a 9% year-on-year growth in real life friending in the first week, which we feel is significant. And once again, strong directional evidence that this benefits retention.
On our economy, we're creating products and systems to build a vibrant economy and empower our creator community to offer them more ways to earn and be discovered. Advertising is now live in its early form. I want to highlight some key things there. We have promoted Christina Wootton to Chief Partnership Officer, to help drive our connection with brands. We've now done over 200 brand activations on the platform and we'll make revenue this year in advertising. We're going to share at Investor Day in November, our expectations for this for 2024.
But I do want to highlight that on the supply side now, 19% of the top 100 experiences on our platform have ad units. And this has been added organically by the creator community and I also want to highlight that there are areas already where we see strong demand and more demand than supply for advertising on the platform. Want to welcome some of our advertisers that are live, including NARS Cosmetics, H&M, Spotify, NASCAR and iHeartRadio.
I'm really excited about really, the vision that we've been talking here that this is a new form of immersive advertising. This is a form of advertising that actually allows people to go to an immersive experience and experience of brand. Highlighting that we are on track on our UGC economy to get to full avatars throughout the ecosystem by the end of the year. We think this is going to significantly change the look and feel of Roblox, really looking forward to that. Also, just highlighting on search and discovery on the efficient frontier. In Q2, we've been able to increase both the impact of bookings and the engagement on our search and discovery system at the same time, which is what we've been talking about doing for a while.
Let's talk a little about AI and just how big it is for a platform like Roblox. We have approaching 14 billion hours of engagement on Roblox in Q4. There are many, many, many areas that we're already live on the platform with ML and AI stacks and more to come. I want to highlight that we have 70 machine learning training stacks right now. We have trained, for example, our own translation model with 1 billion parameters. This is the model that helps auto translate all experiences when a creator makes them.
And the range of verticals that we have live right now, we've mentioned material generation and code generation have shipped. We mentioned that we're making really impressive gains in both quality and cost throughout our safety systems on all types of assets, which is live. We've mentioned that we're building our own model internally and running our own inference on voice, safety, internally on search, we're live, and we have a lot of 3D generative coming as we move to creation everywhere and our avatar project.
I want to highlight two key things on our platform. First, we've got approaching 5 billion hours of human interaction on our platform every month. And this human interaction can help us and does help us reinforce the quality of our stability system. We believe long term that on our platform because we can run infrastructure, inference on our own infrastructure, there's an amazing opportunity to run inference all over the platform and run it at extremely low cost.
I'll give you an example. Our personalized recommendations right now, a 100% of these are running on our own infrastructure, running inference and doing it really cheaply at scale. Also, all of our safety pipelines, image, audio, voice, text, and 3D are running on our own platform, doing inference on our own platform at significant efficiencies of cost and driving quality there.
Longer term, look for us to build bigger and more sophisticated models, first around voice, text and language supporting safety and stability, look for bigger and more interesting advanced models for us for 3D generation and ultimately, look for models from us on general human simulation and PCs. Once again running at extremely high performance and low cost on our own infrastructure.
Finally, just to cap it off and then we'll start taking questions. We do have a research group that is producing some really high-quality technology that we will be wrapping into our product over the next two to four years under Dr. Morgan McGuire, checkout research.roblox.com, Manish Agrawal just published a great paper on adding conditional control to text damage diffusion models. And 2023, and you can see all of what we're doing there.
With that, thank you, and we'll welcome questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Crum from Stifel. Your line is open. Okay. Thanks, guys. Good morning. So Dave, I think in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that the company is on pace to pay out $800 million in developer exchange fees this year, that would imply an acceleration in the second half over the first half against conceivably a deceleration in bookings growth. I just want to make sure those assumptions are correct and what's driving that uptick in the second half? Thanks. Hey, Drew. It's Mike. Generally, back half revenue in our business is higher than the front half of the year. It's pretty simple. So it's straightforward. You know what the -- roughly what the payouts are and so that's what's driving the $800 million number. Got it. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you address your plan to enable developers the ability to offer subscriptions within their experiences. Any sense on timing and if or how, Roblox would share in the economics of the accompanying bookings that are generated through subscriptions? Thanks. Yeah. So, hi. Thanks for highlighting this Roblox way of thinking about things. A lot of our developers would like to offer VIP subscriptions directly for their experience. We are working on it. We plan to support this. We're not going to give a date or a time. We do think it will be significant and we do think it will interact with subscriptions on the platform and recurring revenue. Thanks, guys. And your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Wonder if you could talk about what the impact has been on British (ph) cohorts for now having 17-plus rated content? I want to share that it's early. That said, we have started to see some organic traction, which is just the same as we've seen in all areas. We have started to see developers build specific 17-plus experiences, and they're starting to show up in our sorts (ph). We think this is going to continue to grow and get bigger, but you can check it out on the site. Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, with advertising begin to roll out now, how are you pricing the inventory? Yeah. This is really exciting. We've been a little gentle on the pricing right now. We're going to -- we expect at some point in the future to float the price. And when we do this, we will see the true value of what we believe is an extremely new and valuable ad units which is a teleport into an immersive experience. This is a new ad unit, unlike a video ad unit, unlike an image ad unit. It’s literally moving real-time people on Roblox into one of our partners’ experience, and we will self-discover that in the free market as we float pricing. Thank you very much. And your next question comes from the line of Clark Lampen from BTIG. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. I have two. Dave, I want to start with some of the AI commentary you made in the shareholder letter. Understanding that it's an accelerant creation across the platform. I think the consequence from a user side seems fairly obvious in terms of the overall experience improving. But as we think about the developer side, how does that increase sort of, in volume and velocity of content creation impact developers? Does it make it a more competitive ecosystem? And if it is, is there a need to, I guess, sort of offset that with potentially higher developer distribution rates over time. We think that -- I mean, we're entering an exciting new period on our platform. You highlighted that for users traditionally when users create immersive 3D content or social content. They're used to doing it with graphics tools and 3D type creation. We think experiences, for example, a fashion design experience is going to migrate all the way from using a virtual sewing machine and scissors to purely based text prompts. And ultimately, we'll enter an age on Roblox where anyone can make their avatar or clothing 100% through text prompts. So if I or you wanted to build a piece of clothing, we could describe it. We're going to see that created in real time.
We think for developers, this is going to accelerate quality up and down the stack. There's a great video clip. We're not going to claim when we will achieve this on West world, where there's a text braced interaction of 3D creation and we do think that's the product vision where developers will have all tools at their disposal. We'll see a greater diversity of experiences. We will see people who before didn't expect to be creators making immersive 3D experiences. And we'll see the ones that are created by developers become more rich and dynamic. We may ultimately even see experiences that are dynamically personalized for each individual player. So it's really early, but we think it's a really exciting frontier for 3D creation. That's helpful. I appreciate the comments. Maybe one for Mike as a follow-up. I want to kind of pull out the thread that you dangled a moment ago with saying the back half of the year is going to be bigger than the first half traditionally. I think that sort of implies an acceleration or I guess, at the very least, steady growth into the back half of the year. Assuming that sort of persists, if not improves next year with product cycles that are unfolding and sort of improving, we talked about advertising already.
Could you help us, I guess, think about ongoing rates of margin improvement with the business. You identified the sources, I guess, across OpEx, but maybe simplifying a lot of those things between COGS, ITS and R&D over time. Does that roughly speaking, translate to sort of 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year? Is it a little bit more or would you be willing to quantify at this point? Thanks. That was a long question, but a good question. That's okay. We will see leverage against pretty much all of the cost areas over the next 12 months will, we think we'll see a little bit of leverage in cost of goods sold because we've slowed down hiring, leverage against our compensation expenses because infra, trust and safety, we slowed down a little bit there. We've already close the gap pretty meaningfully on both of those two.
Just to give you a few numbers. In the first quarter, infra, trust and safety was growing at about 33% year-over-year, bookings were growing at 23%. And then just last quarter, infra, trust and safety is growing at 24% and bookings were at 22%. So you can already see there's a lot of leverage that we've already shown and obviously, well on the way to seeing leverage in Q3.
Same thing with personnel, the head count costs were growing far in excess of bookings in Q1, much less in Q2, and we've already taken steps so that we'll see leverage in Q1 -- Ss we -- '24. So we really feel like all the cost areas there is opportunity for leverage while we continue to invest in growing the top line. It will really depend on both a combination of how the costs roll out and how fast our top line grows, obviously. But I don't really -- we're not giving guidance on what the year is going to end up. We're just saying Q4 is -- we're a seasonal business. Q4 is back into double-digits, and we should be able to run double digits for 2024 as a whole. Yeah. And on the hire (ph), I just want to highlight. We continue to hire a lot of people. The year-on-year incremental head count compensation costs will go down slightly. We do expect bookings in Q1 2024, to be growing at a year-on-year rate higher than the head count compensation. And the final thing just to add, I said once again in my statement is, we do expect double-digit covenant adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 in 2024 as a whole. And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross from LightShed Partners. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Your beta with Meta Quest actually opened a few questions in my mind. One of them is, while we're on new platforms, is there any update on opening Roblox to other new devices and game platforms like PlayStation or switch? And then, I have a follow-up. It's a great question. High level, we believe immersive 3D, human co-experience should be on every platform. We of course, have our eyes on those platforms and stay tuned. Okay. And then, Dave, it seems like in the past, you haven't shown all that much interest in VR. I could be wrong. But do you believe that VR now will become an important tool for accessing your platform? And does the Apple Vision Pro change our perception at all of how people will experience 3D interactive in the future? And then, maybe if you could talk a little bit about technically how much more complicated it is to build for VR and AR, and still create the same experience across all the platforms you work with. Yeah. I tweeted a few weeks ago that we had 1 million installs on Meta Quest. There's a lot of good information in the comments there where people who haven't used VR before are used to certain Roblox experiences on their phone or their computer. And they put on a VR headset like, oh my gosh, this same experience is all around, I’m deeply immersed in it, and it's the same experience I'm used to. So we do believe it's a really immersive experience. Our strategy has always been that immersive 3D should be everywhere. We want the highest quality experience everywhere. We want a creator to make once and run everywhere.
We've done a lot of work on performance and on human interaction, so the same experiences out of the box work on Meta Quest. A lot of that work of course, is the same work we would do on Apple vision, just as a lot of the work we've done on Xbox would be the same work for PlayStation. And we are really excited that some of the performance work we would do for Meta Quest reflects throughout our whole ecosystem. So we’re already pretty good at build once, run everywhere. And as you correctly note, there’s a lot of opportunity for both immersiveness on VR and more platforms. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. Maybe I'll just revisit DevEx for a second. So step down to like 21% of bookings in 2Q is down a little bit from 1Q. And given your expectation of $800 million of bookings -- or excuse me, of DevEx for the full year, it would imply that as a percentage of bookings in the second half, it would have to step up depending on your bookings assumption, 2 points maybe even 3. So I guess I'm wondering, given that it's a formula that the DevEx payouts are based on and you have gift cards offsetting some of the -- some of what's happening in the second half. What changed in 2Q and then what's going to change in the second half to kind of cause that ratio of DevEx payouts to go up? And then I have one follow-up. Thank you. So hey, I want to go high level on this. And we believe over time, more and more ways creators earn money on our platform, traditional DevEx, engagement-based payouts, we have advertising coming and potentially subscriptions and other things. So this is going to be a very rich ecosystem. We've also highlighted that by Q1 of next year, we expect year-on-year bookings growth to be faster and greater than cost of goods than infra and then head count. That leaves either cash generation or DevEx. And that puts us in this wonderful place to balance really how much cash we generate versus how much we distribute to developers. So at a high level, the more we drive to this, the more opportunity we have for both earnings and DevEx. With that, I'll kick over to Mike for detail on this. Yeah. And then just on the quarterly and timing, just look at '22 as the year, DevEx rates were 23, 22, 22, 20 in the fourth quarter, 24% in the first quarter. So the timing of prepaid cards doesn't in fact, affect the payout ratios back to 21% this quarter. That number, if you can consistently look over time, it's moving up and it's moving in the 22%, 23% range, again, 24% in the first quarter. So it's going to be in -- it's not entirely formulaic because you do have engagement-based payouts on top of the normal formulaic piece.
And to Dave's point, other things that developers can also participate in over time. So the number will fluctuate 100 basis points, 200 basis points quarter-to-quarter sometimes. And overall, so it implies that we're going to, again, be a bigger business in the second half than we were in the first half, and it implies a good healthy payout ratio for our developers, which is, ultimately, we're always investing in the developers. Great. Thank you. And then just on the AI model, there's a comment in the shareholder letter about creating a multi-model generative AI model. Dave, you were talking in the prepared remarks about how efficient you're able to be on the AI side. So I guess from a head count and infrastructure perspective, are all the investments, if not in place, at least in the plan in order to create those AI models that you're going to need to go to the next generation of what the platform is going to be capable of? Or could we conceivably be in a position where as you try to build these tools, it requires maybe more investment and that's a worthwhile thing to do. Yes. I want to highlight that right now, we have a lot of people working on AI internally already. So we have a fairly significant team and it's a fairly significant team considering, once again, the scale of what we're doing, we're running 70 different vertical training models right now. And we've built fairly significant tech on the trust and safety side. I don't want to comment on the future opportunity there. We're always open to things. But right now, we're still on track to have our bookings expense, beat our head count expense in Q1 of 2024. And we have a really great sophisticated AI team already in place. Great. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You launched UGC Limiteds in April. I was wondering if you could update us on your commercial learnings thus far, and I'm particularly curious if you saw a corresponding increase in the mix of subscriptions. And I have a follow-up question. Yeah. I'll tell you, right now, limited UGC is the long-term vision. Right now, it's a smaller proportion of our marketplace. But -- you could -- one could say that UGC Limit is more accurately near the economics of the real world as far as scarcity as far as cost of goods sold as far as creating really a rich and vibrant economy. And we do expect ultimately for every cohort, every type of asset to follow this pattern of more similarly mirroring the real world.
The pricing on UGC items is 3x, the non-UC or non-limited pricing, which is a really, really good sign. And it's a good sign that we're moving in the direction of strong economic theory supporting how we build a virtual goods marketplace. We'll be rolling out expansions of this over the next two quarters and ultimately, it's our long-term direction. Any comment on the effect on Prima subscriptions, because for my understanding, you have to have a premium subscription in order to participate in the trading. Yeah. I believe we may be referring to be a creator, and we're using that most likely more as validation of user account. We'll have to check on that. I want to validate that. But we're not requiring subscription necessarily, I think, to buy UGC Limited, and we'll check with the team on that. Understood. We're not trying to -- Yeah. Just I want to clarify, we are not trying to drive subscriptions with UGC Limited. Got it. And how much do you think UGC Limiteds could influence the trajectory of monetization in your core markets in the next few quarters? Hard to say. We are doing experiments once again through every cohorts, trying to optimize mirroring of real life. All of the projections we talk about as far as bookings versus expense in Q1 really head count acceleration or not acceleration, but really bookings beating head count expense. I don’t believe we have huge gains from this built in. I believe we have a lot of upside there. Thanks a lot, David. I appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks. And your next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks. Dave, I was wondering if you could discuss for -- and I know it's early for games that have added advertising units, how that's impacted the overall experience. Is it purely additive in terms of monetization? How does it impact engagement? And then your shareholder letter noted giving measurement and attribution tools to brands, I wanted to see if you could unpack that a bit. How much targeting you think you can provide for marketing purposes? Yeah. Two things to unpack. One is, developers have a lot of analytics right now on our platform and they're opting in to these ad units once again to the tune of 19% of the top 100. We're optimistic that these types of ad units are native, immersive non-blocking and additive. We're not talking things that prevent you from playing or pre-roll or things that get in your way. We're talking about ad units that somewhat simulate the real world. We're walking around. We can see a portal to go to one of our brand experiences. And then people have a back button and they can come right back. So we're really optimistic about this.
I would say, can you just highlight once again the second part of your question. Yes. It was just about in the shareholder letter, you talked about giving measurement and attribution tools to brands. Just wanted to see if you could discuss that, what level of targeting you willing to go. We're building a full ad marketplace for this new type of ad unit. Brands will have within the constraints, of course, of safety and stability on our platform and PII rules and Copa rules and all of those types of things as well as our own vision. The ability to, I think, thoughtfully do some targeting. We're not going to be doing this for user teams on the platform. This is all for 13 and up. And we are already seeing signs in certain areas, for example, 17 through 24 female of strong demand potentially being greater than supply for these ad units. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hey. Good morning, David and Mike. Two, if I could, one on AI, and one on ads. On AI, I don't know if this is for Mike or not. I think you guys have got thousands of trust and safety head count on the platform at current. I think that's an area where you could certainly point AI to drive efficiencies. I'm curious, if you have any color or thoughts on timing of attacking that and what that impact might look like from a margin lift perspective?
And then just second, on ads. As we think about the back half here, it sounds like we're going to get a lot more color here at the Investor Day in November, which is great. But as we think about the back half of the year and into next year, how should we think about, number one, just the biggest friction point that you see that you still need to unlock to kind of grease the wheel for acceleration there or said differently, maybe milestones we should look for in that ad business?
And then a follow-up to your prior commentary on ads. I'd be interested to hear what developers are opting for in terms of ads, portal versus billboard, if you have any kind of split there would be great. Thanks, guys. Okay. Yeah. So two things. One is, we'll give you a little hint here that we've indicated our year-on-year bookings growth is going to be faster than our infra cost in Q3 of this year. Infra includes all of our infrastructure hardware. It also includes cost for trust and safety. And we'll also say that all of our asset review pipelines are moving more and more to higher quality and lower cost with AI acceleration, all five of those pipelines, I mentioned.
On the advertising thing, the thing to watch for us will be -- and we're not going to give a date when we fully float the advertising market, and so you can see true pricing out there, we're excited about it because we're seeing supply/demand really being interesting in some cohorts. As far as portals of the 19% of the units that we've placed, I believe most of them, I think, 12% or 13%. I'm looking it's about – that’s 12%. Great. So 12 of the top 100, I’m grabbing the data, Yes, cool. So 12 of the top 100 are placing portal ads. Do I have the right data there? Thanks. And then I'll kick it over to Mike. Yeah. Thanks. Matt, on friction, again, maybe just I'll keep it high level for a second. Ultimately, in my mind, it's the total volume of brands that get engaged on the platform. So brands today, agencies, working with agencies and working with us, how many of those brands are building and engaging on the platform. We know that there's over 200 brands that have engaged with us at this point, that's double over last year. And that rate of growth and that rate of adoption is really what makes the platform a rich and open opportunity for advertisers. So that's the number I track almost more than anything. I don't think it's technology. I think it's the volume of brands and agencies that are working with us and getting their content onto the platform. So that's really what I look at. Yeah. And then one final thing. To unlock when I say -- when we say float pricing, the complementary unlock there is everything we're doing is completely self-serve. We're not building a handholding platform. We are building a platform where any brand on their own can come and start using our platform for portal and image ad. Appreciate the color. And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Hi. This is Jim on for Tom. Thanks for taking the question. I guess one for Dave. So you mentioned some detail around decreases to the premium payout program. Can you just touch on that a little bit? I don't think we've mentioned any detail around that. Can you more color on that? [Multiple Speakers] We've addressed premium payouts on the call the comment? Yeah. So we've been talking about DevEx and also engagement-based payouts. We haven't announced any changes in either of those programs. Okay. Great. And then I guess just one more on the developer exchange fee. Is there anything we should keep in mind with respect to like FX here for payouts that are going to non-U.S. dollar developers? Yeah. I'll chime in. I believe we pretty much normalize everything to the U.S. dollar in all of our payouts and do that in real time as we pay out. Okay. Great. thank you. Well, thank you for joining us today. That’s a wrap for us. Rob, you can close it out. Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Roblox Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Stefanie Notaney, Senior Director, Financial Communication. Stefanie, you may begin. Thank you, Krista. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Q&A session to discuss Roblox's Q3 2023 results. With me today is Roblox's Co-Founder and CEO, David Bezucki; and CFO, Mike Guthrie. As a reminder, our shareholder letter, press release, SEC filings supplemental slides and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.roblox.com. On this call, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions.
Our commentary today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations of our business, future financial results and strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. A description of these are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in our press release and supplemental slides.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our Roblox Q3 2023 earnings call. A couple of quick highlights. We're going to continue to talk about our delivering growth strategy, highlighting our vision of reimagining how we come together and continued moving forward on our mission to connect 1 billion people with optimism and civility. We'll highlight some of the product velocity and new monetization opportunities we've been working on, and we're also going to give an update on our commitment to deliver operating leverage, which we shared in our letter.
Finally, highlighting the really the breadth of our business, which is connecting people around the world, connecting people of all ages and all backgrounds and highlighting the complexity of a business that spans so many cohorts today for a first time, we are going to give you a little hint at guidance looking forward, and Mike will do that after my discussion.
Diving into Q3 a real strong quarter all around. GAAP revenue, Q3 $713 million, up 38% over Q3 2022 and diving more into how we run the business, which is on bookings and cash, bookings of $839.5 million, up 20% year-on-year. Cash flow from operations, $112 million and $59 million of free cash flow. Our DAUs hit $70 million, which is up 20% year-on-year. Total hours of engagement, 16 billion in Q3, which is up 20% year-on-year. And from a liquidity standpoint, over $2 billion of net liquidity and $3.1 billion of total cash equivalents and investments.
And finally, on a covenant adjusted EBITDA basis we hit $81 million. So let's talk a bit about our growth initiatives. This goes all the way back to our S-1 filing, which is connecting everyone around the world, a platform for every 1 of all ages, Roblox everywhere and a vibrant economy. On connecting the world, I just want to highlight, not just the growth in many really big future areas around the world, but also the monetization acceleration in these areas. Japan DAUs, up 66%, hours up 64%, bookings up 174%. Germany DAU is 27%, hours 30%, bookings up 75%. Brazil, DAUs 23% hours, 23% bookings, 62% and India, a huge opportunity for Roblox DAUs up 53%, hours 49%, bookings up 76%.
We continue to also show great progress in our vision that Roblox is a platform for everyone irregardless of age. On the DAU side, in our 13 through 16 cohort, we saw 22% growth, 17 through 24, 27% growth and 25 and up 25% growth on the DAU side, hours very similar growth, 13 through 16, 23%, 17 through 24, 29% and 25 and up hours of engagement up 28% year-on-year. On on our vision that Roblox is everywhere, and this goes to the vision that immersive 3D multiplayer in the cloud simulation that connects and helps people communicate should run on every device. We brought forward 2 new devices recently first Meta Quest, which as of October 31 had over 2 million lifetime installs and then Sony PlayStation, which we announced at our developer conference and launched on October 10, has had over 15 million downloads in October.
And our goal is really for Roblox to be everywhere. On the size of vibrant economy, we're innovating in many ways there, continuing to grow our monthly unique payers. We had 14.7 million average monthly unique payers in the quarter, which is a record. We have some really exciting innovative extensions to the platform coming. One is really in the vision of Roblox, giving our developers and creators, the tools to run their own business. We're going to be introducing subscriptions for developers, so their experiences can host subscriptions. We plan on launching that this month. Advertising, we're going to share a lot more at Investor Day but we are making amazing progress here. We've hired Stephanie Latham as our VP of Global Partnerships to help supercharge this business.
We've also, in addition to portal and image ads started testing video ads in Q4 and looking for a launch of that in 2024, we'll share more of this at Investor Day. On the overall product velocity and the background, we shared a lot of our 2024 vision at our developer conference in September, and those videos are all available online for anyone who's interested. A really strong pipeline of great innovation on some of the big things we've been working around, which include voice and Avatar simulation to more and more host real-time communication.
Our voice via use for the quarter are now up 240% year-on-year. On Avatar side, we are now live with what we call UGC avatars, which is user-generated content for avatars, allowing the community to participate in the creation of Avatar, and we're now live with facial animation and over time, we expect all avatars on the platform to support real-time camera tracking and facial animation at our developer conference, we introduced a new platform called Robox Connect, which is a showcase of communication technology that will be open stores and shows off a set of APIs that allow creators to embed communication capabilities into their own experience, including on mobile, bringing the phone to join with friends.
And a couple of highlights. We'll touch more on Investor Day. On the AI side, we continue behind the scenes to more and more incorporate AI up and down the stack. And in addition to, of course, added capabilities like roadblocks, assistant, which we rolled out in October that you'll hear more about on Investor Day and Roblox, other ways of generating things. I think behind the scenes, I just want to highlight the efficiency that this is bringing us both on safety, on moderation. We're moving many of our moderation pipelines more and more to AI and this is simultaneously increasing quality as well as cost. And you can see that in our increased operating leverage.
Finally, just want to highlight that at Investor Day in a week, we'll be covering a lot more of this, and now I'm going to pass it over to Mike for some more discussion on our operating leverage. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining. I think Dave did a great job of covering the highlights. I just want to point out that it was another quarter of very solid growth, and that growth was accompanied with a management of the growth in expense in our business, in particular, our fixed costs, which we've been talking about for the last few quarters, which are personnel costs and infrastructure costs, both of those grew at a substantially lower rate this past quarter. And trust and safety grew at a lower rate than our bookings growth, which is something we had talked about and indicated what happened this quarter.
So we're quite happy with that. That provides quite a bit of operating leverage, and we see that -- we're now in a moment where we can see our operating costs growing at a rate that trails our top line growth, which is exciting and should provide a healthy operating leverage in the future. We'll talk more about that at Investor Day. I'm sure, on this call. And at the same time, we've now completed our Ashburn, Virginia data center. And so capital expenditures in the third quarter were down significantly from both last year and last quarter. And we now have enough capacity to handle even significant growth in traffic all of next year. So substantially less capital expenditures in 2024 than you've seen over the last 2 years, which is a good setup for not just operating leverage but also cash generation.
Finally, as we mentioned in our shareholder letter this morning, beginning next year in 2024, we intend to begin providing financial guidance. Typically, when we report our annual results each February, we will provide guidance for the ensuing full year and for the first quarter of that year. For each ensuing quarter, we will provide forward guidance for the next quarter and update our annual guidance. This is pretty standard fair. Thus, on our Q4 earnings call next February, we will provide guidance for the full fiscal year of 2024 and for Q1 of 2024.
In May of next year, we will provide guidance for Q2 of '24 and update the guidance for the full year and so on. We will guide on revenue, bookings, net income and margins. We believe bookings provides a timelier indication of trends in our operating results that are not necessarily reflected in our revenue because we recognize the majority of revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user. The change in deferred revenue constitutes the vast majority of the reconciling differences from revenue to bookings.
Since our first quarterly guidance will be for Q1 of 2024, we expect a question today about our views on consensus numbers for Q4 2023, the last quarter for which we will not provide guidance. And since we haven't provided any guidance information we just want to reflect that based on FactSet as of November 7, mean consensus for Q4 2023 is as follows: bookings of $1.065 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $173.2 million, which correlates to our calculation of covenant adjusted EBITDA and revenue of $809.3 million, while we are not going to provide formal guidance for Q4, we are comfortable with the consensus estimates for bookings and adjusted EBITDA.
Concerning consensus revenue, we want to remind everyone that revenue is much more complicated to forecast and model than our bookings. Paying users can buy both consumable and durable virtual goods, bookings related to consumable virtual goods are recognized essentially immediately while bookings related to durable virtual goods are recognized over the average life of a paying user, which is currently 28 months. The split between consumable virtual goods and durable virtual goods changes every month. In addition, the average life of a paying user can also change in any given quarter.
Finally, because of the deferral period in any given quarter, the revenue recognized has much more to do with prior bookings than with current bookings. Thus, for example, the growth in bookings over the past quarter will largely be reflected in our future revenues. And just as an example, I went back and looked at our bookings in the supplemental materials. If you think about the 28-month average life of a payer, that's about 9 to 10 quarters. So if you look at the growth rate of bookings over the last 9 to 10 quarters, you'll see that it is -- those growth rates are below the consensus revenue estimate, which is about 40%.
So we expect revenue in Q4 when we do the work on virtual versus consumable and the average life of a payer, assuming there's no change to that average life in Q4, we expect revenue in Q4 will be approximately $740 million to $750 million or a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 28%.
So with that, we're done with our opening remarks, and we welcome questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Tilchen from Canaccord Genuity. Congrats on the strong results. I was just wondering, exchange fees as a percent of bookings were down sequentially. I'm curious if there's anything onetime that drove that and just higher level, how you view continuing to reinvest in the developer community as you see leverage in other areas? Jason, we absolutely top priority is to continue to invest in the developer community. In fact, the strong results that you've seen over the last few quarters is a direct result of an explosion of creativity, new content, existing content being updated and upgraded appealing more and more to our user base. So top priority is to continue to invest in our developer community. The sequential decline is primarily related to an issue with our prepaid cards. So there was an ability and we can go through this in more detail if you want to get on a call with us one-on-one. But there was an ability until recently to actually buy Roblox at a discount through prepaid cards in certain currencies. And as a result, the bookings number and the DevEx number, the DevEx number was artificially inflated versus the bookings number.
The user would get an extra Roblox per dollar. We've now closed that and they're now getting -- they're not buying robots at the right price. That means they get slightly fewer Roblox, which means the DevEx related to those bookings is slightly lower. But going forward, that's that loophole effectively is closed, and we will continue to be driving lots of opportunities for developers to grow the overall dollars in the system and the percentage of the economics that they get. And we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, and happy to discuss it on this call as well. Yes. And as we highlighted at our developer conference, the growth rate of the top 10, the top 100 and the top 1,000 developers and this all continue to grow quite rapidly as far as their revenue. Great. It's really helpful. And just 1 quick follow-up. In the shareholder, you called out bookings growth really strong in Western Europe and East Asia. Just curious if there was any underlying drivers of that performance that stood out in the quarter? Across the Western Europe and East Asia, we have a few benefits that are really pushing the bookings growth rate. Number one, we have payer cohorts that are getting -- that are more and more seniority, and we know over time, as payer cohorts are on the platform for longer periods of time, they tend to monetize better. And so a lot of those payer cohorts are really hitting their stride in terms of maturity. Those are wealthy countries, so they have a lot of purchasing power. And so we've done very well there. We have seen lots of new content that has popped up in those markets. And so lots of growth there. And we're really growing across all ages in Western Europe and East Asia from -- all the way from the youngest users on the platform to aged up users. I want to highlight also core technology, less on the monetization side and more on the user engagement side is also underlying some of this, the quality of our platform in Japan has increased rapidly over the last few years. We highlighted semantic search and some of the other things we've been doing there. So this is also a result of product quality and the quality of our automatic translation system. Your next question comes from the line of Bernard McTernan from Needham & Company. Great. Maybe just to follow up on the last one. You guys have been talking about Japan for a couple of quarters now. Are there other kind of wealthy underpenetrated countries out there that is next on the list to target? Well, [indiscernible] Spain, Italy I mean all throughout Western Europe, France, they're all growing really dramatically. And as you know, Bernie, it's less about an immediate target. If it's more about an organic growth that's driven, as Dave said, by great product technology, the fact that translation and search are better, the fact that there's a local developer community sprouting up in those marketplaces. So it's organic and it's just -- and we believe, very sustainable because it's organic. And so we're targeting really users around the globe, including more and more users in the U.S., Canada and markets that we're already very strong in. But with the countries in Western Europe and East Asia, just are showing particularly strong growth and very healthy monetization. And highlighting when we talk about product quality in Japan, that's platform-wide product quality, not Japan-only product quality. And that goes all the way down to raw product performance on low-end devices, for example, which can help accelerate countries like India, search can help accelerate all countries. So really, we target the platform as a whole generally. Understood. And then just on the cost-saving initiatives and talking about internal efficiencies. Especially in infrastructure, obviously, you guys are doing a great job pushing on that. It feels like this from the shareholder letter, the commentary that there might be maybe more to do, you're discovering that there's more to do. Is that the right read, especially in infrastructure, just we see internal efficiency initiatives. It sounds like it might be a broader push than just growing it below bookings, but I just wanted to double click on it. I want to highlight a couple of efficiencies that we actually get from a quest for quality as opposed to a quest for raw efficiency. More and more as our safety platform moves to AI. It's been driven by a quest for just increasing the quality of everything we do around safety and moderation. A byproduct of that is a lot of efficiency. I think on the infra side. As we get into a high level of resilience that gives us a lot more room going forward to grow without a lot of CapEx. So some of these are are less discoveries than natural evolution. And maybe just add for 1 last thing to that. The growth rate we had to build into -- through COVID was so significant that we made a decision to invest heavily and aggressively and we're happy that we did. And obviously, the platform and the scale of the platform is much, much larger and much more capable than it was before. But now we're sort of through that that macro adjustment of hyper hyper growth that the economy took when we started when the pandemic started, it should be much more rational and reasonable and predictable growth and that allows us to invest and be more efficient really throughout the income statement and the balance sheet. I want to highlight 1 other nuance on efficiency, and this gets into what we're doing on voice, safety and voice moderation. We're doing very sophisticated work to help with voice safety and stability, and we're doing this on our own infrastructure. And there's incredible efficiency by using the same infra that we use for real-time 3D simulation of all of our players using that exact same inference for voice safety. Your next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky from Bank of America. I actually wanted to double-click a little bit more on this infrastructure question because the numbers are quite remarkable. So if I just look at your results, it looks like your hours in the third quarter, your total engagement hours were up 15%, but your infrastructure cost per hour was down 18%. So that's pretty strong and your infrastructure costs came in well below my estimates. So is there -- are there any onetime events that caused this very high cost savings on that line -- and how should we think about your infrastructure cost per hour kind of going forward? Do you -- would they be at a similar rate as they were in this quarter? Or will they kind of come back up to where they were in the second quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Omar, actually feel the onetime event has happened in the past, which was on core data centers a fair amount of CapEx to build out resiliency, and we're through that now, and we have resiliency on core data centers on edge data centers where we run simulation. Once again, we've got great efficiency there on that capacity. So I don't think there's a forward event real. I think we've done a lot of that in the past. Yes. And then Omar, as it relates to in the first thing, you had a comment about power is growing at 15%. I want to make sure I understood that. I think the hours grew at 20%. But just a... I'm just talking about quarter-on-quarter, Mike. Quarter-on-quarter, your hours were up 15%. Yet, your cost per hour was down 18% quarter-on-quarter. Okay. Understood. So we're going to show some more data at Investor Day. But 1 of the factors is what Dave just talked about, which was investment building a lot of capacity, not unlike building a factory or anything else now absorbing that capacity. The second 1 is challenging the team to focus on a cost-to-serve target that declines over time and to get more efficient as an engineering organization and they've done an incredible job, and we believe have plenty in front of them, and they're going to continue to drive down this metric of cost per 1,000 hours served.
So we actually see continued leverage in the infrastructure line to answer your question, and that should be reflected in the future in lower numbers as a percentage -- on the income statement, lower numbers as a percentage of either bookings or revenue. Okay. Awesome. Okay. And then maybe just focusing on sort of your top line in your guidance. What was it that increased your confidence in your ability to guide accurately as compared to, let's say, 3 to 6 months ago? Well, I want to do a shout out to the whole financial modeling team. We've always had a fair amount of confidence in our ability to model the future. So this is less about confidence. Mike, maybe can comment to the real world. Well, first of all, Mark, you said the existing guidance. So we haven't given any guidance yet. We're going to guide for the fourth quarter. I merely commented on Q4. A number of reasons. There's certainly demand. We talked to a lot of investors who would really like a deeper insight into our forecasting and the best way to do that is through guidance. And I think having gone through such a a big cycle of COVID and coming out of COVID and the big investments that we've made. And now with margins and operating leverage coming out the other side, it actually does become easier to have that conversation and show people the models going forward. So I think it will be a healthy dynamic for everybody. Yes. I want to highlight the complex, not really complexity, but the breadth and the scope of our vision internally. We're building a platform that is connecting people around the world in a bunch of different regions and different countries, a bunch of different age groups and more and more moving to several economic models that support that virtual currency, advertising and more to come. And then on top of that, we have complexities on the GAAP revenue side, as Mike mentioned, as far as the deferred revenue. It's a fairly broad ambitious vision, and we think guidance can help that complexity. Your next question comes from the line of Clark Lampen from BTIG. I have a question on average spending rates. You guys highlighted a number of products throughout the prepared remarks that seem whether in the late stages of, I guess, sort of prerelease or early release right now that seem likely to be accretive to spending. Are we at a point now where maybe those products selectively can offset some of the mix shift headwinds to monetization we see from international expansion and maybe average spending from here sort of lift going forward. That's question one. Clark, good to talk to you. First thing I would like to highlight that in the third quarter of '23, so the average payer monetized at [ $19.02 ] over the quarter, which was up from [ $18.11 ] the prior Q3. So monetization on a payer basis has been creeping up over the last few quarters on a year-over-year basis and is basically catching up to those peak moments in the pandemic when monetization was incredibly high. Overall, if you look at it on a DAU basis, some of the discussion around the prepaid cards that I mentioned earlier has been a bit of a drag on it. So I think we'll work through that as well. So yes, I do believe I'm strongly optimistic about monetization.
Overall, in addition, we -- as Dave just highlighted, the platform is built now 70 million daily active users with a virtual economy that is very large and growing at a very healthy clip. And it is set up, as we've always talked about and it goes back to when we went public, that we will grow the virtual economies or vibrant economies on top of our platform, including advertising and other things that we'll talk about at Investor Day, those things as they funnel in, obviously, will also move monetization up materially. So we're pretty excited about that. So overall, as we look at monetization, whether it's per user or per payer, we like the trends that we're seeing right now.
There's a little bit of a talk track sometimes about the geographic mix shift, which I think is what you're getting at. I just want to remind everybody that in the U.S. and Canada, as an example, as users grow in terms of older users, they monetize better. There's a mix shift going on even in our core. And so even with a younger user base, where monetization and bookings are growing more slowly, we are definitely seeing a positive mix shift to older users who do spend more. So it is not necessarily the case just because other markets are growing faster it has to have a detrimental effect on the rate of bookings per user or per payer. And overall bookings growth is really what we focus on. Understood. You talked about economy changes. Also, it looked like there were some adjustments that were made to sort of packaging and then the Roblox per unit of currency values earlier this quarter. Could you talk about maybe how those packages are going to sort of affect the user and developer community, if at all? And maybe secondarily, how could those changes, I guess, impact the P&L moving forward. Yes, I just want to highlight you may be seeing small experiments that we're constantly running on the economy. We don't have any big plans for a massive economy shift, consider these nudges right now. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler from Roth MKM. A couple of things on advertising. First, I imagine it's very small, but were there any advertising contributions in the third quarter? There were, and you're correct, they were very small. I do want to do a little bit of a preface to Investor Day. While the actual ad revenue was pretty small, there is a vibrant economy around brands and the content that brands are publishing on the platform. And there is a virtual economy related to brands just like there's a virtual economy -- the virtual economy around brands is integrated into our virtual economy overall. So while the ad dollars themselves were small, they're already contributing to the platform. Great. And then maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here, and you'll talk more next week, but now that you're testing video advertising, when I look at sort of the suite that you have for advertising, I imagine the digital billboards are probably the low end in terms of pricing. You've got this unique concept with portals and now you have video, can you maybe talk about the value proposition of those 3 buckets? Yes. I'm going to take a step back on the visionary value proposition and then we can paint a picture a year or 2 out and back into it. And once again, this is no promise of product delivery or any future revenue. But the vision really is ultimately what we do in real life, for example, hanging out with friends at a shopping mall, going into various locations, browsing, trying on and literally buying is going to be fully replicated on our platform. And ultimately, that buying behavior will go to both virtual goods as well as Sunday physical goods as well. And this will all happen on the Roblox platform. So advertising is a great way for brands. And we've mentioned some of our great partners, Gucci Vans, Nike, and whatever to bring essentially friends traffic to their 3D virtual destination where people can interact with the brands, watch videos, try stuff on and then ultimately by virtual and physical goods. So we actually think the advertising is just the first step to really a fully closed-loop long-term shopping solution. And Eric, just a quick comment because we're going to cover this more on Investor Day and Cristina who runs this business at Roblox, will talk more about it. You're really talking about portal ads and video ads and there are going to be more than 1 type of video ads. So we're going to talk about multiple products. I wouldn't underestimate the value of video ads. Portals are very interesting and unique. We also have a massive user base and a very interesting age demographic that's highly, highly engaged. So we really see value for brands and to look at various products on the platform. Ultimately, we're incredibly excited about portals, and we've seen good activity. And when brands engage at that level where they have their own persistent experiences, it really is a base for a lot of other interesting engagement and monetization in the future. But there's a real breadth of products. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross from Lightshed. You recently launched on a couple of new platforms, including Sony PlayStation. We're just wondering if there's any way to size the impact from those type of launches on DAU or an engagement. And if there's an update on any more platforms to come? And then I have a follow-up. I would say we wouldn't share any platform by platform engagement estimates. I think it's safe to say it's doing better than we expected. And I think the reason it's doing better than expected as we have so much amazing content that is already running on phones, tablets, computers, other console that that's really just an accelerant of that existing content with a new destination. And actually, Brandon, I would add to that. It's also a little bit more of Meta Quest loss. So those people on the network can connect to other people on phones and desktops and other things. And so we are seeing an impact that maybe we can't just explain with a discrete view of what's happening on on PlayStation. It's really the benefit that we're seeing all over. But we're going to talk about download numbers next week and everything. They're very strong and very healthy. So we're super excited about it. But I think it's sort of multiplicative. And on future platforms, the vision would be immersive 3D multiplayer communication and connection technology ultimately should run on any form factor on any device. Great. And then on the DevEx. Just to clarify from earlier, was it the loophole that made Devex only 20% of bookings in the quarter? And then like generally on DevEx, how are you thinking about your profit and cash flow generation of the leverage and kind of cost control versus giving back to the Dev community, kind of what goes into that decision? And how will advertising affect that? So there's a lot in that question. So first and foremost, our goal is to continue to push high growth in DevEx to the community. The investment that we make there is why we have great content and growing content. And so we're always looking for ways to grow that overall our desire, Brandon, on leverage and cash flow is really to leverage the efficiency in our fixed cost, which is around headcount and infrastructure. Those are the primary fixed cost in the business. Generally, over the last few years, as COGS as we have seen efficiency in COGS, we tried to share those pretty much dollar for dollar with the community, and that's been really effective. And so historically, if you look back 3 or 4 years, the DevEx rates were quite a bit lower than they are today. So we're in a much more sustainable place and an ability to continue to push more of those economics to the developers. As we open up the economy, things like advertising, we fully intend for the community to participate in those economics. And so we're really excited about the scale and the growth and the ability to continue to invest in it because that's really what's driving the flywheel. It's content and users and that investment that we make pays back. So we're always trying to grow it. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost from Morgan Stanley. Maybe I'll start with 1 for Dave and then 1 for Mike. Just on the AI tools, you mentioned the moderation pipeline shifting more in that direction and then a lot of exciting use cases for those new tools. Are you still on track to build everything you're planning to build from an AI perspective on open source or from scratch? And is that from a CapEx and headcount perspective, is that fully baked in to kind of your view from here? Yes. I think we have so much breadth in the AI. We've highlighted we've got 70 ML pipelines running right now inside the company that goes all the way from our safety systems, moderation systems, real-time translation systems gets into our search and discovery systems and then get into more of the user-facing things like Roblox assistant. I think the big takeaway is we want to run super high volume in print, for example, voice as much as possible on our own hardware so we can do this extremely efficiently. And I would highlight on our edge data centers using as much as possible the same hardware to run inference. It gives us the ability in parts of the world that are not as active to use for inference.
As far as the collection of tools we're using, I would say, generally, yes, the [indiscernible] open source, markets in a really interesting time as far as what people are building and training and tuning and distilling and optimizing internally, and we're building a full AI internal platform that many of our teams will then use for high-performance inference. And then for Mike, I just want to revisit the goal of $800 million of DevEx that you guys mentioned last quarter. I think in order to hit that versus consensus, you need to do 26% of bookings at DevEx next quarter. I guess are you reiterating that $800 million target? So I think we've talked about this Mat many, many times. So it would be unlikely for us to hit $800 million this year. But if you look at what we are accomplishing this year, it's a massive pool of capital that has grown at very high rates over the last few years, and we're super excited about what we are delivering to developers this year just like we're excited with the top line growth in the business and the operating margins of the business. So incredibly proud of the numbers that we're printing and incredibly proud of how the developers are sharing in that, and we're going to continue to drive efficiencies across the business, and that's what we're going to focus on. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Maybe 2 that are sort of follow-ups to topics we've talked about and hopefully not front running next week. But to put a finer point on it, when you think about the developer community and lining up platform investments to meet the needs of the developer community, your highest priority items as you move out of 2023 and into 2024? And then to come back on the infrastructure investment, is there a way to think about capacity utilization in your data center network and how much excess capacity you have right now to better understand engagement growth and filling that capacity to where CapEx could be coming in under expectations like now versus a more normalized trend longer term? Yes, I'm going to go really tough on 3 points. On core data centers, I want to highlight just our intra platform teams ruthlessly improving quality efficiency performance of all of our componentry there to really squeeze out as much as we can on the cost side. Also on our cloud expenses, we're being very, very thoughtful there, moving as much cost internally as possible. On the edge capacity just highlighted ability to run inference on same grid where we run real-time simulation, so we could run more and more inference for super, super low cost. So a little bit of a vision there as well. And Eric, I'm not going to give you a direct number on capacity, but I would suggest to you that our capacity has quite a long way to go. It's not through 2024 for sure before we would have to start thinking about adding capacity. So we're in a really comfortable place right now We have time for 1 more question, Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. This is Jim on for Tom. Just a quick 1 on cost of revenue. So we've seen the shift toward bookings through lower fee channels. I guess, can we sort of talk about -- has that trend continued? And how should we think about modeling like leverage in that line going forward? I'll go first to really high level and then Mike, you talked about modeling. You're highlighting more of the complexity, once again, consumable durable different mix shift. As an example, developer subscriptions on the platform over time with some of our partners may have different COGS than other type of Robux purchases, which bodes well for COGS. Our prepaid business bodes well for COGS as well. Mike, may talk more about the mix shift? Yes. Tom. So we've definitely been able to provide some leverage over time. There are some interesting areas where we could dive in. But generally, our real focus in operating leverage right now is infrastructure and personnel, and we're doing a really good job there. And those are numbers that will, I think, drive the vast majority of margin improvement over the next few years -- next couple of years at least. We're going to talk more about that at Investor Day. I think you're comfortable modeling COGS at about where they are today for now. That's a -- that's a fairly safe bet. And think about operating leverage coming more from from people costs and from infer costs. Those are much more in our control. I will now turn the call over to Stefanie for closing remarks.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our Q4 and full year 2023 earnings call. It's great seeing or hearing or talking with all of you, and it was great seeing you all at Investor Day.
We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong full year 2023, consistent with the outlook we made at Investor Day. Some highlights in Q4: Our DAU $71.5 million, up 22%; hours engaged, 15.5 billion, up 21% year-on-year; revenue, $749 million, up 30% year-on-year; and bookings $1.1 billion, up 25% year-on-year. It was our first quarter over $1 billion in bookings and also our highest quarterly growth rate in 2 years. For the full year and fiscal year 2023, DAU is up 22%, hours up 22%, revenue up 26% and bookings of $3.5 billion, up 23% year-on-year.
We continue to invest in innovation and simultaneously invest very thoughtfully in the growth rate of those investments. And at our Investor Day, we discussed thoughtfully balancing the growth rate with our investments, both in cost of revenue, infrastructure expense, people and capital expenses.
And we're pleased to share that in Q4, we delivered net cash flow from operations of $143 million, up 20% year-on-year. Strong net liquidity of $2.2 billion, and our covenant adjusted EBITDA was $259 million. Mike will talk about the balance of our investments and the management of our margin targets.
I want to highlight going all the way back to our S-1, our 4-dimensional growth strategy, including all ages, international Roblox everywhere and a vibrant economy. And in all 4 of these dimensions, we made great progress on all ages. Our 13 and over DAUs grew 28% in the last quarter and over 58% of our DAUs are now 13 and up. And these older DAUs are interesting and exciting for the advertising business that we're building.
Our growth continues to be the result of innovation and investment in the platform as well as our amazing creator community. On the international side, DAUs in the U.S. and Canada grew 17%. DAUs outside of the U.S. and Canada grew 23%.
A couple of highlights in Q4. Japan DAUs, 45%. India Q4 DAUs up 59% year-on-year. This growth, we believe, is supported by our international expansion playbook, including a foundation of safety and stability automatic AI-powered language translation. So all of the content our creators create can run around the world.
Our infrastructure, including edge data centers around the world to supply performance and reliability, great content developers popping up all around the world, and continued innovation here. On Monday, we announced that our own AI model is powering real-time AI chat translation, allowing people around the world to communicate with people who are chatting in a different language.
On Roblox everywhere, in Q4, we released Roblox on PlayStation and on Meta Quest, both of them attracted new users and continued on our vision that we want Roblox everywhere. In our vibrant economy expansion, in Q4, we delivered developer subscriptions. We're moving consistent with the vision of everything is creator-driven. Our Avatar platform, to full UGC. And quick update on our advertising initiative. We had the most brand engagements ever in Q4, 69 great brands working with the platform, and we're scaling up over 2024.
A couple of highlights on innovation that we're building on top of all of this. On our social side, we're connecting more friends all the time. On -- we released real names for 17 and up players. We released video capture -- or sorry, image capture now. He hinted where we might go there someday.
On the immersive communications side, we saw great growth in our voice DAUs. Voice DAUs are up 161% year-over-year, which is just highlighting our vision of Roblox connecting and really acting as a connection and communication platform. We -- on the avatar front, we continue to make progress in immersive connected avatars in addition to layered clothing, we released this year, and we're seeing more penetration on facial animation everywhere.
We are seeing more penetration on voice chat. And a hint of what's to come at our Roblox Developer Conference, we hinted around the use of our own AI to generatively create avatar. The AI opportunity at Roblox is manifest and everywhere. We've been working on this behind the scenes for many, many years.
On the more visible generative side, we have announced Roblox Assistant, which is now in beta, where creators can use natural language text prompts to generate new ideas, in addition to code assist and material assist. Behind the scenes, we continue to roll out more and more AI on real-time image voice and chat moderation, which, in addition to constantly improving quality, is also making our whole safety platform much more efficient.
Looking forward, we will continue on our path of innovation and execution. Consistent with what we shared with you at Investor Day in 2024, we are driving growth and engagement in DAUs. We are relentlessly focusing on the leverage we gain from raw performance, quality and cost to serve efficiency. We are focused on accelerating monetization through advertising in our virtual economy. We are using AI both in, once again, the user-facing generative way to accelerate creation and expression, but also behind the scenes for cost and quality.
And underlying this always since day 1 is our focus on safety and civility from the start of our platform to really just stay forward. And we continue to be optimistic about our mission to connect 1 billion people every day with optimism and stability, not just in gaming, but in entertainment, ultimately in shopping, ultimately in social communication and ultimately in learning and education where we're making amazing progress as well.
With that, I'm going to pass it over to Mike Guthrie, our CFO. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Just a few quick comments before we open it up to your questions.
So obviously, we're pleased with the '23 results. I'm going to reference our supplemental materials, which are on the IR website, ir.roblox.com, and some of the charts there. So on bookings, as Dave said, Q4 $1.127 billion, that's 25% growth year-over-year. Strength across all geographies, which you can see on Page 18.
Expense growth. In particular, compensation and infrastructure are 2 big fixed costs, on Pages 12 and 13, you can see are growing at a slower rate than bookings growth, and that's yielding healthy operating margins and more cash flow from operations. Cash from operations on Page 19, you can see the growth there and how we saw good growth year-over-year, both in Q3 and in Q4. And then reduced capital expenditures are yielding significantly higher free cash flow.
I want to now address some seasonality, which I think will help people with their models. We're really starting to see good seasonality in the business. And really in '22 and '23, we're through COVID comparisons as you can really start to see things more clearly.
On bookings, back to Page 17, normally, Q1 is down from the Q4 of the prior year, the holiday season. Q1 and Q2 are pretty similar in terms of overall bookings, with a slight uptick in Q2. And then we see very good sequential growth in Q3 with the summer, and then a big sequential jump in Q4 for the holidays and then again, back down a little bit in Q1 of the next year. So that's normal seasonality on bookings, and you can really see that.
On Page 19, you can start to see our cash flow from operations and the seasonality around cash from operations. Let me just talk a little bit about that. Note that Q1 is normally the highest cash from operations rather than Q4, which is the highest in bookings. And the reason for that is simply working capital. We had a working capital buildup in Q4 when holiday bookings are the highest, and then there's a big release of that with post-holiday collections. And so Q1 tends to be our highest cash flow from operations.
On Page 36, looking at covenant adjusted EBITDA. It's a little bit different than cash from operations because the difference is actually that change in working capital. And therefore, the seasonality around covenant adjusted EBITDA tracks much more with normal bookings. So Q1 is lower because we don't have the working capital benefit.
Q2 goes down a little bit because we tend to grow the top line, but also invest a little bit, and we have some amount of fixed cost growth. And then Q3 and Q4, covenant adjusted EBITDA tends to pick up with growth in summer bookings and then, of course, hits its peak in Q4 with peak holiday bookings. And free cash flow, we'll start to see more seasonality -- normal seasonality as long as CapEx sort of matches and flows throughout the course of the year, which we think it will.
Some other quick callouts. Dave talked about DAU growth and hourly growth, great numbers, both overall and across all geographies and with older users. I do want to call out monetization. Our bookings per DAU, which you can see on Page 26, was up 3% overall. And on Page 27, it was up across most of the regions around the world. And then on Page 28, monthly unique payers hit an all-time peak in the fourth quarter. And a big call out -- our bookings per monthly unique payer was the highest of any Q4 and actually, of course, the highest in the history. And that number was up nicely over the same number this time last year. Our share count grew by about 3.7%.
Let's talk a little bit about guidance, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We are obviously guiding to GAAP revenue and GAAP net loss. These are going to be a little bit difficult for you to get exactly right because of the waterfall of the deferred and the factors that go into determining that number. So those are the natures of goods purchased, whether it's a consumable or a durable and then the life of a paying user. We're also guiding on a non-GAAP basis to bookings and adjusted EBITDA.
Now you're all familiar with bookings. This quarter, we're guiding to adjusted EBITDA, and that calculation differs from what most of you referred to as adjusted EBITDA in your Roblox models. What most of you are referring to is covenant adjusted EBITDA.
So just to clarify, again, the difference between covenant adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back that net charge of deferrals. And so that's what most of you are modeling to. So when you see the adjustments, and you'll see in our releases, you have to add back the deferred to get what's in your models as adjusted EBITDA.
Margin guidance, about 100 to 300 basis points. We talked about this at Investor Day. That means, year-over-year by quarter and for the full year. So when we have variance in margin, that's okay. We're going to show margin improvement in each of those quarters and then overall.
So for example, many of you in your margin expectations for Q4, we're at about 18%. We generated about 23%. And for us, that compares to 20.3% last year. So it was about a 270-basis-point increase in the fourth quarter. And then for the full year, consensus estimates were about 10% for '23. We produced 12.3%. So that's about 230 basis points of improvement.
Now for the full year, and then I'll stop and let you ask questions. For the full year, the midpoint of our margin guidance would suggest 13.4% or 110 basis points higher than where we were last year. And the high end implies about 14% or 170 basis points.
And for Q1, the midpoint is about 8%, which is also 110 basis points higher than where we were last year in Q1, again, just the seasonality and the change in margins. And the high end implies 8.3% or about 140-basis-point improvement.
So with that, why don't we turn it over to questions. Yes. And just highlighting 2 growth rates. Q4 bookings growth, 25%. Fiscal year bookings growth, 23%.  So thanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. I wanted to get a sense of how much the developer layoffs in the video game industry could potentially be a tailwind for you in 2024. Some industry experts estimate that over 10,000 workers lost their jobs in the video game industry in 2023.
And Kotaku reports that over 6,000 have already lost their jobs in January, including 2,000 from Microsoft. And I was wondering, did you notice more mobile app and PC console game developers than usual joining the Roblox developer community in Q4 or in January so far? And what is Roblox doing in 2024 to attract some of that video game industry talent to your ecosystem? And then I have one quick question after that. Two ways to talk about this. First, we continue internally within the company to hire throughout this year. Also, over really all of the last years, all the cohorts of the creators on Roblox have continued to grow and make more money, whether it's the top 10, top 100 or top 1,000.
So what you're asking has already been in place for several years. And as we grow bookings, we grow the economic opportunity on our platform. So we believe naturally, irrespective of the layoffs, our creator community will continue to grow. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Tilchen with Canaccord Genuity. I'm curious -- with the really strong bookings growth in Q4, I'm wondering to whatever extent you can share about upside that was driven by advertising? And then just more higher level, where do you stand today in terms of building out some of those additional capabilities and measurement tools you talked about at the Investor Day? I'll go high level on that, Mike. We have a plan throughout this year to add more ability for our partners to measure and see what's going on, on the platform. We had real bookings in Q4. We have a quarterly target for advertising within the company. We're not sharing the splits, but we are very focused on this year maturing the size of that market. Jason, we said in the past that we're going to start disclosing specific financial data on advertising when it becomes material and really important to the financial results. And so while we're really pleased with the progress, we have not hit that point yet. Next, we'll go to the line of Brian Pitz with BMO Capital Markets. While you continue to make progress aging up the user base, this does remain one of the biggest questions from investors. What do you attribute as being the biggest factor in attracting and retaining older users? Is it the higher quality or is it different content?
And then as you look at the audience, I'm really curious about how the different age cohorts are engaging differently on the platforms. It'd be really great to hear more in terms of gameplay and spending habits between the different age cohorts. First on how do we do this, I want to highlight, we have been doing this for 2, 3 or 4 years already. And in several years back, the vast majority of people on our platform were under 13. So seeing the growth over 13 is a really good sign.
We attribute it to such a wide range of things: quality of the platform, search and discovery, organic growth of new older players, existing players retaining and aging up. We do see play habits generally of older players that might mirror what we see in existing gaming and communication markets. We can see certain cohorts that might lean in for a longer engagement on a PC type experience. We can see other cohorts that lean in socially on mobile.
So the good news is we are seeing patterns on Roblox that mirror really large markets: the overall gaming market, the overall social communication market. And we're -- no specific thing, many, many things all contributing to both, I would say, retention-based growth as well as viral new player growth around the world. Brian, just to add to Dave's comments. Yes, we've been -- the growth in older users has been higher than the growth in younger users for a long time. It's the majority of the user population today. In terms of behavior, and that has been just consistent quarter after quarter after quarter. In terms of behavior, in addition to Dave's comments about engagement, the older users do tend to monetize a bit better on sort of a like-for-like basis, meaning cohorted by time spent on the platform. So over the long run, that is generally a boost to monetization. I want to highlight, one can qualitatively see the expansion of content that intuitively would seem appealing to older players, both in maybe the realistic battle genre in the fashion and dressing genre. I tweeted to highlight some of these properties. Next, we'll move to the line of Clark Lampen with BTIG. I've got 2, 1 for Dave, 1 for Mike. Dave, the network effects that you talked about in the shareholder letter, is it possible to contextualize for us how much of your user base is either utilizing the voice tools or maybe some of the more recent text translation and how much that affects behavior?
And Mike, the uptick in bookings per DAU growth that we saw this quarter, should we expect that to continue? And if so, are the recent releases or maybe economy items that are in pipeline that you'd highlight for us amongst the drivers? I will -- I don't have in front of me the voice DAU number. I do -- I shared 161% voice DAU growth year-over-year in the quarter. Our internal metrics when we look at users who are using voice show lovely gains on retention, on engagement and on other aspects. So there is a network effect in that the more of our base that is using voice, we see other metrics go up at the same time. And Clark, on the bookings per DAU question, I'm going to be focused primarily -- we will be focused primarily on bookings and bookings growth. If DAUs happen to grow a little bit faster, then that number might come down a little bit. If they happen to grow more slowly, that number will go up a little bit.
On the other hand, I will say the economy team at Roblox has more compelling initiatives going on than I've ever seen. And so I'm certainly excited and optimistic about the ability to continue to improve monetization.
I would also look at that number generally again, just make sure seasonality, just compare like periods to like periods for the most part. Next, we'll move to the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. I want to go back to the advertising, and I understand that it's too early to quantify. But could you give us a sense of kind of the key signposts we should be looking for as you develop the opportunity, whether it'd be market research or case studies with brands? And -- how do you think about the -- how should we think about your -- the development of your direct sales force? Where are you in the build-out of that process? And are you ready to go to market? Yes, I'll share the signpost one might watch. We shared anecdotally the just rough growth in the number of brands advertising on the platform. This year, you'll see, from a platform point of view, more and more measurement abilities for our partners to attribute brand advertising. We have shared that we are also building experiments with physical shopping, but no ship date on that, that we think will ultimately create a full closed-loop effect for advertisers on the platform.
As Mike said, we're not sharing specific numbers on the development. In Q4, we hired Stephanie Latham, who's driving just an awesome team. And we're growing out that brand partnership team to go to market. I just met with them all yesterday actually. And it's an amazing team.
Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything on top of that? No, I was going to say the same thing. Both Dave and I had the opportunity to address the new and emerging organization. So it's growing, new people all the time, very talented, very excited.
And Ken I think one of the main points of this is what are the best ways to show signposts as we get to that revenue level that will become material? And so we'll continue to come back on that. Right now, it's a sheer number of engagements is the right way to look at it.
And Dave talked a little bit about the number of brands that started to work with us in Q4. And the quality of them and the depth of the engagement is fantastic. So we'll be talking more about that in subsequent quarters. Next, we'll move to the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. I want to know if we go a little bit deeper on your updated thoughts on some of the more emerging platforms, elements of augmented reality, spatial computing platforms like the Quest 3 and the Vision Pro from Apple? And how you think about continuing to widen out means of distribution and new experiences for users over the medium to long term? Really proud to be on Quest with Meta and along with PlayStation in Q4. Highlighting our vision that immersive 3D connection and communication should be on phones, tablets, computers, VR headsets, consoles. We can span the other platforms, where we're not on and those are all logical candidates. Vision Pro, obviously, is an interesting candidate. There are others out there that you all know about as well.
And I think looking way off into the future, we're excited about the really connection and communication things we're building out on our platform, including our open source Roblox Connect that shows up a lot of communication, APIs. And we're well aware that some of this communication may go beyond VR into MR and AR as these platforms become more prevalent. Next, we'll move to the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. So we saw that you introduced real-time chat translations on the platform recently. Any early learnings you can share there? And as you continue to push globalization of the platform and launch features that enhance localization, what would be the next milestone? Is it voice translation? And any sense of timing on that? Yes. Highlighting my tweet on Monday and our release that, I believe, right now between 16 languages, we're allowing real-time text chat translation. Always sitting on top, of course, our same safety civility back-end infrastructure.
This is the first step really to some of the dreams that we shared where a class in the United States might have a partner school somewhere overseas and be able to go visit them and communicate with them.
Also highlighting, this is our own model based on our own ML platform. We're behind the scenes. We're building out this AI platform to support both generative as well as stuff like this translation. And it's running on the same technology that allows translation of content as well.
Without any ship dates and leaning in on vision, 2 things. We're getting really good high-volume voice processing for safety and civility. Once again, on our own infrastructure, at low cost. And as you see, we're getting good at models that can drive real translation.
So you could project the overlap of those 2 Venn diagrams. And I think I tweeted once again on Monday, voice would be lovely someday, once again with our safe foundation. Next, we'll move to the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Mike, could you just talk a little bit about the full year 2014 guidance? How you think about the different mix of DAU growth and maybe spend per hour, even maybe spend per payer? Like what's the key metrics we should be watching for to see whether you overperform or come in line there? So Andrew, the forecast that we built internally are generally driven primarily by user growth. We tend to take a conservative assumption on engagement. We have relatively high engagement on the platform. So we don't tend to forecast meaningful increases in engagement per user, even though we have achieved those over time, but we just generally take a fairly conservative view.
We're relative -- we stay conservative on our conversion to payer numbers. And so we have tended to have a little bit of extra room there. And then in terms of monetization, we are fairly conservative improvements in monetization, but we do forecast some improvements that we have to achieve those.
As I mentioned earlier, we -- our economy team has a lot of things that are very -- so compelling opportunities to improve monetization. We tend to bake a fairly small number of those into the models. Those are available for upside. So generally, the models that we build internally and from which we yield our guidance are focused on user growth and continued user growth. Got it. And then just as a housekeeping question, on the covenant adjusted EBITDA, you're making no other adjustments there besides deferred revenue. So it truly is your historical adjusted EBITDA plus the change in deferred? That's correct. Yes, that's right. And on Page 36 in the supplemental materials, you can see that number. What look odd a little bit in the letter with the guidance as adjusted EBITDA is negative because the deferred is not in there. You have to add the deferred to that, and you'll be back to company adjusted EBITDA, which is normally the number that we're talking about. Next, we'll move to Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Mike, I think you alluded to this earlier, but your operating cash flow or your EBITDA to operating cash flow conversion has been running close to about 100%. Is that a good measure to think about for 2024 and beyond? And also how -- what is your CapEx expectations for the year? When you say free cash flow conversion -- the EBITDA operating cash flow conversion to restate that part of... Your covenant adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow conversion is pretty much right in line around 100%. Is that something... Yes, that's right. That's a good... It's just timing. That's right, Eric. It's just a timing difference, and it has to do with working capital and the timing of working capital. And it's most significant in Q1 and Q4. Q4, it's the buildup of working capital. And in Q1, it's the collection, the heavy collections that come in. So that -- those are the quarters where there is a big difference.
CapEx expectations this year are $180 million for the year. And I think in prior periods, we've indicated, some of that is related to real estate. It's not all infrastructure. So our infrastructure investments have come down pretty significantly. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you are -- now that margins are expanding, free cash flow is once again nicely positive, you have the high-quality problem of being on a position of having a good amount of excess cash, what's your view on the excess cash and sort of as you think about capital allocation? Well, I would say we're in a position to have a nice cash position. Whether or not it's excess for a company of our size is, I would say, it's kind of a matter of opinion. We like having a very strong balance sheet. We like having enough capital on hand where if we needed to do something or wanted to do something opportunistic, we could do that. We're also in a nice position where we continue to invest in the business, continue to grow and invest and we're doing that out of operations.
So for now, we like the balance sheet. We like where it is. We don't really look at it as a lot of excess cash. Our capital allocation is really investments in infrastructure and engineering and product. And we're able to do that out of the operating cash flow of the company. So that's a nice place to be. Next, we'll move to the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. One of the tools that you've introduced into the economy has been subscription. Just wondering if that's -- if you see that as an important monetization tool? And how that may impact developers' abilities to create new types of experiences?
And in general, when you roll a new tool out for developers, how long does it take for that to kind of be integrated into how developers create new experiences? Like what's the lag there? Yes. We're not breaking these numbers out, but subscriptions are very consistent with our vision of creating a platform where a lot of developers have optionality on how they monetize.
We saw a -- I don't know if we shared -- you can probably go in and figure it out what percent of the top 20 creators on the platform are now offering in-experience subscription, highlighting that we've seen good adoption amongst our creator base.
And these subscriptions allow an individual creator to create a recurring revenue stream, whether the user is using mobile payments or credit card or other recurring type payments. We believe this will contribute to long-term monetization on the platform. We're not sharing the breakout.
Mike, I don't know if you have any... No. We also think it will contribute to retention. And the developers, obviously, they're free to implement it as they want. I don't think there's -- Brandon, to your second question, I don't think there's any pat answer on time it takes developers to absorb things that we've created for them. They all will do that at their own pace based on how that -- they think that works for their own business. Ultimately, our job is to give them the visibility and the tools to build, and they roll them out as they see fed. And then obviously, Apple made some changes in the EU to App Store take rates and such. Does that impact you at all? A couple of highlights on this across all of our store partners, whether it's Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and others. One is all of the guidance we're giving is assuming no change in those systems. The second is they all continue to be great partners. Third is we are examining the EU ruling to see if it makes sense for us. And the fourth is we have always hinted that as much as possible any adjustment in future fees, we would want to distribute as much as possible both to our creator community and judiciously some to our bottom line. So if and when possible changes happen, we think that can help drive our creator community. We will move next to the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Great. Just 2 on bookings. First, the booking acceleration that happened in the U.S., just any thoughts in terms of what's driving that. Remember last year, there were some thoughts that there could been some outperformance last year because of gift cards, so if that played through in a similar way. And then 3 million new payers added in the quarter, where are those coming from, from a geo or age demographic perspective? And any shifts that are going on that are significant? Bernie, on the second question, no big geo shift. We're seeing strong payer growth really everywhere. Part of the reason monetization has gone up is older users in places like U.S. and Canada have grown at a really nice clip. And as we said earlier, they monetize a little bit better.
In terms of -- the question is, why was bookings so strong in the fourth quarter? We like to think it's growing our user base. They're more engaged. The content continues to get better and better. The platform continues to scale. We were on a couple of new platforms in the fourth quarter. So that clearly had an impact. But overall, a lot of the things, it continue to drive the growth of the business over a very long period of time. The math, with 58% right now of our DAUs over 13%. When we look at the overall market size of gaming, immersive communication and social connection, that 13 in over market, you can all do your own computation on the size of that TAM relative to the under 13, and that's why growth there is so important to us. Next, we'll move to the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. I have 2 probably both for Mike. So just on some of the expense lines. For the certain infrastructure, trust and safety, it got down to just a really high level of efficiency this quarter, 11% of bookings. I guess when you think about that internally, do you think about that figure on a per user basis, on a per hour basis, on a per dollar bookings basis? And how do you think about where that can go over time? And then I have a follow-up. I mean how we look at it on all of the above? Ultimately, it's cost to serve is the metric that we use and it's the metric that the team owns -- the infrastructure team owns. And so they're working hard to drive that down.
It is -- like you said, it's about 11% now. Ultimately, with higher efficiency, more use of artificial intelligence, we see that as a high single-digit number over the next few years. It's been a good source of leverage recently, and we still think there's more to do there. Great. And then on the developer exchange fees, you gave some good color just a few minutes ago about sort of reinvesting any savings on the cost of revenue side into DevEx. So that's clear. But just DevEx on its own, I think, was below 20% of bookings this quarter, very slightly for the first time in over 2 years.
I guess anything you can say about the drivers there. And then all else equal, do you expect it to still be a number that rises as a percentage of bookings, even if nothing changes on the app store fee side? Yes. I mean, DevEx is almost exactly where it was this time last year in the fourth quarter. So it's about 20 -- it's about 20% last fourth quarter, about 20% this fourth quarter. So I don't see a major change. There is some seasonality in that number. But overall, we always are looking to push more of the economics to the devs. Yes. Chiming in on what we shared 6 months ago on our Q2 2023 earnings call. The vision -- we want to grow bookings faster year-on-year than cost of goods. We want to grow bookings faster than infra and certain other expenses. And we want to grow bookings faster than personnel costs.
That leaves 2 areas, both our bottom line as well as our creators. And the more efficient we are with the first 3 things, the more we can look to possible future expansion on the last 2 margins, developers and our leverage. I think we probably have time for one more call. Today's final question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Maybe to come back to a question that was touched on in a bit of a different way earlier in the call. I know it's not necessarily an input for you guys rather than an output. But any particular drivers on the average bookings per DAU growth, particularly looking at Europe and rest of world? Both of which were still pretty strong and both accelerated in 4Q. The longer payers are on the platform and users are on the platform, the more they tend to spend. We have a very nice mix of older and younger users, with older users growing around the world. They tend to spend a little bit more. And you can never underestimate the importance of great content on the platform. So that's our developers building great stuff that people are paying for.
So it really is a trend that's been moving in the right direction for a while. And as I said earlier, our economy team has a number of initiatives that they're working on to continue to improve that number. Yes. And complementing that on the economy team angle, there's a lot of hygiene just on payment providers. I also want to highlight that on a biz dev sense, prepaid cards wherever we can around the world has also made enormous progress in the last year. Well, thank you for joining us today, and that's a wrap. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone, for joining the Roblox Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you. Hey, welcome all Roblox's investors, new investors and longtime investors, and we're pleased to be here with you to report on our Q1 2024 results. We continue on our mission to connect 1 billion people every day with optimism and civility around the world, and we'd like to report it on our progress.
In Q1, our DAUs came in at over 77 million daily people on our platform with year-on-year growth of 17%. Our over 13 DAUs were particularly strong, growth at 22% year-on-year. And we continue to highlight the growth of our platform around the world with Japan, which is a key gaming market growing at 50% year-on-year; and India, which is a huge market growing at 58% year-on-year.
Our hours' engaged grades were 16.7 billion in the quarter that's 15% year-on-year growth. And once again, very strong growth over 13 and very strong growth in countries around the world, including Japan and India. Revenue was $801 million, which is 22% year-on-year, and that was higher than our guidance range of $755 million to $780 million.
Our bookings were $923.8 million, which was in the middle of our guidance range of $910 million to $940 million, but I do want to highlight we wanted that number and expected that number to be higher, and we're going to dive into that a bit in a year. That represents 19.4% year-on-year bookings growth, and one of the big focuses that we've had, which is on our operating efficiency came to light with our cash and consolidated net loss.
Our net loss of $272 million based on GAAP accounting, was relatively flat with Q1 of last year. And our guidance was a net loss of $347 million to $342 million. So this was remarkably less of a GAAP loss than that. We continue to operate extremely efficiently and to manage our CapEx. Our cash flow -- net cash flow from operations in Q1 was $238 million, which was up 37% year-on-year. And our free cash flow in Q1 was up 133% at $191 million. This is 50% more free cash than we generated in all of 2023.
The past 3 quarters on infrastructure, trust and safety. Well, the platform performing better and better in all of these areas and the quality going up through the use of AI, internal efficiency, the way we've optimized our infra and our trust and safety, we've actually made huge efficiency gains there, and we've reduced these costs.
On the personnel side, we've been very thoughtful in how we're hiring and how we're growing our head count. We've been relatively consistent over the last 3 quarters and the size of our head count, while we continue to focus on growing our economy ads team, our AI safety team and our live operations events team.
I just want to highlight what we -- on the theme we started 3 quarters ago, which is getting bookings growing faster than other areas, we continue down that path. Once again, Q1 bookings 19.4%, trust and safety infrastructure, while increasing quality 4% less year-on-year and personnel at 20% growth. So we'll continue this.
So that -- but those of you watching us, you will see -- you can see that our bookings in Q1 grew faster than DAUs in hours. I want to make a few comments on this. First, we continue to see the general number of people on our platform being very strong. We don't report the number, but we did see less growth in Q1 that we expected, and we wanted to highlight where we believe this is coming from.
First off, we shipped a bunch of new tech in the second half of last year. We rolled out dynamic heads, layered clothing, anti-cheat, expanded voice, and we believe, especially in low-end Android, even near the end of Q4, we are starting to see some drag with this. This started to show up in Q1, and we spent the last 3 months analyzing and really improving this up and down the stack, and we'll talk about this a bit more.
The other thing is, we believe, once again, in the midst of a great Q4, our velocity of new content and our velocity of highlighting just the amazing amount of new content bubbling up on our platform was not optimal. And once again, over the last 3 months, we've made a lot of expansions and enhancements in our search and discovery system that we'll talk about with you.
We've also taken a lot of steps on live ops and content that we'll talk about, we've done a lot of stuff around our economy in the last 3 months. And I want to highlight, over the last -- really the last half of April and the first half of May, we've seen USA and Canada bookings, DAUs and hour growth come back to north of 20%.
Now that's not showing in our full Q1 numbers. And as for those of you that have read our letter, you will see that we are going to be more conservative on our guidance, primarily because we only have 3 weeks of data from these improvements. So we are going to be looking at lowering our guidance in 2024 a bit. Mike will highlight that.
That said, we have a lot of operating efficiency going on. We're not going to be changing our implied guidance on free cash flow for the year. And we'll continue going forward with conservative hiring growth once again in economy and adds, AI safety and content and live apps or live ops. And I also want to highlight internally our advertising plan, which we'll talk about a bit more is on track.
So hey, some more detail on discovery, we really have done a lot of work here over the last 3 months. And the highlight here is we're optimizing and want to be optimizing not just short-term improvements in bookings and DAUs, but long-term platform health as well.
For those of you that are watching our home page, you've seen over the last 3 months, an addition of curation to the homepage, which we call top picks. You've also seen that we've moved sponsored, which is for those creators who want to purchase traffic on our platform, start to be a much bigger share of impressions.
And we've also continued to make adjustments to our core ML algorithm as well. We believe over the last 3 months; this is increasing the discovery and velocity of new and upcoming content. And the mix of new creations on our platform is in a much stronger position than it was 3 months ago. And more to come there.
The other thing you've probably seen over the last 3 months is the first introduction of a more aggressive live ops philosophy. We ran The Hunt, our first live ops event of 2024 over the few weeks before and during Easter. And we saw an incredible engagement, a lot of reactivation there and we're going to continue this. The community loves the notion of bringing together all of the diverse content into a rolled-up event. For those of you interested in seeing the interest, if you look at my Twitter feed, I think I would say, I hinted at our next event. And this is probably by 2 to 3x, my most engaged tweet I've ever done.
On the -- on our virtual economy, I want to highlight that as we've gone to a UGC economy, our economy team has been hard at work, working through how to optimize both utility from our users as well as utility from our creators and utility from our platform. And in February, we launched dynamic price floors in our marketplace, which is really driven a much healthier economy as far as the pricing of those items.
And this is starting to contribute once again to that 20% last 3 weeks, U.S.A and Canada bookings growth that we've seen. We've also launched on the tooling side adjustments to our economy, we really want as many people creating as possible. And so in our creator store, we've just decided for all of the people building tools, plug-ins, message, images, fonts, 100% net proceeds to them because we -- there's really no need for us to try to make a profit there.
Finally, the long-term vision of everything in our marketplace being UGC, we call that UGC for all. Over the last few weeks, we have launched that. We've opened our market to more creators, it's a big step forward for brands to create Avatar's clothing and accessories as well as the rest of our creator community.
Highlighting on some of the work we've done around performance and quality, a lot of which showed up, especially in low-end Android devices, and we've been diving in on. There's been a huge focus on analyzing metrics and perf in a much more granular set of cohorts around the proof of our platform.
We have made significant frame rate improvements, we've made significant stability improvements, especially in our most difficult devices. Once again, that's low-end Android. Also on Windows as well. These results, some are directly measurable in DAUs and spend. And we've also enhanced the quality of graphics on higher-end devices.  So we believe -- also this effort, which we've really been heads down on has contributed to that last 3 weeks, U.S., Canada back to north of 20%.
On the advertising, which will not be material this year, and that's why we haven't shared the forecast. We are on track with our forecast. And we have done a few things that have been exciting in April. We announced our partnership with PUBMATIC in April. We did our first real-world shopping test with Walmart on April 29. We have a lot more of these tests rolling out.
And finally, on May 1, we announced that video ads would be available to all of our advertisers through self-serve on our ads manager, and we're really excited about the opportunity of video on Roblox in addition to our portal and site visit type units just because there's so much supply there.
On the measurement side, we've started the independent measurement, which is critical to our advertisers. We've had some really lovely results on that. We've brought in a brand less solution with KANTAR and our direct sales team has been attending events like play fronts and new fronts. We have had, by the end of this quarter, over 370 cumulative brand activations. And also, I just want to welcome more talent to our ad team on the engineering product on the live ops side. Could welcome David from Google, David Westby, who built a lot of engineering ad tech at YouTube.
On the creation side, for those of you that are tracking AI more and more we're seeing that data for training is critical. And there are some companies out there they have certain types of data that allows them to train, optimize this still and build their own AI solutions that really leverage our data. We have an enormous amount of data at Roblox. We have a lot of trust and safety data. We have a lot of people writing code and building 3D objects and creation data. And we're more and more starting to lean into really building our own AI platform built on this proprietary data in concert with all of our users.
So I want to just highlight a few of those things, we continue to roll out generative AI assistant tools on AI stacks that we've built. Earlier this year, we launched our Texture Generator, which is an AI tool to help creators efficiently text your objects. It's absolutely amazing. We rolled out in Q1 a tool we call Avatar Auto Setup, which we were in Open Alpha, I believe we went live yesterday or a day ago, which allows standard industry avatar models which are not necessarily ready for 3D simulation or facial animation to be automatically rigged and turned into full 3D interactive Roblox Avatars.
And finally, code assist is our own in-house code optimization and code generation tool. This continues to get better and better as well, and we have quotes from devs who are mentioning a 5% increase in efficiency, and this is still very early.
Finally, our safety platform, which has been the foundation of really everything we've done since we got started continues to get better and better. We're using AI up and down the stack as we've mentioned, we built and run on our own infrastructure, increasingly high-performance voice models that are helping us really keep all the voice on our platform safe, as well as using AI to help in the moderation of every asset type on the platform.
So [ Synopsis ], Q1, we saw less growth than we expected. That said, we exceeded our margins on cash flow targets the last 3 weeks in U.S. and Canada with all the work we've done in Q1, which is in response to this. We are back to north of 20% growth on bookings, hours and DAUs. But we want to be very transparent, conservative and responsible and that is why we made the very difficult internal decision to adjust our bookings guidance. And we believe we'll continue to deliver the same operating free cash flow that we implied in our guidance last quarter, while making judicious hiring in our economy AI content, live ops and safety groups.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike, and then we will have Q&A. Thanks, Dave. I just want to turn everyone's attention to Pages 24 and 25 in our supplemental materials, which are on the IR website. And just to reiterate a couple of things that Dave said.
So on a bookings number of about 19.4% growth, we continue to generate really good cash flow dynamics. On Page 24, you'll see cash from operations, this really reflects operating leverage primarily in infra, trust and safety, as Dave mentioned, more of using artificial intelligence, requiring less and less on manual moderation and also leverage across head count by keeping head count flat over the last 3 quarters.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was almost $240 million, up significantly over last year. Again, that's all-operating leverage. Also on Page 24, just the shape of the curve that shows how we -- how this metric moves during the course of the year. So Q1 is normally our highest quarter. We have a big working capital cash flow inflow from the Christmas holidays that comes in, in Q1. So collections are high. Q2, that number goes down. You can see our guidance. We'll talk about that in a minute is for good year-over-year growth, but the shape of the curve will stay roughly the same, and we're expecting solid growth in Q3 and Q4 as well.
If you turn to Page 25, what you'll see is the same number less capital expenditures and free cash flow in Q1, $191 million versus $82 million this time last year. That is both the combination of the operating leverage that we talked about as well as a significant reduction in capital expenditures now that our infrastructure, second data center are all in place. So we're through a CapEx cycle. We talked about this at Investor Day in November. So really strong free cash leverage. This is significantly more cash than we generated last year. And if you look at our guidance, we've put a big dent in what we need to produce for the rest of the year to be on target.
As it relates to guidance, we are -- if you look at the shareholder letter, and we are guiding to revenue bookings, consolidated net loss and now adjusted EBITDA rather than what we had referred to before as covenant adjusted EBITDA. But we're giving everybody all the constituent parts, so that in your models, what you have to do here is take the adjusted EBITDA number and add back the change in deferrals that will fit with your prior adjusted EBITDA in your model. We're happy to talk about that on calls. We have a good growth forecasted in cash from operations, again, moderated CapEx and solid free cash flow on a year-over-year basis and looking strong for the full year.
And with that, we'll stop the comments and then turn it over to questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Great. Just two for me. First, understand the commentary on search and discovery, but are you seeing any changes in the pace or quality of content that's hitting the platform? And then for live ops, Dave, you suggested that there is a next event coming, but how many events are you doing a year, how much makes sense for the platform and kind of maybe what's the pipeline of good ideas that would have the accretive benefit that the Hunt had? Yes. I'd say, first, the distribution of content in Q1 is -- I would say, more distributed than we saw in Q4 in a general way, which highlights new content gaining more market share. In Q1, we also, I believe, saw more velocity of new experiences entering our top 20 than we saw in Q4. So this is, I believe, working.
On the events, we have to be thoughtful in announcing the full schedule, but I would say between every 1 and 2 months, we expect to do one. The next event, you can -- if you dig into Twitter, you can figure out what it's going to be, and it's going to be awesome. So we do think these are ways of highlighting the key strength of our platform, which is a wide range of distributed content many, many of these pieces of content hitting north of 1 million daily actives. And so yes, I think this is like more good stuff to come with our events. Your next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. So you mentioned the performance -- recent performance for KPIs trending around 20% year-on-year. But at least for 1Q this was the second consecutive quarter in which year-on-year bookings growth has outpaced the year-on-year rate of change for some of your other KPIs like DAUs and hours engage. Any sense as to what's driving this? Is it a trend you expect to continue going forward?
And then lastly, you had previously endorsed a 20% growth rate for bookings for 2025 through '27. I know it's only 1 quarter, but with the adjustments you've made for '24, is 20% still an appropriate longer-term target? Yes. I'll comment first on one, which is I highlighted that we want all of those numbers marching in step at 20% DAUs, hours and bookings. And one of the signs in Q1 that really things weren't where we wanted was that drift between bookings, engagement and hour, and we also saw that in numbers -- just internal numbers, which we generally refer to as general people on the platform versus DAUs and our hours.
So the last 3 weeks, we've seen all of those numbers in arguably our most mature market, which is U.S.A. and Canada, all 3 of those numbers north of 20%. We want the DAU number, not that we're guiding to it -- to be north of 20% as well. And I'll kick it over to Mike. Yes. Drew, over the last couple of quarters, the bookings per DAU and bookings per payer have gone up, which is good. So monetization has been higher than -- has driven bookings growth higher than 1,000 hours. And generally, that's a pretty healthy trend. The movement isn't enormous. It's a couple of percent, 3% this past quarter.
There's always a little bit of flux in that number as payers' season, they tend to spend more on the platform. So there's always a balance between how many new payers or how many new payers are coming in versus how many payers are seasoning and then becoming longer-term payers. But the numbers are relatively close on a year-over-year basis.
So to Dave's point, generally, we think those numbers will move pretty much in lockstep. But in any given quarter, 1,000 hours can grow faster than bookings or bookings can grow faster than 1,000s hours. But our goal is for them to be pretty much in lockstep. And then if you look at Roblox far out there, you could see both within the U.S. as we layer in advertising and other forms of monetization, it's conceivable to imagine our bookings per hour goes up in the U.S. and Canada because right now, we're not really fully tapped into the advertising market. That's complemented by some countries that are going to have enormous DAU growth like India that may monetize less. So we have both some forces driving bookings per hour and other forces driving our DAU numbers, and they'll complement each other. Your next question is from the line of Omar Dessouky, Bank of America. It's Omar Dessouky, not Desousky. I thought the prior analysts had asked about the 20% kind of outlook that you talked about in the Investor Day for '25 to '27. Were you guys -- did you answer that question in the response? I'm sorry if I didn't hear it. No,We didn't -- we forgot to answer it. Yes, we still believe that the business has that kind of growth potential without a doubt. Like what we're seeing right now in the beginning of Q2 is encouraging, and we absolutely still believe the business has that kind of growth potential. Okay. So then it's -- we should kind of think about calendar '24, the lower guidance is a one-off due to the factors that you mentioned, such as lapping PlayStation and the Easter. Is there any more color you can give on like in '25, like how much of that growth would be driven by core versus advertising. I think you've said in the past that north of 20%, is that still kind of the outlook north of 25%? Yes. Has your thinking of like advertising versus core changed at all for those out years? Thanks, Omar. No, I don't think the out year thinking on ads versus the core business has changed. We're going to -- we will give early next year, when we give guidance on '25, we will give guidance on advertising for the first time. So we're going to do that. We believe we have enough of a foundation and momentum to guide on that number for next year.
The back half of this year, really what we've done is we've taken the growth rate that we believe is implied by our guidance for the first half of the year and applied it to the second half of the year with a small decline just based on Q4 of last year, which was obviously our highest growth quarter and had things like PlayStation, which we'll be lapping this year.
So ultimately, the back half of the year is about 100 to 150 basis points of growth lower than what is implied by guidance in the first half of the year. On the other hand, going forward, again, based on what we're seeing today, we believe that we can continue to grow the core business at the kind of rates we talked about last November.
So that is still how we're thinking about 2025, and we're thinking about advertising in 25 as a nice increment of the business but not one that is substantially driving the overall growth rate of the company. It will eventually be contributed to the overall growth rate, but that will be more '26, '27. And just one more question for me. So if I just do the quick math on the calendar '24 top line guide, it looks like it came down by a little less than $200 million, yet the EBITDA margin like-for-like seems not to have changed, and you don't appear to have lost cost leverage. Has your investment plan changed? Or have you pulled back on your plans to make fixed investments, is that why the EBITDA margin is staying about the same, as you've said before? So Omar, yes, the top line guide number is down by about 4%. And you're right, the profitability, EBITDA, cash flow numbers remain unchanged. That is just because we have had operating leverage in the business, and we've had that for a while. If you look at the last 4 quarters, we've been getting leverage on our fixed cost, which is infrastructure, trust and safety as well as on head count. And we expect to continue to see that by being very careful about what we're doing, but we had already forecasted that we were going to have operating leverage.
And then on the free cash flow side, it's because CapEx is coming down, and that's something we talked about last November, and we are certainly seeing that flow through this year. So we've said the unit economics and the cash flow generating ability of the company are very high, and we are in a good place in that we had enough cushion in the operating expenses and the CapEx to be able to deliver the same amount of cash flow on a forecast or guidance right now that's about 4% lower. Your next question is from the line of Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. I was hoping you could expand a bit on what you think drove the engagement with the clients in 1Q. I know you mentioned potentially low-end Android slowness, but anything else to call out.
And as a follow-up for Mike, you mentioned U.S. and Canada bookings north of 20% to start the quarter. I think the 2Q guide implies 13% bookings growth. Could you just help us bridge the gap there? Yes. I'll go first on Q1. And -- we -- just to be clear, we believe this is a combination of several factors that was below the measurement threshold in Q4 and started to show up in Q1. The biggest driver or arguably one of the biggest growth drivers on our platform is raw performance.
The time to join and experience, the frame rate of an experience, the ability to play for a long time without interruption on our platform, the speed of finding friends. These are all huge growth drivers. And we shipped a lot of stuff in the second half of Q4 or second half of the year.
We also started rolling out a lot of stuff. Once again, dynamic heads that track the camera, more and more of our users with Avatars with complex collections of layered clothing. We -- more and more of our users are using voice on the platform. And also, we've arguably tuned one of the best anti-cheat systems with our acquisition of Hyperion over Q4 and the second half of the year in the industry. A lot of our users use high-end devices, but a lot of our users use low-end mobile devices as well. And performance is just critical on all of these things.
So we have a large, focused effort on perf up and down our stack. It's been happening in our creator tooling group. It's been happening in our user client group. It's been happening in our core engine simulation group. We're measuring finer cohorts. We're measuring more specific users, and we believe this has been contributing to the recovery we saw on Q1, at least what I would say is the last 3 weeks being U.S. and Canada go north of 20%.
And now I'll hand -- Mike, if you could refresh the second half of the question, Mike, you can handle that. Yes. Great. The activity we're seeing in the last 3-plus weeks is obviously encouraging. So the back half of April and what we've seen so far in the month of May. Our guidance for the quarter reflects a couple of things. One is you have to take into account the first half of April.
So the improvements really did start right around April 15, it was pretty significant in our numbers. So embedding the first half with the second half gives us the April numbers. And then the 3 weeks that we've seen we have to be cautious as we roll those through our forecast for the month of May and the month of June and what that means for the quarter.
So in the context of providing guidance for the quarter, Q2 and the growth rates, we felt like it was much more prudent to lower that growth rate and give ourselves some cushion. And same thing with the back half of the year. Again, it's great to see the last 3 weeks, but extrapolating that into Q3 and Q4 with no sort of discounting just doesn't make sense. It's just not prudent to do that. So we're trying to be very thoughtful and rational about it and the overall hit to the full year guidance ends up being at about 4%.
Does that make sense? Yes, that's helpful. Your next question is from the line of Clark Lampen with BTIG. I have 2. David, I wanted to come back to the point around new content. We've got a lot of really good visibility around [ active ] payers on the user side of the platform a little bit less so on developers. Was that challenged sort of with new content, a function of both user and developer engagement moderating or maybe more one versus the other. Just curious if there was, I guess, a little bit of that moderation on the developer side, if you would think about addressing it differently than you would users? Yes. It's really exciting. Yes, we actually are in the process of having a developer day with some of the top creators on the platform right now. And we really have arguably the foundation not just a 5,  10 or 20, but hundreds of some of the most creative people creating studios on our platform who arguably are the future CEOs of the interactive entertainment environment.
What -- this content is already there. We have in our top 300 a huge collection of amazing experiences. What we really want to do more and more is to optimize the long-term health of our platform by making sure these amazing creators are all seeing the growth they need to, to continue building their business. And if our content distribution is too focused, some of those, not necessarily long tail, but some of those creators in the top 300, for example, are not seeing enough action to supercharge their business.
So we've seen the content curve in Q1 with the work we've done, once again, not just with our top picks or not just with the ability to buy sponsored placement and not just with the adjustments of our algorithm too, I think, focus a little on long-term platform help. We've seen that curve get flatter and more distributed.
The other thing is our live events. The Hunt, for example, featured 100 creators, some of the most amazing creators and behind the scenes was also a content discovery event where as part of the Hunt users on our platform experienced all 100 of those experiences. So I think -- our belief is there's already amazing creations on the platform. There's a lot of creators out there with 5 to 20 people already on their team building businesses that are arguably up and coming, great new content, and we're seeing more, I would say, new creators coming into our top 20 in the last quarter than we had in Q4. Understood. Mike, maybe as we think about, I guess, a more prudent approach to sort of forecasting the back half of the year. Has there also been, I guess, sort of a commensurate sort of moderation in any of the sort of pipeline or product launch initiatives that you guys had sort of talked about last quarter thinking about, I guess, whatever you had maybe plan to provide to the community in terms of economy initiatives? Have those been walked back in any way for 3Q or 4Q? I want to comment on that. The -- we have a lot of stuff in the pipeline on advertising and economy, and we're continuing to drive that. Just as I highlighted, we rolled out dynamic price floors. We're rolling out more integration of -- on the homepage sponsored advertising, we have other things coming around search advertising on the platform. We just rolled out in-game and inexperienced video. So you're going to continue to see velocity there.
In other areas of the company on the raw performance and quality of our simulator, you'll see that drive for quality and perf continue there. So I think it's selective. And I highlighted on the AI side, we have a lot of work and things we'll be bringing to market there. And also on the content and live ops side, you'll continue to see these events. So we're focusing a bit on AI safety. We're focusing a little bit on economy adds, while other areas of the company continue to drive perf and quality. At this time, we have time for 1 more question. Your next question comes from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Two questions actually. First, over the last 12 to 18 months, you've seen a huge inflow of branded experiences. And I'm curious, how does the engagement and monetization of those branded experiences compare to the traditional nonbranded content that's on the platform? Yes. I'll just go anecdotal high level without metrics. And then, Mike, I don't know if you have any. There are experiences on Roblox, any of our top 20, top 100, top 200 experiences that are played many times a day, week or month and sometimes for years and years by some of our players. And these are long-term engagement with games that's not necessarily our expectation for branded experiences. Although over time, more and more branded experiences will have longer playtime and longer dwell time.
That said, our research, there's an interactive movie trailer on our platform. And the engagement of something like that is much more deep than what would typically happen with a video movie trailer. And we do expect the engagement of branded experiences to ultimately be very different than image, print or video engagement. These are experiences where friends can shop together, try things on interact with the brand. Once again, whether it's Lamborghinies or adidas or Gucci and really relate. So the engagement is much higher than video.
Mike, I don't know if there's any numbers, we would share around that? No hard numbers, Eric, that we would share at this time. I think it's early in the experiences, and each of those are individual experiences. They're learning how to build content on the platform. So some of them have done an incredible job and created very, very engaging experiences and others are still learning what our platform is all about, and they're experimenting and they're not looking at those kinds of metrics yet. So I just think it's early to draw any conclusions.
And Eric, you said you have a second? Yes. So recognizing it's still very, very early, but in the few days that you've been out with the Walmart Discover, and knowing it's -- they only have 3 in real-world products to sell. How is that going? And you did the digital advertising beta that you did was 6 months. How long do you think this is before you sort of go live on a broader scale? We want to -- this is the year we're focusing on advertising, portal and video. We are excited about in world physical shopping, partially because it's a way for our partners to attribute and measure the success of their ads in addition to buy stuff. So in World Shopping is very early. We're not in corporate revenue in any of our models for really '24 or '25.
But it does point to a future where just as being with friends together on Roblox when you're playing or you're playing hide & seek or you're socializing or whatever, that -- it's an exciting what we believe new way over time, that more people will shop together. And we do see a future over time without any forecast or expected dates, we're going with friends to shop together in 3D trying things on and then buying physical items is going to be part of what people think of Roblox. And Eric, I just would add that we're really thrilled that the first partner is a company like Walmart, the quality and scale and the brand of Walmart in retail is sort of the perfect partner to start off something like this. So we're really thrilled to be getting the earliest indications and signals of commerce on the Roblox platform with someone like Walmart. Thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over to   Tamika to close this out. Thank you. That does conclude today's call. Thank you for participating.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Thank you. Hey, welcome, everyone, to our Roblox Q2 2024 earnings call. Overall, it was a solid quarter for Roblox. We'll validate this as we kick off with the numbers. I'm going to touch base a bit on the dialogue we started with our earnings call 3 months ago. And then I'll give an update on why we're optimistic about our future growth prospects.
Starting with the numbers for the quarter, all metrics are back on north of 20% year-on-year growth rates and strong margin improvements. Our revenue in Q2 was $893.5 million. That's a 31% year-on-year gain. And that beat our guidance, which was in the range of $855 million to $880 million. Our bookings were $955 million, that's year-on-year, 22%. That would be our guidance range of $870 million to $900 million
We had a record number of DAUs at $79.5 million, that's year-on-year 21%. And our over 13 DAUs were particularly strong with 26% year-on-year growth. And our over 13 are now 58% of our total DAUs, strong across all regions, U.S. and Canada saw their fastest growth since Q1 2021. Japan, 1 of the largest gaming markets in the world, we have our DAUs growing there at 56% year-on-year. India DAUs are growing at 57% year-on-year, that's an enormous potential market for us.
Our hours engaged hit a record $17.4 billion year-on-year. That's 24% and similar to DAUs, that was our strongest growth in over 13 with 30% year-on-year growth in hours. And similar trends in the U.S., Japan and India, with Japan engagement hours growing 66% year-on-year and India growing 60%. Our consolidated net loss was $207 million that compared to our guidance of $267 million to $265 million. We were roughly $60 million better than what we guided to.
And in addition to the strong top line, we continue to show a lot of fixed cost discipline, couple of highlights there. Net cash flow operations in Q2, $151 million, up 433% year-on-year. And our Q2 free cash flow was $112 million versus a year ago where it was negative $95.5 million. We're continuing to see benefits from all of our investments on the quality of our platform continues to go up while at the same time, we're keeping costs under control.
Importantly, our infra and trust and safety expenditures were 8% lower year-on-year. The efficiencies are coming to a lot of infra efficiency initiatives. We are continuing to add AI efficiency to our safety and moderation platform. And we'll note on the personnel expenses, that was flat year-on-year. But we would note that we've consolidated a number of employees to work in our office in San Mateo rather than remote. And unfortunately, not all of them were able to make the move. That contributed to our flatness year-on-year.
We do continue to hire, especially in the areas that are key growth areas for us, including our AI platform, our safety group areas that are driving proof and quality on the platform. And our economy and ads team. Okay, 3 months ago, we shared with you on the earnings call, steps we were taking to offset unseasonable growth rates that we had seen in Q1. And we shared that we are seeing early signs of positive impacts that have continued, as we can see by the numbers into Q2.
We highlighted a focus on 4 key areas. One was live ops, including bringing back platform-wide events in March, which kicked off with our hunt. Subsequent to that, we've done the classic, and we're just going live now with our next event called the Games. We talked a bit about ecosystem health. I'm going to talk about that and improvements in search and discovery.
We talked about economy improvements, and we also talked about just -- perf and quality. We've really been executing on those 4 big initiatives and in addition to everything else we do in the company. On the search and discovery side, we've taken a lot of steps to drive the diversity and help our users discover awesome new content. In addition to our AI-driven algorithm, we have brought forward really intelligent curation of up-and-coming content and content with new releases that we call today's PIC.
We have also increased the ability for our creators to launch and boost their properties with the ability to buy sponsored tiles on our homepage. And we've seen an increase in variety of content bubbling to the top of our marketplace. We are continuing to optimize and refine our economy. One of the initiatives we shared with you was improving the pricing dynamics of our Avatar accessory marketplace. That's really paid great dividends. Our developer community is also working with the launch of price optimization, which will help developers around the world.
And on the perf and quality up and down our stack in a bunch of metrics that affect everything from very low end to Android devices throughout devices on our platform. We've continued to make improvements in raw performance, stability, quality, join times, frame rates, all things that contribute to our growth rate. Looking ahead, when we went public, we shared for growth vectors that we believe will take us ultimately to 1 billion daily active users, including growing around the world, growing amongst users of all ages, expanding the use case of Roblox to include gaming, social communication, shopping, entertainment and learning and expanding the diversity of our economy.
Those are all continuing to show growth. And I want to just take a quick look. Just within the gaming segment right now, we have a very, very small portion of that, and we have enormous headroom in that 1 segment. Our UGC approach brings with it an extremely long tail of content. We have well over 20 experiences now on the platform with north of 20 -- sorry, north of 1 million DAUs. Our creators are pushing to any device in any language. We have our users bringing their expressive and personalized avatars from experience to experience with a vibrant social graph and MRSA 3D communication built in.
And we're putting all of this on top of an extremely high performance and increasingly efficient infra platform, that in addition to supporting 3D simulation is and will more and more support AI inference as well. A couple of highlights just in the gaming segment -- impress has come out of nowhere. It's an exciting property on the platform. It has doubled in DAUs from Q1 to Q2 of this year. It's a social sensation on TikTok, and it's really loved by users of all ages on our platform.
Dusty Trip, a new release just released in March is solidly into the millions of daily active users. And FIFA -- on June 1, FIFA launched a major update to FIFA World including a new tycoon style game. And since the update, they've seen bringing their -- they brought their total visit count to over 22 million and the 18 and up users have increased 20% in the last 90 days.
In the advertising and shopping domain, I just want to highlight the continued growth and progress we've seen there. We've launched our video ads product. We've enhanced our self-serve ad manager. We've introduced third-party integrations with IAS and PubMatic. We are now testing real-world shopping in Roblox with partners at Walmart and e.l.f. Beauty. And in Q2, the total brand activations to date went north of 400, which is almost double the cumulative from a year ago.
Couple of really fun new brand partners. You might have read about IKEA's coworker, a virtual IKEA store, where they hired real life employees to work in the virtual IKEA store. Netflix launched their persistent IP hub next world. And we've seen also activations from Shrek, Despicable Me and Six Flags. New artists on the platform, Rolling Stones, Ice Spice, and we had a concert from -- as part of the Olympics with our partner, Visa. We'll share a lot more of these updates in September at our developer conference.
One other note, I'm in the room with Mike Guthrie and we're smiling at each other. I wanted to share that Mike, our Chief Financial Officer, has decided to move on from Roblox to pursue his personal interest and focus on his next chapter. And together, Mike and I are going to begin the succession process. Mike is going to stay on as our CFO through the search for a new leader and transition period, which we do anticipate will take some time.
Just want to highlight, Mike joined the company in 2018. And over the past 6 years, with Mike's leadership and contribution, we've had quite an impact throughout the company. Real part of our journey, helped us go public, help the investors, employees and Board members understand how the business works, helped us explain really how we run our business based on cash and bookings, and that's really contributed to driving our growth. And the team that Mike has built is absolutely amazing and contributes a lot to our growth.
So Mike, before I hand it over to you, I just want to say on a personal note, it's going to be fun to still keep working together, as we did this surge and we're also thankful for you and glad that we have a little more time to work together. So thanks, Mike, and I'm going to hand it over to you. Okay. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. I want to just reiterate, I've also really enjoyed the last 6.5 years, look forward to finding a great financial leader for the company and helping that person transition. And I feel as the Head of Finance, I like the financial position that the company is in. I feel good about where we are in terms of growth, and return to cash flow margins are expanding and the balance sheet in just pristine conditions. So it's been an amazing period of time and really good fortune to have been at the company during so much growth.
I do want to reiterate a lot of comments that Dave made regarding the quarter and the condition of the business and where we're going to be able to take it and as that relates to our guidance in the full year. Bookings, as he mentioned, grew at 22%. We know that at our Investor Day last November, we talked about maintaining 20%-plus growth. We were a little bit below that number in the first quarter.
And even with a little bit of challenging April, we produced 22% growth for the quarter so the exit -- operating leverage is really kind of the highlight, I think, for this quarter. And after you look at the top line, it's really about the leverage. We've talked about getting our fixed cost down and getting leverage on our fixed cost that really falls into 2 buckets: Infrastructure, trust and safety.
The metric that we look at, and you can calculate looking at our supplemental materials, which are now on the IR website is cost to serve per 1,000 hours. That's our KPIs. That's what the team is focusing on. And that is really we've been able to get that number down pretty dramatically over the last year. In Q2 of last year, our cost to serve for 1,000 hours is about $12.75; this quarter, $9.61, which is a 25% reduction.
And if you look at infrastructure, trust and safety as a percentage of bookings, that number has moved from 17% down to 13%. So that's a significant part of operating leverage. There's a lot of technology behind that. There's a lot of getting our infrastructure to a more efficient place, and we have plans to continue to drive efficiency in that area. And the other 1 has been headcount. Dave mentioned some of the return to office. And
right now, if you look at -- again, these are numbers you can look at from our supplemental materials, the latest 12-month bookings per person is a metric that we look at, that was about 1.3 million this time last year, 1.6 million this year. So that's an increase of about 20%. And at the same time, our cost per person is well under control. And so as a result of getting fixed cost leverage on headcount, personnel costs as a percentage of bookings went from 26% this time last year to 21% in this quarter.
So very, very strong improvement overall in operating margins and well above the 100 to 300 basis points that we talked about at Investor Day and sets us up well. Capital expenditures, they were about $334 million last year. This year, there'll be about $180 million. And another 1 of the things we talked about at Investor Day is the free cash flow efficiency, turning operating cash flow into free cash flow and free cash flow of $112 million, as Dave mentioned, versus negative $95 million last year is a really big turnaround.
And for the full year, I'll talk about guidance here in a minute, we are guiding to over $0.5 billion of free cash flow this year. So that's a great improvement, and we're really excited about that. So speaking of guidance, I'm going to run through very quickly. It's in the letter. It's in -- on our website right now, but I'm going to go through the Q3 guidance and full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.
So for the third quarter of 2024, we are guiding revenue between $860 million and $885 million. That's a year-over-year growth rate of 21% to 24%. Bookings, we are guiding for the third quarter between $1 billion and $1.025 billion or a year-over-year growth rate of 19% to 22%. Our consolidated net loss or guidance of between negative $275 million to negative $255 million, a significant improvement over where we were last year.
Adjusted EBITDA between $22 million and $42 million, an increase compared to negative $26.4 million last year. That number excludes adjustments for deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue. The total of those 2 deferrals is $113 million. So when you're building your models, for the analysts out there, you have to consider those 2 line items. Operating cash flow, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the third quarter, our guidance, $147 million to $162 million, which is a year-over-year increase of 37% at the midpoint.
You can see operating leverage continuing into the third quarter and back half of this year. We expect CapEx around $42 million for the quarter, which means that free cash flow will be between -- our guidance is we'll be between $105 million to $120 million, and that's a year-over-year increase of 89% at the midpoint of our guidance. So -- average continues, fixed cost leverage continues, free cash flow continues to grow well in excess of what we're guiding on top line bookings growth.
For the full year of fiscal 2024, we're raising pretty much all of our metrics. Revenue, we now expect to come in between $3.4 billion and $3.54 billion, a year-over-year increase of 25% to 26%. Bookings, we expect to come in between $4.18 billion and $4.23 billion or a year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. Our consolidated net loss for the year between $1.089 billion and $1.09 billion. Adjusted EBITDA, the range of $92 million to $132 million, with $548 million of deferred -- $711 million increase in deferred revenue and a decrease of $163 million for the deferred cost of revenue. So the net is $548 million -- to use both the adjusted EBITDA and that number in your models.
Net cash and cash equivalents or operating cash flow, our new guidance is $685 million to $715 million or year-over-year growth of 53% at the midpoint. And again, that continues to show very strong operating leverage. CapEx will stay in the range that we talked about at $180 million. And that means that our free cash flow guidance for the full year now moves to $505 million to $535 million. That's a year-over-year increase of 319% and an increase of about 35% above the guidance that we gave last quarter.
So we feel really good about the financial condition. The balance sheet is in great shape. Top line growth has continued, and we continue to believe we'll show operating leverage and free cash flow leverage in Q3, and that's what's also reflected in our full year guidance. So with that, thanks very much to everybody, and we're going to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]
We will go first to Drew Crum at Stifel. Okay. And Mike, best of luck too. It was a pleasure working with you through the years. You touched on this in the shareholder letter and kind of touched on it in your prepared remarks, but this 1 to see if you can expand on the point, if our math is correct, using the midpoint of the range looks like you've taken up bookings guidance for the second half by $85 million. Can you address the source or sources of the upgrade and just the confidence you have in achieving the updated range? Yes. The major changes that we had started to implement this time 3 months ago when we did the call, we have started to see the level of improvement happening in the back half of April and the beginning of March, and we were cautiously optimistic and reflected in our guidance -- lower guidance at the time that we didn't have enough data to project that forward.
What we have seen since that call has been actually an acceleration of those trends, very powerful improvements in user growth and in -- especially in engagement. And then subsequently in our bookings growth as well. So given the -- again, the sort of the exit rate of growth of bookings in the second quarter and what we've seen at the beginning of the third quarter, we felt comfortable bringing the full year guidance back up.
And on top of that, we continue to see the kind of operating leverage that we expected to see, which reflects why we've increased the -- basically all the below-the-line metrics all the way down to free cash flow. So that's a simple -- answer is that what we saw working 3 months ago is continuing to work very, very well and actually has accelerated in terms of its impact, and we feel like the health of the platform has really just never been better. Got it. Okay. And then just separately on the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate passed 2 bills yesterday, aimed at protecting children online. Just curious your thoughts on how this, in any way, impacts the Roblox platform? Would it require any step-up in investment? Does it change your plans and strategy around advertising? Yes, great question. I'll start with the metaphor, which is a while back. Roblox came forward as the first sponsor of the California age appropriate design code. We're always behind legislation that helps support privacy and safety of people around the world. And in the case of the California age appropriate design code, we happen to be already implementing much of what was in that code and supported it.
So we're -- we continue to monitor legislation. We're very supportive of legislation that helps ensure safety and privacy. It's been the foundation of our company ever since we started. Thanks. Good question. We'll move next to Bernie McTernan of Needham. Maybe to stick on the point of guidance. Mike, just given the commentary of the strong exit rate of 2Q and strong start to 3Q, just surprising the decel maybe that's being guided to for 3Q and 4Q. So just not sure if you're willing to go into more detail there. I know there's -- the shareholder letter called out conservatism.
And then maybe for Dave, just talking about new genres in the shareholder letter like action sports, racing, what does it take to stand up in new categories like this? And how is the process work to communicate to developers and additional tools that you need to provide them? Bernie, I don't think there's any significant deceleration into the guidance to be perfectly candid with you. Yes, the gross -- the exit rate is strong, and we've seen that. We're going to continue to be careful and conservative with our guidance. We want to leave ourselves room. And I think that's really the best thing to say at this point.
90 days from now, we'll be back here, we'll talk about our results and do whether or not we did better than these numbers. But we feel great about the business and want to make sure that we continue to exceed what we talked about at Investor Day last November, and that's really what's baked into this. On the gaming front, and we touched on it, but we'll go into just a little more arguably wherever you get your data, the gaming space is north of $160 billion market. And so when we look at our bookings guidance for the year of maybe 4.2, we're right now at just 2.5% of that. What we talked about regarding genre is there are some -- there's many genres where our creator community is super strong with properties in the 1s and 5s and north of 10 million daily active users, and that includes role play, battle, platformers or war experiences.
What we shared with the creator is the platform we have and the infra, the game engine, the tooling, we believe can support a wide range of genres in gaming. We did a research study to highlight genres that we just thought were underutilized right now. This is less about our tooling and more just making our creator community aware. And we're seeing really good early signal in open-world action sports, racing, social, cooperation type platform.
So we just think there's headroom there in some genres that our creators are now starting to take advantage of. We'll go next to Cory Carpenter at JPMorgan. You touched on your commerce and ad initiatives briefly in your prepared remarks, but hoping you could expand on the progress you made on both this quarter and how that saves your thinking around the longer-term opportunities. Yes. I'll share a couple of really additional pieces of color. There are -- there's 3 main areas we have been working on and implementing. The first is very simple traffic-type ad units on our own platform. You can see those on our homepage right now. They say sponsored. We've increased that. We've seen an uptick of our own creator community.
And when I mentioned FIFA, for example, they actually took advantage of that to help launch and boost their property. So there's a large opportunity for even the creators on our platform. We launched video now for brands, and we're seeing subsequent quarter-on-quarter growth of that unit as well. And finally, long term, we are also supporting portals that bring traffic to experiences. And more and more with the stuff we've implemented like IAS integration and real-world shopping, we're going to more and more give our brands the ability to close the loop on that and really measure more and more accurately the benefit of those units so continue to make great progress. I think Mike wants to add a little ... Yes, Cory, I also want to make a comment about the growth rate of the business and the forecasting of the business. One of the things that we think is really crystal clear that's come out of the last few months is that we have the ability to build a great business with brands and ads and shopping, and we have a great core business that we have built over the years and is growing very rapidly.
It's really clear to us that we can continue to grow the core business while investing in the new business and that will be incremental to our growth. But we're quite comfortable that we can continue to achieve our top line growth goals in our core business. As Dave mentioned, we have a very small percentage of the market. We've seen a fantastic reaction to product changes that we've made.
Improvements accelerated through last quarter and into this quarter. And so it's really an add for us. It's the core business and the new business that we're building. And ultimately, we see that brand business as an accelerant to the growth rates that we provided in our plus 20% business on our core business. We'll move next to Aaron Lee at Macquarie. Question, so I just wanted to touch on the live ops events. As you run more of these types of events, have there been any takeaways or learnings that you can apply to the pipeline of events you have planned? And is there anything you can share about what you saw during the last event just in terms of engagement, I think that would be helpful. I want to highlight a unique real opportunity on Roblox and part of the engine of these live ops events is that we're a UGC platform. And some of our events are including 50 or more experiences, all of whom are participating in the event, adding event features, whether it was the hunt a classic or now the games, which is more focused on the sporting genre and the competition genre.
So here's what we see from those events. They do drive DAUs. They do drive reclamation. The classic, for example, brought a lot of the Roblox community that has played on Roblox throughout the years back to the platform just with some of the classic means on that thing. They also have some other benefits as well. In addition, to what I've shared with our AI-driven discovery algorithms and duration and sponsored, they do increase visibility on a wide range of properties on the platform as well, driving content discovery and diversity.
So it's a net plus, plus. We're in a unique position to support these type of events with incredible diversity. Once again, the games was -- is a great example of that. There's over 20 experiences that are all sports-based experiences that support kind of the -- we're in a sports 2 weeks period here, and the games is kind of reflecting that with properties on the platform. That's great. And then turning to the CFO succession. First, Mike, amazing job over the last 6 years. Best of luck and looking forward to seeing what you do next. Dave, as you start the succession process internally or externally. And can you talk about what you're looking for in the candidate just given how much the company has grown over the years? We're just looking for another amazing CFO. Mike's been amazing, and we're going to together find another amazing one. We'll move next to Matt Cost at Morgan Stanley. So there's some commentary, I think, in the shareholder letter about the North American user growth, which, as you pointed out, is the strongest, I think, during COVID. So I guess really strong showing there. Is there anything you'd call out as a driver of that growth in North America? And where do you feel you are on the penetration curve of the potential user base in U.S. and Canada.
And then on the margin, I think that the full year guidance now implies over 300 basis points of margin expansion this year, so a little bit ahead now of even that 100 to 300 basis point guide you talked about at the Investor Day. I guess what is going better now than maybe you had initially expected? And does it change your longer-term view at all on the margin potential for the business. Yes. I think that highlighting North America growth, both DAUs, hours and bookings we believe is a validation of what we said 3 months ago and that with a heavy focus on performance, quality, heavy focus on optimizing the health of our ecosystem with search and discovery, bringing live ops forward, tuning our economy. There's amazing headroom in really 3 ways. One is, as Roblox is used more and more spontaneously, there's headroom for Roblox more and more to become an everyday product.
As Roblox gets more performing and support the broader range of content, we're seeing even north of 25-year-old, that user segment grow very, very rapidly. And then also, as we continue to add wonderful kind of tune-ups and improvements to our economy, well continuing to be premium and having the majority of our people on our platform use Roblox for free. We're continuing to see benefits on that side.
So there's a lot of headroom in North America. As I said, the gaming market is just 1 lens onto that, where we arguably have 2.5% of the bookings of that. And in addition, in the future, to get to 1 billion daily actives, there's a lot of headroom in shopping, in entertainment, in education and in social communication. And Matt, on your question on margins, your math is correct. It's really a combination of 2 things, which is -- I'm sorry, 3 things, very much in line with what we said last November. I do feel like we were pretty accurate in describing what we expected to have happened. The first is the top line growth, which obviously helps us absorb fixed costs and there's nothing like top line growth to help your margins along.
The second 1 is back to those fixed costs, as we talked about on the call and highlighted in the letter, and we've seen significant leverage in those areas. It's been just an incredible job on our infra and safety teams of focusing on a KPI of cost to serve per 1,000 hours and constantly looking for ways to improve that while increasing the quality and safety and civility of everything on our platform.
And I think the team has just done an amazing job. This is probably 1 of the best examples of using artificial intelligence and all of the compute and logic power behind that to make something in our cost structure better and more efficient and safer but also driving the cost down. And so that cost to serve number, which is down about 25% year-over-year is really 1 of the big drivers. That's about 400 basis points of margin improvement right there.
The second 1 is on people. And a really good metric to always look at for us is revenue per person and for any company. We've generally had very high revenue per person at Roblox. And over the last year, that number has moved back up to $1.6 million, that's another 20% improvement over where it was a year ago. And as a result, that drove about 500 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year.
What's nice about that is I see these trends continuing, but also as we get through the year -- your comment about the full year is accurate matter, what the guidance implies is over the 300 basis points at the top. But what's nice about that is we've stepped back into a place where I think we're proving something I always talk about, which is the unit economics of this business are very favorable.
And now that we have these fixed costs have come back down, in the future, 1 good way to manage those is to look at your growth and basically continue to invest in the things that make you great and -- slightly below the top line growth rate, that will give incremental margin improvement in the future. So we've done a lot of heavy lifting in 2024. And from '25 on, I think it gets, in some ways easier because we -- what I think are the true unit economics of the business. And so yes, that's what's reflected in the guidance as you pointed out intelligently. I just want to close -- bring a bunch of things that Mike said in 1 focused example. And that is as we've rolled out voice on our platform, consistent with our foundation of safety and stability we had to engineer a way to review and moderate all of that voice for safety. Our voice safety team built an AI model and a voice classifier that we are now able to run on our own infrastructure extremely efficiently.
And the quality and performance of this model is such that we open sourced a version of it to our community it's not 1 of the most widely used, I think, trending audio models available on the open source communities. So it's an example of full circle efficiency running on our own infra, supporting improvements in the way our platform works. Next would be Omar Dessouky at Bank of America. This is Arthur on for Omar. I guess on certain discovery, I think last quarter, you guys mentioned that you saw some content stillness, particularly among like the top experiences. And I know you guys have been making some improvements on the discovery algorithm to help drive content freshness. I'm just curious like how these top experiences have responded to these algorithm changes? Have you seen them sort of like publishing more frequent updates? Or was it just like the longer tail content is getting surface more and more?
And then I have a quick follow-up on the guidance, if I could. Yes. I would use the -- maybe sort of the word content sales, I would use the term nonoptimal ecosystem health based on how we surface content. And I highlighted. I'll touch base on the algorithm, but also highlighted that we've increased the diversity of the content that's bubbling up with our today's PICs, which is really intelligent curation. That's expanding into several cohorts as well. We've seen creators take advantage of our sponsored tiles.
On the core algorithm, we're getting more and more transparent with that algorithm. We're starting to share more with the community how we kind of rate and support various terms. We have seen as they result of all of this, as I mentioned, more properties in the last 3 months bubble up quickly. I mentioned dress to impress, for example, which has doubled in the last quarter. And internally, we do measure diversity of content. We measure the spread of that and we have some internal indices that we've seen improve over the last 3 months. Understood. That's super helpful. And then just quickly on the guidance, if I just look at the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like Q4, it would look like there's a 4-point implied decel sequentially versus what the Q3 bookings guidance is. Is that purely just driven by -- from last year? Or is there some sort of organic desaturation assuming in there? Just trying to understand the puts and takes for the more. Arthur, a, it was the highest growth quarter of the year last year. So we're just comparing against the highest growth of 2023. And b, as you rightly point out, it was when PlayStation launched. And so that was a good healthy bump to growth last year, and so we'll have to lap that in Q1 -- sorry, in Q4. Next question comes from Clark Lampkin at BTIG. I wanted to come back to some of the commentary around AI-driven moderation initiatives. I'm curious, I guess, independent of that what sort of runway for either growth or optimization maybe exist in other areas across the platform, whether that's OpEx base or perhaps, I guess, separately with content creation.
Have -- on that latter point, have you guys seen the sort of desired effect and impact on platform growth and developer onboarding that you wanted with the introduction of some of that stuff within Luau tools? Great question. We're running over 150 ML and AI pipelines within the company's training, tuning, building our own models, voice is a big one. We have a lot of AI running up and down the safety stock on content moderation, communication, safety. We have shared that we are building a foundational 3D model.
And we recently with our community, adjusted our terms of service so that our community could participate in a PII and safety compliant way in using all of that 3D data to build a 3D generative model. We've seen really good early results with a lot of our tooling on texture generation -- assistance, but we do believe there's an enormous opportunity to build arguably one of the world's best 3D foundational creation models that will allow our creators to create by prompt, by other types of hints, so stay tuned on that. It's a big area of research, and we're just getting started there.
Safety is where we have most of our AI running now, and we are continuing to grow on top of that. And finally, I just want to get 1 other comment. Safety is an example of running massive amounts of inference own hardware to keep costs very low. And it's 1 of the benefits of having built our own infra with many edge data centers, lots of bandwidth around the world, is the ability to run this quantity of inference at low cost. That's helpful. Dave, if I could, I guess, just if we look at items, I sort of have a bigger picture question around sort of the implications of this. If we were to take maybe a step back and look at just sort of objectively your guidance where it was 6 months ago, even some of the Investor Day targets.
I think it's sort of hard to argue that some of the changes that you've introduced more recently haven't put the platform seemingly on stronger footing than it was 6 or 9 months ago. I'm curious if I guess if that's the right way of looking at it, how has this experience, I guess, over the last couple of months maybe influenced your views or perhaps risk appetite with regard to pushing through similar platform improvements, I guess, in context of potential disruptions? Yes, I would say we have a fairly thoughtful balanced approach to risk. What you saw in the last -- in the second half of last year, was pushing a lot of long-range technology on our platform forward, facial animation, voice, more interactivity on our Avatar. We shared 3 months ago is concerned that, that may have introduced some drag on the platform.
We also talked about content discovery, tuning our economy. I think it's validated that -- quality, raw performance of our economy, raw performance of discovery, those just making those better and better in their own are huge growth drivers, and we'll continue to focus on them in addition to all the visionary stuff we're building. We have time for 1 more question from Shweta Khajuria at Wolfe Research. I have a very high-level advertising potential question for you. As you think about where you are today and your large opportunity in growing your ad revenue base, how -- what do you think is the low-hanging fruit right now as we think about the next 1 to 3 years and that you can capitalize on? And then how do you think about 3 to 5 years that you think you'd benefit from in terms of your revenue potential? My comment would be in the window of 1 to 3 years, I'm not so sure we need to go after low-hanging fruit as opposed to big strategic opportunities. And the way we run product at Roblox is we go after systems, we go after large opportunities. What we more and more with all of the brands on our platform will continue to move towards invalidating is closed loop repetitive systems where -- whether it's for driving brand awareness, whether it's for driving digital shopping, whether it's for driving physical shopping we move more and more to -- in addition to all the incredible brand engagements, a larger volume of just repeat day-on-day advertisers on top of the platform.
And the stuff we're working on is strategic, and we don't have to do low-hanging fruit. We have the opportunity to do the right big picture stuff. Well, thank you for joining us today, everyone. That's a wrap for us. Thank you, and that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.
