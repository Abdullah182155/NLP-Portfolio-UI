Welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings First Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Charlie Schumacher, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Thank you, Karen. Hello, everyone and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings inaugural earnings call. Today, we will be reviewing our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. We will begin with some prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel and our CFO, Hugh Gallagher. After their prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from our covering analysts.
Before we start, a few reminders. I would like to remind you all that this call – management that in this call management’s prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and management may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project, and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. In addition, other risks are more fully described in Marathon’s public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be reviewed at ww.sec.gov.
Finally, please note that on today’s call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which Marathon excludes certain expenses from its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company’s periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a full reconciliation of its non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Once again, this call in its entirety is being webcast on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this webcast will also be available on our website shortly.
And with that covered, I am going to turn it over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for taking the time to join us today for our first earnings call. Marathon is a mission-driven company. Our purpose is to secure and support the development of the world’s monetary network, which is the Bitcoin ecosystem. Today, we are supporting the adoption, security and evolution of Bitcoin by building one of the largest, most agile, and most sustainably operated Bitcoin mining operations in the world. Miners like Marathon are essential based layer infrastructure that enabled Bitcoin to be distributed trustless and secure. We perform a service to the network and for performing that service we have the opportunity to earn Bitcoin. We operate in a nascent industry that has the potential to dematerialize traditional finance in the same way, the internet dematerialized communications. And we believe the opportunity for innovation and value creation, are immense.
We believe 2022 will be transformational for Marathon as we are in the process of deploying nearly 200,000 miners growing to represent potentially 7% of the total Bitcoin mining network and transitioning our operations to be 100% carbon neutral. And to kick things off, we started the year with our most productive quarter to-date in terms of Bitcoin produced.
Some highlights from Q1. In Q1, we increased our Bitcoin production 556% year-over-year and 15% sequentially and produced a record 1,259 Bitcoin in the quarter. In dollars, this translates to $51.7 million in revenue for Q1, which is a 465% increase from Q1 of last year. The improvements in our Bitcoin production were tapered by the fact that the global hash rate increased by approximately 17% during the first quarter of this year. Holding the global hash rate and difficulty rates constant from the end of Q4, we would have produced approximately 1,282 Bitcoin in the first quarter. As of March 31, we held 9,374 Bitcoin, and as you can tell from our monthly production reports, that number continues to grow as we hurdle all the Bitcoin produced, solidifying our position as one of the largest holders of Bitcoin among publicly traded companies.
Some strategic and operational highlights. In Q1, we made substantial progress, strengthening Marathon’s competitive advantages to expand our position as the leading Bitcoin miner in North America. A year ago, when I transitioned from the Board of Directors to become CEO, we had 12,000 miners operating. Our hash rate was 1.3x hash and Marathon consisted of 4 full-time employees. Today, we have approximately 37,000 miners installed. Our hash rate is more than 3x higher and we have 15 full-time employees. Most of whom are in senior level positions that extend across technology, operations, strategy and finance.
Our philosophy is to maximize intellectual capital in-house, test everything and then outsource the muscle of our operations. This industry is evolving quickly and we want to be agile and informed so that we can effectively adapt to changing circumstances and capitalize on new opportunities as they present themselves in hardware, firmware immersion, Layer 2 protocols like lightning and elsewhere. In regards to deployment, and perhaps most important in Q1, we began deploying with our hosting partner, Compute North at their new facilities in Texas. We increased our hash rate to 15% from the prior quarter, which drove our record BTC production. But the timeline has admittedly shifted from the original targets we set for ourselves. Deploying and effectively operating miners, which drives our hash rate and our Bitcoin production, is our primary focus at Marathon today.
However, before discussing our deployment and outlook for the rest of 2022 in detail, I’m going to turn it over to our new CFO, Hugh Gallagher to discuss our financial results. Hugh? Thanks, Fred and welcome, again to everyone for joining us on our initial earnings call today. My focus will be to comment on some of the highlights of the quarter and to provide additional color on our financial performance before I turn it back to Fred to discuss operations and the outlook for the business in a bit more detail.
Given the dynamic growth and business activity over time, I am going to provide color on our results for the current quarter compared to both last year’s quarter the period ended March 31, 2021, which is also outlined in the earnings release and the last calendar quarter, which we sometimes refer to as the sequential quarter, Q4 of 2021. That information is not in the release, but we think it’s an important data point.
Revenues for the quarter were $51.7 million, an increase of $42.6 million from the prior year quarter. A significant increase in mining activity during the quarter accounted for $50.9 million of this increase in revenue. And that increase – that $50.9 million increase was partially offset by the impact of lower average Bitcoin prices versus the prior year period, which had the effect of reducing revenue by about $8.3 million. Revenues compared to Q4 decreased by $8.6 million despite the 15% increase in mining activity that Fred discussed earlier, as the positive impact of that higher mining activity, which was about $8.8 million in revenue is more than offset by a decline in average Bitcoin prices, which reduced revenue by about $17.4 million. It’s also worth noting that there were 2 fewer days in Q1 and that as we said earlier had a slightly negative impact on production results and therefore revenue.
Our cost of revenues during the quarter were $26.4 million, that’s an increase of $24 million from the prior year period and $12.4 million from Q4. The increase in cost of revenue was largely due to the increase in mining activities versus the prior period with higher depreciation and amortization expense as the primary drivers of this cost increase. I also wanted to mention that we have updated our non-GAAP disclosures this quarter as a means of providing additional information to investors. Specifically, we have added adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric in addition to adjusted net income.
Just a few quick reminders on these non-GAAP metrics. They are intended to be used in conjunction with our GAAP financial statements and our quarterly SEC reports. And it’s really important to note that our definition of these non-GAAP measures may vary significantly from similar terms that maybe used by other companies, including our competitors. So, please refer to our earnings release and our SEC reports for more detailed information on the reconciliations and the definitions of the non-GAAP measures.
Turning to this adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.4 million. This was an increase of $33.3 million from the prior year period. This was primarily related as I said earlier to the significant increase in Bitcoin mining year-over-year, which increased net margin, excluding depreciation and amortization. Again, we are talking about EBITDA by $35.8 million. As we mentioned earlier, we also had a 15% increase in production versus Q4, but in spite of this adjusted EBITDA declined $10.3 million, primarily due to the lower average price of Bitcoin mine during the quarter.
Turning briefly to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $118.5 million at the end of March, a decrease of $150 million from December. The primary drivers of this decrease were the significant increase in mining activities, including deposits for Bitcoin mining servers of $192.4 million to a lesser extent purchases of property, plant and equipment, $6.5 million and deposits for co-hosting of $6.3 million. We also invested $10.5 million in equity investees during the period. These uses of cash are financed with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $85.6 million and net cash used by our operating activities was $19.7 million during the quarter.
At March 31, we held 4,579 self-mined Bitcoin, with a book value of $155.6 million. We also held Bitcoin in an investment fund with a book value of $218.2 million, that investment fund is carried at fair value. The market value of all of our Bitcoin holdings at March 31 was $427.7 million. We expect to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time, primarily through mining activities though we may purchase or sell Bitcoin in future periods as needed for treasury management or general corporate purposes. Finally, we had zero borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit line at March 31. But we have since drawn about $70 million on that line to fund additional deposits related to some orders of Bitcoin mining servers.
And with that as my update, I will turn it back over to Fred for his update. Fred? Thanks, Hugh. Our primary focus for 2022 is the deployment of our miners. This year is all about execution. At Marathon, we are constantly pushing boundaries to propel our business and our industry forward. But as Q1 and subsequent events have demonstrated, not every industry operates at the same pace as we do. There is no playbook for building Bitcoin mining operations behind the meter at our scale nor with our strategy and innovation is not a linear process. No one has deployed 23 exahash behind the meter with renewable power companies before. It takes immense effort to drive progress, especially in an entirely new industry, as anything new is inherently met with some level of friction.
Building one of the largest and most sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in the world is no exception. In our case, the friction has manifested primarily in the form of regulation and permitting, which we made great progress overcoming during Q1 in which we continue to proactively address. As we have discussed in our prior monthly production reports, our deployments were delayed by approximately 45 days during the first quarter. These temporary delays have nothing to do with procuring equipment or operational competency. Last year, we provided Compute North with a bridge loan so that we could preorder the infrastructure containers, transformers, etcetera for us. And historically, the miners they have operated for us have performed at nearly 100% uptime for over 2 years.
Rather, the friction relates to breaking the mold and deploying our miners behind the meter at power facilities operated by some of the largest renewable energy companies in the United States. This strategy provides many benefits to our business and to the local community and grid, but its implementation comes with the unique challenges that we are progressing through. The challenge with renewable power, particularly wind and solar is that it is intermittent and our objective is for our miners to operate as close as possible to 100% uptime.
To ensure our miners perform when their renewable power sources dip, a grid connection needed to be established into our new facilities feeding over 200 megawatts of power from the grid back into a power station was a new process for the grid operators. No one had done it before. Therefore, there was a learning curve and it took longer than originally anticipated for the various parties involved to coordinate and complete the permitting and approval process. Since then, we have encountered some additional hurdles related to our energy partners need for third-party consents before energizing our installed miners, which we expect to be resolved in the coming weeks. We do not anticipate this impacting future deployments.
Regardless, we are in the process of strengthening our relationships with our power providers to ensure that we have more influence over the timeline going forward. While the power provider was working through this process, construction of Compute North’s facilities continued unimpeded. On schedule, approximately 4,200 miners were installed in containers in April. These miners are currently ready to be energized and thousands more are being installed as construction progresses. It’s our expectation that our hash rate which is available for anyone to see online should start to reflect this progress later this month.
Encouragingly, in March, the grid operators in Texas granted permission for all 280 megawatts of the first major facility to be energized when you consider that Texas may begin slowing down the rate of deployments for all miners in the state, to monitor Bitcoin mining’s impact on the grid, the fact that we have 280 megawatts pre-approved to energize places us in a uniquely advantageous position relative to our competitors. Additionally, once we have finished working through some of these initial hurdles with the regulators and power providers, we will have a model we can use for all sites going forward, which should make future deployments much more efficient.
We are committed to working through the process and expediting as much as we can to achieve our targeted 23.3 exahash by early next year. We recognize that we do not control all the variable types of deployments, most notably the regulatory process and the pace at which large regulated entities prefer to operate. Currently, the pace of deployment is predominantly determined by the power providers and the pace of construction. As a result, we believe we may be through our backlog of miners and fully back on track with deployments before the end of this year.
Given the progress we have made at the start of this year, breaking the mold on deploying behind the meter and the unique advantages we maintain from our asset-light model, we are cautiously optimistic that we are still on pace to hit 23.3 exahash early next year. There is no denying that the macro environment has become turbulent. The broader market and Bitcoin are all down year-to-date as investors work to navigate market volatility, inflation, changing interest rates and the impact of the war in Ukraine. The Bitcoin mining industry has felt these effects as well. We have seen some large miners start selling their Bitcoin or sign deals for equipment financing with double-digit interest rates, indicating that they are becoming capital constrained. Pricing on mining machines has also started to come down indicating that miners may not be able to grow at the rate at which some analysts have predicted.
The cost of natural gas is increasing, which maybe problematic for miners who buy exclusively from the grid and are subject to fluctuations in power pricing. Given that Bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, the miners who are most agile and well equipped to adapt to changing circumstances will ultimately benefit in the long run and that’s exactly how we positioned Marathon. For Marathon, we aren’t immune to the macro environment, but our asset-light model does make us fairly well insulated. Due to our size and scale, we have several options available to us to efficiently finance our growth. And we sit in a large warchest of Bitcoin as well.
We have fixed pricing for power and industry low Bitcoin production costs. We aren’t under pressure to finance the construction of data centers or maintain customers since we aren’t in the hosting business. And we have a lean team of industry experts who are focused on efficiently scaling Marathon and opening doors for new expansion opportunities in the future.
I am very proud of what the team at Marathon has accomplished so far. We are incredibly excited for what 2022 has in store for our business. And we very much appreciate all your support as we continue to set the pace for innovation in our industry and establish Marathon as one of the leading Bitcoin miners in the world.
With that, we will open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Sir, the floor is yours. Thank you so much and thank you very much for this format. It’s really helpful. Fred, I really appreciate the outlook and maintaining, I think you mentioned maybe cautiously optimistic or maybe that’s more of the spirit, growth target of 23.3% early next year, how should we think about kind of the cadence of minor deployment between here and there? Thank you very much for your perspective. Sure. You should see significant ramp start as we begin deploying now and energizing. Again, as I mentioned on the call in my prepared remarks, we – construction is not slowing down. So, construction and installation of miners and containers is continuing at pace regardless of what’s happening with the power provider being able to flip the switch. So, that’s continuing. So what you are going to start seeing is a pretty significant ramp as we get to the end of this quarter and then through Q3 you will see an even more significant ramp through Q3 and in Q4, you start seeing it tapering down as we fully catch up to all the backlog of miners that we have. And it’s really we are back in a mode away for Bitmain to deliver the orders, which are predominantly S19 XPs towards the end of the year and into early next year. So, hopefully that provides you some more color, but we are very bullish on kind of catching up to our original targets here towards the end of Q3 and then being fully on track from then on. That’s helpful. Thank you, Fred. And in terms of the number of megawatts that are completed from a construction perspective, so I understand 280 megawatts are approved from the grid to be energized. What’s the amount of power capacity that’s been completed from an infrastructure perspective? I don’t have that exact number. So, I don’t want to quote something that’s going to be incorrect. I don’t think in megawatts so much as in actual miners, in the thousands of miners, so – and containers that are ready on the ground, but our container deployment, if you would, is going fully on schedule. So, we don’t foresee any issues with that. Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then one last one for me, then I will turn it over. So we try to model capital outlays diligently. It’s not always easy when considering minor deposits that you have made to Bitmain. Can you guide us to kind of what do you still need to pay cash USD for Bitmain deliveries this year would really appreciate that guidance? Thank you. Sure. I will hand that one to Hugh. Sure. So for the reminder of the year, when I look at our at our investment needs, we are looking at including not just orders that have been made, but orders that we are planning. We are looking at around $0.5 billion of investment needs for the remainder of the year. Got it. So, could you break that down? Thank you very much for that. Could you break that down between things that are already booked versus what might still be contemplated in the future? I don’t think I can. Okay, alright. Well, thank you very much and best of luck. Thank you. We will take our next question from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. So, you have Compute North lined up for the stuff that’s coming online through midyear? I mean, can you remind us is Compute North also your hosting provider for that next 10 megawatts that gets you to 23.3 by early 2022 or are you guys still in negotiations with various hosting providers? So, we haven’t disclosed that yet, but we will over the course of this quarter. But Compute North will have definitely a piece of it. They are our primary partner. And then we are going to have some diversification in the mix. Okay. And then if we think about the cost of hosting, I mean, I know you guys kind of addressed the cost of power and how that moved for those that are connected to the grid. Just curious if you know how much of that you think is impacting your business and if your hosting costs might increase on that – those next contracts you sign? Sure, yes. So, all the existing contracts are at fixed price that we have already disclosed. Future contracts, we are seeing energy prices with the resulting power price that’s coming up a bit. We think there are some things we can continue to do to mitigate some of that. But I would estimate that depending on where the energy markets are over the next few months you may see an increase in the energy cost. You are not going to see a doubling or anything like that, but you will see some increase in the energy cost. Okay, alright. That’s fair. And then just a couple of high level questions on the industry, so any thoughts – any updated thoughts on immersion cooling as that seems to be coming somewhat more mainstream? Have you guys spent more time looking at that? Is that something we could see you do on future deployments? Sure. Great question. I couldn’t have teed it up better. So, we are very actively looking at immersion. We have spent pretty significant time and resources in evaluating a number of different solutions, not to go into any deep technical descriptions, but there are a variety of different ways of doing immersion. There is single phase, dual phase and then you can do individual tanks per minor, you can do totally new tank designs, where you essentially deconstruct miners and build higher density. You are going to see some new miners come to market new mining hardware companies come to market with solutions that are designed specifically for immersion based on non-Bitmain chips. So, you could infer Intel or one of the 3 or 4 other new vendors coming to market later this year, early next year. But I think our focus is to deploy as much as we can where it makes sense with immersion. There are number of benefits with that. Immersion extends the life of a miner, because you are not operating with air cooling, where you have wide temperature cycles and where you get a lot of dirt in the miner. And so some early tests have shown that the reliability for a miner is greater when it’s in immersion. So that’s one reason to do it. The other reason to do it is you have the ability to potentially overclock the miner.
And in some cases, we are seeing significant improvements where you could get up to a 40% boost in minor performance if you would. So, obviously, there is a linear increase in power consumption as well. So, it’s not free that boost. But what it does is, if you pay, let’s just say, a round number $10,000 for a miner, if you can get 40% boost out of it, well, that saves you $4,000 of extra capital for buying additional miners to give you that boost. Then you also have the capital cost for the immersion tanks. And so what we are seeing is it can range from the kind of low say sub $1,000 per miner for immersion, up to a couple of thousand to almost $3,000 per miner immersion, depending on the tank vendor of the solution and how it works.
And then lastly, you have capacity constraints. Most immersion vendors can’t deliver 10,000 tanks a year. It’s in the hundreds per month most probably for most vendors. So, what I think you are going to see is a gradual kind of use of immersion, starting really next year. And as we go through the year, you will see a greater and greater percentage of miners deployed with immersion. And as we get into 2024 even more that continues to develop, but there is this combination of supply constraints. Obviously, it’s more expensive. And so you want to make sure that your operating model supports that additional expense. And then you have to have a way to be able to overclock the miners as well if that’s what you’re going to do. So, hopefully that answers your question. Yes, that’s really great. And just one last question and you kind of mentioned more chip manufacturers, so Intel has – everybody is talking about Intel coming into the industry. I guess, if we fast forward a year or two from now, I mean, how do you think that we are going to be talking about the cost per terahash for these ASICs? Will it become more disconnected from the price of Bitcoin in kind of a more realistic, and I guess, more favorable number for somebody like Marathon? Yes. So at the end of the day, the price of Bitcoin does end up driving it, because it drives demand. So if the price of Bitcoin, let’s just say it’s in the $40,000 to $50,000 range at the end of this year, then I think you are going to see continued in the macroeconomic environment remaining kind of as is, I think what you are going to find is miners maybe capital constrained and not able to grow as quickly as they expected. And so you are going to see a glut kind of equipment like in prior cycles. And so pricing, the buyer is going to have pricing power. If Bitcoin goes to 100k, and everybody is like, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, then demand will outstrip supply and pricing will be based on the market. So, I think in a normal environment, what you are going to see is two new factors impacting price. One is today only Bitmain arguably has 65% of the market. I think you are going to see that number come down to about 50% and then potentially lower as these new vendors scale. Intel is still early in the game. They are only partnering with 4 OEMs at the first stage, but there are new people coming to market with some really exciting designs that are both more energy efficient and designed specifically for immersion, high density, which will lower the CapEx cost of an immersion tank. And so, now you have specialization. So if you were to go back to the early days of the server industry, you started out with these desktop boxes and then you had rackmount boxes, and then eventually you had very specially designed purpose-built servers for different types of applications. And then you eventually got to the place where Facebook and Google today in their datacenters operate immersion type solutions that are all custom-built hardware. So I think you are going to see the industry to go through that same transition. The large industrial miners like ourselves will likely over time move from shoeboxes to let’s just say industrially designed application-specific immersion systems that give us high density, maximum performance and the ability to control every aspect of the operation of the miner through our own software systems. So as you look at how companies like Marathon will add value in the future and differentiate themselves from other miners who just want to be datacenter operators effectively, we are going to focus very much on the technology of mining and how we can add more and more value to that as a way to make our mining operations more efficient and more productive. Alright. Sounds good. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Yes. We will take our next question from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Sir, the floor is yours. Thank you, Fred, Hugh. I appreciate you holding the call. Fred, you didn’t really address the move from Hardin. So, I wouldn’t – I appreciate if you could just spend a little time on whether or not that’s going to – how that folds into your deployment plan? Sure. So, the move from Hardin will be done as a phased move, because we don’t want to take down more operating capacity than absolutely required as we transitioned. So it’s about you can figure 7 to 10 days door-to-door for moving miners. And you will see in Q3 kind of takes – kind of 7% to 8% of the capacity of Hardin down, 10 days later that capacity will pop up at a new site. And then we will phase that across Q3, so that we are hopefully never going to see more than a 10% decrease in Hardin’s capacity at any one time. So, that’s how that will happen. And that’s – those units are already calculated in our deployments for the fall. Okay. Does your planning there? Does that match with your expectations for your power partners to deliver and your infrastructure to be in place? Yes. And do you foresee any issues with transportation? No, I think we have worked out a very good plan on how to do this essentially. The miners are taken out of the existing containers. They are cleaned. They are essentially a cue aid, is there any – are there any repairs that need to be done to any service that’s required in the miner and then they are put in boxes and loaded into large semis. And essentially, you can kind of figure its one container full of miners fills a semi. And so each day, you will have roughly two trucks coming and going from the facility and traveling away and then the miners are installed, the ability to install miners if they can install about a thousand miners a day, so that fits perfectly with that kind of two trucks a day model. So, we don’t foresee an issue there. You mentioned an emphasis in technology and I know that’s something you have stressed over the past year. I mean, you offer great insight on immersion. Could you talk a little bit to software optimization? I don’t necessarily know that’s well understood across the industry and how are you working with your – the managers of your pool and other vendors to generate the greatest return you are getting on your hash? So, as you know, we operate our own pool. So we are not dealing with a third-party. And I think what you could expect to see is there are number of levers you can pull the technology in mining. You can do things at the chip level, which if you are big enough in scale and you have enough purchasing power from a vendor, you can drive certain aspects of that. There are things you can do in the firmware of the miner itself, regarding how it allocates and operates the – optimize the use of the ASICs, especially in a immersion system, there is some unique things you need to be thinking about with those ASICs. Then you have in the controller board for the miner, again, some opportunities to get some small incremental benefits. And then you have at the pool level, some opportunities to get some incremental benefits. So, you have, let’s just call them, architectural and algorithmic advantages you can eventually create. And these are in very small percent numbers of efficiency gains and performance gains, but it does add up in the long run. But you also have an important factor is the ability to go down and control directly at an ASIC level the performance of the miner and that can give you a couple of percentage points of benefit as well. So, the whole key is how do I maximize the amount of productivity I get out of a miner across its life, such that its producing the maximum amount of Bitcoin based on kind of what’s going on. Not just that the data center, in the individual miner at the individual ASIC level, but also more globally, how it interacts with the overall global network. So let’s kind of think of it as a whole technology stack. And are you at a point where you have many of these adjustments implemented and then you are running, Marathon is running at Hardin, I guess offer enough time to make some of these improvements? So, we have a lot of things that are work in progress. Certainly, operating the Hardin facility taught us a lot of lessons, least of which was we don’t want to own our own facility. But it has taught us a lot of lessons about how one can potentially get some benefits. So, we are doing a lot of testing. And we will implement things as we feel confident that it makes sense to implement them. And obviously, that’s going to be, pretty proprietary information. So, we are not going to share too much details about the what and the how. And we are just going to let the numbers speak for themselves. Yes, fair enough. I would expect that. Okay. Aside, from some of the immersion working you are doing and the obviously the software work, what other aspects of technology improvement are you considering or testing? So, one is operational efficiency and productivity of the miners. There are some interesting things, potentially a little bit beyond the base layer, as we look at layer two, where we are seeing what we can do to help provide better infrastructure for some layer two implementations. And we will share more about that later on this year as those plants move into execution mode. You are also going to see some new ways of leveraging the work that proof of work does relative to validating transactions, such that we can leverage all the existing investments we are making and operating costs that we are incurring in ways that can drive some additional revenues by leveraging some of the space in blocks to provide an immutable record for non-Bitcoin blockchain. And I can’t really share too much more about that because there is some development going on there and we don’t kind of want to spill the beans on that quite yet. But let’s just say that there are ways that the Bitcoin blockchain can actually help other block chains become more immutable and provide better validations. And obviously, that’s something that miners can charge for to be another revenue source. I see. The infrastructure in place now has your facility behind the meter, but also attached to the grid. And I am wondering if the green sources of power are directly attached to your facility. And what stage of construction they might be in? So, all of the renewable power is in place already, it’s been operating for a while. So, that’s not new. So, we think of it this way the power generation equipment has been operating. It takes years to build those sites. So, that’s all operating fully functional. The challenge, as I said earlier in my comments was a power plant generates electricity and pushes it to the grid. It does not take electricity off the grid. And all this infrastructure, the transformers, etcetera, are all designed for power moving from the generator to the grid. So, if you are going to do it the opposite way, you need to put in place infrastructure, that’s all in place. ERCOT has already approved the load. Typically, you have heard this term of a load study. So, they have approved 200 megawatts of load to the facility. So, that’s not an issue. The problem, the last little gating problem we have right now is consent, third-party consent. And as soon as that’s done, we can go live. So, we are continuing to Compute North build out the site. They are continuing to deploy containers. They are continuing to stuff miners and containers. And every day that goes by more miners are built are put into containers. And when we flip the switch, they all come online. Okay. Now… One thing I will say is, as you look at renewable energy and this was a renewable energy operators getting additional benefit from having us behind the meter. We have talked a lot about Bitcoin miners being like a capacitor buffer to the grid being able to be a customer for the renewable energy operator to suck up the excess energy as they can’t sell to the grid. But the other thing that as a minor we can do is, we can enable a renewable energy generator, who let’s just take wind, for example. If they are a wind generator and they have the right type of leases with the land under their wind turbines, they can deploy solar as well. And they don’t have to get additional capacity permits from the grid, because they are not going to push that extra energy out to the grid, because typically, solar and wind operate at different times of day, especially in Texas. And so all of a sudden, we are not providing an incentive for renewable operator to double down and add solar in addition to wind at the same facilities, significantly increasing their total capacity, but their capacity on an hour of the day basis remains the same, if that makes sense. But the benefit to us is that it means we have to take even less energy off the grid. Absolutely. I hadn’t expected to hear that, Fred. So, thanks for sharing. Appreciate it. And thanks for entertaining all my questions. Yes. Absolutely. Appreciate it Kevin. We will take our next question from Chase White with Compass Point. You may proceed. Thanks, guys. So, how do you guys think about financing your build out going forward in terms of both capital needs and also sources? I mean is there going to be a focus on kind of non-dilutive sources of capital, like debt and/or potentially selling bitcoin, or is the at the market offering that you guys had out there going to be kind of the main source. I am just trying to get an understanding of the needs and where it’s going to come from going forward. Thanks. Sure. I will let Hugh answer that question. Sure. I think what you have to do is look at the long-term – a long-term financing plan, what’s the right capital structure for the business. So, when you really look at that, it’s a combination of debt and equity over the long haul. I don’t want to get into timing of when we are going to issue debt, when we are going to issue equity, whether we are going to do leasing or not. But we are looking at all of that at this point. I said, we may buy or sell Bitcoin for general corporate purposes, I will say we don’t really have an intention to do that in the near-term. We are looking at financing things like term loans, revolvers, equipment financing, and the shelf all are part of the mix. And we have to focus on getting to a long-term balance of what’s an appropriate long-term capital structure. And the way you get to that is, you pull different levers at different times. But I don’t think we want to quote – we want to go into details of how we are going to finance in the very near-term, in the mid-term, in the long term, other than to say all of those things are part of our plan. Sure. It makes sense. And I mean just on the kind of debt/equipment financing side. I mean, is it getting easier out there? Are you finding that there is more competition and therefore, capital costs can start coming down for those who can obtain it, or how does the debt and debt related market look? Yes. Well, I am well, one month in, so it’s pretty hard for me for conclusions of it. Sure. But it was getting easy. I would say without question. I think Bitcoin is getting more readily acceptable. There has clearly been a pullback in the whole – before today, the whole industry and the whole stock market. But I think it’s becoming a little bit more – there is more sources coming, approaching us now. And the folks that we are working with are open for business and willing to continue to work with us. So, I feel like the – it feels to me like the environment is constructive. It’s hard for me to draw a hard and fast conclusion as to, is it better than a year ago, was it worse than a year ago, because I am just too new in the chair. Fair enough. And following that up, I mean is there any, I mean how does the landscape for hosting providers look right now? Do you see that impacting your ability to grow beyond sort of the 23.3 exahash that you guys have contracted in the future? And following on to that, I mean is there any concern that maybe to the extent you go for geographic diversification, that regulatory delays, like you saw in Texas might start popping up in other states that maybe currently don’t have a regime like that? So, I think let me answer the question in two parts. One is, if anything we are seeing more and more opportunities for hosting every day. And you could say, well, that’s just part of the trend. And I think there are enough people who have now understood kind of the nature of this business who either have access to flare gas, or who have access to renewable energy, or hydro, or geothermal or other sources, solar, etcetera. That – now we are looking at, hey, we have got 10 megawatts, 20 megawatts, 30 megawatts, we would love to have you guys come in and run miners in our facilities. And we are not at all against having a lot of hosting partners. We obviously prefer having a handful of larger hosting partners, it’s fewer next to choke, if you would, fewer operations to be babysitting, because we are very active in the kind of oversight on our miners and how they are operated. But there is definite benefit to having a broad dispersion. And certainly there is much easier access to smaller chunks of hosting, than there are big chunks. It’s pretty hard to find 300 megawatts of power at a time. And so our strategy now is broadening out and looking at a lot of site diversity, a lot of geographic diversity to your point to avoid over establishing in Texas. In the prepared remarks, I mentioned that the environment in Texas, while it’s very open to mining, there comes a point where enough is enough, and the load on the grid just becomes too much. And we don’t want to be in a position where we have all our eggs in one basket. Some of our colleagues in the industry have everything in Texas and everything in ERCOT. ERCOT may decide depending on what happens to go one way or another and do things differently. And so we just don’t want to have that risk of having all our eggs in a single basket, like that. So, you are going to see us having more geographic diversity over time. And you will likely start seeing some international deployment over time as well. Got it. Thanks guys. Our next question, we will turn to Zach Sippel with D.A. Davidson. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It’s Zach in for Chris Butler. It looks like cost per coin came down a bit from last quarter, is that a function of improved operations at Hardin? And then if you could remind us what we should expect for cost per coin, as you transition to Texas? I will let Hugh address kind of the difference if we look at our kind of cost per coin, I think our cost in Q1 was up a little bit over Q2 As we go ahead – go ahead Hugh. Yes. So, there is – what I typically do is I just look at the – if you just look at the face of the financials, I looked at the cost of revenue, and I backed out DNA, that’s kind of how I sort of worked my way through this. And when I do that compared to the fourth quarter, you do have a slight increase in cost per Bitcoin mined. And that makes sense, because the global hash rate increased and so therefore, the amount of energy required to mining Bitcoin should in theory have increased, right. That’s right. Yes, makes total sense. And then maybe some additional color on the April issues and if that was sort of related to the Hardin facility and if you expect those to subside in May? Yes. So we have had this ongoing issue with the Hardin facility. Unlike, our Compute North facility in Texas, there is no grid connection at Hardin. So if the power plant goes down, we can’t pull power off the grid. And the power plant in Hardin though, it’s quite new, it was built in 2007, just look at our past production reports and you can see there have been consistent issues. And unfortunately, in the case of a coal-fired plant, there are mechanical issues, such as you are ingesting coal, it gets ground up, turned into a slurry that then get combusted, generates heat and boils water, generates steam, electricity is generated, lots of mechanical parts. Well, sometimes it can be rocks in the coal that mess up a grinder it could be a turbine issue. It could be all sorts of issues. And with the supply chain issues out there today, when something breaks, you don’t necessarily always have spare parts available and you have to wait for them to come in. And so the Hardin facility in April was really limping essentially. It was operating at about 60% of capacity. So, hopefully, those issues are kind of behind us, but I don’t think we have believed they were behind us a number of times in the past and it’s just keep cropping up. And uptime is very important to us. So, we are eager to do this transition away from Hardin and into an environment where we can have much higher performance and uptime. Yes, that’s super helpful. Thanks. And then my last question is sort of pertaining to that transition. Can you give any color on how many rigs you may expect to be up in Texas this month and then throughout the year? I am sorry if I missed that. Yes, I mean, we are not giving specific numbers for this month, but you could think of it. If you were to look at Q2, I think you are going to see essentially another 3xahash come online and then a significant increase over that in Q3 and then Q4 you start seeing the increases or decrease because they are now driven by receipt of miners, but the big – you are going to see a – think of it as a snake where you have got kind of the tail in the mouth. The middle of the snake is the fattest while Q3 is by far our absolute fattest deployment quarter. Thanks. That’s super helpful. Congrats, guys. Yes. At this point, there are no further questions. I’m going to turn the call back over to Charlie Schumacher for closing remarks. Thank you all for your time today. If you have questions that were not answered during today’s call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team at iratmarathondh.com. Thank you and enjoy the rest of the day.

Welcome to the Marathon Digital Holdings Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Charlie maker, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Sir, please go ahead. Thank you, Vikram. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are our Chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel; and our CFO, Hugh Gallagher.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. are, as such, a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full reputation of our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. In addition, other risks are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be reviewed at www.sec.gov.
Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which Marathon excludes certain expenses from its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a full reconciliation of its non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Hue. After their comments, we will be going through some of our more popular questions from our investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts.
And with that covered, I’m going to turn it over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Charlie, and thank you all for joining us today for our earnings call. The second quarter 2022 proved to be a challenging time for our industry, the broader market and for Marathon. But as we'll discuss today, we believe our recent progress proves that Marathon is well positioned relative to its peers to grow as a leader in securing and supporting the bitcoin ecosystem.
During the quarter, Bitcoin's price declined approximately 56%. At the same time, energy prices increased in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The combination of both factors has compressed margins and reduced profits for many in our industry. miners who are running old equipment or overpaying for electricity have been forced to stop mining. As a result, the global hash rate has grown far slower than many analysts were projecting at the start of this year, and we have even seen the difficulty rate adjust downwards multiple times since the end of May.
At Marathon, we tend to be fairly well insulated from the macro environment relative to our peers since we run a lean operation, we are asset-light, and we do not have large capital expenditures for data centers or power assets. However, as our financial results demonstrate, we are far from immune to the impact as we are directly tied to a new but maturing asset. In the second quarter, in addition to the challenging macro environment, we also had to work through several obstacles unique to Marathon that depressed production and negatively impacted our results this past quarter.
As we've discussed in our monthly production reports, our bitcoin production was substantially reduced during the second quarter due to downtime and maintenance issues at the power generating station in Harden Montana, coupled with an elongated regulatory process that delayed the energization of our installed miners in Texas. For most of the quarter, the power generating facility in Montana struggled to produce an adequate amount of electricity to supply our miners with power.
And in June, it seemed that Murphy's law came into effect when a severe storm passed through the region, damaging the power plant and taking offline all 30,000 of our miners in the area, which represented approximately 75% of our active fleet at the time. The downtime from an inconsistent supply of electricity and the storm caused our miners to produce approximately 45% less bitcoin during the quarter than they theoretically could have if they have been running at 90% uptime, which is more in line with our long-term target.
Outside of Montana, the energization of our miners in Texas was repeatedly and frustratingly postponed by the power provider until the tax exempt dates of the wind farm, where 68,000 of our miners are being installed to be confirmed. While confirmation was pending, we applied pressure where we could to expedite the process, and we continue to have miners installed in preparation of receiving the green light to energize. By the end of Q2, we had approximately 30,000 miners or 3.9 ex ashes installed across these new facilities. And as of August 1, that number increased to approximately 49,000 miners or 4.7 ex ashes.
Fortunately, these delays are finally behind us. Just last week, miners at the wind farm in West Texas started to be energized. However, before discussing the immense progress we've made subsequent to the quarter's end to energize our installed miners, procure hosting for the remainder of our fleet and bolster our financial position, I'm going to turn the call over to Hugh to discuss our second quarter financial results in detail.
Hugh? Thanks, Fred. My focus today will be to comment on our operating results for the second quarter and to provide some color on more significant recent financing activities, including our withdrawal from the investment fund in June and the new credit facilities we put in place at the end of July.
First, operating results. We recorded a net loss of $191.6 million during the quarter compared with a net loss of $108.9 million in the prior year period. This is an $82.7 million increase in loss, and I'm going to walk through the components of this increase in our loss starting with revenues and margins.
As mentioned -- as Fred mentioned and as we mentioned in our release, we faced some real operational challenges this quarter, and we generated revenues of $24.9 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, compared with $29.3 million during the 3 months ended June 30, 2021. This $4.4 million decrease in revenue was driven by lower revenue per bitcoin mined of $6.8 million, and this resulted from the lower market prices for Bitcoin in the current year period when compared to the prior year period, partially offset by an 8% increase in Bitcoin production activity during the quarter, which had the effect of increasing revenues by about $2.4 million.
Cost of revenues, energy, hosting and other during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, amounted to $16.7 million compared with $4.1 million in the prior year period. This $12.6 million increase was driven by accelerated cost recognition associated with our early exit from Harden of about $10.3 million, and to a lesser extent, higher cost per bitcoin -- total margin, which we define as revenues less cost of revenue for energy, hosting and other totaled $8.2 million compared to $25.2 million in the prior year period. This is a $17 million decrease driven primarily by the accelerated cost that Harden that I mentioned earlier and the lower revenue per Bitcoin mined.
We also recorded a $21.8 million increase in depreciation expense during the current quarter. This is included in the caption called cost of revenues, depreciation and amortization, about $18 million of this $21.8 million was related to the acceleration of depreciation into the second quarter as a result of our decision to exit Harden [ph]. The remaining increase in D&A was just the impact of having a larger fleet year-over-year. So that sort of covers depreciation and our margin. But the largest single driver of the steeper loss in the quarter was the significant decline in the carrying value of our digital currencies, driven by the lower bitcoin prices during the quarter.
We recorded a combined impairment expense/fair value decline of $207.3 million during the current period quarter compared with $125.8 million in the prior year period to that $81.5 million of an unfavorable earnings variance quarter-over-quarter. We also saw increased costs related to income tax expense of about $10 million, operating expenses of around $6 million and interest expense associated with our convertible notes of about $3.7 million. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was a gain on the sale of equipment of $58.2 million. In December of 2021, we entered into a contract in which we agreed to sell certain equipment in conjunction with the development of commercial activities at the King Mountain facility.
During the 3 months ended June, we sold -- we sent 2 shipments of equipment for cash proceeds of approximately $87 million and realized a gain -- a total gain of $58 million. And finally, adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, was a loss of $147.2 million compared with a loss of $105.2 million in last year's quarter. This $42.1 million decline in adjusted EBITDA primarily resulted from the decline in carrying value of our digital assets, which I spoke about earlier, both impairments and changes in fair market value and lower total margin, partially offset by the gain on the sale of equipment.
Now, I'll turn briefly to a few of the more recent updates on the third quarter -- these are things that are -- that we see coming up in the next quarter. In July, we sold the final shipment of equipment related to King Mountain. We received proceeds of $44 million and expect to record another gain of $29 million on the sale. We can also now say that we finished the accelerated cost recognition associated with the hard exit. During the month of July, we recorded $7 million of accelerated cost in cost of revenues, energy hosting and other and an additional $13 million in depreciation costs.
We are now in the process of moving and/or selling to harden miners, and we'll report on the outcome of these efforts in our monthly production reports as appropriate once we have more definitive plans for these assets. Turning briefly to our bit Point Holdings. At June 30, we held around 10,055 bitcoin, of which 2,820 were being utilized as collateral. The fair market value of the remaining 7,235 unrestricted Bitcoin was approximately $143.1 million. We also had unrestricted cash on hand of about $86.5 million. As to our Bitcoin Holdings, we expect to continue to add to our holdings over time through mining activities. And as our mining activities increase, we may sell a portion of the Bitcoin produced in future periods to fund monthly operations for treasury management purposes or for general corporate purposes.
As previously reported, on June 13, we withdrew 4,769 bitcoin from our investment fund and transferred into direct company ownership. As a result, we no longer will receive mark-to-market accounting for the Bitcoin formerly held in the investment fund and the 4,769 bit point are now classified on our balance sheet as digital currencies. Also during the quarter, we terminated the loan of Fit coin of around 600 bitcoin. These were treasury management actions that we wanted to consolidate our Bitcoin holdings in support of the anticipated Silvergate financing, which we placed on July 28.
Speaking of that financing, we entered into an additional $100 million term loan, and we refinanced our $100 million revolving credit facility. The term loan includes a $50 million draw at closing, which we've executed a carried an interest rate of 7.25%. And there's a $50 million delayed draw that we have up to 270 days to choose to draw that facility. Both the term loan and the revolving credit facility are secured by Bitcoin and got mature in August of 2024.
Turning to the cash flow statements. Our total cash position, including cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was right around $90 million, a year-to-date decrease of about $179 million. The primary drivers of this were expenditures of $394 million in advances to vendors related to Bitcoin server orders and, to a lesser extent, $14 million related to capital expenditures and $14 million related to equity investments. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $79 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $161 million and proceeds from borrowings under our revolver credit facility of $35 million, and that $35 million that was outstanding at the end of June has since been repaid.
Looking forward for the remainder of the fiscal year, we see cash needs for investment, including shipping costs related to previously ordered miners that will be shipped to be substantially lower than what we've incurred to date. We are estimating this to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million.
And that completes my comments. I’ll now turn it back to Fred. Thanks, Hugh. The second quarter tested our resilience and our resourcefulness. As a result, even as recent events have demonstrated, we not only weathered the difficult times, but we capitalized on opportunities to improve our operational and financial position subsequent to the quarter's end. At the end of July, we received the much anticipated news that the exemption the power company has been waiting on have been confirmed and that miners could start to be energized at the wind farm in Texas.
Just last week, the energy provider started feeding power to the data center and energizing our miners. Of the 68,000 miners that will eventually come online at this facility, approximately 40,000 are already installed and are now being energized. As of this morning, we had brought approximately 9,700 miners online, which added 0.9x a hashes to our [indiscernible] energizing this much capacity is a complex process that will occur in stages. According to the latest schedules, the facility should be constructed and energized by the end of the third quarter of this year. At that time, we should have approximately 68,000 miners online at this facility, working to secure Bitcoin ledger, process transactions and produce new bitcoin for Marathon and our investors.
In addition to energizing miners in Texas, we also recently eliminated the uncertainty surrounding our future hosting capacity by securing new hosting arrangements to achieve our prior hash rate targets. When vetting potential new hosting arrangements, in addition to the quality of the operator, -- we prioritized speed of deployment, cost of electricity and hosting, geographic diversity and the source of power.
With this in mind, we signed a major new agreement with Applied blockchain securing approximately 200 megawatts worth of hosting capacity, 90 megawatts of which is in Texas, while the other 100 megawatts are at a wind farm in North Dakota. As a part of this arrangement, we have the ability to add an additional 70 megawatts of capacity, bringing the total amount of hosting across all of the applied blockchain facilities to 270 megawatts if we choose to exercise the option. Additionally, we opted to expand our agreement with Compute North to include an additional 42 megawatts of hosting capacity at the facility in Grandbury, Texas, and we're also expanding with several smaller providers in the U.S.
In total, we secured enough hosting capacity to support our prior target of 23.3 ex-hash [ph]. Based on construction schedules, it's our understanding from speaking with our hosting providers that we will have enough miners installed to reach that target by the middle of 2023. In addition to substantial operating progress we made to energize previously installed miners and procure hosting arrangements for others, we have taken measures to enhance Marathon's financial position going into the second half of 2022.
As listed in our contracts, which were published in December of last year, the S19 XPs we purchased from Bitmain [ph] benefit from price protection. For the July and August shipments, we received a price adjustment on our first shipments of S19 XPs that were relatively in line with current market conditions. It is our current belief that we will receive similar adjustments if market conditions persist through the end of the year. These price adjustments materially reduced our potential capital expenditures for 2022. We -- as Hugh mentioned, rather than relocate all the miners that we installed in Hard in Montana, we have opted to sell a portion of them. This decision backs the question how are we still on track to achieve our target of 23.3 ex-hash [ph].
At Marathon, we're always looking to reduce our costs and boost performance, especially in current market conditions when Bitcoin's prices declined and energy rates have increased compressing margins for Bitcoin miners. As part of this strategy, and in anticipation of the potentially industry-wide margin compression, we opted to purchase an additional 30,000 S19Psifrom Bitmain in April of this year. We're currently in the process of using these new miners to upgrade our fleet by replacing some of our S-19 Js and S-19 PROs with XP.
We are still on target to achieve our prior goal of 23.3x ASHs, but with the upgrades, approximately 66% of the 23.3 exahash will be coming from XPs. The S19 XP is 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation. And by converting to these machines, we are decreasing our electricity cost on a per terahash basis. As a result, once fully installed, we believe Marathon's fleet will not only be one of the largest, but among the most energy-efficient mining fleet on a per terahash basis.
One other update we're mentioning relates to our hosting arrangement with Compute North. Our original agreements with them included the fixed price for energy and hosting as well as a small profit share on a portion of our overall fleet. Given the current market dynamics, we opted to renegotiate these contracts to maximize the potential profitability. We have eliminated the joint venture and profit share. Under our new agreements, we will continue to pay a fixed rate for hosting, and we will have an extremely attractive fixed price on the wind energy at the facility in West Texas.
The remaining grid energy we use has passed through pricing, which gives us the opportunity to benefit from hedging and participating in curtailment programs because we now have the benefit of being able to control when our miners will be curtailed, we can now benefit from selling energy back to the grid when it makes economic sense to do so as some of our peers in the industry have recently demonstrated, there are times when it can be more profitable to sell electricity back to the grid than it is to mine Bitcoin. Under our new arrangements, we now have the ability to participate in this potential upside.
In summary, the second quarter was challenging for the industry and for Marathon in particular. Bitcoin mining is a nascent industry, and as I mentioned in our last call, there is no playbook. However, given our progress, we're confident that we remain on track to grow our position as a leader in this space. Miners are coming online in Texas. We have hosting arrangements secured to achieve our target of 23.3 exahash by mid-next year. Our mining fleet is state-of-the-art, consisting predominantly of the most efficient bitcoin miners available in the market. We have a warchest big point in our liquidity position, balance sheet continued to improve.
Overall, we have entered the second half of the year with added confidence that we remain on track to grow our position as a leader in supporting and securing the bitcoin ecosystem.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Charlie so we can begin taking questions. Charlie? Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the questions submitted by investors on our new Q&A platform. In total, we received about 100 questions, which looks fantastic. We won't have time to tackle all of them today, but we do want to cover some of the most uploaded questions. And also, I'll let you all know how much we appreciate the interest in Marathon and the opportunity to have more of a dialogue with our investor base.
So to start, the first question comes from Bill Gee, who asked, can you please give us an update on the rigs and when they will be plugged into full capacity? We got approval from FERC and they were curious about the energization time line. So I think we've actually covered this a little bit in the prepared remarks and in today's earnings release. But just curious, Fred or you any color that either of you want to provide on the process of receiving approval and starting to energize. Well, once the FERC approval was received, the power provider could proceed with beginning to energize the site, which took a certain number of days. They can't turn on 280 megawatts at one time. They turn it on in essentially kind of 20-megawatt chunks. And so while we have 49,000 miners installed at the site, those will be energized 20 megawatts at a time, and we expect to be fully energized with the 68,000 miners installed on site by the end of September. Excellent. Our next question comes from Tami Gee, who asks, what are Marathon's plans for any severe downturns that may occur within the crypto market in the coming years? So I guess, any comments around kind of resiliency of the model or how we're prepared to kind of survive cryptowinter? I can touch on part of this and maybe Hugh will have a comment on the other side of this. But essentially, because of the way we're structuring these power agreements, we do have the ability to curtail our mining operations if mining becomes unprofitable. This is different than other miners who may have PPAs where they’re obliged to take the energy. And so we believe that we have strengthened this strategy, and it will help us going forward.
As it relates to the other side of this and how big corn pricing may affect us, Hugh, I’ll let you comment on that. Again, I think, Fred, the whole point with this is optionality, right? So you want to build flexibility and optionality into your processes. As we said, the financing we completed goes a long way in helping us achieve that goal. And the other thing I think we need to look at is, as we mentioned, as we produce more bitcoin considering using a portion of that production every month to cover your cost where regardless of where bid point is going up or down, you're matching the cost of bitcoin with your cost of production within the same month. That's something we're certainly looking at. But I would say here, in addition to what you mentioned, which is probably the first order issue. The second one is building in financial flexibility, so you can continue to absorb fluctuations that will come in the market. Thank you. This is probably a good segue actually into our next question, which comes from Noah P, who asked how does Marathon compare or stand out from other miners in the market? So any other additional comments besides what just touched on related to Marathon's differentiators or kind of what makes us unique? I think as we’ve stated many times in our public disclosures, the earnings calls and presentations, our strategy is different than many of our colleagues in the industry where we operate with an asset-light model, working with third parties to do hosting and provide energy for us as opposed to being vertically integrated. We think that has certainly given us a lot of flexibility, especially with the delays that we incurred in energizing miners had we been having to make huge CapEx expenditures and investments in infrastructure, I think it would have been a very different financial situation for the company. But our strategy provides us with a great amount of flexibility. And I think as you can see, we’ve weathered the storm quite well. Suspension is a little more esoteric, if you will. So maybe I'll pass this over to you. Ivan B was wondering about the atriums move to proof of stake, do you think there may be any sort of impact on Marathon or earnings as a result of that shift? Yes, I’m not going to directly comment on whether it will impact our earnings. I think just generally in the marketplace, Ethereum and the Ether platform is really a platform for developing this decentralized applications and smart contracts where Bitcoin is really all around Bitcoins cryptocurrency. And as a network that really is ideally designed for tracking ownership of assets. And I think the 2 of them will continue to operate very independently of each other. I think there’s still going to be different versions of Ethereum [ph] classic. You have the current version of serum and there’s people in the news commenting about doing yet another 4 here. And I think bitcoin won’t be really impacted by that much. Next question comes from Mark B, who asked, is there a future potential of a dividend paid in Nicklin... This is something that I think as a management team, we've discussed, it's not in the current plan. It may be an option in the future or not, we don't know, but I think time will tell. Great. Next question, maybe, Hugh, this might be a good one for you. New DS is Marathon considering adding additional shares, hence, potentially increasing dilution. So Hugh, maybe can you touch on sort of the capital allocation strategy a bit and some of the different levers that we have available? Sure. So we have an ATM and at the market facility that's active that we're using. And I mentioned earlier, we've -- that was a source of about $161 million in the first 6 months of this year. So we will continue -- that's an option that's available to us. And given the growth mode that we're in, that we will probably continue to lean on, although less needs coming up in the next 6 months and in the first 6 months. We also try to make sure that we always keep in mind that whatever we're doing in the short term fits a long-term debt equity split debt equity capital structure. And that's why we felt comfortable adding a little bit of debt capacity this quarter because of how much we've been able to raise on the equity side, you can lever that with a little bit of debt. Don't want to go overboard in that and always finance keeping your long-term view of where the company needs to be and keeping optionality and flexibility available to yourself?
The short answer to your question is, yes, we will continue to tap the equity markets as needed for growth. I think the good message that we put out there is we clearly want to get to the point where we’re not tapping the capital markets to pay for monthly operating expenses, which is where we’ve been to this point. Great. Thank you. I think we'll do one more question before we kind of switch gears here a little bit. So last question David Jay asked is, Marathon digital planning on branching out at any point and mining other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. Fred, maybe you want to touch on that one a little? At this point, Bitcoin is our primary focus and only focus. We may do experimentation just to learn and understand how some different cryptocurrencies operate, but Bitcoin is our focus. Great. So in the interest of time, I think we'll wrap up the section of the Q&A. Again, we really appreciate the questions and the interest, and I wish we had more time to answer all of them. But for now, I'm going to turn the call back over to our operator to open the line to questions from our covering analysts. So Vikram, the mic is yours. Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have a first question from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Okay. And congrats on all the progress over the last few weeks. Maybe my first question, I guess if we think about the second half deployments and some of the delays that you had in the first half of the year, I mean, I guess, talk us through your confidence level that we're not going to run into energization delays or anything like that with the next level of deployments. Sure. So the initial site we're deploying in the second half of the year with applied blockchain already has capacity running at it. So that site is the expansion that we're doing there is really more of a construction issue than anything else. So we don't foresee any energization issues there. The second site, based on their historical operating experience, we feel fairly confident that, that will happen on time. The good thing is, today, with the energization of King Mountain and the additional capacity that we've tied up with other hosting providers, all of the inventory of miners that we have will be fully absorbed here very shortly. And if you look at the second half of this year, it's predominantly the XPs that are yet to be delivered that will be deployed there. So if anything, we believe it's really more deliveries will be the gating item than construction or energization. Okay. Got it. And then on the deliveries, you mentioned that the July and August deliveries were discounted from the original purchase price. I’m not sure if you can – if you’re able to quantify that for us? I think if I remember right, you guys paid $79 a Terahash. I think the market rate, I would imagine is down by more than 1/3 from that your final payment is a third. So I’m just curious if the market terahash rate is less than 33% lower than where you paid, are there ways to renegotiate that contract, maybe increase the amount of miners that you’re buying? Or just how should we think about that? I think you should think about it as we will be deploying 23.3x a hash, and we're benefiting from essentially a decrease in the amount of CapEx we're going to have to pay to get those liners deployed. I think your estimates on kind of market pricing or most probably definitely in the ballpark, you can obviously see those numbers in the secondary market, starting to see the XP prices come down in the secondary market already pretty aggressively. So I think it's about all we're going to comment on that for obvious reasons. We have next question from the line of Chris Brendler with DA Davidson. Congratulations on the progress. Not sure this is for Fred or for Hugh, but I'd love to hear on the -- it was really impressive that you were able to go through this quarter without selling material not a big point like a lot of your peers did. Can you just maybe give a little more detail on the sources of cash in the quarter, looking specifically at the compute North loan? And how much of that has been repaid back as well as any -- so like you have less payments on some of these orders than you expected. Can you quantify that at all? Sure. So Chris, there's been no activity on the compute North loan. So that's still outstanding. So that was not a source -- the 2 largest single sources of funds were the -- well, the proceeds from the sale of the miners, that was $87 million. We pulled on the revolver. And we also -- we -- despite the -- that it was not a tremendous quarter from a standpoint of stock price. We did keptapping our ATM periodically during the period as well. So they were our 3 main sources of funds. And of course, the biggest use of funds was clearly continued payments for miners. Important point is that a lot of the impact on minor pricing adjustments come -- came in July and a very end of June and in July.
So that did not have a significant impact on the current quarter. It is more of an impact as you're looking forward for the remainder of the year. And as we said, if you just look at -- if you look at where we are, in the first 6 months, I think our number is around $390 million of advances for miners. And over the next 6 months, our forecast is around $150 million to $175 million. Great. My follow-up question, and I do have a lot more, but I'll get back in queue. The new facility, a new hosting arrangement with AP LD, and I think you've got another -- a couple of other hosting deals that you've signed to complete the 23.3%. Can you talk at all about the pricing? I was always so impressed by the Compute North transaction back in December at $0.042 per kilowatt hour was really attractive pricing that's all in today's environment. What is -- can you give us any indication on how much higher just given what's happened in energy prices, your new contracts are? Yes. While we haven't sort of announced the exact price, it is a fixed price contract. And I think if you look at the fact that we'll be deploying XPs there and with that energy efficiency, we'll still be relatively in the same ballpark as prior fixed price agreements that we have with compute North. So the XP efficiency offsets the increase in power, so your cost for quality is relatively stable? Yes, that's a great way to look at it. We have next question from the line of Chase White with Compass Point. So just curious, what portion of the power purchase agreements have the ability at this point to participate in curtailment programs? I mean you mentioned that a certain portion, you're able to actually do that and sell power back to the market. So I'm just curious what amount of power is kind of subject to that? So in relation to the King Mountain site, which is a wind farm, the wind energy that we have has a fixed price, very attractive fixed price. And so for example, if you look at the forward market and ARCO this week, it sudden $400 a megawatt or something like that. We are significantly below that. And so that gives us a very big opportunity to sell the wind energy back. The grid energy, we only take it when we need it and want to mine with it. So that's not energy that we sell back. But the wind energy, we have 100% benefit from if we sell it to the grid. Got you. That’s helpful. And then, I mean, is it safe to say just as a follow-up to the prior question that the kind of the blended average electricity costs go up, but the efficiency comes down, but everything should stay effectively the same. I mean are you kind of implying, I guess, here that the power price is fixed at something like 30% higher given the efficiency of the XPs? Yes, I think a good way to look at it is operating with XPs, our costs stay in line with where they've been estimated before. Thank you. We have next question from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Thank you so much, operator. I wanted to follow up on this last question in May of last year. I think you disclosed the cost per megawatt hour $0.045 roughly per kilowatt hour. So how should we think about that cost component on the Compute North side of the agreement today? that's the rate that was changed. Right. So in the original agreement, we had no benefit of curtailment. It was a fixed-price PPA. We were -- we had to take the energy whether we liked it or not, unless Arcos was curtailing the site, and we didn't get the benefit of selling the energy back. What we've done now instead is we've negotiated very good price considerably lower than the prior price for the wind energy piece with full rights to sell that back to the grid and optimize the profit picture from that. On the grid side of the energy, we have a full pass-through on the energy. So we have the ability to hedge do whatever we want with that energy. And so we'll optimize there as well.
So we just decided that if you look at the current energy markets, the short-term picture, meaning 2022, 2023 is going to be very volatile from a grid energy price because of energy prices. And we didn't want to be locked in to a 5-year term at a fixed price based on the current market conditions. We wanted instead to have the optionality to be able to hedge ourselves by futures and turn on and off energy as needed and desired to optimize for profitability. So that's why we focus on restructuring the agreement. It gives us a lot more optionality. That’s helpful. So on 280 megawatts or so, you can – you locked in at a fixed rate. That rate is presumably somewhat higher than it was before. And then on the remainder of the grid, you’re currently floating. The wind energy is considerably lower than the rate we had before or by a significant factor. And then obviously, that generates a very interesting opportunity for -- so an example, if you use the old price, $0.45 a kilowatt hour or $45 a megawatt. If current air cot pricing is $400 a megawatt, then we could sell energy, we're paying $45 a megawatt for $400 a megawatt. And that profit we received the benefit of that. So that's really why we structured the areas that way. That is very helpful. Yes. That profit is going to offset any spot market issues with grid pricing as well as health fund futures and other things like that for hedging. I appreciate the color. Thanks. We have next question from the line of Stephen [ph] with Cowen. Thanks for the question. Fred, can you just discuss the construction time lines on the 270 megawatts of Applied's infrastructure on your new hosting arrangements, -- where do they stand today? What's constructed in North Dakota and Texas and what still needs to be done? And I have a follow-up. So the Texas site is an existing site where this is just expansion of that site. And I'm not going to give you specific how many miners per month will be turned on there. But it's essentially really the gating item is our deliveries from Bitmain versus the construction. So if you think about our deliveries, we're basically receiving about 15,000 miners per month. give or take a few thousand each month, which we'll start seeing recede up here later this month. And so that's really the gating item as we go through deployment of the applied blockchain sites. Is the North Dakota site, that starts -- you'll start seeing the first miners going in there right around the December time frame probably -- and then that will continue deploying through May of next year. Okay. And I think the press release highlighted 2,800 Bitcoin utilizes collateral for borrowings roughly. Is there any risk of triggered for sales or liquidation here in the contract with Silvergate and what price is a Bitcoin would that be potentially? Well, the amount we have outstanding, that's since been repaid. So the issue that you're talking about is if you look at where we are today, we probably have 3,000-some-odd bitcoins outstanding as collateral, and that's of our 10,000. So we're not overly concerned about that. I think once you get down the bitcoin prices of around $12,000, things get pretty rough. But right now, we're watching it closely, and we feel like we've kind of picked the right time to do that financing. And remember, the issue you also have is once you can also choose, if you wish, to sell Bitcoin if you have to and pay off the loan. And since you're over collateralized all the time, you can also do that. So I'm not particularly worried about that, but it is something we have to keep an eye on and we do keep an eye on to make sure that we're not getting out over our skis.
The most important thing for me is production ramping, right? Because our view is there's some sort of there's a level of bitcoin holdings that we want to utilize for borrowings. As our Bitcoin holdings increase and as our production ramps up, that becomes less and less of a concern because the amount that could be drawn on your bar becomes less and less a percentage of your overall Bitcoin Holdings. And that's why it's so important that we got that delayed drawdown feature in the term loan. It gives us an opportunity to grow into that debt as well. That's helpful. Appreciate it. We have next question from the line of Greg Lewis with BTIG. And good afternoon on everybody. I guess I wanted to follow up on the shutting down of hard on. I guess you announced that you're either going to be moving rigs or selling those rigs off. Could you talk a little bit about the drivers of those decisions? What types of rigs are there? And as we think about that, what the market is for potentially selling -- and if we were to move rigs, how much it would cost to reposition those rigs and as you look at your existing footprint, where those rigs could even go? Sure. So let me start by saying the 23.3 exahash is that number does not include any miners from hardened being installed anywhere else. So we have no need to use those miners. They happen to be older S19, -- they've been in use for 18 to 24 months. And we believe that what we need to do as much as possible is deploy the latest state-of-the-art machines, meaning XPs because of the energy efficiency. We think that, that's going to benefit us in the long run, especially in the next 18 months of the market where energy prices are going to be very high, most probably generally around the marketplace. So the miners that are at harden, if you go back into our filings, you could calculate that our cost to acquire those miners were somewhere in the low 20s per terahash [ph].
So essentially, if you look at the current market for used machines, it's around that ballpark. And so essentially, those machines could be sold in their current condition at a small loss or near breakeven kind of number. The cost to move them if we were to relocate them somewhere would be around $1 million, $1.5 million if we were to do that. But I think we're very focused on deploying the latest machines that we are getting in and really just exiting, I mean, kind of a clean break out of harden so we can move on. Okay, super helpful. And then, I did want to talk a little bit about the wind facility. I mean, clearly, there’s going to be opportunities, as you mentioned, Fred, about selling power into the grid. I guess what I would say, realizing that we have to look at each of these locations a little differently. Is there any way that we should think about utilization of the exahash at that facility just given those opportunities, i.e., in the summer when it’s demand for power pricing tends to be most attractive to sell versus, say, most of the other parts of the year when it’s I guess, pricing is more stable. Any kind of color you think as we build out our models, how should we should be thinking about the utilization of that ex ash. I don’t know if you want on a quarterly or even annual basis. Have you guys – any kind of color there? It's a great question. We've been working with the power provider there, and the operator of the wind farm. It is a very complex calculus to figure out the actual capacity because it's very dependent on seasonality and when the wind blows, not just what the energy markets are doing. And so it varies, the amount of hours of the day that the wind generates vary during the course of the year, a lot of seasonality. So the wind farm operator has some very sophisticated models on this. They've obviously been operating this site for I think it's nearly 20 years at this point. So they have a lot of experience, and we're relying on their models to really look at this. But the -- generally, the calculus is this. If it's more profitable to mine than selling the energy will mine, if it's more profitable to sell the energy, then we'll sell the energy.
And so from a cash flow perspective, if you would, to the company, whether it’s Bitcoin or whether it’s Viacurrency, we’re optimizing to maximize that profitability. And this is going to be a process where it’s going to take us most probably a few quarters to understand the real seasonality and the real impact of this. But the goal is to really just optimize for profitability. Okay. And then just -- I did want to follow up because I guess sometimes power prices are negative, now that it's typically probably because wind is blowing in the middle of the night. But I guess maybe the question is, in the event that power pricing is super attractive across the grid? Or is there an ability for you to draw power to power those rigs when the wind is not available, are you plug can we draw from the grid or... Absolutely. I mean the wind doesn't blow 24/7, right? So the goal is to optimize the 95% uptime or sell energy back to the grid. So by no means are we only using wind energy. We learned our lessons that hardened that we want redundant energy. And again, Part of the difference in our model to some of our competitors who sit and only have grid energy is by having the wind energy, there's a lot of wind energy that's stranded at the wind farm that can't go into the grid because Barco is not buying it. And so we get the benefit of that, tends to be extremely low pricing on that energy. But we also have the benefit of being able to draw off the grid when that's cheaper. The good thing is that we have the same incentives as the power operator does to operate the site for maximum profitability.
And so we're very aligned in how we're looking at the energy strategy. And I think one of the unique things here as we've talked about, gosh, at this point for over a year is by partnering directly with the power company and really operating a mining business kind of where your incentives are fully aligned with your energy provider, it creates a very unique situation that people operating directly on the grid don't have the ability to do. And so I think, again, our model here is going to be proven to be somewhat better than some of our colleagues in the industry. Great to hear, Fred. Thank you all for the time. Have a great rest of the day. We have next question from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Redirect it. No questions on Marpol [ph] or your optimization. Is there any way you can talk about that your ongoing strategy and leaving that back into your operation and what sort of efficiency gains we can see? And I’ve got a follow-up for you. I’ll just say stay tuned on that, and you’ll hear things in the not-too-distant future on that. Fair enough. Then given multiple sites in Texas, Brent, how far have you gone with your immersion experimentation. And when could we expect to see Marathon’s implementation? Great question. So we have evaluated a number of different vendors of emerging technologies. We have kind of honed in on 2 that we like very much. I think as you may be well aware, a lot of the immersion vendors don't have the scale to deploy at our scale quite yet. And so for these current deployments, these are all air based, both Ken Mountain and the applied blockchain sites. The applied blockchain sites in the Dakotas have the benefit of very different climatology where for a portion of the year, we may even be able to operate the exercise at that site and overclock them even in air. So that's a benefit there. I think as you look at future deployments that we haven't announced yet whether that's going to be in later 2023 or in 2024, I think you'll see Immersion make up a portion of those. But again, Immersion is still a relatively new technology.
A lot of the Gen 1 technologies that have been deployed either require copious amounts of water. And again, we are very ESG focused. We have our goal of being carbon neutral at the end of this year. We'd love to deploy behind renewable energy sources, and we don't really want to be in a position where we're having to step water out of the lake cool or miners. And so as we look at our emerging technologies, we're looking at solutions that are more closed loop in nature. And those are systems that are kind of still in their early stages, but we believe, longer term, will provide much better operational stability and allow us to leverage different types of deployment, not just utility scale deployment, but also microgrid deployment. Well, thanks for diving in on that, Fred. Pardon the pun -- appreciate you entertaining my questions. Thanks, Kevin. Thank you. We have next question from the line of Gustavo Gala [ph] with Truist. This one is a bit of a follow-up a clarification. So for that incremental 254 megawatts that you've been able to book, has the connection to the grid been approved by the respective operators? I'm particularly asking for the 110 megawatts out of North Dakota with Applied. So the grid operator, they have been approved. I'm not 100% sure as to whether the full load study has been completed, but I do know it's approved. Got you. That’s helpful. And just looking at the space with all the dislocation that’s been going on, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for consolidation, be it in the sense of picking up a year or even some of the orders that peers might not be able to pay for and things that mature. Yes, great question. I think the challenge is -- so acquiring another mining company, the problem is what is the cost of the infrastructure CapEx required condition of the current miners they have hash rate. So as we've looked at it, we have yet defined an opportunity where we can acquire a minor and have an ongoing operating cost and CapEx model that beats just going out and buying state-of-the-art XPs and deploying them kind of behind the meter at wind farms, solar sites and partnering with energy companies. We think that sort of de novo model still beats the acquisition model. Part of the challenge is, if you have a miner who's been operating for 2 years, their rigs are old S-19 -- you have no idea how they've been treated. The hosting agreements may only have 1 year, 2 years, maybe 3 years left on them, and then you're back to square one. So we think there's just opportunity for a lot of hair on some of those deals potentially. That doesn't mean that there won't be some fire sales here as some minor struggle with their energy pricing and bitcoin production.
Clearly, global hash rate is going to continue to grow just based on our deployments and what our -- some of our peers are deploying. So we still think the de novo model is a better model. But we'll see there may be a fire sale that just is too good to say no to, but our preference to grow through de novos [ph]. Thank you.

2022-11-08,8,11,2022,10.5,-0.2589978868407885,0.0,1.0,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2022,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Charlie Schumacher, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Thank you, Diego. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are our Chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel; and our CFO, Hugh Gallagher.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. In addition, other risks are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be reviewed at www.sec.gov.
Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which Marathon excludes certain expenses from its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a full reconciliation of its non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Hugh. After their comments, we will be going through some of the more popular questions from our investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts. And with that covered, I'm going to turn it over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Charlie, and thank you all for joining us today for our Q3 2022 earnings call. The third quarter was a transition and rebuilding period at Marathon. With the facility in Hardin, Montana off-line and energization of miners in Texas delayed, we entered the third quarter with only 6,000 miners operational, producing approximately 0.7x exahashes per second. Unsurprisingly, the operational transition that occurred during the third quarter caused our financial results to dip both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. However, as our consistently improving Bitcoin production substantiates, our confidence in our ability to rebuild our hash rate while maintaining a healthy balance sheet was well founded. Today, we believe Marathon is a strong foundation on which we can continue to efficiently grow towards our goal of 23 exahashes per second by mid-2023, and expand our position as the leader in securing and supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Since the end of the second quarter, we have sequentially improved our Bitcoin production from 72 bitcoin in July to 184 in August then 360 in September and then to a record 615 in October. October was the most productive month in our company's history, during which our production was almost equivalent to the entire third quarter. We now hold approximately 11,300 Bitcoins, making Marathon the second largest holder of Bitcoin amongst publicly traded companies worldwide, according to various third-party sites tracking this data.
The consistent improvement in our Bitcoin production is the direct result of increasing our hash rate by bringing more Bitcoin servers online and improving those servers uptime. During the third quarter, we transitioned out of the data center in Montana, where our servers were drawing their electricity from a coal plant that had consistently incurred maintenance issues that negatively impacted our time. This scheduled move was part of our broader strategy to become both more operationally effective and more environmentally sustainable. By transitioning away from the Hardin facility, our renewable energy mix has increased, our uptime has improved and our fleet has become more efficient on a joule per terahash basis.
While we were in the process of exiting Hardin new facilities, most notably the data center in McCamey, Texas, that is co-located behind the meter of a large wind farm called King Mountain, began coming online. The energization of this new site during the third quarter enabled us to increase our hash rate from approximately 0.7x exahashes per second on July 1 to approximately 3.8 exahashes per second on September 30, as over 30,000 miners were built online during the quarter. And since the quarter's end, we have increased our hash rate an additional 84% to approximately 7 exahashes, or 10x greater from where we entered Q3 with approximately 69,000 of our Bitcoin miners operating as of November 1.
Not only have we been able to execute in line with our recent expectations, but we've been growing consistently at a time when many in our industry have been struggling. However, before discussing the current state of the industry and why do we believe it creates uniquely beneficial opportunities for Marathon, I'm going to turn the call over to Hugh to discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Hugh? Thanks, Fred. This was a particularly eventful quarter as we energized our miners in King Mountain and completed the exit from the Hardin, Montana site, a significant strategic pivot for the company. We also announced additional hosting capacity with Supply Digital, and we added new term loan and revolver credit facilities. Then in September, we learned that the Compute North bankruptcy, a process which is still ongoing as we speak and which we'll comment on a little bit later.
Let me first turn to the numbers. We recorded a net loss of $75.4 million during the quarter compared with a net loss of $22.2 million in the prior year period. This $53.2 million increase in our loss -- this is a $53.2 million increase in our net loss, and I'm going to walk you through the components of it now.
As mentioned in our earnings release, production was very low in July as we made the decision to exit Hardin and that we were just starting to energize King Mountain. This combination of factors, coupled with lower Bitcoin prices, resulted in a $39 million decline in revenues when compared to the prior year. Decreased production accounted for $26.3 million of this variance, and lower Bitcoin prices accounted for $12.7 million of the revenue variance. Cost of revenues increased a total of $29.8 million. This is primarily related to the impact of $20.8 million in accelerated cost recognition related to the early exit from Hardin. This impacted both cost of revenues, energy hosting and other by about $5.7 million, and cost of revenues, depreciation and amortization by about $15.1 million during the quarter. And fortunately, the recognition of these costs are now behind us.
Turning to the value of our digital currencies. We experienced a $5.9 million impairment in the carrying value of digital currencies during the quarter compared with an impairment of $6.7 million in the prior year period. However, in last year's quarter, we also experienced an increase in the fair value of digital assets we held in our investment fund of $42.1 million. You'll recall that we eliminated the investment fund during the second quarter of this year, and we now hold all of our Bitcoin as intangible assets subject to impairment. So overall, the negative period-over-period impact was $41.3 million.
I mentioned earlier that it was an eventful quarter. And next, I'm going to just touch on 2 of the more larger and more unusual items that we recorded during the quarter. In October, we finalized our previously disclosed legal settlement of $25 million. The expense to establish this reserve for the settlement was recorded during the quarter.
We also previously disclosed our exposure to Compute North consisting of investments in preferred stock, loans and operating deposits that this number was approximately $81 million. During the quarter, we performed an assessment of where we stood with Compute North, and we recorded an impairment of $39 million related to the preferred stock, the loan and certain deposits. This bankruptcy process is ongoing, and we will not be able to comment on the process further other than mentioning these financial impacts. We also saw a $3.8 million increase in interest expense during the period primarily related to the convertible notes issued late in 2021.
Now partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were the following items. We recorded gains on sales of assets of $31.9 million during the quarter. These gains included the previously disclosed sale of equipment related to the King Mountain development and additional asset sales related to our exit from Hardin. We sold approximately 22,000 miners at Hardin for proceeds of around $46.5 million, and we recorded a gain of around $4 million related to this transaction.
Operating expenses decreased significantly. This was primarily due to a drop in noncash compensation expenses, partially offset by higher costs related to increased business activities from the growth of the company. And we also recorded an income tax benefit of $5.8 million in the current year period versus a $0.1 million benefit in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $8.7 million compared with adjusted EBITDA of $78.8 million in the prior year. And this decline in adjusted EBITDA primarily resulted from lower total margin. Again, this is EBITDA, so excluding depreciation and amortization of $46.9 million, the $41.3 million impacted the carrying value of digital, the legal reserve, and the increase in cash operating expenses of about $6.3 million. And all of these negative variances were partially offset by the gain on sale of assets I mentioned previously.
Turning now briefly to our Bitcoin holdings and liquidity. Unrestricted cash was $55.3 million at the end of September and $52.1 million at the end of October. Total Bitcoin holdings were 10,670 or a market value of $207.3 million at September 30, and 11,285 or $231.3 million at October 31. Unrestricted Bitcoin holdings were 6,842. That's about $133 million at September 30, and 3,464, that's about $71 million at October 31. During the month of October, we borrowed $50 million under our revolving credit line, which is why our unrestricted Bitcoin went down. And we intend to repay this by making the final draw on our term loan facility in November. We don't expect significant additional collateral requirements related to this transaction.
We expect to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time, primarily through our mining activities. And as our mining activities increase, we will likely sell a portion of Bitcoin produced in future periods to fund monthly operations for treasury management purposes or for general corporate purposes. We also expect to fund our operations through prudent use of our ATM facility.
Looking forward for the remainder of the year, we see modest cash needs for investment, including shipping costs related to previously ordered miners.
And with that summary, I'll turn it back to Fred for the rest of the call. Fred? Thank you. There's no doubt that the macro environment presents challenges for Bitcoin miners. Bitcoin's price has been relatively flat for the past 4 months. Power prices have increased, and the global hash rate has climbed to over 260 exahashes per second. These forces have depressed margins across the industry. And so far, hosting providers seem to have felt the largest impact. While these variables present challenges for some, they also present opportunities for others, including Marathon.
We believe there's no better time to be scaling our Bitcoin production and to be commencing the installations of our previously purchased S19 XPs, which are the most energy-efficient machines available and approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation S19 J PROs, predominantly being installed today by many of our competitors.
Today, it is unprofitable to mine with S9s and S17s unless your energy pricing is below $0.03 and $0.065 per kilowatt hour, respectively. Even with S19 J PROs, the breakeven cost to mine is approximately $0.085 per kilowatt hour given the current global hash rate. For these reasons, we believe one of Marathon's unique strategic advantages is that over 60% of our hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs by the time we achieve our primary target of 23 exahashes per second in mid-2023.
Given the large mix of XPs in our mining fleet, we believe the efficiency across our fleet will measure approximately 24.2 joules per terahash once fully operational. To put this in context, it's been estimated that global Bitcoin mining fleet are currently operating at an average of 45.9 joules per terahash. Said another way, by mid next year, we expect Marathon's mining operations will be consuming 47% less energy than the Bitcoin network is today on a per terahash basis.
Why does this matter? It means we're positioned to keep the lights on when others cannot. And since Bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game in which the difficulty of mining is dynamic, being able to survive the winter, while others are out in the cold, provides us with excellent downside protection, and it also provides us with more leverage should Bitcoin begin to turn in a positive direction.
Installing and energizing our miners and achieving 23 exahashes per second remains our primary goal for the upcoming quarters. Based on conversations we've had with Applied Digital and our other hosting provider, we believe we are still on pace to achieve this target near the middle of 2023 as previously stated.
The most recent construction and deployment schedules indicate that miners should start to be energized at Applied Digital facility in Texas during the fourth quarter of this year, while our deployments of their facility in North Dakota should mostly occur during the second quarter of next year.
King Mountain is now nearly fully operational. And depending on the outcome of the ongoing Compute North bankruptcy, second phase energization that will follow may occur in Q4 with final energization potentially in Q1. These time lines are always subject to change, and we continue to provide deep updates on this progress in press releases, quarterly filings and elsewhere.
With production scaling and our hash rate becoming more consistent, the obvious question to ask is, what's next? In Marathon, we don't speak in detail about our growth plans until we have contracts in place. However, today, I do want to share a part of our philosophy to give you all a sense of how we see the company evolving over the coming quarters.
To drive value, we believe it's imperative to become effective and then more efficient over time to maximize optionality and to be proactive rather than reactive. And as part of that strategy, we're constantly evaluating new technologies and searching for new hosting arrangements. This past year, we significantly reduced our reliance on fossil fuels as we broke the mold on deploying behind the meter of renewable energy sites. While the majority of our hash rate will be located in near-sustainable power sites by this time next year, Marathon is always striving to set the pace to make Bitcoin mining more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable.
While we believe there are several innovative opportunities in North America to increase our geographic diversity, decrease our power costs and drive further towards carbon neutrality, we are also investigating international markets which are becoming increasingly more interesting, especially as we look to deploy emerging technology.
Bear markets are a great time to build, if you can do so, and we believe Marathon remains well positioned for growth. We look forward to building on our current momentum through the end of the year and beyond to become the largest self-mining Bitcoin miner and to improve our position as a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem.
With that, I'll turn it back to Charlie so we can begin taking questions. Charlie? Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the questions submitted by investors on our Q&A platform.
The first question comes from Eugene who asks, continued sideways between 18,000 to 21,000 for the next 6 to 12 months, is Marathon currently in a financial position to weather the storm and come out on top if the value of bitcoin begins to increase in the future? Fred, would you like to take that one? Sure. So as you can see from the Q and our prior -- sorry, from the earnings release and our prior production reports, our cost to produce Bitcoin remains very competitive in the marketplace. We think, as we've been saying, we expect Bitcoin to trade in this kind of 18,000 to 22,000 range for some time. And we think we're very well positioned to weather that storm and come out the other side very attractively as Bitcoin goes up in price.
To date, we haven't yet sold any of our Bitcoin. We will hold that Bitcoin unless we deem it's necessary to cover operating expenses or other expenses. At the same time, as we're going to continue to look at Bitcoin's price behavior. Today was a unique day in the market, this news with little battle between CC and Sam Bank Manfred is obviously causing turmoil in the price of Bitcoin, but we think that Bitcoin will likely come back within the range that we've spoken about, and that's a range we feel very comfortable with. Great. Aisan H. and Mohamed M. we're both curious about some of the potential risks to the business. So I guess the questions essentially where, does Marathon currently face any threat of bankruptcy or other major risks associated with it? And what are the company's plans to avoid those risks? Well, there are lots of risks that we can't control, price of Bitcoin, global hash rate, things like that. But we think that barring those things, we're very well positioned to weather through this winter and come out the other side and definitely harvest as the environment improves. Our next question is from [indiscernible]. Fred, this is probably one for you as well. What is the future of Marathon in 2023? And sort of a follow-up question to that from Busan S is, will Marathon consider diversifying its business beyond Bitcoin mining in the foreseeable future? So 2023 is going to be an important year. I mean today, we're operating at a little over 7 exahashes per second. And by mid-2023, we'll be at 23 exahashes. That's pretty substantial growth in a very short period of time. If you look at the balance of the year and if you remember the comments I just recently made earlier on this call, we're beginning to look at international opportunities and other opportunities, which we believe will provide us with very attractive energy pricing, very consistent energy sources, very well capitalized hosting partners and energy partners as we continue to evolve kind of our strategy around renewables and driving that renewable mix as high as 100%. Our next question is from Jacob B., who asks, is Marathon considering an acquisition of another mining operation or data center? So Fred, maybe you can talk about your ideas around potential consolidation that may occur within the mining space? One of the big challenges, and I've said this at many conferences and my kind of stock answer to this question. In this industry, when times get tough, the cost to replace assets goes down as well. And so in traditional industries, if you're going to build a factory, whether the industry is doing well or not, that cost differential is marginal.
In our industry, when the price of Bitcoin drops, the price of Bitcoin miner drops. And then you have the technology cycles. And we've just gone through a technology upgrade cycle. And so if we were to go acquire another miner, they likely will have machines that are S19 J PROs or older, and they may have hosting agreements that don't necessarily fit our mix, which is why we prefer to buy the latest state-of-the-art miners to deploy them so we have an energy consumption advantage or an efficiency advantage, if you would, in the industry. And then really drive the types of hosting agreements that fit our model ideally.
So with that, as I've said to many people, I don't foresee us going and consolidating the industry necessarily. But that being said, there may be unique opportunities, and we'll obviously be open to looking at things. And our next question comes from Brian D. who asks, what is your energy diversification strategy to avoid overexposure to any 1 provider like a Compute North and/or avoid another Hardin incident? Is there any consideration of hosting some of your own miners? So if by hosting some of our own miners, it means owning hosting infrastructure sites ourselves and contracting for power directly, our model currently is asset-light, where we don't like to invest in the infrastructure. That being said, there are potentially new solutions for energy that would cause Marathon to potentially invest in developing those further, which could drive our energy costs down substantially in the future.
I think one of the most important thing for miners to have control over is not their infrastructure, but it's the power price. And if you can control your cost of power and drive that down, then you'll have a better competitive position than they did [indiscernible] miner. At this point in the interest of time, I think we'll wrap up the section of Q&A. Again, we really appreciate the questions and interest from all the investors who added to the Q&A platform. I'm now going to turn the call back to Diego, our operator, to open the line for questions from our covering analysts. Diego, the mic is yours. Thank you. And we're now going to open the call to questions from Marathon covering analysts. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Maybe to pick up on a comment, actually, you just made, Fred, on the importance of controlling your power. I wonder if you could just give us some more details on the hosting agreements you have with Applied Digital and this next wave with Compute North? Like how are those power agreements structured? And are they structured in a way that, I guess, maybe a continued low price of Bitcoin or rising network cash rate coupled with rising energy costs kind of protects you guys from these hosting providers having future issues such as what Compute North is having right now with their bankruptcy? So the applied digital hosting agreements are at fixed price. So rising cost of energy doesn't impact our hosting costs in those circumstances. In the case of the King Mountain site, as we've talked about before, we have a PPA on the wind side that is extremely attractive energy price, that also gives us the ability to sell that energy to the grid whenever ERCOT needs it, and we get 100% of that upside. And for the balance of the energy there, we're buying from the market and following traditional principles of dealing with energy cost risk mitigation.
If you look at the future, what's important is being really at the point of power generation as opposed to being on the grid at all. And I don't really want to kind of open the too much on this because it's a strategy we haven't talked publicly about a lot. But suffice it to say that we believe that Bitcoin miners in the future will be very intertwined with the energy industry and more directly in energy generation than before.
But this is kind of an extension of the thoughts that we've had regarding partnering directly with the power industry. And in those circumstances, hosting is only just an outsourced service you procure from somebody. As long as you control your input costs, the rest is really just question of deciding what do you want to own and what don't you want to own. Right. Okay. And then maybe a question for Hugh. On -- so you guys used some of your Bitcoin as collateral, I guess, on your line of credit. I think you said you were taking out a term loan. But I mean, I guess the bigger question is why in this -- with these debt costs today and in these uncertain markets, like why take out an additional term loan and more debt? And why not just pay down Bitcoin and use that to fund your business? It's just a treasury management decision that we've made keeping our flexibility for the price appreciation of Bitcoin. There's really nothing more to it than that. The term loan we put in place last quarter and it's a $100 million term loan for 2 years. And we consider that part of our sort of longer-term cap structure evaluation. And we try to balance kind of the short-term needs and the ultimate long-term needs of the company when we come up with those decisions, and that's where we ended up. Our next question comes from Chase White with Compass Research and Trading. Could you just give us a bit more color on kind of the regulatory issues with ERCOT at the Wolf Hollow side? And any idea when those could be resolved? And what options do you have if there continues to be delays? So our understanding is that ERCOT is going to give a decision on energization imminently. I don't believe it will be a negative. But the number of miners we have installed there in the scope of our overall miner fleet is quite small. And obviously, in today's marketplace, there are a lot of opportunities to plug holes 5,000 miners here, 10,000 miners there very cost efficiently. There are a lot of people whose miners have been shut off and can't run. They have PPAs to cover. And so we're seeing ample opportunities to essentially cover that mix if we need to, and we don't believe at all is going to impact our delivery of our 23 exahash. Great. That's helpful. And then how much in prepayments do you guys have left for the year? I might have missed that. But for the year-end, just in total, on the main orders that you have for the 23 exahash? We said that it's very modest. When I look at our investments for -- when you look at what we've spent so far this year and I look at where we are -- where we're going, we spent about $200 million in the first quarter, $207 million in the second quarter, around $96 million in the third. The fourth quarter is going to be pretty light. It will probably be $20 million or $30 million. Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Just first, Fred, can you just clarify for me, did you say that the PPA with Applied is a fixed PPA? Yes. Okay. I'm just curious, in light of that comment, we saw like from document on July -- July this year, excuse me, some verbiage around the ability for applied to pass through some higher power cost up to a certain threshold, and then I just was curious, is that document just to disregard it? Or anything you can say around there? Let me go back and look at the document, the fully executed MSA before I respond to that. Okay. I appreciate that. And then my other question was regards to guidance for -- you reiterated the 23.3, but -- and I know you don't really explicitly give near-term guidance. But I did notice you're now expecting to reach 9 exahash by the end of the year, and that was a downward revision from your October '19 presentation of 11.5 exahash, which was a downward revision from prior to that at 13.4. So can you maybe just talk through what's driving the lower near-term guidance on hash rate for the company? Sure. So it's driven by a couple of things. One is when you contract for the hosting and when they actually have it ready and live to go, there can sometimes be 30- or 60-day lags in that. What you're seeing is us being a little bit more prudent regarding the full energization of the first Applied Digital site in Texas and how that flips over into the new year. But again, we're not changing our end number for midyear at all. Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. . My first question is on -- it's a modeling question. In terms of modeling uptime in Q4 and then also in 2023, when you hit the 9 exahash threshold, when you then hit the 23.3 exahash threshold, what's a good range to model for equipment miner uptime? That's my first question. So with Wolf Hollow, we have a very short period of experience so far. We're seeing very good uptime though at that site, actually exceptional uptime. So it's a little too early to tell, most probably on that, but we've not had a lot of curtailment there at all in comparison to other sites in Texas that we've been monitoring. So I think you're going to see that remaining quite high. Let us get back to you with a better number on that.
The other Applied Digital sites, we expect to have very good uptime to as well, especially the North Dakota site just because the climatology is much better there, and there's an opportunity for us to overclock miners at that site during the right times of the year. But again, for the Texas sites, you are going to have to look at some seasonality because of temperature. And we're still very early on in that. So we'll -- more than happy to work with you on kind of coming up with a model and a way to look at that. I appreciate the color. And then second question is more strategic. Obviously, there's a ton of distress in the space miner. Prices are way down on a dollar per terahash basis. And Fred, how are you looking at the opportunity set here? Is this the time to raise more capital, be more aggressive? Or would you say, look, you have 23.3 as a target for the middle of next year, let's kind of stick to that. I'm just kind of trying to get a sense for your strategic priorities given the distress in the industry. Sure. So as stated in the call, our primary priority remains getting the 23.3 exahash deployed and operational. Beyond that, so as you look at the back half of next year, we're obviously continuing to evaluate opportunities for expansion. And I think over the next couple of months, you'll see us talk more broadly about that. But obviously, this is a time period where you can acquire miners at very low cost. And then there's more and more hosting opportunities becoming available each day. But we're also thinking more about the long term, and really, it's not a question of just grow for growth sake, but how do we grow strategically so that we're getting better and better leverage on energy costs, and we're getting better and better uptime and availability as we transition to things like immersion and operating in locations where we get very good opportunities for energy arbitrage. And then I'll squeeze in one last one, if I may. What is the current mix between XPs and J PROs? And if you want to pick the 9 exahash figure for the end of the year, that's fine, too. Just trying to get a sense of what the current breakdown is between XPs and J PROs.
And then secondly, how are the XPs performing versus the S19 J PROs? Are there any notable performance differences other than, of course, the specified performance metrics, just in terms of uptime and things like that, Yes. So today, I would say that -- so the King Mountain site is all -- it's S19 J PROs. So that's the bulk of our capacity today. We have a couple of other smaller sites running as S19 J PRO as well. And the first XPs really go into production will follow. And then applied Digital is 100% XPs. So you'll see a little bit of XP coming online in Q4. But really, it's in the first 6 months of next year, you'll see the bulk of those XPs come online.
So the mix, when fully deployed, 66% of our hash rate will come from XP. That might actually be 65-point something, but generally speaking, about 2/3 of our hash rate will be XP by mid next year. If you look at from a performance perspective, so anecdotally, what I would say is the XP is a better quality machine than the S-19 JPRO. It operates -- it has a cooler operating range. So if you're looking at the difference between the input air temperature and the output air temperature, we're seeing definite advantages on the XPs. And that means you can run them potentially in slightly warmer climates without them having to shut down. And it also speaks very positively about the opportunities for overclocking them. So to date, we're very happy and pleased with what we're seeing out of the XPs that we've been operating in our labs and as we begin to [indiscernible]. Our next question comes from Greg Lewis with BTIG. This is Tyler on for Greg. Most of mine have been answered, but I just wanted to follow up on the merge comments, Fred. Could you maybe provide a little bit more color on how you're viewing emerging today realizing that the XPs are going to be rolled out and then you allude to the 60% of the fleet, I think, by the middle of next year. Just trying to get a sense as to where the merge is really going to come into play? And as we start to get a real meaningful incremental benefit? Just any other color on that front would be appreciated. Sure. So immersion is ideal for use in places like Texas, anywhere where there's a warm climate because it provides for a more stable operating environment for the miners. So you're not having to shut down the miner due to temperature issues. You still have -- if you have to curtail for power issues, you have to curtail regardless.
We believe that Immersion allows the miner to operate in a narrower temperature range, which then extends potentially its life and decreases the amount of times you have to touch a miner. So your total cost of ownership with immersion in theory should be less. And I'd say, in theory, because with air-cooled miners, you're having to really clean the miners and touch them at least kind of once a month. And with liquid immersion, that need for cleaning kind of disappears. And so it comes then down to failure rates of components and things like that.
And again, if the operating temperatures aren't as extreme because you're keeping them immersed in fluid, then in theory, there should be less of that. So we believe that the advantages and immersion excluding the ability to overclock our longer life span on the minor and lower cost of ownership to maintain and manage them.
In regards to the overclock, there are certain vendors who have published results of overclocking S-19 J PROs as much as 60%, 70%. And to date with XPs, there are still some firmware hurdles, but those have been solved for the most part, I think. And so we'll see kind of what the test results are -- we're talking with the XPs. But we believe that there's very good opportunities just based on how they perform in error that they will be able to perform exceptionally well in immersion. Our next question comes from Brian Dobson with Chardan Capital. So you mentioned global geographies becoming more appealing for mining. Could you elaborate on which geographies you're seeing becoming more appealing? And is Africa an area that you see as an area of opportunity? So I'll answer it in this way. You have certain geographies where you have very good energy infrastructure. You have no risk of regime shift. You have a good legal system, but you may have energy asymmetry due to seasonality where you need a lot of energy in 1 season to provide cooling or heating. And in the opposite end of the calendar, you don't need as much energy. So there's a lot of idle energy sitting there.
Those locations are very interesting. You have areas like Latin America, where you have ample hydroelectricity that is for the most part, not utilized perfectly. And so that makes it available to Bitcoin mining. You have parts of the Middle East, where you have this temperature asymmetry in seasonality, and you have some opportunities potentially in Asia.
Africa, unfortunately, today outside of North Africa and the Middle East, you have too much issues around regime risk. And while you have, for example, in Kenya, very ample geothermal opportunities, I think Kenya has published data about up to 17 gigawatts of geothermal energy being available to be developed. You have issues with regime risk, getting infrastructure in place and other things. So at this point, as we're looking around the world, it's really predominantly kind of Latin America, Middle East, parts of Asia. Yes. That's interesting. So turning to global difficulty, I guess, where do you see it now? And what are your thoughts on next year given the price of Bitcoin? Well, the beauty of the Bitcoin network is that it's constantly looking for stasis, right? And so when the price of Bitcoin drops, people have to unplug miners because they can't operate profitably. As we said on the call, the cost to operate an S19 J PRO, if your energy cost, energy and hosting costs, if you put those 2 together, is north of $0.085. You're getting to a point where you're most probably not operating profitably. And if you look at the most recent price drop of Bitcoin now down to kind of 18,000 range, there's some miners who are definitely about to become -- or are marginal operators, which is why we believe it's so important to really push hard to use S19 XPs because of the energy efficiency there. Our next question comes from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Hugh, yes, you mentioned $20 million to $30 million, perhaps right, payment in the fourth quarter. Is that the last payment that you have to make on the XP batch? Yes, that's our forecast for the fourth quarter of this year, and there's not much after that. Now -- and that's an all-in number, Kevin. That's payments, that's shipping, that's everything. Okay. Can you give us a balance sheet perspective on the 2 debt levers? Where were they at the end of September? And what do you expect them to be at the end of the year? What are you talking about that? Our level of debt? Well, yes, you said you're offsetting the revolver with a term loan. I just wanted to make sure I understand. So we've got $50 million in the term loan. Right now, we borrowed $50 million of revolver. We're going to borrow $50 million on the term loan and pay off the revolver. So all that we're going to have is we're going to have $100 million of debt outstanding. And that all happened towards the end of the year. That will happen in November. Okay. This month, okay. Right. So -- and then my whole point to that was the collateral is already outstanding for the revolver. So there's no additional collateral meter that revolve into a term loan. Right. So what was the total amount of Bitcoin as collateral? And then what are -- what's your interest rate payment associated with that? The rate is -- the term loan is the Wall Street Journal Prime plus 1.75%, so it's a floating rate. The Bitcoin that we used to collateralize, it's around -- I think it's around 3,800. It's probably around 7,600 for the whole 100 million. Okay. Okay. All right. That's kind of what tripped me up. I appreciate the detail. Our next question comes from Gus Gala with Truist Securities. I just wanted to understand what were the biggest -- I mean, what's the biggest like roadblock -- potential roadblocks to this 23 exahashes midyear '23 outlook? I mean we're -- as Steve pointed out earlier, we've pushed now. It's going to be 14 exahash, let's call it, in 6 months. What is maybe helping size of that 14 exahashes, what's going to be like maybe plugged in, but not energized at the beginning of the year? Just tell me with the cadence there a little bit. So you've got the applied digital site in Texas which we'll be deploying now in -- and so part of that will be potentially energized this side of the year and with the balance really in January potentially. Could it energize all this side of New Year? Possibly, but we prefer not to put that out there. So we're just taking a very prudent approach on that.
Relative to the North Dakota site, there's been very good construction progress to date. So right now, we're feeling very good with the deployment outside completely in Q2 and energizing that site. So it's really construction and potentially final approval from the electrical regulator in each location, but we don't think there'll be any issues with the Texas site because we're so close in on that. There are already miners being put on shelves there. So that's moving ahead. North Dakota site construction is moving ahead very nicely. We don't foresee any delays there currently so. Got it. And as we think about -- just how you think about running it where -- if Bitcoin remains sideway you would say, in a very bare case like through midway '24, how do we think about running the business and to have with depressed prices? Well, as long as we can mine profitably, we'll continue to mine profitably, right. There aren't a lot of reasons to operate your miners if you're losing money with every Bitcoin you're mining. So it's just something we have to keep a very watchful eye on. Right now, our margins are still quite nice. So we don't believe there's a lot of risk. We think price -- our margins would support Bitcoin dropping below this current range and still allowing us to operate.
The question is really more, as we get closer to the having, how Bitcoin is going to perform. And nobody can project that. Nobody would know that. But I think that at Bitcoin, we're at a price in the teens when we come to a having, I think that would have big implications for the whole industry. Thank you very much. Thank you. At this point, there are no further questions. I'm going to turn the call back to Charlie Schumacher for closing remarks. Thank you all for your time today. If you have any questions that were not answered during today's call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team at ir@mara.com. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chris Brendler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Sherry. Good morning and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings first quarter 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us for our call today. With me on the call our Chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel; and our CFO, Hugh Gallagher.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements.
Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. In addition, other risks are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be reviewed at www.sec.gov.
Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which Marathon excludes certain expenses from its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a full reconciliation of its non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Hugh. After their comments, we will be going through some of the more popular questions from our investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts.
And with that on the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Chris. We started 2023 with two primary goals for the year. The first is to energize our previously purchased mining rigs to reach our target of 23 exahashes by the middle of year and the second is to optimize our performance to become more effective and more efficient. As our monthly production demonstrate, we've been making notable progress executing on both of those initiatives. After weathering at tumultuous 2022, that tested the resilience of our entire industry, we started 2023 with our most productive quarter to-date.
During Q1, we increased our operational hash rate 64% from seven exahashes on January 1 to 11.5 exahashes on March 31. By growing our hash rate faster than the rest of the network and by improving our uptime, we also increased our Bitcoin production. We produced a record 2,195 Bitcoin during the first three months of this year, which is up 41% increase from the prior quarter.
April's production report which we published on May 2 shows that these positive trends have continued into Q2 as well. Thanks to the hard work of our team and our hosting partners, Marathon’s operational hash rate is now over 14 exahashes, double where we started the year and 61% of the way to our 23 exahash target. Additionally, our installed hash rate, which we define as our operational hash rate plus the hash rate that has been installed, but not yet energized, is approximately 18 exahashes, nearly 80 of the way to our goal.
Given our recent progress, we believe we are still on track to achieve 23 exahashes of capacity near the middle of this year. As a reminder, the miners have all been paid for, so the primary gating item at this point are the ongoing construction of the facilities, the pace of installations and some pending regulatory approvals to energize one facility where miners have already been installed in Texas. Given what we know today, the path to 23 exahashes remains clear and we believe the target is in sight.
Achieving 23 extra hashes will be a milestone for Marathon and for our industry as it will establish us as the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in North America. But this industry moves fast and to maintain our position as the industry leader, we must constantly push the pace of innovation.
In a few minutes, I'll discuss some of the ways in which our organization is evolving. But first, I'm going to turn the call over to Hugh to discuss our financial results for the first quarter. As you all know, Hugh will be retiring shortly after this earnings call. Hugh has been a valuable member of our team since he joined us a year ago. He was instrumental in developing our finance strategy, building our finance team and helping us transition from an early stage company into a more sophisticated organization. So on behalf of everyone at Marathon, thank you Hugh for your service.
And with that, I'll let you take it away. Hugh? Oh, thanks, Brad. And thanks for the kind remarks, I appreciate it. It’s been a pleasure to work here at Marathon, and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished during my time here. And I really do wish everyone at Marathon the best going forward.
But now let's focus on the results for the quarter, and I'll take you through them briefly. Improving Bitcoin prices, increased production and the commencement of our previously mentioned plan to start selling Bitcoin as a means of generating cash were the main drivers of our operating results for the first quarter.
Revenues for the quarter were $51.1 million slightly below prior year revenues of $51.7 million, as a 74% increase in Bitcoin production year-over-year was more than offset by lower average Bitcoin prices, compared to last year's quarter. We recorded a net loss of $7.2 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $12.9 million or $0.12 per share in the prior year quarter.
The $5.6 million favorable variance in net loss year-over-year was driven by three main factors. First, we realized the gains on sales of the digital asset associated with our sales program that was $17.6 million. Second impairment of digital assets improved by $11.5 million year-over-year as Bitcoin prices were generally increasing during this quarter. And third, you'll remember last year we had an investment fund with Bitcoin in it and it had a $5.3 million unrealized loss last year, we have no such fund this year, so we benefited from the absence of that loss.
Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a reduction in total margin of $25.3 million and to a lesser extent the impact of modest income tax expense in the current quarter versus a large benefit in the prior year, that was $4.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $18.6 million from $9.8 million in the prior year period and the drivers of adjusted EBITDA were similar to what I already mentioned, including the gain on sale of digital assets, reduction in impairment, the absence of the unrealized loss, and those benefits were offset by a lower margin excluding DNA, because we're talking about EBITDA of $21.5 million.
Turning to our Bitcoin Holdings cash flow and liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $12.4 million during the quarter to $124.9 million at March 31. Also at March 31, we held 11,466 Bitcoin with a carrying value of $189.1 million on the balance sheet, care value of a single Bitcoin was $28,474 in fair value of our holdings was approximately $326.5 million.
We reduced our leverage during the quarter when we repaid the entire $50 million outstanding on the term loan facility with Silvergate Bank and terminated both the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility. Although there were no prepayment penalties associated with this transaction, we did record a small loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million, this is primarily related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to those facilities.
We sold 2,900 bitcoins during the quarter realizing cash proceeds of $62.6 million, these proceeds were utilized to fund cash operating expenses during the quarter. Including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses and certain deposits we made in conjunction with the ramp up of production activities.
So all in all, a good quarter for the balance sheet as we increased our cash position by over $12 million, while also reducing leverage by $50 million. As mentioned in our April production report, our cash balance at April 30 was $123.5 million and we held 11,568 Bitcoin with a fair value of $319.2 million. So our most recent update is not that much different than the March results I just went through on the balance sheet.
We expect our future Bitcoin Holdings will generally increase, but will fluctuate depending upon operating and market conditions We intend to add to our Bitcoin Holdings primarily through our production activities and we will also continue to sell Bitcoin as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs and for general corporate purposes.
And that completes my update. So I'll now turn it back over to Fred, who will talk a little bit more about our operations and our ongoing plans. Fred? Thanks, Hugh, and thanks again for all your hard work. To ensure we maintain our leading position in the Bitcoin Mining industry, we need to constantly push the pace of innovation. It's easy to view Bitcoin Mining as commoditized. All miners convert electricity into economic value in the form of Bitcoin. The commodity we all produce may be fungible, but the techniques we implement to produce that commodity, the technologies we develop and deploy make all the difference.
At Marathon, we have always believed in staying ahead of the technology curve, because it allows us to optimize our performance and further differentiate Marathon from our competitors. We have continuously invested in the latest most energy efficient mining rigs and we're the only publicly traded miner that runs its own mining pool.
Now we're further leaning into this strategy to develop new proprietary mining techniques and own more of the process. Vertical integration is a popular term in our industry and when most people in the industry use that term, they're really referencing power in data centers. We take a different approach. Marathon is the only Bitcoin miner that is vertically integrating the Bitcoin Mining technology stack, we're the only miner that either directly controls or influences each aspect of the Bitcoin Mining tech stack, all the way from the mining pool down to the ASIC. This includes our mining software, firmware, hardware and infrastructure. Bitcoin Mining is a game of speed and efficiency and we believe technological innovation is essential to maintaining an edge in both.
Let me give you some examples of our key competitive advantages. We operate our own mining pool MaraPool, which reduces latency and allows us to orchestrate how and when miners working to solve a block. Our team has built custom controller boards, which gives us flexibility over firmware. We have always invested in the latest and most efficient mining hardware and we maintain good relationships with manufacturers.
Once fully deployed, we expect to be one of the most energy efficient Bitcoin miners at scale as 66% of our hash rate will come from S19 XPs, which are 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation. And we've been designing, co-developing and deploying immersion cooling infrastructure that reduces maintenance and improves efficiency. In fact, our technology expertise is one of the primary reasons we were selected by Zero Two to help develop and operate the first large scale immersion Bitcoin mining facilities in the Middle East. The details of which we disclosed in a press release earlier this week.
While our first domestic deployment of immersion cooling came online last month at [Technical Difficulty] Applied Digital facilities in North Dakota. We had already been successfully running immersion in Abu Dhabi as part of a pilot program with Zero Two, due to its climate, the Middle East is an incredibly challenging place to mine Bitcoin. This part of the world should have been -- should be a haven for Bitcoin miners, because it has an abundance of stranded sustainable energy, but the climatology, the heat and the dust has made deploying air cooled miners in the region infeasible.
Typically, air cooled miners require cleaning and maintenance approximately every 30-days, even in favorable weather. In unfavorable weather, air cooled operations need almost daily attention. However, with the immersion pilot we co-developed, the miners ran for over 100-days without any maintenance needed, despite being in one of the most challenging climates imaginable for Bitcoin Mining.
Immersion like the type we're deploying that reduces maintenance and runs effectively in harsh climates suddenly opens the door to several new opportunities, the first of which for Marathon is in Abu Dhabi. With the pilot successfully complete, we were selected by Zero two to be their partner in developing and operating the first large scale immersion Bitcoin mining facilities in the Middle East. The joint venture we are establishing is for two sites, a 50-megawatt site in the port zone of Mina Zayed and a 200 megawatt site in Masdar City, which is the sustainability hub for Abu Dhabi. Both sites are expected to be operational before the end of this year.
In aggregate, they will generate approximately seven exahashes of security for the Bitcoin network and through the JV, we will represent 20% of the total project. And just to be clear, our 20% is additive to our 23 exhahash target. While we are intently focused on optimizing the mining tech stack, innovation doesn't just come from technology, it can also be expressed in business models. And the joint venture we entered into with Zero Two is the first example of this evolution.
In 2021 and 2022, our strategy was simple. It was to be asset light, to outsource the muscle of our operations and to remain as lean and scrappy as possible. By outsourcing, we were able to grow faster than our competition as it allowed us to invest most of our capital almost exclusively in mining rigs, which are revenue generating assets. But we are also able to avoid many of the pitfalls that other miners fell into last year, including over leveraging their business with debt or being upside down on power contracts.
This strategy was essential to building the foundation on which we now stand and from which we are growing this year. But all businesses evolve. Startups outsource initially, but once they've established a proof-of-concept and found product market fit, they begin to bring more resources in-house to optimize their processes and they begin to iterate on their business model to become more effective and ideally more profitable in the long run.
Marathon is currently going through this growth phase, while public, we were essentially a start up at the beginning of last year and now after proving out our initial thesis we are evolving. We're taking what we learned over the past two years and we're starting to build some of the muscle in-house. This muscle includes several new team members across operations, strategy, growth and technology. It also includes designing and investing in the technologies of the future like immersion cooling, as well as taking a more active role in the development and management of some of our current and future deployments.
To be clear, we aren't abandoning asset light, we have no intention of losing our agility, but we do believe that diversification is integral to creating a more resilient business. We've been applying this principle to our operations over the past year by adding new hosting providers and deploying our mining rigs in different geographies. Now with the joint venture with Zero Two, we're starting to apply it to our business model.
When done correctly, joint venture can be a synergistic as it allows each party to play to their strengths. We have deep technical mining expertise and experience with a variety of mining sites, business models and geographies. Zero Two is a local, well capitalized collaborator with a regional expertise, a proven record of infrastructure development. For us, this was an ideal match. Each deployment comes with its own unique challenges and requires a curated approach. We believe in staying flexible and adapting to the circumstances to ensure the best outcome. And technological innovation and adaptation are in our DNA, and we believe they will remain key components of our future as we continue to pursue to expand Marathon's footprint and diversify our operations.
We're becoming more diversified, more sophisticated and as a result more resilient. We're smarter now than we were a year ago and ultimately in a much better position. We're a company with a strong balance sheet, a roadmap to hitting our primary target of 23 exahashes of capacity near the middle of this year, a growing team of subject matter experts, a technology stack that is becoming increasingly more vertically integrated and efficient and a unique approach to mining that's allowing us to effectively expand our hash rate to support the Bitcoin network.
At Marathon, we're all working extremely hard to ensure that we energize our portfolio of mining rigs on schedule and that we optimize our operations to become not just one of the largest, but one of the most energy efficient and most technologically advanced Bitcoin mining companies in the world.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris, so we can begin with questions. Chris? Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start with -- by answering some of the questions submitted by investors on our Q&A platform. Our first question comes from Brandon. B. What is the minimum bitcoin price that would allow you to sustain for profitability based on current operating costs, would it be Fred? So, the breakeven price if you would of Bitcoin Mining is very dependent on global hash rate and current energy prices and obviously the price of Bitcoin. So it really is a very complex kind of question. But essentially, we're constantly optimizing our operations to make sure that we're operating with the right mix of hash rate dependent on the energy cost and the price of Bitcoin. So I think as you kind of look at Bitcoin pricing, you can kind of look in the rearview mirror at where our average cost to mine at Bitcoin was in Q1. And as you roll forward, an expectation would be essentially to look at growth in the global hash rate and what projections for energy pricing are going forward, which for the summer months we may see obviously some seasonality in energy pricing in certain markets, due to just weather driving more demand for energy or less. But our expectation is that obviously more hashrate will continue to come online and so that kind of breakeven point will continue to edge up sort of month-by-month. Great, okay. Our next question comes from Jacob. B. Yes, are we still on course to achieve our 23 exahash per second target by June or July? And what obstacles may get in the way of that goal? Also, what is the cause of our hash rate run over the last week. We've hit block numbers, we've never seen. What's the catalyst? [Multiple Speakers] Yes. Thank you. So we're still on course to hit our 23 exahashes we reiterated kind of throughout this call by the middle of this year. What obstacles can get in the way of that goal. At this point, it's really down to some final construction that's going on, which we don't foresee currently, any challenges with. And then just regulatory approval of one site in Texas where we have machines installed currently and we're just waiting for energization. Those are kind of the only two things that we see as any potential risk there.
Obviously, all the machines have been purchased, virtually all of them have been delivered. And what can be installed, has been installed and the rest are just waiting for buildings to be completed. So we're feeling very confident about that. If you think about the hash rate run over the last week, many of you are familiar with the luck factor that exists within Bitcoin Mining and over time in theory, your luck should kind of even out. I'd love to say that it's because our technology stack is performing better-than-expected, but I'm not going to make that comment quite yet until we have more historical data to kind of go from. But we've been very pleased with the results needless to say. And certainly, based on kind of what everybody can see in the Min Pool by looking at how MaraPool is performing. We're definitely performing north of expectations from just pure hash rate and average BTC produced per exahash numbers that many of the analysts put out there. Great, okay. Our next question comes from Chaitre. A. Are you planning on selling any Bitcoin soon? If not, do you have enough capital for the operations for the next four years? I can take that. We sell Bitcoin to cover operating expenses as we've done all this year. Essentially will cover energy costs operating expenses. And then any Bitcoin that's left after that, we save put on the balance sheet and huddle. So every month we've been increasing our holdings to some degree or another. Other than potentially in January when we sold more Bitcoin than we produced. But as you look at our capital requirements, going forward, we've essentially fully funded the 23 exahash growth target for this year. We've funded the vast majority of the Abu Dhabi project as well.
So barring additional expansion in the back half of this year and early next year. We're pretty well set from CapEx spend perspective at this point. I'm not going to kind of comment on the next four years, because that's a whole cycle in this industry and we'll have to see how things go. Yes. Sounds good, okay. Let's go to Bra. M. Yes, countries like the U.S. and Sweden are implementing or attempting to implement large tax penalties on Bitcoin miners. What are you doing to avoid fight or position the company against these proposed and pass discriminatory taxes? Well, we have no operations in Sweden, so we're not very active in that area. And to be fair in Sweden, what they did was essentially remove tax abatement that they had and essentially removed the discount. And so those energy rates went back to what they had been previously. And that affected the broad data center space completely, it wasn't just something targeting Bitcoin miners.
In the U.S. very different story, the Biden administration's proposal of an excise tax on energy used by Bitcoin Mining is another example of this industry being specifically targeted in an unfair way. If you were to think about different ways to save on energy wastage. The vast majority of energy used in this country is used for heating and cooling of homes. And I think the government should think more seriously about if you're going to restrict an industry, then restrict instead the wasting of energy across all industries. If you want to reduce carbon emissions in this country, Bitcoin miners are the biggest users of renewable energy of any industry and consume less than a percent of the energy generated globally.
And you should focus instead if I were the administration on fossil fuel industry, which when it comes to our electrical energy generation coal is still 19% of our energy generation focused there as opposed to targeting the Bitcoin Mining industries. This is clearly just a veiled attempt at trying to push Bitcoin Mining offshore, which is something we believe potentially could threaten U.S. National Security and we think it's very important for the U.S. to maintain a strong position in securing the Bitcoin network by allowing Bitcoin Mining to operate within the U.S. along fair economical terms. Okay. [Indiscernible] ask can you briefly expand on Marathon Digital Holdings mission for its investors regarding growing valuation and dividends? I'm not going to comment on dividends. Companies that pay dividends typically are just mature industries where there's typically not a lot of growth happening and it's really just about optimization. In the Bitcoin Mining industry, we are driven to continue to grow our capacity, because of the increase in the difficulty rate and the -- having a Bitcoin that happens every four years. And so we're very focused on continuing to grow. We've done a huge amount of growth this year, we've already doubled our capacity from where we were at the beginning of the year and we're going to increase it further nearly 50% by the time we hit our 23 exahash target around the middle of this year.
And so we'll continue to grow in the future. We've not made any public pronouncements as to how much. But I think you could infer that minimally we would want to maintain our share of the global hash rate. Going forward to maintain our share of the Bitcoin that are awarded each day. Okay. Well, in the interest of time, I think we'll have to wrap up this part of the Q&A. Thanks to our investors. We really appreciate your interest and your questions. I'll now turn the call back over to our operator to open the line to questions from our covering analysts.
Sherry, back to you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joe Flynn with Compass Point Research and Trading. Please proceed. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. We're curious what drove the lower uptime in April compared to the March? And if you could comment on maybe the incremental fee benefit you've been getting from [ordinals] (ph) and just overall network activity, looks pretty strong this quarter and it looks like it started picking up as early as March? Thanks. Sure. So what drove April's production results are a combination of some curtailment in Texas, due to heat, as well as one less day of mining, 30-days versus 31-days in the month. And the increase in the global -- in the difficulty rate, because of the increase in the global hash rate, primarily.
As you look at the impact of ordinals, obviously we've seen blocked rewards go up considerably. Where typically the average block reward we've previously been seeing is somewhere in the, kind of, 0.2 to 0.5 Bitcoin per block. There were some blocks that were won by various pools at over 6.25 Bitcoin per block meaning that the transaction fees were greater than the block reward fees provided by the Bitcoin network.
I think this is likely going to be a kind of an initial frenzy as people use, kind of, BRC-20 tokens and are leveraging ordinals. And I think over time, what we'll find is the competition for getting blocks processed and transactions processed that have driven up the fees will abate a little bit and we'll see more normalized transaction fees. Still above historical, kind of, trends in the most recent periods, but not at the levels of 6 BTC per block. I think the -- there'll be some technologies that will likely come to market, which will enable people to achieve the same outcome on the Bitcoin network as BRC-20 and Ordinals have enabled, but without causing as competitive erase around the transaction fees.
And I'm strong believer in innovation in this space and I think we'll continue to see development of applications and business and use cases on top of the Bitcoin blockchain accelerate, we've seen -- if you look at the data around the creation of wallets on the Bitcoin network, it's at a record level, back near or above the levels of 2017. And so obviously there's a huge demand to build things on the Bitcoin blockchain. Development team's focus on the Bitcoin blockchain have expanded considerably. And we're obviously very interested in fermenting as much development on this network as possible, because we believe a strong Bitcoin network is the best thing for not just the industry, but this country as well. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just one more question on, kind of, if you could expand in your capital allocation plans going forward. As you mentioned, most of the CapEx is paid for at the JV and all the miners are purchased. So just more specifically on that point, have you considered using the cash in Bitcoin on hand to buy back the convert here, like at a significant discount? Yes, I'm not going to comment on the convert, but we're obviously very focused on managing the company's assets as effectively and efficiently as possible. And we'll continue to evaluate growth opportunities and obviously balance sheet opportunities as we move forward. And we'll announce plans kind of as they happen. Alright. Thanks. Our next question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed. Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Fred, I wanted to circle back to the earlier question regarding production cost and maybe take a slightly different angle. Could you comment on the average power cost in Q1? In terms of kind of 10s per kilowatt hour and what would be your outlook for power cost once you fully ramped up to the 23.3 exahash? Thank you. Sure. The difficulty, Lucas, as you're aware, is in some cases, we pay for energy and hosting separately. But in most of our third-party hosting, it's actually baked together. So I can only really talk about combined posting an energy cost as opposed to just energy broken out. But I think you can look at, kind of, the numbers there and see that our energy costs are -- and hosting costs all combined are somewhere in the, kind of, $0.06 to $0.07 range most probably doing a calculus back of the envelope. I think that would be a fair place to put it. But again, that's hosting plus energy cost. The only place where we currently break it out is really our King Mountain site is the only place where we could break it out separately. Very helpful. Thank you. And then that $0.06 to $0.07 would supply to the fully ramp 23.3? Yes. Very helpful. Thank you for that. And then I know you've got a few questions already in regards to investments over the course of this year. Again, I want to take a slightly different angle looking at Q1 cash flow statement. I kind of see three buckets, advances to vendors, purchase of PP&E or P&E rather. And then also investments in the joint venture. And I just wondered if you could maybe elaborate on each of those buckets exactly, kind of, what use, for example, in the joint ventures, is that in Abu Dhabi or is that related to Kings Mountain et cetera. So would appreciate the color on those investments and then also kind of at the end of the year where would you expect these various buckets to stand based on your current budget? Thank you very much. I mean, the way we look at it -- yes. Thank you, Hugh. I'll just jump in. Lucas, I think the way I would look at it is as Fred mentioned, the 23 exahash is paid for, so we don't have any real significant CapEx related to hitting that. That doesn't mean where we won't continue to look to grow the business going forward. I think the one that you could probably most easily comment on and get clarity on is the investment in the joint venture, that is all related to the Abu Dhabi JV, it's $43 million so far. We said earlier in the initial announcement that we expected the entire JV to be around $406 million, 20% is our share, so 20% of that is in the $80 million range, a little bit over $80 million. So we're kind of halfway through that.
And I think that's probably the best way to kind of walk you through it. As you can see when you compare our cash flow this quarter to last year's quarter as we've already said significantly lower, because most of the advances to vendors most of what happened in the first quarter was receipt of equipment and not necessarily purchases of any new equipment. Any purchases of PP&E that you see there are probably just some maybe some containers here and there for immersion and things like that, nothing really significant. That is very helpful. Thank you for all the color and I'll turn it over. Best of luck. Thanks. Our next question is from Tyler DiMatteo with BTIG. Please proceed. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So Fred, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the vertical integration with the mining tech stack. Can you provide a little more color there and how you're thinking about integrating some of those technologies into the business the uptime of rigs from emerging, for example, I know it's a pretty big thing that you talk about. Any other color there that you could, kind of, speak to that you're looking towards through this year maybe in the next? Sure. So I think a great way to look at this is and again, don't translate these numbers literally. But if you look at the mobile telephone industry and you look at Apple versus any other vendor, Apple with less than 20% share of the mobile industry generates over 80% of the gross margins in the industry, because of their vertically integrated tech stack. They have the hardware device. In the hardware device, they have chips. They have the operating system on the device, they operate to cloud services and get a fee on kind of transactions if you would that are done through their cloud services.
If you correlate that to our tech stack, what is the equivalent of, kind of, cloud services for us is our pool. The pool is the orchestration layer that essentially instructs miners what to do. In a traditional third-party pool, the challenge is that they have to be able to properly task and control miners with a huge amount of variation in them. They may have old S9s old S17s by Bitmain, they may have micro BT machines, they may have all sorts of machines of different generations, different efficiencies, different latencies, different capacities connecting to their pool and they have to manage those, kind of, equally, which means typically third-party pools are optimizing to the lowest common denominator. That creates inefficiency if you're a large scale miner, who has the most advanced equipment in the industry. And as we've said repeatedly, 66% of our pass rate will be coming from S19-XPs, which are the most energy efficient miners and amongst the most powerful miners in the industry today.
So being member of a pool that's optimized to a lower common denominator of S9s and S17s doesn't make sense. And while it's not going to generate a huge increase in the operational efficiency, it does add incremental efficiency. And in our industry, a 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% increase in efficiency can be very significant. And so you start with the pool and by having our own pool, we essentially don't have to design it to operate with third-parties in mind. So everything we do can be optimized to efficiency. We can remove every second of latency in the communication, because a, we don't have an issue of having to validate the miners that into our pool, because it's our own pool, it's proprietary connections. And so we can save on that step for example in the operational process of the pool.
So things like that allow us to gain a few single-digit percentage points of efficiency, which allows our pool to sometimes potentially not saying it's the reason why, but potentially outperform the average pools out there from a perspective of how many Bitcoin per exahash do they produce? The next layer down is the management layer that actually operates a site. And so together with the firmware that we have built, which allows us again optimize the operation of the miner specifically to our need as opposed to using a third-party firmware that's operating in the miner that has to cover lots of different machines or the stock firmware that comes from the vendor. Our firmware is specifically optimized to work with our pool and also with our controller boards and our controller boards provide us greater control over the miner. It allows us to do things like flashing updates over the air, so you don't have to go physically go and update each miner, you can all do it remotely. It lets us control and track the operation of every miner down to the hardware layer, which again allows us to optimize their performance specifically to the needs of a specific site.
So at a specific site, you may have temperature variations going on. You may have energy prices changing. You may be doing intelligent control of curtailment. All things like that start entering into the technology stack and having a very significant impact on the operating results of an individual miner, a site and therefore the company. So that's kind of a way to look at it.
The other way to look at it is over time, we're going to integrate much more even down to the basic layer on the board of the miner itself. And I think you'll see through some future announcements what we've been doing in that area. And I think we will be absolutely the only miner, who is fully integrated from pool down to ASIC in the industry and we view that as a very critical differentiation. Okay, great. Thank you. I really appreciate that. And then I want to follow-up. You made some comments on the immersion applied digital and now you're working towards the JV. But you allude to some of those other opportunities presumably, you may have mentioned a little bit of those, but can you just provide some more color on those as well if there's anything that you didn't just touch upon, please? Yes. So as it relates to immersion, there's this concept in the technology industry about you're either a pioneer and you're the company that, kind of, is the first one into an industry and -- or technology. And then there's a concept called fast followers. And if you look throughout history in the technology industry and I've spent 40-years in this industry. Clearly, pioneers get arrows in their back and the fast followers are the ones who win and the typical example people use is Google isn't the first search engine, Facebook, wasn't the first social media site, et cetera. So it's typically a fast follower can build upon the learnings of the pioneers and do something much better.
And so we like many companies and again the analog to kind of Apple. Apple is typically not the first one into a -- with an innovation in a sector. They typically wait, see how things develop and come out with a much better optimized version and that was our approach to immersion. We looked at a lot of the Gen 1 versions of immersion and how people had done those. And we realized there were some shortcomings in those systems and we had a couple of design criteria that we wanted to have. One was simplicity and cost efficiency, it had to be as low cost as possible from a CapEx perspective to deploy it. It had to have the highest degree of reliability and uptime and be able to be controlled and maintained remotely. So that you didn't have to have large team of people on the ground.
And as could be -- as we were able to prove in the Abu Dhabi, pilot. There are very few places where Bitcoin Mining goes on where the operation can be totally done lights out, so to say with nobody touching machines and maintaining things for a 100-day period, that's kind of unheard of in this industry. And what that opens up the ability to do is now, a, you're lowering your operating cost of sites, because you have fewer people on the ground having to maintain machines and the systems uptime. What it also does is it lowers the economic barrier to doing smaller scale sites, because now typically the industry has been driven to do utility scale sites north of 50 megawatts, because just that's what pencil is best relative to the number of people you have to have on the ground to maintain and operate the site.
But with our immersion technology solution, we believe that we can go downsize in sites, which opens up many more opportunities globally for places where we can mine and the ability to do so with very little operating team member involvement allows us to run a vastly, kind of, distributed network if we wanted to do that. So there's some technology design decisions in there that we're really key on. How do we become the most highly optimized miner out there and especially with emerging technology using this generation that we're now deploying with Abu Dhabi and we're continuing to evolve. That even as we speak further and adding more enhancements to it. I think what you'll see is we will lead always with technology whether it's the fastest most energy efficient machines, whether it's the best immersion technology, best firmware, best controller boards, best pool, et cetera. Okay. Great. Thank you. Really appreciate that, Fred. I'll turn it back to the queue. Our next question is from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed. Good morning, gents. Thanks for taking the questions. Fred, can we go back to the curtailment announcement or comment that you made with regard to the March -- sorry, yes, March operation. April? April. April. Right. Could you add maybe a little more color to that. At what point do you get to decide or do you rely on your hosting partners to decide? What's sort of the threshold? How do you look at weather patterns? And I don't know, just maybe just give us some insight on your thinking around curtailment and how you're going to manage it? Yes. So kind of think of it this way. Unlike some of our competitors who operate single sites have all of their hash rate coming from one site and are subject to the foibles of the grid and our power generation sources that they have at the one site. We have our operations now distributed across many, many sites. And so each site handles curtailment slightly differently from an operational perspective. For example, at King Mountain in Texas, what's unique is we have a direct PPA for the wind energy there, which drives some decisions as to whether we're going to sell that energy or consume it ourselves. Based on where the current price of Bitcoin is, global hash rate and energy prices in the grid market.
And then that's kind of also limited by the systems that our third-party partners in this case U.S. BTC have deployed on the ground. We've been doing number of upgrades with them to how curtailment is being handled and I think what you'll see is with the enhancements -- the technology enhancements that are being put in place the systems are becoming more intelligent in our ability to really optimize when we shut down and how we shutdown. We'll start seeing some benefits here as we go into the summer months, where typically in Texas you have higher heat and therefore you have issues around heat generated curtailment, which is not a grid issue that's an operations issue, but it's still important because it is a curtailment of operations if you would. And so some of the things our custom firmware allows us to do is optimize both under clocking and over clocking at miners as a way to deal with heat.
With the APLD sites, for example, again, it's kind of site specific, how we deal with curtailment though, because the North Dakota location of those sites is very different than West Texas, where King Mountain is, different weather patterns, different seasonality different issues, great operators, et cetera. So our diversified strategy allows us to have a very diverse exposure to curtailment. And as we continue to explore and deploy more immersion, we'll have less curtailment due to heat. In places where we use the emerging technology and as we continue to build out our operations capabilities around managing in an automated fashion.
Energy pricing curtailment, you'll see some advancements in efficiency there. And I think obviously as we get involved in opportunities where we're actually controlling the power purchases, you will be able to take advantage of some of the tools that exist for buying blocks and hedging and things like that as well, which will further optimize operations there. So think of it as we're just starting on this journey of optimizing curtailment, but they'll see continual benefits throughout this year. Can we carry that discussion over to the Abu Dhabi installation, Fred, please? I know you said 250 megawatts and seven exahashes. Is that seven nameplate? Can you talk about overclocking, underclocking there. Maybe you can offer some insight on the performance you saw in your pilot with overclocking? And then how should we assume that power comes online? Do you think it's all in by the end of this year or maybe give us a little more insight? I know you said that you'd have something going this year. I just wasn't -- I guess, I just missed the details. Apologies. Sure. So in reverse order, the site will be fully operational by the end of this year, all 250 megawatts. And like any of our deployments, you'll see it come on gradually. Starting in the not too distant future here and then accelerating as more equipment has, kind of, landed on the ground and installed. So we'd obviously specifically if you want to think about curtailment there in the summer months, you'll see some curtailment due to not heat, but rather energy demand. As I think I've mentioned previously, you have this energy use of symmetry that exists there where they need 4 gigawatts of power generation in the summer for all the air conditioning that they run amongst other things.
And in the winter, that's only about 1 gigawatt. And so in the wintertime, there's plenty of excess energy and in the summertime, there are periods of the day where there may be curtailment. So we may see some seasonality in the numbers and likely we'll see in the summer months, some curtailment. And then in the winter period obviously, there won't be any curtailment. So there'll be seasonality in those numbers.
All of the hash rate when we talk about it is nameplate. And we specifically don't comment on over clocking because two things: one, it's very easy to assume, oh, if you can overclock your miner by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% then we'll just take that into your numbers. And overclocking is dependent on a lot of things, site specific, cooling technology specific, et cetera, et cetera. And it just gets too complicated to try to talk about hash rate net of, kind of, over or under clocking. So we believe that by talking just nameplate hash rate, there's going to be periods of the time in certain sites where we underclock miners as a way to keep them operating during summer months when otherwise they would be curtailed for heat purposes as opposed to energy purposes.
And there will be times of the year at certain sites where we will overclock. What I can tell you is that the pilot in Abu Dhabi exceeded our expectations on the amount of overclock we were able to achieve. I'm not going to name a specific number, I'm going to be like the U.S. Navy and just not talk about how fast our ships are or how deep our submarines go. But I think what you will see as we announced numbers in the forward quarters, including results from those sites I would expect to see our operational efficiency as a percentage of our nameplate hash rate get closer to 100% at times when we can overclock and otherwise be it kind of what our normal rate is, which is in the kind of 90-ish percentile. How should we think about the joint ventures power costs? So I think you should think of it as it's essentially fixed contractual price that starts in the kind of low-single-digit range and goes up marginally over the life of the contract. So there's no risk on the pricing there at all. It's fixed with, kind of, an annual little increase each year. And again, because that's a joint venture operation, depending on how we end up consolidating that. We may just show it as a profit number based on our 20% share without, kind of, a lot of detail around the specific Bitcoin mine there et cetera. But that's something those are details we're still working out. Okay. You mentioned the -- actually I apologize, I’m not sure if you mentioned the length of the contract, but can you talk to that, can you talk to who has hands on assets at the conclusion of the contract? So we haven't commented on that aspect of it, it’s a multi-year agreement. And like any JV, there are provisions in the contracts that allow for liquidation of the joint venture either at expiration or extension of it. And then there's an unwinding process that would happen there. So it’s -- but it is a multi-year agreement, not atypical to the typical duration of the hosting agreements that we have. Our final question is from Brian Dobson with Chardan Capital Markets. Please proceed. Hi, thanks and good morning. Just another quick follow-up on the joint venture, which is very exciting. So I guess ultimately as a management, how did you choose that partner? And also which geographies were you considering? And really what made you decide that Abu Dhabi was the right place? Great question. So when you look at any opportunity, you're looking at kind of the risk reward aspects of it. And so as an international opportunity, you obviously have risk relative to the locust, the country you're going to operate in there, regime risk, taxation, et cetera. And UAE had a number of very attractive opportunity or aspects to it. One is stability, excess power, they just recently brought on a new 5 gigawatt nuclear power plant in addition to all of the existing power infrastructure they had. And so they had excess power generation capacity, but they also had a need for Bitcoin mining. This asymmetry in the energy that exists there creates a problem or challenge for them, which is two-fold.
One is you are only monetizing your energy generation in the winter months to a much lower degree than you are in the summer months. And so that capital equipment if you would for energy generation in theory is not revenue generating in the months when you're not consuming the power that's needed there. And so the government and the owners and investors in the power generation assets were very interested and to find a way that would allow them to better get a return on investment in their power generating assets, which includes the transmission line distribution of energy in the country in a way to achieve a couple of things.
One is how do we obviously generate revenues that we're not generating today as a way to increase the ROI on the investment they made in the energy generation and distribution. The other thing is the government provides subsidies for electricity to their people, which is a great thing. And the ability to monetize the energy generation through Bitcoin Mining is a way to allow the government to do that in a way where they're not having money out of treasury to do it, but instead can use this operation as a way to help subsidize the energy costs in the country.
And lastly, the heat offtake from the energy generation essentially drives the water desalination systems that they have. And the vast majority of water in that region has to come from desalination where you're taking seawater and you're essentially heating it to the point where it converts to steam, then you condense the steam and what you have is distilled water essentially. And that is the primary source of water in that region. And so they need the heat off take from the energy generation, but when the energy generation drops in the wintertime, they don't have all that heat off take. So they had to find a way to keep the heat going if you would from the energy generation in a way that was profitable, because you don't want to run these systems if you can't sell the energy. So we provided the ideal solution. So it was really a match made in heaven.
If you think about who our partners are there, the investors, the co-investors, if you would together with us, in this opportunity are obviously members of sovereign wealth fund, which also has an ownership interest in the power generation and distribution in the country. And so from a risk perspective, we only wanted to partner with somebody where we could dramatically decrease risk of energy pricing, energy contracts, energy distribution, et cetera. And we also wanted to partner with a partner who would have significant skin in the game to ensure that the operation was going to operate successfully post-launch and that they were going to be able to bring the capital to the table if they said they were. And we could not have chosen a better partner.
Zero two, is a great partner, their investors are obviously some of the largest entities in the country. And we feel very honored and proud to be able to work with such a good partner there. So it was kind of a combination of risk, the unique nature of the way energy markets work in that country and that region and also the ability for us to really deliver a technology advantage that nobody else could. And there were a number of other people who had attempted to partner and we ended up being chosen because our solution was better. Yes, excellent. Thank you. I think that, that's really in line with what a lot of investors are talking about as far as, you know, subsidizing the base loan on -- a base load on that clean energy projects. Do you see opportunities elsewhere in the world? And what other geographies might you consider? Yes, a great question. So we are very focused on diversifying risk. And by the same token, no pun intended, that we diversified out of Texas into North Dakota and other parts of the U.S. Now diversifying internationally. We're looking at things like optimizing for different climates in different hemispheres. And so for example, if you're in the southern hemisphere and you're operating there with seasonality there, heat, for example, if we were to do air cooled in the southern hemisphere, the hottest period for the southern hemisphere is when it's coldest in the northern hemisphere. And so you could essentially offset some of the seasonality in production by splitting operations between North and South hemispheres.
So there are some opportunities in Latin America, which we think are potentially promising. We're not going to name locations at this point, but let's just say that there's some very interesting opportunities for renewable energy in Latin America. We're also looking at further growth in the Gulf region not just in UAE, but countries around there, who have similar needs and similar systems and allows us to kind of leverage our good reputation from the Zero Two project in the region. There's some potential interesting energy source is in Africa that are renewable, geothermal energy for example being one that look quite promising. You won't see us necessarily doing any expansion in Europe. You may see some expansion in Asia. There's certain opportunities in parts of Asia where there's attractive hydro energy also.
So I think if you kind of look at the combination of our technology stack that we've built kind of going back to what I said about being able to operate smaller sites, hands off kind of remotely allows us to take advantage of opportunities for smaller size sites that maybe are more geographically dispersed. It kind of opens up more opportunities than would normally be open to a large scale miner like ourselves.
And then you also have the opportunity as we've spoken about before where we believe the ability to generate energy by consuming methane gas from landfills for example is a very interesting opportunity, because you're taking something that is 80 times more damaging than carbon dioxide and essentially eliminating it. Converting it to energy using that energy for Bitcoin production. And in that way, we would be fully energy self-sustaining at those sites and not need potentially grid energy at all for that. And so generate our own energy, consume our own energy, while at the same time having a significant potential impact on the climate. So those are kind of how we look at opportunities here going forward. Excellent. Thank you very much for that color. Thank you. There are no further questions at this point. I'm going to turn the call back over to Chris Brendler for closing remarks. Thanks, Sherry, and thanks everyone for your time today.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chris Brendler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Daryl. Good afternoon, and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings second quarter 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us for our call today. With me on today's call are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Thiel; and our Chief Financial Officer, Salman Khan.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements.
Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. In addition, other risks are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be viewed at www.sec.gov and ir.mara.com.
Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which Marathon excludes certain items from its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, and to our website for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
We will begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Salman. After their comments, we'll be going through some of the more popular questions from investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts.
And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Chris.
After a solid start to the year, we continued to make progress towards our primary 2023 goals, which include energizing our fleet to reach our 23 exahahash target, while at the same time, increasing our operational efficiency. As our recent results demonstrate, we're near to completing our first goal and we're making consistent progress on the second.
During Q2, we increased our operational hash rate 54% from 11.5 exahashes on April 1, to 17.7 exahashes on June 30. Those of you who saw the July production report we published last week will have noticed that our operational hash rate is now approximately 19 exahashes.
In 2023 alone, the team at Marathon has more than doubled our operational hash rate and positioned us as the largest publicly traded self-miner on an installed hash rate basis. We've grown hash rate this year by successfully working with our various hosting partners to energize new facilities. During the quarter, the facility at Ellendale, North Dakota was energized and officially became our largest operational Bitcoin mining site. While growing hash rate has been our primary goal, it has been important for us at Marathon that we do so in a sustainable manner.
Since I became CEO, we have made a concerted effort to transition Marathon to more sustainable sources of power, and I'm pleased to report that we have been successful in that endeavor. In less than two years, we've evolved from a company that relied on a coal plant for its energy to one that is mostly powered by renewable energy.
During the first six months of this year, approximately 58% of the energy our miners consumed was generated by renewable and sustainable sources. While we expect this mix to fluctuate depending on wind conditions, curtailment and other factors, we remain committed to 100% carbon neutrality in 2023, with the balance offset by renewable energy credits or similar instruments.
Operationally, we hit another milestone this week. As of today, we have officially installed 23 exahashes of miners, and energization of the final tranche to reach 23 exahahash of operating capacity appears to be imminent. I'm pleased to report the final tie-in to the substation in Garden City is complete; therefore, barring any unforeseen delays, energizing this site and reaching 23 exahashes of operational capacity should be imminent.
Because we've been growing our hash rate faster than the rest of the network and simultaneously improving our uptime, we have continued to increase our Bitcoin production. We produced a record 2,926 Bitcoin during the second quarter, which is a 33% increase from Q1 of this year. And last month, we won a record 179 blocks, which is a record for Marathon and indicates that our improvements have continued into the third quarter.
In a few minutes, I'll provide an update on our expanding capabilities and evolving growth strategy, but first I'm going to turn the call over to Salman to discuss our financial results for the second quarter. As a reminder, Salman joined us as CFO in June, and he has quickly become a valuable member of our team. He brings a wealth of valuable experience from several industries that are directly pertinent to Marathon, including technology, renewable energy, oil and gas, and Big Four public accounting and consulting.
With that, please join me in welcoming Salman to his first earnings call with Marathon. Salman? Thank you, Fred, and thanks for the warm welcome. I look forward to meeting and engaging with our analysts and investors over the coming months. For now, let's focus on the results for the quarter.
Improving Bitcoin prices, increased production and accounting gains on Bitcoin sales were the main drivers of our operating results for the second quarter. The company recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $21.3 million, or $0.13 per common share in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $212.6 million or $1.94 per share in prior-year quarter. This represents a $191.4 million favorable variance in net loss year-over-year. Total revenues for the quarter were $81.8 million, well above our prior-year revenues of $24.9 million, representing a 228% increase year-over-year.
The company's Bitcoin production at 32 Bitcoin per day was 314% higher, which was partially offset by a 14% lower average Bitcoin price compared to last year's quarter. Our hosting and energy costs for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $55.2 million compared to $16.7 million last year. The increase was due to increased Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower production cost per coin and one-time exit costs for our Hardin, Montana facility last year.
Total cost of revenues, which includes depreciation, amortization was $92.5 million compared to $41.4 million last year increasing by $51.1 million, or 123%. Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $37.3 million increasing by $12.6 million compared to the same quarter last year. We also had one-time accelerated depreciation of our Hardin, Montana facility for $9.4 million last year. As Fred mentioned, we have grown our mining rigs significantly since last year. And as a result, increased our energized hash rate from 0.7 exahashes in the second quarter of 2022 to 17.7 exahashes in the same quarter of 2023.
Gains on sale of digital assets was $23.4 million in the current year quarter. And in the prior year, we had a loss of $14 million from losses on digital assets loan receivable. Impairment of digital assets improved by $123.2 million year-over-year as Bitcoin prices fell significantly in the prior year's quarter. Lastly, you remember last year we had a Bitcoin investment fund with a $79.7 million loss and a $54.1 million gain on sale of equipment, both of which did not exist this quarter.
I want to note that the company's non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $26.5 million this quarter, representing an $18.3 million, or 222% increase when compared to the same quarter last year. This is representative of our increased hash rate and our strategy to systematically improve efficiency.
Adjusted EBITDA improved to $25.6 million versus $167.1 million loss in the prior-year period. The drivers of adjusted EBITDA include the previously mentioned accounting impacts and total margin improvement excluding depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $10 million year-over-year increase in general and administrative expense to support the growth of our business.
General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, we're $16 million in the current period as compared with $4.3 million in the prior-year period. This increase in expenses was primarily due to higher cash compensation and benefits, professional fees, property taxes, charitable contributions and insurance costs.
I'm pleased to report we now have over 40 employees, up from just 17 a year ago, as we have built out our finance, strategy, communications, legal and human resources teams and opportunistically added talent across the organization.
Turning to our Bitcoin Holdings and cash position. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $128 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of $15.5 million compared to last year. Also, at June 30, 2023, we held approximately 12,538 Bitcoin with a carrying value of $234.4 million on the balance sheet, with the fair value of our holdings approximately $382 million at quarter end.
The company's combined balance sheet of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and fair value of Bitcoin was approximately $495.7 million. We sold 1,854 Bitcoin during the quarter, realizing cash proceeds of $51.3 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses during the quarter, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses.
During the quarter, we generated $65.5 million from at-the-market sale of equity, which we intend to use for growth capital. The combined cash and cash equivalents Bitcoin and access to our - at the market facility provides us ample amount of liquidity and optionality to execute our strategy.
So all in all, a good quarter for the balance sheet as we maintain our strong cash position while increasing our Bitcoin Holdings. As mentioned in our July production report, our unrestricted cash balance at July 31 was $115.1 million, and we held approximately 12,964 Bitcoin with a fair value of $379 million.
We expect our future Bitcoin Holdings will generally increase, but will fluctuate depending upon operating and market conditions. We intend to add to our Bitcoin Holdings primarily, through our production activities. And we will also continue to sell Bitcoin, as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs, and for general corporate purposes.
And that completes my update. So I'll turn it back over to Fred who will take a little bit more about - who will talk a little bit more about our operations and our ongoing plan. Fred? Thanks, Salman.
While all Bitcoin miners fight to win blockchain in Bitcoin. Marathon has always done things differently. We've achieved a number of first for the industry. We've set the pace for growing hash rate to improve our Bitcoin production for navigating capital markets to efficiently scale the business, for operating behind the meter of wind farms to improve our mix as sustainable energy, and for geographically diversifying our operations domestically, and internationally to reduce concentration risk.
Now we're continuing this trend by vertically integrating our technology stack, which can potentially reduce latency in our operations. If you can reduce latency then in theory, you can operate more efficiently, and therefore potentially win more blocks. Efficiency is particularly important as you move closer towards next year's having from the block subsidy will be reduced by 50%. Because Bitcoins difficulty rate dynamic, someone will always make mining I'm sorry, make money mining Bitcoin.
But what matters, is that you are more efficient than the average miner. And if you're on the low end of the cost curve that you can keep operating when others cannot. And we believe the technology is one of the keys to improving efficiency and operating even in those toughest of times.
Marathon is the only Bitcoin miner that directly controls or influences each aspect of the mining tech stack. Starts at the top of the mining pool, which is the orchestration layer, between the miners and the blockchain, and it runs all the way down to the ASIC. Over the past few months, we've made several upgrades to MaraPool, which seem to have contributed to an improvement in the number of blocks won, and therefore, Bitcoin earned.
However, developing our own proprietary firmware for our miners is making an even larger impact. There are several companies that sell firmware. And given our experience in our technological expertise, we thought we might be able to build a superior solution. And so far the feedback indicates that we have. We recently benchmarked our proprietary third we're against some of the leading alternatives. And so several advantages in performance, protections and security.
So far our firmware seems to have demonstrated better curtailment times that are overclocking, improved temperature and voltage protection and encrypted communications with the mining pool. And it allows for security audit, which is a very valuable tool for us as a publicly traded company.
Moving down this tech stack to the hardware. We've been heavily focused on upgrading our fleet of S19 XPs to not just grow hash rate, but to also reduce our energy expenditure per hash our mining fleet now operates at 25.3 joules per terahash which makes it one of the most efficient fleets in the industry.
At the infrastructure level we're clearly demonstrating our competency in designing and building immersion cooled mining farms. In February, we signed an agreement to jointly build a 250 megawatt facility in Abu Dhabi. For reference, the climate in Abu Dhabi is one that is extremely hostile towards Bitcoin miners.
The temperature often is above the typical shut-off temperature for Bitcoin miners in air meaning over 40 degree C very high humidity and it's a very demanding environment. The sites in Abu Dhabi where Marathon today is partner and its joint venture were designed and built and are operated by team trained by Marathon.
And it really exemplifies the ability that Marathon has in building these sites. And as a matter of fact, our pilot site operated for over 100 days without human intervention, which shows how sophisticated our operations can be. So, we clearly believe that this demonstrates our ability to now, become truly a leader in the owned, and operated space as well as third-party hosted.
So the whole 250 megawatts in Abu Dhabi is expected to be online before the end of this year, but already in July, first of the two sites began hashing and produced for 17 Bitcoin of which we received 3.4 Bitcoin due to our 20% ownership in the project. Even the hash rate that's currently online has already proven to be helpful to the region as a load balancer and preliminary reports have shown the site's ability to dynamically ramp up and down during the day when grid energy demands change.
This type of flexible demand response has an excellent case study for how Bitcoin mining can benefit utilities. It also proves, that we can now mine Bitcoin successfully in parts of the world that were inaccessible even a year ago, given their climates. While we've not announced any significant growth plans beyond 23 exahashes. Our intention is to continue to grow and maintain our leading position in this space.
Our scale, operational expertise, flexible approach to implementing the right business model for a given deployment, and our ever increasing portfolio of technological innovations are all key to drive rapid expansion of efficient operations. With the having coming up next year optimism may not be the dominant emotion for every Bitcoin miner. And many in our industry today are focused on how they're going to survive, which is not easy to do, given how dynamic this spaces.
But at Marathon, our focus is not just staying alive, but thriving. Even in the most challenging times. We remain focused on conscientiously growing our hash rate, and consistently improving our technology and remaining a leader in this industry. We've been setting the pace in this industry for the past three years, and we have every intention to keep that trend going. This industry is still young, it's full of potential for those who are willing to shape it and we therefore believe the most exciting years for Marathon and for Bitcoin lie ahead. Chris? Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. I'll start by answering some of the most popular questions. Submitted by investors through our Q&A platform.
Our first question comes from CK who asks, regarding Auradine and MARA; number one, what percent of Auradine does MARA own? Two, how should we think about the pricing/benefit that having a stake in Auradine will provide to MARA as you continue scaling hash rate? And three, is Auradine providing AI capabilities to MARA within the tech stack?
Great question, CK. I'm not sure how much of that was disclosed at this point. Fred, can you add a little color on Auradine? Sure, great question. So Marathon today owns about 12% of Auradine, so we're a minority shareholder. There are large venture capital firms that own a much larger percentage, and then the founders of Auradine own the balance. I think you should think about the reasons why we made the investment rather than talking about price advantages and things like that.
What we really were looking for was to find the ability to have a miner built that could really operate in all of the challenging environments we needed be able to ramp up and overclock, be able to ramp down and underclock, be able to operate in immersion, single phase, dual phase immersion, have very efficient operations, but more importantly, be able to be intelligent.
And one of the key things with the Auradine miners that the team in Auradine has clearly been able to achieve even beyond the expectations that Marathon initially had is to create a miner with a total cost of ownership that is significantly lower than most of the industry.
And that is so important as we move into an environment with very dynamic energy pricing and also the halving. And dynamic energy pricing is critical because these miners essentially can operate in a way so you can set a price target of energy or a price target of Bitcoin, if you would - hash price, if you would, for Bitcoin and a variety of other parameters. And the miners will automatically adjust to operate within those parameters, scaling up their capacity, scaling down their capacity. It is a game-changer for the industry, which again means that these miners can operate in large fleets managed from the cloud platform that makes it very unique.
So that's what we're most excited about as regards to Auradine, and we're very excited to be able to start incorporating those systems into our fleet. Great. Our next question is from Tariq who asks, what's your future projections for mining production? Are there any things you're focusing on besides Bitcoin mining to also bring more revenue to your company?
You want to take that one as well, Fred? Sure. So while we haven't disclosed kind of what we're doing outside of pure Bitcoin mining, and I would just say stay tuned to that, we're going to continue to grow our operations. As I said in my prepared remarks, we intend to continue to remain a leader, and we'll continue to grow capacity at a conscientious rate over the coming years.
We believe that it's our duty to be one of the leaders in this industry and supporting and securing the Bitcoin blockchain and supporting the industry and the infrastructure around it. So as you look towards the future, expect to see Marathon developing technologies that will help build the infrastructure for this industry to really thrive long term. That's great. Next we have a question from Andreas who asks, the halving is rapidly approaching and with it, a looming bull run. What are your plans upon this rapid rise in Bitcoin price? What are you doing to separate yourself from other mining companies? So I appreciate your optimism, Andreas, but I don't think we're going to comment on Bitcoin price predictions at this point. Fred, maybe you can provide some more color on how we are approaching the having and how we are differentiating ourselves. So having, is obviously a recurring event in this industry and all miners are very focused on making sure that there'll be able to operate profitably, not just at the having but beyond and through the next cycle - until the next having in 2028. So, as Chris mentioned, we're not going to comment on where we think the price of Bitcoin is going to be. But we're obviously very focused on optimizing our operations that our cost to mine Bitcoin, will allow us to weather any sort of storm here as we get towards the halving where Bitcoin price may fluctuate up and down kind of greatly.
As Bitcoin price moves up, obviously there will be an increase in hash rate because more miners will want to be putting on more hash rate. If the price of Bitcoin doesn't grow into the halving, then you may even expect, as some analysts have predicted, the hash rate to actually decrease post-halving. So we'll just all have to look and see how that is, but we're very focused on just being the most optimized miner from a cost perspective. And while we still have some ways to go, we're very focused on it. And as our mantra has been this year, it's energize and optimize, and so we're very focused on doing both at the same time. That's right. The next question comes from Bert F. who asks, why should an individual invest in MARA as opposed to Riot or buying Bitcoin itself? What do you see as the benefits of MARA compared to other investing options? Great question, Bert. Allowing to Fred as well. So I think Riot runs a great operation. I think the challenge with Riot is they're not a Bitcoin pure-play in the sense that they operate a third-party hosting business where they rent out capacity to third parties, and then they also are a self-miner. They are also highly concentrated to a particular area in Texas, which makes them very susceptible to either regulatory changes in Texas, ERCOT changes in Texas, climate, et cetera.
So I think you have to look at each miner's operating model. We operate a very diversified portfolio. We operate some third-party hosted sites. We operate some owned and operated sites. We operate in Texas. We operate in North Dakota. We're now operating in UAE. And we'll continue to expand internationally and continue to diversify our portfolio of sites and move to a greater balance of owned and operated than we have today.
So we offer kind of more of a diversified play in that regard. We are also a Bitcoin pure-play in that we not only mine Bitcoin, but we hold a lot of Bitcoin. And that generally tends to show itself in how you see our stock react to increases in the price of Bitcoin. So I think Riot, Marathon, two very different companies and operating under different models. I think that, yes, if you compare Marathon to just buying spot Bitcoin, I would recommend you look back at Bitcoin price movements and Marathon stock movements and see and you'll likely find that there were opportunities this year, for example, and I think even on a year-to-date basis where Marathon has outperformed Bitcoin. So that may be a reason to invest in the stock. Okay. And then we have one last question from our - or time for one last question from our platform this afternoon, and we'll actually combine two of the most popular ones into one and try to hit them both. James R. asks, are you thinking about or planning a reverse split? And then Xavier T. asks, why do you continue to wish and try to dilute the shares of your shareholders? Why not do a split, take a loan or do something similar to advance shareholder value instead of always trying to create more shares and dilute the value? So perhaps we can provide some color on our strategy for you as in equity and growing the company. Salman, maybe you can start and, Fred, you can finish it up. Sure. Happy to do that. Thanks, James, and Xavier for asking the question. The way we see as - from an equity and a capital stack standpoint is our eyes are focused on shareholder value creation, so any decision that we make, we will always think about shareholder value creation first. And when it comes to whether it's debt or shares, we already have convertible debt on our balance sheet, which is low interest rate. And certainly, that there is evidence that we have the capital stack in the balance sheet that creates the value for our stockholders.
In terms of growing and raising capital and the strategy to grow the exahash, when we look at the growth here, we're not growing just for the sake of growing. We're growing with the intention of creating value for the stockholders. As long as it's accretive to our existing stockholders, we will continue to raise capital to grow from that perspective. So hopefully, that answers your question.
In terms of a reverse stock split, I'm not certain if I understood the question. We don't have the intention at this stage, given our stock price and given our company size, we don't see a value in a reverse stock split at this stage. Hopefully, that answers your question.
Fred? Yes, I would just add the comment that if you looked historically, splitting a stock is something you do when your stock price is very, very high. I mean, Apple did it when their stock was between $600 and $700 a share because it makes it look like a share is more affordable. And they dropped their share price down to - they did a seven split, so they dropped it down to about $90.
Trading in the $15 to $20 range where we trade, it doesn't make sense to do a split. And that doesn't create any shareholder value. And doing a reverse split, you only really ever do if your stock price gets below $1. So I don't see any value in doing that.
But just as you look at our growth, every exahash that we add, adds shareholder value. Because it produces a certain amount of Bitcoin and that amount of Bitcoin, a certain percentage of that we'll continue to hold on the balance sheet. And that continues to add shareholder value. We have been selling Bitcoin to cover our operating expenses this year. So we're not diluting our shareholders to maintain operating expenses in that degree. So I think our growth plans are going to be very consistent with doing things that drive shareholder value accretion. Okay. On the interest of time, we'll have to wrap up this section of the Q&A. Again, we really appreciate all the questions and interest, and thanks for submitting those questions.
I'm now going to turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions from our covering analysts. Daryl, back to you. Thank you. We're now going to open the call to questions from Marathon's covering analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley. Please proceed with your questions. Thank you very much, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. My first one is also on the halving side. So with it rapidly approaching, I'm trying to get a sense for the flexibility you have. Just for argument's sake, if a given data center is not economical on a variable basis, do you have the flexibility to curtail miners there temporarily at least, or were there kind of take-or-pay commitments if you were to take that step that you would still have to pay for a given amount of power? Would really appreciate your color on that dynamic. Thank you. Thanks, Lucas. It varies by site, and I'm not going to go into each site one by one. But it depends on if at the site we control uses the PPA or we're doing pass-through power. And that happens to be the case in some of the sites there are other sites that have very low cost fixed power and other sites that just have fixed pricing, which is power and hosting. So it's a broad mix between the three. That's helpful. Thank you, Fred. And just to follow up on that, kind of as a percentage of exahash rate today, and assuming installed exahash rate, roughly what percentage would fall under fixed commitments and which ones would be more flexible? I think you would find of the installed, about a third today is flexible. And the balance is most probably - I'm not going to guess, but it's most probably similar, 40% fixed and then the balance is very low cost fixed. Really appreciate that, thank you very much for that. Two quick follow-up questions, not directly related, but first in terms of the utilization rate on the operating hash rate. What are kind of your expectations on that metric going forward? We calculated in-house, but would appreciate how you approach that question. Then, yes, somewhat not directly related, but Garden City, you mentioned you expect to start up imminently because imminently is pretty clear, but if you could maybe share your update on the site and when you would expect it to turn online, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your color. Yes, so the physical tie-in at the site is complete. And the last documents between our hosting provider and the energy provider are being passed back and forth with the final red lines. And as soon as that document is signed, they start energizing. So that's the last step. There are no other approvals or any other regulatory issues holding that site up from going on. So our hosting providers publicly said they expect it to happen imminently. We believe the same based on the current status of their discussions with the power company. And that will ramp in kind of 20-megawatt steps over a short period of time. Got it, so this would kind of ramp up over the course of 10 weeks or so? Most probably somewhere between six weeks to 10 weeks. Great. And then in terms of utilization rates more broadly? You mean uptime? So help me understand what you mean by utilization. Yes. Sorry, with that, I mean, yes, uptime. Obviously like that Garden City miners don't run, that's understood. But kind of in terms of the operating base, kind of what uptime is a good benchmark. So it's seasonal, as you're well aware. Texas has a lot of curtailment in the summer. And so operating in Texas, uptime is going to be lower in Texas. In North Dakota, by contrast, we've been operating well over 93%, 94% even in the summer. And so that site has been operating with very high uptime. So I think you have to kind of look at the West Texas sites as being very seasonal. You're going to be in the mid '90s in the cooler times of the year. And depending on curtailment and temperature issues, you may be in the 60% to 75% during some of the hotter months in the summer. Super. Hi, Fred and team, I really appreciate it and best of luck. Yes. Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chase White with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions. Thanks. Good evening, guys. So how should we think about aggregate power costs across the entire portfolio as you energize Garden City and that site starts to come online? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. So what complicates this is that the APLD sites, we pay essentially a fixed price for power and hosting. So power isn't broken out net cost, it's power and hosting. So that makes it a little bit harder to give you just the power costs. But I think you could look, generally speaking, across sites and you would find us - if you include power and hosting across all the sites, you're going to be in the kind of $0.06 range per kilowatt. Got you. And switching gears a little bit. I mean, are you able to provide us any additional details about the economics for the Abu Dhabi JV? It's an 80-20 joint venture. We've just started production, so we don't even have first month's financials yet, so I couldn't tell you. But what I can tell you is it's a fixed price - sub-$0.04 fixed price energy, and then we split the operating costs 80-20. Got you, so sub-$0.04. And is that - and that's fixed just all the time. Perfect. And then any updates on the recoveries from the Compute North bankruptcy? None to mention, no. Got it, thanks. Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Great, thank you very much. I'm just curious on the exahash here - or the XPs that you're putting into place right now at today's economics. What do you estimate like the payback period is on what you paid for those machines at today's economics? Well, those machines were significantly discounted by the time we finally paid for them, right? So when we ordered them, it was at a high price. And by the time we ended up paying for them, it was significantly below that as can be seen by the limited amount of CapEx we've had to do to pay off those, so I think you're going to find it's somewhere between 13 months and 18 months, most probably. Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then I know this is a hard question to answer, but I was curious in terms of the halving next year, do you have any estimate of what percent of the exahash that's online right now would come off post-halving? Well, you tell me what the price of Bitcoin is going to be, and then you can touch it yourself. Let's just pretend it's today, if it's today's price of Bitcoin and today's exahash. I know there's a lot of levers to figure this stuff out. I mean, if we're talking about a price of $30,000 for Bitcoin, that would mean essentially at the halving, you're talking about the equivalent of $15,000, which would be right around our marginal cost to produce. So don't know we would shut off necessarily. I didn't mean any - sorry, I didn't mean any of yours. I meant the market overall, like do you have any sense of how much of the total network hash rate might come offline. Well, look at it this way. Our fleet operates at roughly 25 joules per terahash. The average for the industry is somewhere in the mid '30s. Your colleagues are estimating 20% to 30% would come off. Yes, okay. All right, that's all - So if you're in the lower third of the miners, from an efficiency perspective, I think you're going to do fine. I think it's, if you're above - if you're average or above, you're going to be challenged. Yes, that's fair. All right, that's all for me. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your questions. Hi, Fred. Thanks for taking it. I was curious about your software integration. How much, progress have you made on that, how much have you implemented, what sort of efficiency gains have you seen, can you talk to that at all? I can talk a little bit to it. So we're running. We've just transitioned to our third generation of pool software, which is fully kind of developed Marathon and that is the one that's been driving a lot of efficiency gains. I want to say how much, but let's just say that it's been driving efficiency gains.
Our firmware is running in a subset of miners and we continue to expand that across the fleet and our expectation is to have the vast majority of the fleet transition to our firmware here over the balance of this year. That far more gives us additional efficiencies, which I think will be very beneficial.
The immersion technology that we're running in UAE and we're also running a tiny bit of it in some other places in the U.S. that we've done for testing purposes was developed by a third party with some direction for Marathon and we're very focused on expanding the development efforts, we're doing in immersion to get even better efficiencies and the efficiency in the immersion, have more to do with being able to operate not just an extreme environments but also require fewer touches by human beings because that's where you get the operating efficiencies in immersion is if you don't have to touch it and you can have fewer engineers on-site.
And so we've been very focused on putting a lot of instrumentation into the system. So that they can be managed remotely. And if you recall my kind of comments regarding Auradine to a prior question, with the capabilities that those miners bring over time we'll have the ability to really manage a fleet from a profitability standpoint where the machines and the orchestration layer really manage themselves if you based on profit targets and cost points.
So that's kind of what we're very focused on. And that's why we felt it was so important to make the investment in Auradine so we could have the ability to influence the design of the miner all the way down to the ASIC level. So we can get specifically what we felt was the right solution to the marketplace for our needs. So Fred to load the firmware and Auradine software, do you need to pull the miner from the RAC take it to the shop. Well, so the Auradine software will run on the Auradine miner. It won't run on the Bitmain so let's be clear about that. Okay. Below the software we do over the air software upgrades. Okay. And how flexible do you think the software development is and will be to changes in your fleet. So far it's been very flexible. Yes, got think about it this way. Our fleet consists of two types of machines today S19 J PROs and S19 XPs predominantly. As we add other machines will add different versions of firmware as it makes sense. So if a machine comes with the firmware that's as good as ours and has the same capabilities, there is no reason for us to change the firmware and the machine. It just so happens that Bitmain's machine don't come with particularly good firmware when it comes to the ability to overclock underclock set 10 points, things like that, it's just, it's very minimal.
And the other third-party firmwares might be good at one or two things that are not good at everything. And so that was why we made the decision to develop. Okay. Thanks for the detail. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thanks, Fred. Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley. Please proceed with your questions. Thank you, operator. Thank you for taking my follow-up questions. First, Fred can you remind us about the fleet at Garden City. Are those most of -- All XPs. All XPs? Got it. So kind of we should expect the efficiency to tick up as Garden City turns online. Yes. So I think we've said previously that our once fully deployed, we would be at about 22 or 23 joules per terahash and we're at 25 today. So that gives you kind of feel for that. Got it. Very helpful, thank you for that. I know you had said it before. I just wanted to make sure I remember it right. And then Fred, on M&A, do you have thoughts on what could make sense here, the industry obviously kind of came through some of the most challenging times. And I could imagine there are players might be looking for liquidity. And so as a leader, you might have a role to play, I would appreciate your thoughts on that. Sure. I think I've said a number of times that M&A in this industry is challenging because the replacement cost tends to be about the same as the acquisition cost when you think about most miners because the hardware has a fairly short life and depending on the age of whatever fleet the miner is running, you always have to weigh - what am I going to pay for these machines versus buying new and as everyone's aware today, the cost of new miners is a rock bottom level you're paying single digit dollars per terahash for S19 J PRO class machines and XPs are in the mid-'20s somewhere.
So it's almost better today to, if you're going to acquire somebody, it's got to be somebody that has an absolute amazing PPA or access to very low energy costs and a facility where you can essentially pull out old machines and put in brand new super-efficient machines. There's got to be a reason why the company is for sale typically right. So either the miners in trouble or they will be in trouble with the having and therefore the trying to sell themselves now. And I think there's certainly a lot of activity in the marketplace right now with people who are trying to solve that issue.
Because these miners that are in trouble today are going to be an even more trouble come having. And so I think they're going to be even more opportunities come next year. But if I were to advertise for a minute. What would Marathon want to buy in the way of miner, it's somebody with great access to very low cost power and great infrastructure where they've yet to put in any miners. And so we can build the site and we can equip it. Thank you, Fred for the perspectives. Maybe one last follow-up question. It's a little bit of a higher level question, but I would appreciate your thoughts. Fred kind of when I look back over the history of Bitcoin mining every couple of years a new mining that came out, fairly relentless march upwards in the efficiency. I wondered what are you seeing today as the pace of technological advancement stable, decelerating, accelerating and with some of the developments you're seeing on the AI front with very efficient ships is that a positive or possibly a negative because it increases the overall demand for new computing system. So kind of double at - two-pronged question here. I would appreciate. Thank you. Yes, so in the Bitcoin mining space as a apart from AI space - in the Bitcoin mining space we went through a pretty significant increase in efficiency with the advent of the XP taking us from basically what was an industry average of around 30 joules per terahash down to about 21 joules per terahash. So that's a pretty significant increase in efficiency - 30-ish percent.
What we're seeing now is a raft of new machines coming from whether it's micro BT, whether Auradine miner, it was a company that were sharing the machine at mining disrupt which are all in that 20-ish joules per terahash. But if you overclock them or underclock them et cetera, you can get down to there - if you underclock you can maybe down into the high-teens.
Getting from there to the next level of efficiency in Bitcoin mining is going to require a pretty big step. I fully expect most of the - especially people like Bitmain working on next generation technologies and so it wouldn't surprise me if we heard something new from them before the end of this year. But I think it's going to be the returns on efficiency are going to start becoming smaller from a miner hash rate perspective where the real efficiency gains are going to come is in the software, not just in the miner meaning the ability to totally tune the operation of the miner to either a target hash price or energy cost or global hash rate et cetera.
So the miner can literally tune itself to operate. Do I overclock? Do I underclock? What do I do so that I can maximize the amount of Bitcoin Mining and then you start getting into a lot of AI-driven cloud orchestration for fleets of miner. So large operators like ourselves could reap very large benefits from that more so than increasing the efficiency of the hardware level by one or two joules per terahash. So that's higher level. Yes, sorry, go ahead. I was just going to say, as you look at the AI side of this business meaning Bitcoin miners moving to running AI compute versus mining Bitcoin, I see there are a number of miners who are actively focused on that Hut 8, Applied et cetera are very focused on that and what that does as I look at it relative to Bitcoin Mining is it means those companies will have less capital to invest in growing hash rate which means global hash rate from players that go that route won't be growing.
I think we're going to continue to see the growth in global hash rate is from sovereigns who want to mine Bitcoin and I think you're going to continue to see the trend of sovereigns mining Bitcoin as a way to potentially use Bitcoin as a reserve asset. I think it's going to be a much more important trend to this industry going forward. Thank you. Thank you, Fred. A couple of interesting things there. On the comment regarding a smaller advance in the machine efficiency, where would you put the next generation at - 15 joules, 10 joules what would be your best guess today? So the next big jump will be a geometry change. So for example Bitmain's XP is a 5-nanometer, if they were to jump to 4, you may see it come down to 18 joules of terahash, if they jump all the way down to 3 which should be expensive, you may see it come to 17 maybe 16, but again that's going to be a very expensive miner because of the cost of 3-nanometer wafers today.
So that's why I keep thinking the real benefits are going to come in software, as opposed to hardware over the next two to three years, and then we'll have to see advancements in compute and in technologies typically take a while to flow through.
And at the end of the day, Bitcoin mining is a fairly small volume industry for technology companies. When you think about it, they're not hundreds of millions of miner sold a year. And so it's hard to justify a development effort. And I think it's the type of market where it's typically student for one or two players to kind of dominate the hardware side of it. And then the small marginal players just after you got little things they can. Very helpful. Lots of food for thought there. Fred, I really appreciate your perspective. Yes. Thanks. Thank you. At this point there are no further questions. I'm going to turn the call back over to Chris Brendler for closing remarks. Thank you, Daryl. And just a quick clarification on the question around our fleet efficiency when fully deployed, we actually put in our press release on July production last week that we're expecting 24.2 joules per terahash when fully deployed.
So with that, thank you all for your time today. Do you have any questions that were not answered during today's call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team at ir.mara.com.

And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Chris. The third quarter was a landmark quarter for Marathon as we achieved several key milestones. To start the quarter, our first international facility in Abu Dhabi powered up just 6 months after signing contracts, even though this is the first site that was designed and built by Marathon together with our JV partner. In August, we reached our stated goal of 23 exahashes and established Marathon as one of the largest bitcoin miners globally. Then in September, we proactively restructured our convertible debt to further strengthen our balance sheet and prepare for opportunities that may be created by next year's haven. In addition to these key milestones, we also reported strong financial results with record revenue, lower cost per coin mine and improving margins. Much of this success was the direct result of measurable progress on our 2023 priorities, which are energizing more capacity and optimizing our mining operations. Let me provide some more detail.In the third quarter, we increased our energized hash rate 8% from 17.7 exahashes to 19.1 exahashes. Over the same period, our average operational hash rate for the quarter increased 18%. The faster growth in realized hash rate was due to improved uptime that helped drive record midpoint production of 3,490 bitcoins, up 19% from the prior quarter as well as lower cost per coin. The increase in uptime was driven by our optimization strategy and a more proactive approach to managing our domestic operations and hosting partners. Over the course of 2023, we have built up our operations team, adding key talent across site operations, power, hardware, software, networks, repair and cooling. We are now directly managing our hosting partners to improve efficiency and increase uptime. Our approach has included on-site Marathon resources to direct operations, upgrade equipment, optimize network design as well as deploy our proprietary firmware. By way of example, uptime in McCamey, Texas, increased by approximately 20% in the third quarter, even with an approximately 84% increase in curtailment hours relative to the second quarter.Â This progress is critically important as the improved operating efficiency lowered our direct cost per bitcoin mined by 9% sequentially, excluding depreciation and amortization despite a 9% increase in average network difficulty in the third quarter. Our all-in cost per coin, which includes G&A without stock-based comp, dropped to 12% quarter-over-quarter and 41% year-over-year. This material improvement is not just the result of optimization. It also reflects the significant scale benefits that we have achieved that helped lower our all-in cost per coin. On a year-over-year basis, bitcoin mined grew 467% in the third quarter as Marathon's block rewards represented 4% of the total available minor rewards in the third quarter. Energization of more efficient mining rigs is also lowering our electricity consumption on a per hash basis. Our mining fleet is already among the most efficient in the industry and growing our hash rate with ever more efficient machines will continue to lower our cost per coin. This process is encouraging. Our operational priorities remain unchanged, and we're still focusing on growing our market share in the most efficient and sustainable methods possible while optimizing our operations to continually drive lower costs.Â In a few minutes, I'll provide an update on our growth plan and how we're innovating to drive lower costs. But first, I'm going to turn the call over to Salman to discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Salman? We had an excellent third quarter with record Bitcoin production and higher margins. The company reported net income attributable to common stockholders are $64.1 million or $0.35 per diluted common share in the quarter compared with a net loss of $72.5 million or $0.62 per share in the prior year quarter. On a sequential basis, we grew net income $85.4 million versus the second quarter of 2023. The sequential improvement in profitability was partially due to a onetime net gain on extinguishment of debt or $82.6 million due to the notes payable exchange transaction. Third quarter revenues were a record $97.8 million, significantly higher than prior year revenues of $12.7 million. Average daily Bitcoin production grew to 38 bitcoin per day versus 7 bitcoin in the third quarter of 2022. And up 18% from prior quarter levels. Revenue also benefited from a 32% higher average bitcoin price compared to last year's third quarter.Â Our hosting and energy costs for the 3 months ended September 30 were $59.6 million compared to $13.8 million last year. The increase was due to significantly higher bitcoin production, partially offset by lower production costs per coin and onetime exit costs for our Harden Montana facility last year.Â Total cost of revenues, which includes depreciation and amortization was $113.2 million compared to $40.1 million last year, which is an increase of 182%. Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $53.5 million, increasing by $27.3 million compared to the same quarter last year. As Fred mentioned, we have grown our mining rig fleet significantly since last year and as a result, increased our energized cash rate from 3.8 exahashes in the third quarter of 2022 to 19.1 exahashes in the third quarter of 2023. We also had onetime accelerated depreciation of our Harden Montana facility of $5.7 million last year.Â Gain on digital assets was $31 million in the current year quarter versus none in the prior year third quarter. Impairment of digital assets, on the other hand, increased by $10.5 million year-over-year to $11.9 million, reflecting the increased size of our Bitcoin Holdings, which was up 29% year-over-year. I want to note that the company's non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $38.2 million this quarter, up $39.3 million from -- compared with the same quarter last year. This is representative of our increased hash rate and our strategy to systematically improve efficiency, as mentioned by Fred earlier as well as higher bitcoin prices in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $43.7 million versus a $6.1 million loss in the prior year period. The drivers of the adjusted EBITDA improvement include total margin improved -- excuse me, total margin improvement, excluding depreciation and amortization and the net realized gains on Bitcoin sales net of impairment, partially offset by an $8 million year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses to support the growth of our business.Â General and administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation were $14.6 million in the current period as compared with $8.7 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenses was primarily due to the increasing scale of business, including payroll and benefits, professional fees and other costs. At the end of the third quarter, we had 48 employees, up from 20 a year ago as we continue to opportunistically add talent across the organization. Turning to our Bitcoin holdings and cash position, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $101.2 million at September 30, which was up $37 million compared to last year. Also at September 30, we held approximately 13,716 bitcoins, with a carrying value of $287 million on the balance sheet. Fair value of our holdings was approximately $370 million at quarter end. The company's combined balance sheet of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents -- the company's combined balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and fair value of Bitcoin was approximately $470 million. We sold 2,300 bitcoin during the quarter, realizing cash proceeds of $65.6 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses during the quarter, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses.Â During the quarter, we generated $37 million from at-the-market equity sales, which we intend to use for growth capital. Also during the quarter, we took advantage of an opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet by exchanging $417 million in convertible notes for approximately $329 million in equity. This transaction reduced our debt by 56% and will save approximately $101 million or $0.55 per share in cash for our shareholders for principal and interest reduction. The combined cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin on our balance sheet, along with reduced debt and access to at the market facility, provides us ample amount of liquidity and optionality to strategically evaluate opportunities as we approach next year's halving. The increased value of combined cash and Bitcoin, along with reduced debt is prudent risk management and a source of strength for the company's balance sheet as we enter a potentially turbulent time for the industry during halving next year. In fact, we have already started to see less efficient and undercapitalized miners looking to be acquired prior to the halve.Â As mentioned in our October production report, our unrestricted cash balance at October 31 was $156 million, and we held approximately 13,396 bitcoins with a fair value of $464 million. In total, we had over $0.6 billion in unrestricted cash in Bitcoin at end of the last month. In addition, during the third quarter, we began making enhancements to our treasury management strategy. Specifically, we began hedging a portion of our Bitcoin holdings. For those who are less familiar with the concept, hedging is designed to mitigate the impacts of extreme volatility in the near term while maintaining the long-term strategy of maximizing the size and value of our treasury. It is designed with predefined risk terms and protects Marathon from sharp downward price movements, while still allowing us to take advantage of upside gains. Hedging is likely to have an impact on our earnings going forward as we recognize gains or losses from such hedging activity. Given Bitcoin's historical volatility, we believe this strategy is integral to improving the resilience of our organization, providing downside risk protection during volatile market conditions and maximizing our Bitcoin valuation potential.Â We expect our future Bitcoin holdings will generally increase, but will fluctuate depending on operating and market conditions. We intend to add to our Bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities, and we will also continue to sell Bitcoin as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs and for general corporate purposes. And that completes my update. I will now turn it back over to Fred, who will talk more about our operations and our ongoing plan. Fred? Thanks, Salman. Our strong results this quarter represent the culmination of several years of hard work, and we first detailed our asset-light strategy in 2021. We believe investing in mining hardware over infrastructure was the most capital-efficient way to scale quickly. Today, we are proud to say this strategy has worked as Marathon is now the leading public miner, public bitcoin miner in the U.S. In Q3, we mined 18% more bitcoin and ended with 27% more hash rate than our closest competitor. This outstanding growth would not have been possible without our asset-light strategy. We estimate the company was able to invest 30% more capital in hash rate growth while our competitors were building infrastructure. Marathon has now entered a new phase, one that prioritizes both capital and operating efficiency. Early in the third quarter, our joint venture in Abu Dhabi powered up, marking our first designed and operated sites as well as our first international location. This site began hatching less than 6 months after we signed the contract, a testament to the strength of both our operations team and our joint venture partner, 02.Â Last month, our second site in Masdar City began energizing and the entire 250 megawatts from both UAE locations are still on track to energize fully by end the year. In addition to improving Marathon's technical expertise and execution capabilities, our success in the UAE is also helping shape the energy debate. At the official ribbon-cutting last month in Masdar City, we heard firsthand how Marathon's UAE ventures ability to collaborate with the local grid operator has been a resounding success. But this is just the beginning. As more countries become aware of Bitcoin Mining's unique capabilities to support grid stabilization and monetize stranded energy, we expect to see continued international growth towards our target of diversifying our hash rate globally. In addition, our UAE success also demonstrates how our emerging technology can unlock stranded energy even in the most challenging climate. As a matter of fact, the number of leading competitors recently requested to visit our Abu Dhabi facility to see for themselves how we achieved 99% uptime in such a challenging operating environment.Â Our success in UAE has opened up new international opportunities in Africa and Latin America, most recently in Paraguay, as we announced yesterday. This new joint venture is powered by the Itaipu Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world. Paraguay produces approximately 32 terawatt hours of surplus energy per year, and Bitcoin miners have the unique ability to co-locate right at the source and take advantage of the stranded energy. This helps local power generators monetize excess energy, which otherwise would have been wasted or sold at a loss without having to build expensive transmission lines and additional infrastructure. For Marathon, it provides attractive power cost for baseload renewable energy. It is truly a win-win for both sides.Â Closer to home, we recently announced a pilot project in Utah that is exclusively powered by landfill methane gas. Methane is 80x more damaging to the environment in carbon dioxide and Marathon is uniquely positioned to capture and convert this environmentally harmful gas into inexpensive renewable energy. This initial pilot is expected to have all-in hosting costs below $0.04 per kilowatt hour, significantly below the average cost to mine in the U.S. But we think we can do even better. Our ultimate goal is zero cost energy. You may ask how is this possible? In addition to creating innovative ways to leverage energy that was previously inaccessible, we can repurpose the heat generated by bitcoin mining towards revenue-generating projects such as heating greenhouses, shrimp farming and other forms of low-grade industrial heat processes. We look forward to sharing more of the innovative projects that we're exploring in the months ahead.Â Why are we so focused on low cost or even zero cost energy? As many of you know, it coin mining revenues are impacted by the having events that occur every 4 years when block reward subsidies are reduced by 50% to bitcoin terms. The next halving is less than 6 months away. Over time, bitcoin miners must reduce their reliance on block subsidies and increasing bitcoin price. We believe that long term, we can operate profitably by consuming wasted energy while monetizing heat offtake. The early results of our initial pilots look very promising. By reducing our dependence on block subsidies, we greatly improve the long-term viability of the enterprise. So what is Marathon doing to prepare? Our strategy has been to reduce costs and lower our risk profile as we continue to grow our hash rate. In addition to strong operating results, we also improved our financial profile this quarter. As Salman mentioned, we took advantage of the steep discount in our convertible debt to strengthen our balance sheet. We believe this traction was accretive to our existing shareholders as the 21% on the principal amount to more than offset the additional equity issue. It also positions Marathon to capitalize on any near-term turbulence in the bitcoin mining sector. Our balance sheet is now a source of strength that allows us to focus on further increasing efficiency and lowering costs. In the meantime, we're still focused on growth. We expect to reach 26 exahash by the end of 2023 and plan to grow our hash rate by approximately 30% in 2024. We will maintain a flexible approach, leveraging hosting providers and local experts to quickly test deployments in new geographies while we continue to prioritize owned and operated sites for major deployment.Â We will also continue to innovate and continue to seek new ways of lowering costs by unlocking stranded energy and leveraging heat uptake. With our strong results and recent progress on these strategic priorities, we believe we are on track to become one of the largest, most efficient and technically advanced bitcoin mining operations in the world. Combined, Marathon is well positioned for the halving regardless of where bitcoin prices are heading next year. Let me be clear, we've never been more bullish on bitcoin. The sustained growth in adoption, use cases and overall acceptance is very encouraging for the long-term prospects, and we are excited about our future. Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the most popular questions submitted by investors through our Q&A platform. Our first question comes from CK, who asked -- actually the 2-part question. So the first part is, why do analysts still favor Riot and CleanSpark over Marathon after taking extreme steps to extinguish long-term debt in Q3. Fred? Marathon still has more debt than our peers, and we're transitioning our business model. Our reported cost per bitcoin is also higher, and we aim to close this gap in 2024. Also, as you look at our business, we believe that optimizing our costs through the benefit of some of the opportunities that will be available post-halving here will enable us to continue to drive costs down significantly. Great. The second part is, it's diluting to reduce debt in the mid-$9 range is accretive to shareholders, why have no insiders bought common stock when the stock has dipped into the 8s? Do you also want to take that one Fred. Sure. So SEC rules restrict insider buying under certain conditions, especially when executives and insiders are party to material non-public information. Typically public companies like Marathon would have a window that is open to buy stock that starts typically a few days after earnings release and would close typically somewhere around 1 month before end of quarter, which is a very small window. As we stated before, we have a lot of major initiatives underway, which means that the management team is currently very much in hold of or have knowledge of material non-public information, which potentially would be a violation if we were in the market buying. That being said, we remain very bullish on the stock, and we continue to look forward to seeing how we can drive shareholder value going forward. Our next question comes from Garrett A, who asked. Why is Marathon not increase the degree that bitcoin has in the past month? A timely topic, Fred, your thoughts? Again, as we said earlier, we're very focused on lowering our costs and leveraging our strong balance sheet. We believe that shareholders are starting to look at the halving. And as you look across the whole mining sector, many of our peers have also seen their share prices declining, especially in the most recent few weeks. We believe that there is certain concerns regarding the ETF launching and the impact that, that may have on bitcoin miners as well. But as I said earlier, we remain very bullish, and we think that this is going to be an excellent opportunity for Marathon to continue to grow. Let's move to our third question from Logan W who ask, will you continue to dilute the shares I heard this a lot recently. Salman, do you want to start on this one? Sure, Logan, thank you for the question. Use equity capital for accretive growth capital growth projects. And as Fred had mentioned earlier in the call, we have a very strong pipeline of growth projects that we, as a company and management team are very excited about. We have the -- obviously, we have the option to source the growth either through selling bitcoin or accessing capital markets. And what our internal analysis shows is a combination of bitcoin sales to fund operating costs and equity for growth capital to be the best source of capital. Any additional shares that we sell through our at-the-market ATM are for accretive growth projects. And look, those projects have to meet our internal double-digit hurdle rate, which means the rate of returns have to be accretive to the shares that we issued. Our management team meets once a month to revisit our source of capital. And this strategy has worked well for our company, but can be changed with changing market conditions and bitcoin pricing situation for which we will adjust accordingly.Â Now this has allowed us to grow our Bitcoin holdings. As you know, we now have approximately $0.5 billion worth of bitcoin on our balance sheet or dollar equivalent. And we have proven our ability to find and invest in attractive growth opportunities, as Fred have alluded to earlier. In summary, everything we do has only one ore arcing which is to maximize shareholder value. Hopefully, this answers your questions. Great. Our next question comes from Derek G. who asked, why did management choose to buy back the convertible debt instead of buying bitcoin and increasing the HODL value up to the debt level? A good way of looking at it. Maybe someone can start on this one and Fred can finish it up. Sure. Thank you, Derek, for the question. We are the largest bitcoin HODLer in the public company mining space. So we truly believe in bitcoin, and we hold to that HODL with that strategy as much as we can after paying for our operating costs. And we continue to grow our bitcoin holding beyond meeting our operating cash cost needs. As we went through the bear market analysis last year, it became important to reduce our debt and prepare for the next share market. And we felt it was prudent balance sheet risk management to reduce the debt to prepare for turbulent times. As I said earlier, we're long on bitcoin price, yet we want to be prepared to weather the volatility that could result during the halving, given concerning macroeconomic environment. While we hope the bitcoin price will act like previous halvings, the data shows us otherwise. Hope is never a good strategy as it is said. And certainly, we hope that the prices behave like they did in the previous having, but certainly, we want to be prepared for any bear market while being prepared to grow as the pricing stabilizes.Â With that stronger balance sheet with reduced debt provides us options and ability to strategically act when other inefficient or undercapitalized miners may not be able to survive. And the short-term drop in bitcoin could be devastating for companies not appropriately capitalized, as we talked about earlier. In addition to risk management, the economics of the notes exchange were attractive for us and resulted in over $100 million shareholder value creation and real cash cost savings, which was icing on the cake. Fred, you want to add anything to that? Yes. I think the -- to the point of why didn't we buy bitcoin with equity? I think then we would just be emulating MicroStrategy's strategy, where they lever up their balance sheet to buy bitcoin, and that really is the primary driver of the value of the company. We believe as a bitcoin miner we generate much more value by using capital to drive growth. And I think if you look at where we are positioned today with the growth we have ahead, the initiatives that we're working on, we're very well positioned today to take advantage of organic and inorganic opportunities as they present themselves. And as we've said before, we believe there will be many inorganic opportunities to acquire very low-cost assets, especially attractive power contract in the potentially turbulent times ahead post the halving. Great. Now we turn into our last question from our shareholders, which is from Edgar M who asks, what makes this company the best option when it comes to bitcoin mining? What makes you different? I'll let you do that one, Fred. So I think really, it comes down to a combination of things, scale for the largest bitcoin miner out there from a self-mining perspective and will continue to grow. That also gives us certain advantages in that partners want to work with us, and it gives us the ability to do joint ventures with the excellent partners like we have in Abu Dhabi and other places. And as you'll continue to see, as we grow, especially in these new market areas, whether it be landfill, natural gas or other places like that, we will continue to leverage this concept as a way to grow in an accelerated way being able to optimize the leverage on our balance sheet in the most capital-efficient way. The other thing is our tech stack. We're very unique in the mining space in that we have a fully vertically integrated tech stack. As can be seen by what we've done in Abu Dhabi, our ability to deploy single-phase immersion technology for cooling and most probably the most growing environment in the world for bitcoin miners has been a resounding success. Excellent uptime and very efficient mining, we believe that sets the stage for how we'll expand with Immersion going forward. But that's not all. We also have proprietary firmware where we now have the ability post halving to take our miners and run them in a more power-efficient way, lowering our cost to mine bitcoin for other people, we'll have to run stock firmware on their miners and not be able to dial back the power consumption and keep their miners running even though it may not be profitable to mine.Â Our balance sheet is extremely strong with $600 million between cash and bitcoin at today's prices. And we have great liquidity in our stock, which gives us the ability to be very opportunistic, should accretive and attractive growth opportunities appear in the market. We also have optionality because we're continually focused on lowering our cost per coin as we transition we can grow, energize new capacity and optimize our existing capacity, which has an excellent effect on our results, as you can see in the most recent quarter. And I think lastly, our people. I believe we have one of the best management teams in the industry and have some of the best talent across our organization in this industry. There are not many companies who can execute the way our team has executed this year with as few people as we have generating the results that we've done. And I am very, very proud of our people and very grateful all the hard work that they put in. Couldn't agree more. Well done. I think we'll wrap up the section of the Q&A. Again, we really appreciate the questions and interest. I'm now going to turn the call back to our operator to over the line to questions from our covering analysts. Sherry, back to you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chase White with Compass Point. So my rough math suggests your hosting costs in the quarter on at least on a dollar per kilowatt hour basis, something like $5.07, which is much better than prior quarters. I mean you can see and you grew average operating cash rate by 18% and costs only grew by 8%. So how should we think about the hosting costs on a per kilowatt hour basis going forward for the U.S. fleet as we head into 2024? Great question. So obviously, when you begin an optimization effort like we did recently, there's some low-hanging fruit, and we've been able to take advantage of that, hence, the great results we had. There's still more fruit to harvest. We think as we continue to work with our hosting partners and actively manage them. There are still opportunities to drive further efficiencies in what we're doing. There are also opportunities for us to work with hosting partners to renegotiate some of the agreements, especially as now we are taking on a greater and greater responsibility for the operation of sites and optimization. And I think the combination of more owned and operated together with more efficiently managed sites is going to continue to drive a decrease in Boston mined bitcoin. Got it. That's helpful. And you mentioned 30% hash rate growth in 2024 from the expected 26 exahash at the end of this year. Could you just give us a sense of a road map to that 30% tax rate growth in 2024? And what pieces kind of drive that? So we've already talked a little bit about the Paraguay expansion. There are other opportunities. We haven't announced that we're pretty far down the road in finalizing agreements and projects that will bear fruit in the first half of next year as well as in the back half of next year. So I think it's going to be a little lumpy, to be fair. You'll see a few extra hash in the first half of the year and then the balance kind of backloaded towards the second half of the year. But the goal is really focusing on the cost side of it as we expand this capacity. Our next question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. This is actually Nick Coles on the call asking a question for Lucas. Fred and team, just wanted to get your sense of how would you frame up a hurdle rate for the sector in terms of new projects? Oh gosh, I think each miner has their own individual weighted cost of capital. And so I'm not going to opine on kind of our colleagues in the industry. We're looking typically at projects that we would, in an ideal world should return north of 20%. That's helpful, Fred. I know one of your peers have called out a hurdle rate of around closer to 30% or 35%. So I just was trying to understand what your take was. But yes, thank you very much. I'll return to the queue for now. I'm sorry, I want to follow up and clarify a little bit on the answer. The hurdle rates is a funny business in the sense that depends on what kind of pricing assumptions you have. And obviously, our pricing may be a little bit more conservative than some of our competitors when it comes to next year. Hopefully, that answers the question. That's fair. I appreciate that follow-up. [Operator Instructions]Â Our next question is from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Lots of them for you, Fred. I'll try to restrain myself. Can you give us some more insight on the 5 extra to hash you just bought and where you think that's going to go? And what sort of -- I mean, that's kind of a parallel to Chase's question. And then maybe you could offer a little bit more on your hedging strategy. I'll defer the hedging question to Salman. But on the growth perspective, you've gotten a little bit of a taste of what we're doing as we look at these pilots. We have a number of growth initiatives we're doing. And instead of committing large amounts of capital to an initiative before it's proven. We're doing lots of pilots. When a pilot proves itself out, then we can have the confidence to deploy capital, it also lets us compare and contrast different potential opportunities. So we're optimizing to the best return on our capital that we provide. So we've talked about the Paraguay expansion. We've taken an approach more recently where we're not going to go out there and talk loudly about our plans because we're doing lots of things, and we prefer to really talk to the market when things have been cemented, and we're actually executing. I think that we've set a pretty high hurdle for this year to hit our 23 exahash goal, and I think we learned a lesson that clearly, the market would appreciate us to talk less about our growth plans in specifics and more about actual growth execution. And with that, I'll let Salman answer the question about the hedging. Thanks, Dede, for asking this question. Look, our hedging strategy is pretty -- it's normal business practice from a financial risk management standpoint. And this is a newer industry, if you like, but more established, sophisticated industries that are commodity price exposed like oil and gas, natural gas, gold, you see hedging strategies deployed by companies to manage their portfolio. And in our case, we view that as a good risk management practice from a balance sheet management standpoint. As we have a sizable -- one of the largest hurdle of bitcoin on our balance sheet, it certainly requires us to deploy certain prudent practices, and this is part of that. So the way to view that is that we look at from a hedging standpoint, our next month moves and essentially next couple of months needs from a cash flow perspective, and we try to target a certain percentage of our holding and use costless collars that protects us from the downside risk while keeping the upside potential on our side. And these are costless collars, so which means that within the range of the price, if the price remains within a range, we will end up pretty much being costless. Now in a situation where the price lands between the downside protection and the ceiling between the swaps or the options are the costless collars there could be a cost to us. And that flows through the P&L yet providing us the upside on the big point on the balance sheet and also protecting the downsides. Costless collars. That's kind of what I was looking for. Fred, last one, I'll hold myself back. The October production report showed, I think, maybe 4 -- sorry, 3 of the 4 operating facilities you have in North America were hashing at rates below 90%. And I'm just -- I know you talked about maybe being more involved in the management -- the direct management of those sites. But maybe you can add a little bit more color on how you might see you move those efficiencies further up. I mean that, to me, would be probably the most instrumental moves you can make in improving your cost per coin. Yes. So obviously, we're very focused on the lowest performing site and the McCamey, Texas site has clearly been that site. That's the site where we've had to apply the most amount of resources. Our Ellendale site has been a very good performer, as at the Jamestown site. There been some infrastructure downtime for maintenance issues at some of the sites as well. But I think what you'll tend to find is provided, we are in a period where there is not a lot of curtailment due to requirements of the grid. We're going to keep pushing that performance number to 90 and above as much as possible. And what do you think your timeline is to that? Should we see that step up incrementally? Or do you think there should be a nice jump before we get to maybe a higher power consumption season in January and February? So I think it's going to be a little seasonal, but I think it will be a gradual move. Part of this is you implement a change, you test it, you iterate, you make sure it sticks and then you broaden it out. It's kind of like when we deploy firmware in our miners. We do it in a limited number of miners initially make sure everything is operating, and then we scale it as we go across the site. Same thing with any changes, whether it's a network optimization, whether it's deploying cooling for switchgear. A whole series of different things we're constantly experimenting with to try to optimize and something that works at one site may not work at another site. And so it's very much an iterative process. And I have a background in lean from a manufacturing perspective, and we've really applied a high sense sort of lean approach to this, where constant never-ending improvement is one of our core values and what we're doing here. And we hold the operations teams to metrics where they need to continually improve performance of the sites. And so it's an iterative process. Thank you. At this point, there are no further questions. I'm going to turn the call back over to Chris Brendler for closing remarks. Okay. Well, thank you all for your time today.

Welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Charlie Schumacher, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Charlie. Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us for our call today. With me on today's call are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Thiel; and our Chief Financial Officer, Salman Khan.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Marathon at this time.
Some of these risks and uncertainties are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be viewed at www.sec.gov and ir.mara.com. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, including adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP total margin. Marathon believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of its operating performance because they exclude certain items that are unrelated to and may not be indicative of its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and to our website for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Salman. After their comments, we will be going through some of the more popular questions from our investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts. And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Charlie. We had 2 primary objectives for 2023, which we outlined on our first quarter earnings call last year. The first was to energize our previously purchased mining rigs to reach our target of 23x as and the second was to optimize our performance to become more effective and more efficient. As the record operational and financial results we published today clearly demonstrate 2023 was an immensely successful year for Marathon in which we achieved both of our primary objectives.
Today, Marathon is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America and whether it be financially, operationally or technologically, we believe we are setting the pace for this industry. In 2023, we grew our hash rate 253% from 7 exahash to 24.7 exahash, surpassing our target of 23 exahash. At the end of last calendar year, we had over 210,000 Bitcoin miners operating across 11 different sites on 3 continents which we believe makes us the largest and most diversified publicly traded miner today. At the same time, we became much more efficient at converting energy into economic value, which is the heart of what we do. During the year, we improved our fleet efficiency 21% from 30.9 jewels per terahash to 24.5 duels per terahash, which means that on top of our scale and our diversified operations, we have one of the most efficient fleets in the industry.
Our operations team dedicated significant efforts to enhance the performance of our facilities. In August of 2023, our site and King Mountain only operated at an average of 51% of its operational capacity and the site in Granbury only averaged 56% of its total capacity. Our team took charge the situation flying in to assess and address the issues. And by the end of 2023, our team had often lied both sites such that King Mountain operated an average of 92% of its capacity and Granbury at an average of 99% of its capacity in December.
While site performance will fluctuate with seasonality and maintenance, the significant improvements we made underscore the positive impact that our team and our processes can have in our operation, a testament that we are not just effective capital allocators, but excellent operators as well. Our operational expertise is one of the many reasons we are confident that we will be able to successfully integrate and ultimately optimize the 2 data centers we recently acquired from Generate Capital and any other sites we may acquire in the near or distant future. In 2023, the total Bitcoin network hash rate experienced a significant increase, doubling from 253 exahash to 509 exahash. This increase in hash rate has the equivalent impact of a having event with hash rate doubling difficulty essentially doubled and that effectively reduced the reward reminding a block by half, holding all else constant.
Meanwhile, Marathon grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the network as we increased our hash rate 253% last year. At the same time, we improved our operational efficiency, improving our fleet efficiency 21%. As a result, we produced a record amount of Bitcoin in 2023. We increased our Bitcoin production 210% year-over-year from 4,144 Bitcoin in 2022 to 12,852 Bitcoin in 2023. Production improved throughout the year, but the fourth quarter really stood out operationally and financially. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, we were operating near full strength after Garden City was fully energized in October, following several months of regulatory delays.
In December, we averaged 90% capacity across all sites, and at the same time, we benefited from a huge surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. In December 2023 alone, we produced 1,853 Bitcoin with 380 Bitcoin or 22% of our total production coming from fees. As a result, we produced a record 4,242 Bitcoin in Q4. In Q4 2023 alone, we produced more Bitcoin than we did in all of 2022 and more Bitcoin than 3 of our top competitors combined. In addition to Q4's record Bitcoin production, we announced several new expansions at the end of last year that are indicative of how we see Marathon evolving.
The first announcement was our inaugural pilot project powered by renewable offered Energy from a landfill in Utah. Our team is still working on finalizing the data, but the preliminary results of this project demonstrates that Bitcoin miners can actually help reduce emissions. The data suggests that the model we help pioneer of turning trash into cash by mining Bitcoin with stranded methane from landfills is economically viable for miners for the landfill operator and is more effective at reducing methane emissions and flaring.
Following the landfill gas project in Utah, we also announced our second international expansion in our first deployment into Latin America. In Paraguay, we're working to convert 27 megawatts of unused hydropower into 1.1 x hash of Bitcoin mining capacity. By Marathon Standards deployment is really just a large-scale pilot, and it serves as an excellent case study for the value that Bitcoin mining can bring to regions throughout the world with excess power. It also demonstrates our ability to replicate the joint venture model that we developed in Abu Dhabi, which allows us to partner with regional experts to quickly and effectively expand our diversified portfolio of Bitcoin mining assets. This experience is essential as we look to grow our footprint internationally and educate the world on the value that Bitcoin mining can bring as a technology solution to the energy sector. Perhaps the most significant announcement from last quarter was our $179 million acquisition of our first fully owned data centers in Kearney, Nebraska and Granbury, Texas.
The acquisition closed last month and the purchase price was subject to customary closing adjustments. With this acquisition, Marathon transformed from a company with 584 megawatts of capacity, 3% of which we directly owned or operated to one with 910 megawatts of capacity, 45% of which power sites we directly own. We've already spoken about the strategic importance of owning these sites of the accretive nature of this transaction and of the opportunities we have to reduce our operational costs at these sites. So I'll refrain from going into detail today. We will be assuming full operation control of them by April 30 or earlier, allowing us to accelerate operational cost savings and optimization.
While we're not yet the operators, our team is currently intently focused on engaging the local communities to ensure that we can be the best neighbors possible as we go through the transition process. We believe Bitcoin mining can positively change the world, and that starts with the local communities in which we operate, where our operations create highly skilled jobs and economic contributions for the people of those communities.
Before going too far into our future plans, I'm going to turn the call over to Salman to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2023. Salman? Thank you, Fred. We had an excellent fourth quarter to cap off what was an incredibly successful year for Marathon. We produced record revenues, net income and adjusted EBITDA, and we've entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet that has us well positioned for the upcoming having and beyond. Well, let me dig into the details. The company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $152 million or $0.62 per diluted common share in the quarter compared to a net loss of approximately $392 million or $3.13 per share in the prior year quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $261 million or $1.06 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $694 million or $6.12 per share in the prior year. In both the quarter and the year, the improvement in profitability was partially due to us choosing to early adopt the new FASB fair value accounting rules. As the company not early adopted the new FASB fair value accounting rules, our net income attributable to common stockholders for fourth quarter of 2023 would have been a net loss of $5 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share and net income of $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2023.
I will discuss these changes and the impact in more detail shortly. But first, let's dive into mining results. Fourth quarter revenues were a record $157 million, significantly higher than prior year revenues of $28 million and were driven by a 172% increase in Bitcoin production, coupled with a 101% higher average price of Bitcoin. For the full year, we recorded revenues of approximately $388 million, also a significant improvement compared to $118 million in the prior year. The improvement year-over-year was driven by a 210% increase in Bitcoin production and a 2% average price of Bitcoin in 2023 compared to 2022.
It is important to note that in 2023, we benefited from the accident of a $333 million impairment of mining equipment and advances to vendors, a $183 million impairment of digital assets an $85 million loss on digital assets held within the investment fund and a $56 million impairment of deposits, loan and investment due to vendor bankruptcy, partially offset by an $84 million gain on sale of equipment net of disposals in 2022. Our hosting and energy costs for the 3 months ended December 31 were $75 million compared to $30 million last year. For the year, hosting and energy costs were $223 million compared to $73 million in 2022.
In both time periods, the increase was primarily due to growth in our mining fleet and related costs. Total cost of revenues, which includes depreciation and amortization, was $146 million in Q4 of 2023 compared to $44 million in Q4 of 2022, an increase of 235%. For the full year, this was $403 million, 166% from $151 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $71 million, increasing by $57 million compared to the same period in the prior year.
For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $380 million compared to $79 million in 2022. In both periods, the change was predominantly the result of growing our energized cash rate from 7 exahash to 24.7 exahash. We have also early adopted FASB's accounting for a disclosure of crypto assets, which actually requires the measurement of crypto assets at fair value. The adoption of new accounting guidance resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment at the beginning of 2023.
In 2023, we increased our Bitcoin holdings 24% from 12,232 Bitcoin to 15,126. Because of the significant amount of Bitcoin we hold on our balance sheet, we recognized a gain on digital assets of $214 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a gain on digital assets of $331 million for the full year under this new accounting guidance. As one of the largest holders of Bitcoin among publicly traded companies, we expect the new fair value accounting of Bitcoin to continue to impact our bottom line going forward as the price of Bitcoin fluctuates. The company's non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization was $82 million this quarter compared to a loss of $1 million in the same quarter last year.
For the fiscal year 2023, our non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $164 million compared to $45 million in 2022. In both cases, the change was predominantly related to higher Bitcoin prices, increased production and increased operational efficiency. In Q4 of 2023, adjusted EBITDA improved to $260 million versus a $374 million loss in the prior year period. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA improved to $420 million from a loss of $543 million in 2022. The drivers of the adjusted EBITDA improvement in both periods include total margin improvement, excluding depreciation and amortization, gains on digital assets and the absence of impairment charges.
Due to the impairment charges of $572 million in 2022, we had a gain of over $700 million, which had a positive impact to earnings when compared to last year. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $20.5 million in Q4 of 2023 compared to $13 million in the prior year period. For the fiscal year 2023, G&A, excluding stock-based compensation, was $63 million compared to $32 million in 2022. This increase in expenses was primarily due to the increase in scale of the business, including payroll and benefits, professional fees and other costs. At the end of 2023, we had approximately 60 employees, up from 30 a year ago, and we continue to opportunistically add talent across the organization.
Turning to our Bitcoin holdings and cash position. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $357 million at December 31, 2023, up $254 million compared to last year. Also at December 31, we held approximately 15,126 Bitcoin with a carrying value of $640 million on the balance sheet. The company's combined balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and Bitcoin was approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2023. We sold 2,365 Bitcoin during Q4 of 2023, realizing cash proceeds of $83 million.
During the year, we sold 9,482 bit point and realized cash proceeds of $264 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses. During the year, we generated $608 million from at-the-market equity sales, which we primarily intend to use for growth capital and other general corporate purposes. As previously discussed, during the year, we took advantage of an opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet by exchanging $417 million in convertible notes for approximately $329 million in equity. This transaction reduced our debt by 56% and saved approximately $101 million or $0.55 per share in cash for our stockholders. The combined cash and cash equivalents and Bitcoin on our balance sheet, along with reduced debt and access to at the market facility provides us ample amount of liquidity and optionality to strategically evaluate opportunities as we approach having.
We believe the increased value of combined cash and Bitcoin, along with reduced debt is prudent risk management and source of strength of the company's balance sheet as we enter it potentially turbulent time for the industry. As mentioned in our January production report, our unrestricted cash balance at January 31 was $319 million, and we held approximately 15,741 Bitcoin with a fair value of $670 million. In total, we had approximately $1 billion in unrestricted cash and Bitcoin at the end of January.
We continue to actively manage and optimize our treasury by hedging a portion of our Bitcoin Holdings. The purpose is to mitigate the impacts of extreme volatility in the near term while maintaining the long-term strategy of maximizing the size and value of our treasury. Given Bitcoin's historical volatility, we believe this strategy is a temperate to improving the resilience of our organization, providing downside risk protection during volatile market conditions and maximizing our Bitcoin valuation potential.
We expect our Bitcoin holdings will generally increase but fluctuate depending on operating and market conditions. And again, due to the significant amount of Bitcoin we hold on our balance sheet, we expect these fluctuations to continue to impact our bottom line with the adoption of the new accounting rules. We intend to add to our Bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities, and we will also continue to sell Bitcoin as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs and for general corporate purposes. Given our positive financial results and our robust balance sheet, we believe Marathon is well positioned to achieve our 2024 growth targets and to capitalize on any opportunities that present themselves around the upcoming having. And that completes my update. I'll now turn it back to Fred, who will talk more about our operations and our ongoing plans. Fred? Thanks, Salman. Those of you who have been tracking our pool will know that Q4's record performance was followed by temporary operational challenges in North Dakota and Texas that started in mid-January and have now been resolved. These sites operated by Applied Digital had unplanned outages due to transformer and transition line maintenance. In both instances, our team in MEA began working with our hosting provider to find solutions to the issues, which are now resolved. As of this week, Ellendale is nearly back to full strength and Garden City is reenergized. While these maintenance issues are now resolved, we do currently expect Q4 record performance to outshine the first quarter of this year due to the prolonged impact.
Regardless, we're confident that the best and most exciting times for our operations are still to come. One year ago, the world was a very different place for Bitcoin miners and for Marathon. We were in a bear market with Bitcoin's price hovering around $23,000. Marathon itself represented less than 3% of the Bitcoin network with only 7 exahash online. We had 280 megawatt portfolio of Bitcoin mining assets, all based in the United States.
We had $226 million of liquidity, and we carried $798 million of debt on our balance sheet. Today is a very different story. Bitcoin's price is hovering around 60,000. I just strike out the 55,000 in my script because Bitcoin kept moving up in price today. Marathon represents approximately 5% of the Bitcoin network with over 26 exahash online and more coming. We have a 900 megawatt portfolio of Bitcoin mining assets diversified across 11 sites in 3 different continents. We have $1 billion of liquidity on our balance sheet and have reduced debt by over $411 million while saving our shareholders $100 million in the process, resulting in net debt of $331 million. We're integrating our first major acquisitions and taking direct control of nearly half of our hash rate, but we're only just getting started. In 2024, we plan to grow our operational hash rate more than 35% to approximately 35 to 37 exahash.
By the end of 2025, we plan to be at 50x to ash, which is approximately double our current capacity. These targets are based on our current machine orders and pipeline. However, we believe there are opportunities to accelerate the time line and realize these targets even sooner. So you may ask how are we going to get there.
To start, we have orders and options for machines that represent upwards of 45 additional exahash with orders for 22 exahash miners already placed an inbound with the option to add another 23 exahash capacity. Additionally, Marathon's investment in Auradine has already begun to pay dividends by providing us with an additional avenue to increase cash rate at an accelerated pace. If we choose to execute on these orders, we have the potential to reach 69.7 exahash [indiscernible] since procuring machines is not a constraint on Marathon's growth, the obvious question is where do we deploy the next 45 exahash of miners. The 2 sites we recently acquired are the first part of the answer. Granbury, in particular, has substantial expansion potential, which we've discussed in press releases and on our last call. But to meet our appetite for growth, we will need to do much more, which will consist of both organic and inorganic growth domestically and internationally with a focus on optimized cost to mine and a sustainable energy source. This is where our balance sheet comes into play.
We have been building up a substantial stockpile of dry powder, now totaling over $1 billion between cash and Bitcoin, and we intend to utilize it to continue growing our business through organic and inorganic means as opportunities arise. So far in 2024, we have raised $489.3 million at an average share price of $19.8. As our 10-K will show, we have filed a new shelf giving us the option to raise an additional $1.5 billion via at-the-market equity offering. This would bring our total potential war chest to over $2.5 billion if it were fully exercised the shelf that is.
Today, the majority of our 900-megawatt Bitcoin mining portfolio predominantly consists of machines in large data centers that reside near power stations in the United States. We believe there exists significant opportunities to develop utility-scale mining operations based on stranded energy outside of the United States, like our UAE and Paraguay side. We will look for more opportunities in places such as the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. But our organization is evolving and with it, we believe we can revolutionize the way people think about Bitcoin mining.
Our long-term vision for Marathon is a diverse global organization that leverages Bitcoin mining technologies to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. Bitcoin miners excel at 2 things, consuming standard energy and generating heat. And while most of our competition is focused on underutilized utility-scale grid energy, we are always asking ourselves, what is the best way to utilize our technology and its unique attributes to create the most value. We believe one of those is through Bitcoin mining's version of recycling, which basically means converting what is currently a waste product into a productive resource.
The pilot project in Utah, where we converted methane gas generated from a landfill into a productive source of power for Bitcoin mining is only one example. There are some new projects our team has been developing that have a higher IRR than traditional Bitcoin mining based on using waste to generate energy and leveraging the heat from Bitcoin mining profitably for low-grade industrial process. It would be premature to discuss details at this time, but given the scale and diversity of applications, we believe the market opportunity here on substantial and the prospects are incredibly exciting. Heat reuse is a concept that we see becoming more significant and scalable in the coming years. Bitcoin miners are more efficient to generating heat from electricity than most other alternatives, including most space heaters, which do nothing but create heat by consuming electricity.
We are currently exploring projects that involve using heat from our mining systems at both large and small scale to provide heat for industrial processes, commercial buildings, homes and even just a living room. It's only a matter of technology and capability in Marathon has both. Marathon's technology group is finalizing the development of a highly scalable immersion technology that enables heat reuse projects in many different form factors, sizes and applications, and we'll be speaking more about this in the near future.
Over the next 5 years, our objective is to have 1 gigawatt of power dedicated to these various applications that are separate from the utility scale mining we're known for today, but that are directly in line with our core competencies. At the heart of these initiatives is our technology. While our growth team initiates potential new projects and our operations team develops and scales our sites, our technology team has been hard at work building and launching new tools and services for those who are building the future of Bitcoin. The first of these is Slipstream, which is the direct transaction submission service we announced last week.
For the Bitcoin community, direct submissions are designed to mitigate censorship and encourage development on Bitcoin. For Marathon, the higher fees may help increase revenue. And as far as we know, Marathon is the only minor capable of offering a direct submission service and benefiting from the potential increase in transaction fees because we're the only miner that operates its own learning pool. This is one of the many reasons we believe there is a strategic value to owning our own pool and focusing on vertically integrating our technology stack. Anduro, which we announced earlier today, is another innovation we have been hard at work on.
We believe Anduro may be the world's first most Bitcoin native layer 2 network, and it is intended to serve as infrastructure for the next generation of Bitcoin applications. This is something we have helped incubate, but it is not something that we own. Anduro is for the pioneers, striving to redefine blockchain adoption. Therefore, it will be community-led and community-driven. Why give something like us away for free to the community? It's actually quite straightforward. We have a vested interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem. We're the second largest holder of Bitcoin among publicly traded companies and the largest single publicly traded organization working to process Bitcoin transactions and secure the network.
Our core competency is converting energy and to economic value in the for Bitcoin, therefore, it's Bitcoin furnished, so do we. This is also why we helped raise approximately $800,000 in just 4 days last year to support Bitcoin Core Developers, $500,000 of which was contributed by Marathon itself. We believe that Anduro can have a positive impact on the community, but we also recognize that different people have different views on how best to extend the utility of Bitcoin. We believe in testing, iterating and letting the market decide what works best. It is that experimental and natural mindset that is core to Marathon's DNA.
And as we look to scale in 2024 and beyond, it will remain one of the primary differentiators that sets Marathon apart. Marathon's leadership team consists of people who think differently and are willing to try divergent ways to execute and deliver on our vision. While 2023 was a banner year for Marathon, we have never been more optimistic about Marathon's future, and we look forward to building on our accomplishments to leverage all of our assets to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. And with that, I'll turn it back to Charlie for Q&A. Thanks, Fred. At this time, we're going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the most popular questions submitted by investors through our Q&A platform. So the first question comes from Rex, who asks, is the company more profitable after BTC having? I'll take that question. Thank you,. Thank you for asking the question. Just for the benefit of everybody, having are unique to this industry in Bitcoin and force the industry to become more efficient every 4 years. And the drop in the [ Blocker ] board forces the inefficient operators out and the most efficient one remains. And we expect this likely will help us gain market share as we go through the having. The impact on Marathon will depend on where the Bitcoin prices go from here. Obviously, there has been a great run in the Bitcoin price recently. And it all depends on how much the competition falls from here as well with those inefficient miners, which could drive some interesting activity in the marketplace.
With that, we have a significant discount holding on our balance sheet. And given that fact, if you do the math simple terms, every $10,000 change in Bitcoin price will result in approximately $200 million of change in our EBITDA on an annualized basis. And in the current price environment, we expect to be profitable and with the assumption that the competition will -- certain of those machines will go down and it will provide us opportunity to create more value for our stockholders. Hopefully, that answers. One thing I'll just pile on top of Salman's great answers. The fact that we are very focused on growing parts of our business that generate higher IRRs than traditional Bitcoin mining. So we have one of the most efficient fleets in the industry. And if you think about the 45 exahash of machines that we have on the inbound between orders and options, and you just look at the orders that are locked for delivery at this point. Our efficiency will drop from 24 duels per terahash down to somewhere around 22 or near 21 jewels per terahash, again, maintaining the most efficient fleet in the industry.
Our technology investments in heat reuse projects and areas adjacent to Bitcoin mining, will allow us to mine Bitcoin at large scale, though, across multiple smaller installations at costs that may at times sometime approach near 0 energy costs because of the fact that we're actually paid to generate electricity in some cases. We believe is a minor if we can target being in that lower quartile of miners, no matter what the price of Bitcoin and what the global hash rate is, we'll always be able to operate relatively profitably. Our next question comes from Tarek A, who says, ""I love your work and think you're heading in the right direction. A lot of critics are worried that if the crypto market fluctuates, your company won't be able to handle the fluctuation. Fred, so on, how do you address that concern?"" I'll take that. Well, we've been focused on building resiliency. We're investing in technology, diversifying across the business and paying down debt, positioning ourselves for the worst of storms, no matter what might happen. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with $1 billion in cash in Bitcoin, which gives us the strength to survive whatever comes our way. And most importantly, this is not our first cycle. Marathon was built during the last down cycle. And we maneuvered it well and have come out on top of the industry again. And we've never been more confident in our future. So I hope that answers your question. Thanks, Fred. We have 2 questions necks that are a little similar, so I'll ask them back to back. The first is from CK who asked why did Marathon use equity to purchase 183.5 Bitcoin in January after stating on the Q3 earnings call in November, that equity was only to be used to drive growth in hash rate. Also, please explain the 2024 treasury strategy, i.e., what is your target [indiscernible] cash for having at the end of 2024. And then similarly, Samir A asked, will the company purchase any more Bitcoin on its balance sheet. So either if you would like to take that and speak a little bit to Marathon's treasury management strategy? Sure. I'll take that. The question. Look, the company has stated in the past that we want to utilize equity for growth purposes and investment in exahash, whereas we've utilized Bitcoin in for our operating costs. And that's primarily what our stated strategy has been, and we follow that along. In terms of how we have used cash, opportunistically, we have looked at the cash to take advantage of drop in Bitcoin price in certain cases. As you know, cash sitting in the balance sheet with the cash amount of cash that we raised, that yields about 5% in U.S. treasuries.
And when we look at it, we look at it from an investment standpoint, how can we maximize our investments either in cash or Bitcoin. And when there are opportunities that arise like an unusual situation that happened in January with the ETF launches and price went down temporarily, we knew that the price was going to come back up, and that was a great opportunity to create more value for our stockholders, and we took a small position and that has been a very profitable investment for us instead of 5% rate of return on U.S. treasury.
But our core business remains Bitcoin mining. And our primary focus and source of equity is going to be growth investment. Given the unique situation of Bitcoin price and this was an unusual opportunity, we don't expect these kind of opportunities to regularly arise, but we will be opportunistic in nature of just small scale, if you like. Our hotel position and cash it provides us a great mechanism to fight any downturns as the Bitcoin price different cycles, it goes through having it goes through the upcycle, down cycle. We're in a driving position from that perspective. It also provides us a great opportunity for investors to write the price as Bitcoin price appreciates from here. Just to summarize, in future, we may monetize good coin for investing in our company, our general corporate purposes. But as of now, our focus remains to use equity for growth and discount for operating costs. The next question comes from Michael, who asks, what is your DTH or Ethereum mining percentage and your Bitcoin mining percentage in overall mining capacity as of today. How much Bitcoin and Ethereum are on hand at the company currently? Fred, do you want to take that one? Sure. We don't mind it, period. Next question. Short, sweet. All right. Next question comes from Mohar see who asked, what are your plans to compete with competitors based on the hashing power metrics? Marathon does hold a lot of Bitcoin, but the efficiency is somewhat less as compared to [indiscernible]. Are there any plans to address that? We're constantly focused on really 2 things in our mining business, energizing more hash rate and optimizing the cash rate that we have. And our efficiency has increased significantly year-over-year, partially because of the machines that we deploy and having one of the most energy-efficient fleet in the industry and continuing to have that will be [ hostile ] work part of that strategy. We also are the most efficient miner of the publicly traded miners or one of the most efficient on an SG&A basis. And you have to look at the total cost of mine.
You can't just look at your marginal cost of mine Bitcoin. You have to look at the overall costs. What is the corporate cost to mine Bitcoin when you add all of the expenses and allocations to it and we believe that we operate as one of the more efficient miners using that metric already today. But we are very focused on optimization. We're going to continue to roll out more and more parts of our technology across our fleet, which we think is going to increase our operational efficiencies even more. And now as we take control of more and more sites, if you compare us, for example, to Clean Spark and Riot who own their sites predominantly, whereas Marathon historically has not owned their sites, we now own and control 44% of our hash rate. And we expect to see that number grow considerably to the point where the vast majority of our hash rate is owned and operate, which means that we have a significant opportunity for cost reductions just through the operating line. which we believe will put us on par, if not better, than both of those players. Great. Thanks, Fred. I think we'll do one more just in the interest of time. This last question, at least of the prepared questions comes from Michael W, who asks, what is the plan post having to ensure revenue stays the same or goes higher? I think we've addressed this a little. But Fred, do you want to take that one? Well, when having occurs, you produce half as many Bitcoin for the same amount of hash rate, providing global hash rate stays the same. One of the reasons we have set such aggressive growth targets is to make sure we continue to grow our hash rate and grow our percentage of the global hash rate for all miners. So our focus is rapid growth. Our focus is optimizing existing operating metrics and continuing to generate revenues that are complementary to mining from our technology products as well as things adjacent to them. Great. So at this time, we'll wrap up the prepared questions. And again, we really appreciate all the questions and the interest from our investors and the consistent dialogue. So please feel free to keep submitting those and contact us any time. And at this point, I'm now going to turn the call back to our operator, Kevin, to open the line to questions from our covering analysts. So Kevin, back to you. Now conducting our question-and-answer session with Marathon's covering analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Tyler DiMatteo from BTIG. Congrats on the excellent 2023 as well. Fred, I'm just curious here, we've made a lot of strides on expanding the hash rate as we roll out the different technology offerings. As you look out for the rest of this year and into 2025, I mean how do you think about prioritizing the expanding of your own hash versus maybe some of these other tech offerings in just going back and forth between the 2. Sure. Great question. So you can think about our business is organized around 3 predominant silos. One is what we call utility scale mining. This is our traditional business, sites like King Mountain or Granbury, Kearney and what we're doing in UAE, et cetera, large-scale sites, hundreds of megawatts sitting behind the meter or adjacent to the power source and helping balance grids. We see very large opportunities for that internationally. The UAE sites together are 250 megawatts. Today, we have opportunities to expand further, not just in the Gulf region, but also in Africa and Latin America, where we're currently operating in Paraguay, and we'll continue to do that.
We believe that's low-hanging fruit. We also believe there are great opportunities domestically, both in the area of greenfield sites as well as the existing sites similar to the transactions we did kind of with Granbury and Kearney. The second silo is what we call energy harvesting. This is where we leverage Bitcoin mining as a producer of heat, and we predominantly find sources of energy such as methane flare gas and other forms of, let's just call them, recyclable biofuels that we use to generate energy. In some cases, we're actually even paid to do that, to take that material and then recycle heat back into an industrial process, which were paid for it yet again and mine in that way.
Our technology group has developed solutions and together with the partners that we started developing relationships with. We're able to build these projects at small, medium and large scale. And so I think you'll see news later this year of some of the first of those projects arise. And that's the sector of the business that we expect to grow to over 1 gigawatt of power over the next 5 years. The technology sector or silo, if you would, today consists of things like tool software, firmware controller boards, a variety of other technologies as well as now Slipstream and Anduro. While Anduro is technology, we have helped incubate and is not something owned by us that we won't generate revenues from it. Slipstream does generate revenues.
We already have customers that have thought and are using our firmware. We expect to see more sales in those areas. And as our next-generation immersion technology comes to market later this year, we expect that to begin to generate significant revenues as well. And sorry for the long-winded answer. But if you look over a 5-year period, I think what you'll see by the next having in 2028, 50% of our revenue is coming from traditional utility-scale mining, 50% of the revenue is coming from elsewhere. And 50% of the revenue is domestically, 50% of the revenue is internationally. And I hope that answers your question. Okay. No, great. I really appreciate it. Very helpful. And then, Fred, on your comments on Slipstream there. I mean, how should we think about the rollout of that and the actual implementation and generally as management, how are you thinking about bringing that and scaling that to market. So Slipstream is us really unique technology. It's an API. It's a submission system. So you don't have to call a salesperson, you don't do anything. You go to the website, you submit a block, you pay the price for submitting a block, and that block goes into a queue off it goes. It's a hands-free system. Think of it as simple as uploading pictures to the iCloud or something like that. It's very simple. The whole idea is it's meant to be hands-free.
So if you are an artist and want to submit a block, you can do that. If you're a financial institution and you want to ensure that transactions you're doing will have priority, you could potentially purchase blocks in advance and essentially submit blocks as you need them. So there are lots of opportunities, I think, for people to use this. Again, we're iterating, it's a simple tool. This is technology that the key enabler here is that you have to be a miner who operates a pool that's large enough so that you can submit blocks and wind blocks with enough frequency so that the temporal nature of the use of the product makes total sense. Your next question is coming from Joe Flynn from Compass Point Research. Looks like power prices creeped up a bit from the third quarter, backed into like $0.065 levels. Just curious if you could provide more color there and how we should think about all-in power and hosting costs as you guys transition to the 40% owned data center model. So one way to look at that is you have in our normal model, pre being an owner-operator, many times, we don't get the benefit of curtailment when an operator of a site curtails and they get the economic benefit of the curtailment. And there were some winter events in Q4 that had an impact there. You also had because it's wintertime energy prices may have fluctuated well. I think historically, our energy and all-in cost has been in and around the $0.06 per kilowatt hour basis. As we take more control of our sites, the operations side of it, I think you'll see the cost per kilowatt hour drop somewhere between $0.01 to $0.015 possibly more per kilowatt hour.
The other advantage that we have by being an owner-operator is we can now take advantage of economic curtailment. We can now take advantage of power hedges. We can now take advantage of buying and selling power and doing that. And we have already seen the economic benefit of that on a handful of occasions this year already. So I think time will tell, but the goal is that we should be able to operate where the operations cost above the power cost is somewhere between $0.5 to $0.25 a kilowatt hour, take the power cost at about $0.75 to $1.25 and that should be where you could model longer term what the model looks like. Yes. Just to add to that, the Q4, we had a record production, and it's all about the scale, how much of that cost of that production can you squeeze out of that cost associated with that. There's a fixed component of the cost. And if the transaction fee being at a record high this quarter, that certainly helped us as well from a unit cost perspective. Hopefully, that helps answer your question. Next question today is coming from Reginald Smith from JPMorgan. I guess most topics have been covered. But Fred, I wanted to get your opinion. Obviously, a lot of public miners have announced fairly large ATM offerings. I guess competitively, as you look across the landscape to both private companies and public companies, do you have a sense of how much capital is out there, maybe on the private side as well to fund growth. And I'm curious, should we expect or do you expect that the public miners will continue to garner a larger, a larger piece of the network cash rate? And then the final question, the follow-up to that is just what industry CapEx look like on a normalized basis? I know these are all hard questions, but I think you're the best person to line. Okay. I will do my best to answer your question. So I think that, generally speaking, this industry has 3 choke points, 3 constraints. It's access to capital. As you mentioned, it's access to capacity sites to plug miners in and its access to miners. In different cycles, there have been different constraint points. In the prior cycle, access to machines was the constraint point. You had $85 per terahash pricing on machines. And today, we're still sub-20%. So that's obviously not a constraint today. And based on the machine orders you've seen our peers announced and the numbers we just announced, obviously, the manufacturers seem to have plenty of capacity to supply us all. So that's not a constraint.
On the capital side, the public miners that are ASR eligible able to raise money through ATMs have a significant advantage over everybody else. The investment community today is definitely looking for and moving towards a slight of quality, if you will. They're looking for the miners who are able to grow and execute and scale. And the smaller miners are challenged by a couple of things. One is there's a certain fixed cost to operate as a minor, if you would, your SG&A. And if you can scale that over a very large capacity, you can be super-efficient. But if you're a small-scale miner, that's a lot more difficult. The other thing a small-scale miner has the challenge of doing is getting a site, putting deposits down for PPAs and having the capital to buy miners.
The big challenge today is this is a big boy capital game. If you can't raise large amounts of money, you're going to get left behind. And as you know, Bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game. There are only so many Bitcoin available per day. And if you're not -- they're growing your hash rate, you're falling backwards. And the innovation cycles are accelerating. And so if you think about it this way, the S-19 JPro by Bitmain was a machine that started being delivered in late 2020, early 2021, that had an efficiency of about 30 jewels per terahash. The XP started being delivered in early 2022, and that had an energy efficiency of 21 jewels per terahash, almost a 30% decrease in energy use.
And so if you are paying for 1 megawatt of power and you had JPro and you replaced those JPro with XPs, then you essentially increased your hash rate by almost 30% overnight without having to pay any additional power or add any additional capacity. In Marathon's case, we came out of the last cycle buying the latest state-of-the-art machines. The vast majority of our fleet today are XPs or better, and we're now currently deploying S21 and other machines like them that are even more efficient than the XPs. So there's this CapEx cycle you just have to keep up with. And there is, unfortunately, nothing called normalized CapEx here because we're entering the phase where maintenance CapEx starts to catch up with miners. The JPro is on the bubble of being profitable, come to have here in just a few weeks. XPs will still be profitable, again, providing you the right power loss.
And obviously, the S21 and that next generation will be profitable for some time yet to come. But the miners who are operating S-17, S-19 Pros, they are going to be in a position where they may have to shut off a lot of those machines come to having. Now Bitcoin has been behaving extremely well. Some of you may remember, I have spoken a number of times over the past 6 months, where my expectation was that Bitcoin's price was going to be in the 40s as we went into the having. And here we are, and we're at $61,000 today. So this is providing an extra gas of breath, if you would, for miners who have these older generations of machines. And it's giving them an opportunity to raise some money right now. And so you're seeing some capital going into the private markets.
What you don't have this cycle that you did have in prior cycles is nobody is lending on equipment. You can't go call Nidec or Galaxy and say, ""Hey, guess what, I want you to lend me and truck me the money for these miners."" And so the only way to do that is to convince somebody like Bitmain and a hardware vendor to do it for you. And then what you're really doing is just operating a hosting site on their behalf and you're getting paid a little bit extra to do that. And so I think this is the cycle where you start to see consolidation where hash rate moves towards the larger miners. That being said, publicly traded miners market share of global hash rate is declining. Why? Because sovereign nations as well as large, very well-funded private companies are getting into this business buying the latest machines without this maintenance CapEx cycle hanging over them and building a lot of capacity.
You're familiar with the Kingdom of Butuan working with [ Didier ] to add 200 megawatts of capacity. You're seeing miners now in Ethiopia, Chinese miners moving to Ethiopia, doing hundreds of megawatts of power. There is lots of power available if you can find it. And if you have the money to do it, the problem is most of the mom-and-pop miners, any miner who has less than 10 exahash in my mind, will be out of business by the end of the cycle. They just can't raise the money. They don't have the critical mass to do it. And that doesn't mean that they're going to get bought up by ourselves and Riot, CleanSpark and people like that. It just means they're going to go out of business.
And so meanwhile, global hash is going to continue to grow everywhere else. So this is very much, unfortunately, a business where like in the jungle, Gazelle gets up every morning and has to run faster than the line that's chasing it, and the line has to get up every morning and run faster than Gazelle so it can eat and survive. And that's what just happens here. It's this constant drive to grow, grow, grow. And as Bitcoin now starts developing into this asset class, which institutions hold, you're already starting to see this with the ETFs, record and close in to the ETFs. As of last week, total AUM and ETFs was 40% of the total AUM in gold ETF, which is insane. And as money keeps going into those areas, it's big coin that won't cycle back out into the market.
And so if you look at exchanges today, their lowest volume of Bitcoin available on exchanges historically when you normalize for where we are in the cycle. So I think it's going to be very hard for people in this industry to keep up because Bitcoin's price is going to grow and the volatility is going to start to decrease. It's going to start to normalize. And at that point, margin compression will happen in the business. And if you don't have scale, you'll be out of business.
And our goal as being one of the largest miners in the world, is to have the scale, the operational capacity, the optimized cost structure and the revenue streams that are adjacent to and associated with Bitcoin mining, that think of it this way, can subsidize our cost of mind or that because of the revenue streams coming in through heat [ waves ], et cetera, do subsidize the cost of mine, make us the operator who is at the lead of this pack in the bottom quartile cost wise. So we will always be operational. We'll always be able to mine it no matter what the price of Bitcoin, obviously, within recent rate. So hopefully, that answered your question. That was a great answer. It felt like I just had a master class on Bitcoin mining [indiscernible] tuition as something. I appreciate it. Our next question is coming from Kevin Dede from H.C. Wainwright. A little more granular here, Fred. 22 exahash to come out this year and 35% to 37% potentially. Can you give us some insight on how you see adding it to your network? Sure. If you're thinking where are we going to put it? Well, one of the reasons we... I apologize, Fred, you made that clear in your prepared remarks. I'm more concerned about the timing. Just so we have a view to how you see Marathon's hash rate increase through the course of the year. Sure. if we had historically been a de novo site developer, I could give you a whole pipeline with a chart of, okay, these sites will energize on this month, et cetera. That's not been our historical model. Our historical model has been, as you know, Agile grow quickly. And we're now in the business of being more of an owner-operator and vertically integrating. So you can think of sites across 3 buckets. There is the bucket of I'm going to go buy things like Granbury and Kearney, where there's excess capacity with an ability to grow. And as the hosting customers at those sites age out as those contracts age out, we will absorb all that capacity ourselves.
So we're looking -- think of it this way. You have a site with 100 megawatts, maybe 80 megawatts is used, okay, we can plug 20 megawatts of miners. And then over the next 2 years, half of those contracts for the 80 megawatts will age out and we'll start deploying more and more miners there. And oh, by the way, that site could potentially add 100 or 200 megawatts more because of the substation and we'll develop that and add that capacity. So not to give everybody our playbook, you can send me an e-mail, happy to send it to you.
But that's how you look at that bucket. If you look at the next bucket, it's sites that somebody may have permitted, somebody has gotten some form of allocation of power. There's a substation available. They may even have transformers on the ground, but they haven't built a site yet because they don't have money. And this is back to Reggie's question. There are people who have sites locked up that they can't raise the money to develop them because investors aren't willing to give you money in today's market for Bitcoin mining data centers because they prefer to give money to people building AI data centers because there's a lot more money to be made there if you believe people who believe that that's the case.
We happen to believe Bitcoin mining is the place to be, but we'll let the rest of that be option tension. So think of them as halfway done side, it's like in the real estate development world, it's not raw land. You've actually bought the land, got it entitled, you've laid the sewage and utility lines and now you're going out calling to the homebuilders and saying, ""Hey, I've got 16 lots here, you want to build a home. So that's middle bucket. These are sites that could be energized and online in a 6- to 18-month window. Then you have the true greenfield sites where we have folks that are out today scouring opportunities to acquire access to power, access to land, access to transmission interconnects, et cetera, on a global basis, not just in the U.S. And those are 18 to 24, 36-month type projects.
And so we believe that as a global world-class Bitcoin miner, you need to build a stack, if you would, of staggered projects that give you immediate capacity, midterm capacity and long-term capacity. But that all have optionality. So I'll give you an example. Granbury, Texas has about almost 300 megawatts of capacity today. There's an opportunity to expand because the power station has lots of power. So that gives us optionality. We could add more capacity to it if we want to invest the money to it. So you already have a site, you already have a power partner, you already have access to substations, et cetera. It's just a question of when do you want to start developing it and how much money do you want to spend to develop it? And what are you going to use that site for Immersion air [ cover ].
With the longer-term sites, the optionality is it's very inexpensive to tie up an option on long-term power access to a substation, relatively speaking, when you talk on a per megawatt hour basis and lease land. And you can sit there and this is the business that, in the old days, the compute north of the world used to do, which is they would go out and they would tie up a deal with the power company and then go find a miner who would essentially be willing to fund the build-out of the site and then 12, 18 months later, you plug in. The King Mountain site in Texas was done that way. We engaged with compute North back in the day.
They engaged with NextEra Energy, and they got the power, they got to being permits on that, and then they build the site and then we came in. In this case, we're acting as the builder operator of those sites. And so we're working along all 3 of those tranches, if you would, today with partners and directly ourselves. And so our goal is essentially to have -- think of it as a storehouse full of either readily available immediately today, mining capacity, midterm available capacity. There's an option for us. We know that when we need it 12 months out, we just turned the crank and it will be operational, already permitted. We already have all the transmission, et cetera.
And then the longer-term sites where we want to build 100 megawatts to 200 megawatts, 500 megawatts at a location where we may have 700 megawatts of potential capacity if we're willing to do the longer-term investment. And especially internationally, those longer term, that last bucket, there is a lot of available opportunity there, Ethiopia, Paraguay, et cetera, et cetera. So the goal here is to build a really resilient business is you build a huge pipeline and lock up potential capacity of sites with optionality to it. And by the way, I'll mention one thing, the Granbury site, for example, the way the PPA works there is it's not like we have to take all the power. We can actually, in the event of really bad pricing in the marketplace, scale it back. So we have ultimate optionality there, which is the best thing.
So you look for creating a portfolio of capacity that is short, medium and long term. You look to have a portfolio and access to technology, which is short, medium and long term, and I'll touch on that bucket right now. Short term is Bitmain [ chip me ] S21. Medium term is MicroBT, Bitmain, Canaan, I want to access to your chips. I'm going to lock up a supply chips. You're going to sit on them for me, and then I'm going to tell you when I want you to build the miners.
This is a very different model. This is the model from the PC industry and the technology industry and no small player can do this. You have to be able to write a $50 million, $100 million check to one of these people and say, ""I want so many wafers of your chips."" And then when I tell you too, I want you to turn it in the miners. And in that way, I can lock up capacity, and I have no worry about getting access to chips. And the last one is what we've done with Auradine, where we actually own a part of the company who's designing the chips. Why is that important? Because we can get miners that have spec specifically suited to our needs and use cases. And when you see the 2-phase immersion technology that we'll be releasing later this year, you will see the benefit of that, where any other traditional miner, whether it's Riot or CleanSpark, if they don't know how to build technology products, they are going to be buying off-the-shelf PCs when we're busy building custom build high-performance systems. And that's the differentiator longer term that we believe is the biggest moat with these guys. I'm very much looking forward to seeing Auradine's product in action. So thank you for that color. Can we peel the onion back just a little bit more though, Fred, based on the numbers that you offered this afternoon, 22 exahash, you're 24 now. Does that mean you're at 27 by the end of March? Or if you're going to for 35, does it mean you're at 40 by the end of June. How should we think about how that capacity actually comes online through the year? So we're already at 27. We were at 27% at the end of the year pretty much. So I think the way you have to look at it, Kevin, is I'm not going to lay it up for you. because we are going to play the game here where in 2022, we said we're going to deploy the cash rate. We had these machines. And then I was getting the question, ""Hey, are they plugged in yet? Are they plugged in yet? Are they plugged in yet?"" So we are just going to talk about stuff when it goes live going forward. So we're giving you an idea as to what our pipeline of equipment is. Unfortunately, I can't help you model the when because you're going to see it will come in very interesting lumps, not smoothly. But when it comes, it's going to come a combination of at a rush and then in box. So I wish I could say more about it. Our next question is coming from Lucas Pipes from B. Riley Securities. Fred, my question is around the capital budget for 2024. What is it? And would you be able to break it down between miners and infrastructure? Let Salman answer that question. Yes. Lucas, I think we talked about it last time as well. This is what we're looking at from a from a total capital perspective, with the targeted growth that Fred talked about earlier today, we're somewhere around north of $200 million, so somewhere between $200 million to $245 million, somewhere in that range. And that includes our minor purchases and approximately $180 million or so. Just a quick reminder, we have been buying and paying some of these miners so some of those payments may have already happened. I'm just talking about the accounting capital here. In terms of the rest of the stuff, we have other technology businesses and other ancillary businesses that Fred talked about, a small portion of that will be allocated to that. And then on top of that, we also purchased generic assets in Kearney and Nebraska and also Granbury in Texas. And that will be added to the capital, which is some cost at this stage, but that was about approximately $180 million. And that, of course, is separate and on top of the other numbers you mentioned. Yes. And I heard it right. It's $200 million to $45 million for 2024 and about $180 million of that is for miners. That is correct. Our next question is coming from Brian Dobson from Chardan Capital Markets. So you mentioned as we head into the having, it's very likely for smaller miners to be pushed out of business. Do you have a view on the potential magnitude of the decline we could see in global hash? And could that decline potentially be offset by some of the other players you mentioned, like nation states or large private entities? Great question. So one way to look at this is look at the nonanalysis work that a number of people have done that's been published readily available, where you essentially can see the amount of hash rate coming from what category of machine and in some cases, locations and even energy pricing data if you have the ability to do that analysis. So the industry average efficiency today is somewhere around 30 jewels per terahash. 30, 33 varies depending on how many machines are on in a given time when you look at the numbers.
So at 33 jewels per terahash and Bitcoin at 55,000 post having, you'll likely see anywhere from 11% to 18% of the hash rate come off. Now it may not come off all at once. Some people may have a few million dollars in the bank, and they're willing to say, you know what, ""I'm not going to shut off because I'm going to let the other sucker shut off I get the benefit of the hash rate dropping and now I'm profitable again. And so I'm willing to take a loss for a month or 2 or 3 or 4 maybe."" So I would say, if you have to look at the window having and then the first 6 months post having. That's when you're going to see the people who are hanging on for dear life are going to hang on as long as they can.
Other people are going to say, ""No, I'm not. I'm going to shut down and wait for better days wait a bit corn price to go up or not."" What you are not going to see based on the announcements of ourselves and our peers is the rest of the world slowdown. And so you may very well have a world where by the end of this year, global hash rate is 20% to 30% higher than it is today. You may have a world work the exact same than it is today. What I will tell you is that, obviously, it's very dependent on the price of Bitcoin. And the fact that -- I'll go back to the thing about the ETFs.
With the ETFs sucking up Bitcoin and realize nobody can print Bitcoin. People talk about supply shocker they're having, you go from 900 Bitcoin to 450 a day. So it's every mine 450 Bitcoin a day is I'm going to do anything to the supply in the marketplace. What is doing it, what is creating a problem is the ETFs as they continue to vacuum up Bitcoin. And I don't really see it abating. It may not grow, but I don't see it debating based on the conversations I'm having with institutional investors, certainly, is that the available supply of Bitcoin in the market is going to start drawing up. It already is. It's at record lows on exchanges. What that does is causes huge volatility swings in price. That's where somebody at night when ETFs aren't buying can short Bitcoin drop the price down because there's no real demand.
And then in the morning when demand comes up, the price comes back up, and there are already traders doing this. You may have seen a couple of days last week or the week before, where Quatfunds went in and 10x the volume that a couple of ETFs were doing as a test for this exact strategy. I'm going to go short Bitcoin, the spot Bitcoin outside of the ETF markets drop the price, buy it up and let the ETFs come back, drive it right back up and sell it again. So you were going to see a market that is going to be having a lot of gyrations in it. And when that happens, some miners will say, ""Oh my god, Bitcoin price dropped I'm going to shut down. Oh my God, Bitcoin prices going back up, I'm going to turn on."" And you're going to see hash rate bouncing up and down. And it's going to make for a crazy role.
So I think some miners are going to become sporadic miners if they have the right type of energy pricing contracts. Miners that have PPAs, whether it's take or pay, they have to buy all 50 megawatts of the energy they're contracted to, especially hosted miners. And let me take a minute and say that the third-party hosting business is dead. Nobody who's hosting S19 JPros and paying $0.065, $0.07, $0.08, can be in business anymore opposed to having unless Bitcoin just goes on a real tear because they just won't be able to afford to do it because they're not getting the economic benefit of curtailment, they can't subsidize their mining cost through other means.
And so it's the third-party hosting business, the retail hosters other than people who want to host because they do it for vanity purposes. I really don't see that business. And I get calls very frequently now from people or hosting miners and locations saying, ""Hey, do you want to buy my hosting contract? Do you want to buy the miners, I have plugged in here and just take them over for me. And so I foresee that business dying. And so that will be a certain portion of hash rate that temporarily will come off. But by the same token, there's somebody like me saying, ""You know what, I'm calling every third-party hosting guys saying, 'Hey, listen, do you want to -- if you have an empty shelf, I may be interested in buying the shelf from you. I'm not going to pay you hosting for you, but I'll buy the shelf from you. I made by you if you're interested in it.'"" And so this is where I think you're going to see the consolidation. And this is where balance sheet makes is so important and just availability of cash. And so anyway, we go on for a long time on this. Yes. No, I think as just a quick follow-up to that. So is that where you see, call it, the lion's share of appealing M&A post having in that third-party hosting segment? To some extent, again, who can afford to do it. I don't see Riot, CleanSpark ourselves. Yes, but Core was probably not. Core's business model is predicated on a $0.07 cash price. We'll be at $0.04 to having. So I think miners with a lot of debt, miners with balance sheets that are wonky, can't raise capital. aren't going to be able to do much. And in the case of Core, they have a big brother whose name is Bitmain who's able to plug miners in can do a rev share deal that way. But that's not a way to service $700 million of debt. So the large-scale hosters or others in Riot and Core are disappearing and converting to self-lighting and the small-scale hosters, they can't afford to buy their own miners. So I don't know what they're going to do. And if they don't have good power prices, nobody is going to want to buy them. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Charlie for any further or closing comments. Thanks, Kevin. Thank you all for your time today.

Welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Robert Samuels, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Marathon Digital Holdings' first quarter 2024 earnings call. Thank you for joining us for our call today. With me on today's call are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Thiel; and our Chief Financial Officer, Salman Khan.Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements, and that we may make additional forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer session. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. When used in this call, the words anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project and similar expressions as they relate to Marathon Digital Holdings are as such a forward-looking statement. Please refer to our earnings release for a full recitation of our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Marathon at this time. Some of these risks and uncertainties are more fully described in Marathon's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be viewed at www.sec.gov, and ir.mara.com.Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, including adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP total margin. Marathon believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of its operating performance because they exclude certain items that are unrelated to and may not be indicative of its GAAP financial results. Please refer to our company's periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and to our website for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.As usual, we'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Salman. After their comments, we will be going through some of the more popular questions from investors before transferring to a live Q&A with our covering analysts.And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Rob. The first quarter of 2024 was one of our most transformative to date. We officially transitioned Marathon from being an asset-light Bitcoin miner and laid a solid foundation on which we are building this organization into a globally diversified company that leverages digital asset compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future.During the quarter, we significantly grew and improved the resilience of our portfolio of digital asset compute by acquiring and integrating our first fully owned and operated Bitcoin mining sites. At the end of last year, our portfolio consisted of 584 megawatts of capacity, only 3% of which we directly owned and operated. In less than 4 months, we initiated, negotiated, closed and integrated our first 2 acquisitions comprised of 3 sites. The first 2 being the sites in Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Nebraska, and the second being the site in Garden City, Texas, that is adjacent to a wind farm. We purchased these assets for approximately $458,000 and $437,000 per megawatt, respectively, which is approximately half the cost of what some of our competitors have paid to build new sites.In Q1, we effectively doubled the size of our portfolio to 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, and we gained far more direct influence over our operations by taking direct ownership and operational control of 54% of the portfolio. We did this while generating significant savings for our shareholders relative to building sites the way our competitors have, and we quickly gained enough capacity to meet our near-term growth targets of 50 exahash by the end of this year. As we cost-effectively laid this path to accelerate our scale and enhance our operational influence, we also launched our first products and services as an organization, each of which demonstrates our commitment to expanding and diversifying revenues by creating advanced technologies that transform digital infrastructure and diversify our revenue streams.In February, we launched Slipstream, which is a direct Bitcoin transaction submission service that is designed to streamline confirmations of large or non-standard Bitcoin transactions. In essence, it provides sophisticated users with a simple, transparent, and trusted means of adding complex Bitcoin transactions to the blockchain, provided they adhere to Bitcoin's protocol and it provides Marathon with an opportunity to increase revenue by capturing more transaction fees, which is particularly advantageous in a post-halving environment. Although the service is only a few months old, it has already proven valuable. Last month, just before the halving, we earned an additional 4.25 Bitcoin from Slipstream alone. MARA Pool, which powers Slipstream, captured 1 block with 10 Bitcoin in transaction fees and another with 16, generating nearly 10% greater fees than FPPS pools at the time. While these numbers are small relative to our overall production, Slipstream serves as a tangible example of the strategic importance of operating our own mining pool of being at scale and of deploying our proprietary technology stack. As a matter of fact, if you were to look at the mempool.space for the past week and look at mining pools, you would see that Marathon's pool performed 40% above average.As we demonstrated in March, Slipstream was just the beginning. During the first quarter, we also brought our first products to market, all of which contribute to 1 of our key competitive advantages, our vertically integrated tech stack, and provide us with an opportunity to diversify our revenue streams. These products include our industry-leading MARA firmware, controller board and 2-phase immersion technology which we call 2PIC. We showcased each of these products at the Empower Conference in March, and the reception was overwhelmingly positive. We already have paying customers for our firmware and 2PIC has a pipeline that is in the tens of millions of dollars and growing. We're currently integrating 2PIC at some of our own sites, which is part of our strategy to optimize our performance by increasing uptime, improving efficiency and reducing maintenance downtime and cost. For the market, our goal is to begin shipping these systems in volume to third parties by the end of this year.While the quarter was highlighted by the significant expansion of our portfolio of digital assets compute and the launch of our first products and services geared towards transforming digital infrastructure, our Bitcoin production was negatively impacted throughout the first quarter by unexpected equipment failures, predominantly transformers at our third-party hosted sites. Utility company transmission line maintenance and the higher-than-anticipated weather-related curtailments across multiple sites. However, I'm pleased to say that we have mitigated a number of these issues and are currently operating at a record high level of 27 exahash. While there will always be the potential for exogenous events that impact operations, we believe we can mitigate their impact over time as we continue to scale, standardize equipment, diversify globally and build redundancies and leverage economies of scale that stem from owning and operating multiple sites around the world. In the meantime, we can always control how we respond to challenges, and just as we always have, our team quickly began working on solutions that were within our control.We were able to immediately take advantage of the newly available capacity from our recent strategic acquisitions. Once it became clear that the transformer issues at Ellendale were more complicated than originally believed, our team quickly began reallocating miners from this site to Garden City, where there was available capacity. We successfully moved 9,500 idle miners from Ellendale and simultaneously began energizing new machines to expand our capacity. Our ability to adapt combined with the uptime improving across our sites, these challenges were resolved, enabled us to achieve an all-time high operating hash rate of 27 exahashes this month.The transformer issues that negatively impacted our ability to convert megawatts into terahash, and therefore, Bitcoin have been challenging, but with our hash rate continuing to grow to record levels, we have clearly been able to work through the challenges and to execute. Unfortunately, the resilience we've built into our diversified portfolio, our ability to adapt to change and changing circumstances and our HODL strategy allowed us to still capitalize on Bitcoin's positive momentum. Despite the operational challenges, we still produced record financial results during the first quarter.To unpack our financial results, I'm now going to turn the call over to Salman, who will cover the results in more detail. Salman? Thank you, Fred, and welcome, Rob, to team MARA. As Fred mentioned, our Bitcoin production was negatively impacted in the first quarter by transformer and other issues. Despite these challenges, the positive momentum in Bitcoin price, our strategy to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time and our team's consistent ability to execute help us drive record financial results for the quarter.Let's dig into the details. We reported net income of $337 million, or $1.26 per diluted share in the quarter. This was a 184% increase from net income of $119 million or $0.72 per diluted share in Q1 of last year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by favorable Bitcoin price, higher production, and fair market value of digital assets on our balance sheet.Revenues increased 223% to a record $165 million from $51 million in the first quarter of 2023. With the average price of Bitcoin mine being 126% higher this quarter than the year ago period, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by a $77 million increase in the average price of Bitcoin mined. We produced an average of 30.9 Bitcoin each day during the quarter compared to 24.4 Bitcoin each day in the prior year period. These improvements in production also contributed approximately $10 million to our top line. As a result of closing the recent acquisitions, we are temporarily providing hosting services to existing hosted customers during the transition period. The revenue we generated from hosting revenues was $21 million, which was not present a year ago. We expect this revenue to taper off in the coming quarters as we work with current tenants off the sites on their transition plans and use that space for our own growth.Our hosting and energy costs were $71 million compared to $33 million last year. In both time periods, the increase was primarily due to growth in our mining fleet and related costs.In the first quarter of 2024, global hash rate or network difficulty levels continued to increase. Average global hash rate has increased by more than approximately 86% since Q1 of 2023. That combined with operational issues at our third-party hosted sites in Q1 of 2024 resulted in a higher cost per coin.Our non-GAAP cost of revenue without depreciation has improved 16% from 53.7 per petahash per day in Q1 of 2023 to 45.2 per petahash per day in Q1 of 2024. As we realize synergies from our recently announced acquisitions, reenergized production at our third-party hosted sites, and spread the fixed costs over larger 50 exahash capacity, we expect our marginal cost per coin to improve. Total cost of revenues, which includes depreciation and amortization was $168 million compared to $151 million [Technical Difficulty] of last year. Depreciation and amortization was $78 million, a $60 million increase from the same quarter in the prior year. The change was predominantly the result of growing our energized hash rate from 11.5 exahash to 27.8 exahash and recent acquisition of 2 sites in Texas and Nebraska. Our non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization was $75 million this quarter compared to $18 million in the same quarter last year. The change was predominantly related to higher Bitcoin prices, increased production and increased operational efficiency.General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $21 million compared with $11 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenses was primarily due to the increasing scale of the business. Headcount grew from 30 employees at the end of Q1 last year to 60 employees at the end of Q1 this year, which subsequently has increased to over 100 employees. As we thoughtfully grow our company, we continue to opportunistically add talent across the organization.Part of our treasury management strategy involved selling enough of the Bitcoin we produce to cover operating expenses and then HODL-ing the remainder on our balance sheet. By employing this strategy, we have essentially been dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin at a discount for the past several years. With our cost to produce a coin significantly lower than the Bitcoin price, the dollar average strategy generally has been even more accretive for our stockholders. With the new accounting rules that require the measurement of crypto assets at fair value and with the Bitcoins price appreciating nearly 150% from the end of Q1 last year to the end of Q1 this year, this strategy has proven very effective for us.In Q1 of this year, we increased our Bitcoin holdings 15% from 15,126 to 17,320 Bitcoins. Because of the significant amount of Bitcoin we hold on our balance sheet, we recognized a gain on digital assets of $489 million during the first quarter of 2024. Primarily due to this favorable value adjustment, our adjusted EBITDA increased 266% to $529 million from $145 million in the prior year period. A reminder that the fair value accounting reflects the changes in market value of Bitcoin that we hold on our balance sheet. In the current environment of Bitcoin price appreciation in recent quarters, we have continued to recognize gains through our income statement, reflecting the impact HODL strategy has had on our financial statements. For example, every 10,000 change in Bitcoin price period-over-period can impact our adjusted EBITDA by approximately $170 million to $200 million.Digging more into our Bitcoin holdings and cash position, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $324 million, up from $125 million a year ago. Also, at March 31, we held approximately 17,320 Bitcoin with a fair value of $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. Combined, our balance of cash and Bitcoin was approximately $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. We sold 730 Bitcoin during Q1, realizing cash proceeds of $45 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. During the quarter, we raised $489 million from at-the-market equity sales, which we primarily intended to use for miners, acquisition of infrastructure and for other general corporate purposes.We expect our future Bitcoin holdings will generally increase, but will fluctuate depending on operating and market conditions. We intend to add to our Bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities, and we will also continue to sell Bitcoin as a means of generating cash to fund monthly operating costs and general corporate purposes.As Fred mentioned, we have systematically deployed capital for accretive growth and strategic investments, which our teams have been able to integrate successfully in Q1 of this year. These acquisitions have, not only been almost half the construction cost, but also have allowed us flexibility to move our miners from asset-light sites with operational issues as discussed above. If we were to construct such sites on our own, it would have taken us more than a year to energize and likely cost twice the amount on a per megawatt basis, making these acquisitions highly accretive for our stockholders. The acquisition of sites in Granbury, Texas and Kearney, Nebraska have been accounted for as a business combination for FASB rules. And we have recognized the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on our balance sheet. As a result, we also recognized goodwill of $30.9 million and intangible assets of $22 million, primarily related to customer relationships. We also accrued early termination expenses of $22 million as we terminated certain hosted customers subsequently.One other -- another item worth highlighting is that, Marathon was added to S&P Small Cap 600 Index. Just a reminder, the S&P Small Cap 600 tracks 600 U.S. companies with a market cap between $1 billion and $6.7 billion that have positive earnings over the most recent quarter and 4 quarters combined. We are proud to be the first Bitcoin miner added to the S&P Small Cap Index. This inclusion is a testament to the consistently improving financial performance of our organization as we have scaled and implemented effective strategies to capitalize on market conditions.And that completes my update. I'll now turn it back over to Fred, who will talk more about our future plans. Fred? Thanks, Salman. Over the past year, we've evolved from outsourcing our operations to third-party hosting providers to owning and operating sites, developing and marketing technology products, and using waste and stranded power to generate energy and recycle heat. During Q1, we laid the foundation for Marathon to become a globally diversified company that leverages digital asset compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. And as we transition into the second quarter, we are reorganizing the internal structure of the business to better align with our growth opportunities, sharpen our strategic focus, bolster accountability and maintain our speed and agility as we scale.Starting in the second quarter, Marathon will be restructured into a matrix organization consisting of 3 business units, utility scale mining, technological innovations, and energy harvesting and supporting organizations such as Marcom, Finance, et cetera. In my opening remarks, I spoke at length about the first 2 of these verticals. Utility scale mining is our large scale global digital asset mining operations. This vertical is what Marathon is primarily known for today, large-scale digital asset compute that's geared towards enhancing grid stability and the security of the world's preeminent blockchain ledger. Our technology division is focused on creating advanced technologies that transform digital infrastructure. This group has already launched its first series of products, and going forward, its mission will be to deliver innovative hardware, software and services that maximize energy efficiency, improve performance and unlock new opportunities for those who operate at the edge and for those who are building the foundation of the digital future.In March, at the Empower Conference, we demonstrated how the combination of MARA firmware and 2PIC immersion enabled us to operate state-of-the-art digital asset miners at significantly higher performance levels with near-minimal impact to energy efficiency. Using this solution enables digital asset miners to significantly increase the productivity of their digital mining assets, earn a higher return on the compute investment dollars and reduce the total cost of operating sites.Our third vertical, which I did not discuss in my opening remarks is energy harvesting. The mission of energy harvesting is to support the energy transformation by converting environmentally harmful waste energy, stranded clean energy or otherwise underutilized sources of energy into economic value. For now, it's perhaps easiest to think of this as the next evolution of Bitcoin mining, involving leveraging digital asset compute to convert waste into energy, sequester methane, and generate and reuse heat for industrial and commercial purposes. This last part is quite important, as nearly 50% of total energy use is used for heat and a portion of that is low-grade heat, i.e., sub-50 degrees Celsius that can be provided by heat harvested from our digital asset compute systems. This includes applications such as pre-heating materials in industrial processes, heating buildings and water for communities and food production applications such as greenhouses and shrimp farms. We created these business units in response to the opportunities we saw in the market and how we believe this industry will evolve.As you all know, the industry just underwent a halving event, during which the block reward was reduced by 50%. As block rewards will continue to reduce by 50% every 4 years, it is critical to find new ways to leverage expertise and create value for others in order to maintain a position as a leader in the industry. And we believe that we can do so successfully and we can, not only mitigate the impact of halving events, but also excel. While utility scale mining is by far the most significant portion of our business today, we believe each of these businesses will contribute meaningfully to our organization over the coming years. Long term, our goal is for 50% of our revenues to come from non-utility scale mining. It will take time to reach that scale, but these new businesses are already showing progress. We already have a pipeline valued at tens of millions of dollars for our technology products. Our pilot project in Utah, where we're capturing methane from landfill to power Bitcoin miners is our first energy harvesting project, and we expect to launch several others in the coming quarters.The demand for these verticals isn't just domestic, it's global, and we're chasing after it. In April, we announced that we appointed a new Managing Director to lead our expansion in Europe, Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. Since his appointment, our team has generated promising opportunities across the region from Finland in the north to Kenya in the south. While Marathon is already operating on 3 continents, our plan is to continue scaling our international business over coming years such that approximately 50% of our revenues come from overseas by 2028.In the more immediate term, we're doubling down on our utility scale mining business. We originally targeted to grow our operations to 35 or 37 exahash by the end of 2024 and 50 exahash by the end of '25. However, with the expansion capacity gain from our recent acquisitions and the 45 exahash of additional compute available to us between current orders and options, we're now targeting 50 exahash by the end of this year. We already have 12 exahash of new miners arriving in early Q3 to take advantage of our acquired and expanded capacity with more coming to fill waiting capacity over the balance of this year. This represents a doubling of our compute capacity and further increases our energy efficiency in under 1 year and will strongly extend our position as the leader in our industry. While we will always be raising capital to continue growing our business, we currently have ample liquidity to fully fund the balance of our 50 exahash growth target this year.Q1 was a transformative quarter for Marathon, during which we battled against operational challenges to produce record financial results. We launched and began building the pipeline of our first product and we doubled the size of our portfolio of digital asset compute. With 11 sites diversified across 3 continents and the road to 50 exahash clear ahead of us, we look forward to evolving into and excelling as a globally diversified company that leverages digital asset compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future for all.And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob for Q&A. Rob? [Operator Instructions] We'll start by answering some of the most popular questions submitted by investors through our Q&A platform.So our first question comes from [ Alexander Ren ], who asks, post halving, in what ways does MARA in a better position to stay profitable and grow compared to other mining companies?Fred, do you want to take that one? Sure. So a number of things. By acquiring sites and vertically integrating, we lower our cost structure. So essentially taking out the middleman who was the third-party hosting operator and taking out their margin, which, in some cases, can lower our cost by as much as 20%. Additionally, the diversification of our revenue streams, technologies such as Slipstream, which enhance our ability to earn transaction fees over and above what normal FPPS pools earn, provide us with abilities to, in a lower Bitcoin block subsidy world such as post-halving generate, generally, greater revenues on a per block basis. So we believe we're very well positioned with our diversified revenue streams that we'll be developing over the coming years to be positioned to take advantage of whatever the market brings to us in the near- and long-term. Our next question, and we have a couple of questions related to M&A, but [ Parminder S ] asks, is MARA looking for a merger or planning to buy out other miners in the short-term?Fred, do you want to take that one as well? Well, we've already shown that we're acquiring hosting companies and the sites for capacity. Now, to date, these have been mostly sites where we have miners installed currently. So it's a very easy integration. The challenge with integrating and acquiring miners that have their own fleets of miners is the age of miners that they have in their fleets. Most companies today are still transitioning to the latest state-of-the-art S21 class of machines and may be running S19j Pros or even XPs. The challenge is, if we were to acquire a miner today and attribute any value to their fleet of existing machines, especially if their machines were S19j Pro or older, that wouldn't be a very smart idea.So essentially, as we acquire miners, you'll tend to find that pricing will be very focused on the infrastructure value as opposed to the miners that are installed, unless, of course, they have state-of-the-art miners installed, at which point you can value them at their replacement cost. But I think typically, most publicly traded miners have valuations which exceed essentially the cost to rebuild that infrastructure, and it comes down to a question of time to revenues. And what is it worth for you to acquire a miner that has capacity running and miners installed versus building it yourself and how much extra do you want to pay for that time to market. Our next question comes from [ Roshan U ], who asks, what's the status of your open ATM? And do you think this is the reason that MARA has not been tracking the price of Bitcoin?Salman, I think this one is for you. [ Roshan ], in Q1, there was a general rotation out of miners into the recently launched ETFs. We believe the top performing miners will see price appreciation as the investors see the results. Similar to other industries like oil and gold, ETFs have their own position in the value chain, while oil and gold companies create value for their stockholders and generally track the commodity price with premium on top of the commodity price.In terms of the ATM, as of March 31, 2024, we had not accessed the new ATM. And subsequently, we raised about $200 million. As a reminder, the ATM gives us low cost of capital to invest in accretive acquisitions or grow the company as we continue to use Bitcoin to fund our operating costs and G&A. I think the next one is for you as well. [ Orlando C ] asks, what's your current breakeven for Bitcoin?You want to take that one? Great question, Orlando. There seems to be a lot of diversity in the industry in terms of how the companies report their costs and where is it parked and all that stuff. So it's a difficult question to answer in terms of apples-to-apples comparison. So with that in mind, typically, you could look at multiple ways. One is, marginal cost of revenue without depreciation, which is cost of revenue minus depreciation non-cash items. And that's one way of doing it. The other way of doing it is to look at cost per hash, which we believe is a better representation in this industry. So cost per petahash, as we talked about previously in our prepared remarks, we have improved about 16%. And as we fully integrate these recently announced acquisitions, as Fred had mentioned, some of those acquisitions can be -- can save up to 20% on our costs. All these costs will continue to show up in the future quarters as these synergies kick in and we integrate these acquisitions completely.As a reminder, our mining fleet remains the industry's one of the most efficient, which will even get better and more efficient as we progress with time and we hit the 50 exahash towards the end of the year. And that larger scale of exahash, it will allow us to spread the fixed cost across the larger pool, which, on a unit basis, will make us even more efficient.Moreover, just a quick reminder, our G&A per hash or coin remains one of the lowest in the sector, and that shows how efficiently the company has operated historically. Our next question comes from [ Tarik P ], who asks, what are your plans for increasing efficiency and reducing the recent downtime at several bitcoin mining facilities? Fred? Yes, great question, [ Tarik ]. So if you think about what happened in Q1, as I mentioned in my prior remarks, we had transformer issues at third-party hosted sites and we had a utility line maintenance that was done that shut down one of our sites for a short period of time, and then we had weather events. All of these are exogenous factors.If you think about when you own and operate sites, you look to do things like standardize equipment across sites so you have standard operating procedures, you also have spare parts for everything you're doing. One of the challenges with the Ellendale site were transformer issues, where some of the transformers that were installed could not operate at their stated spec. And so, as those transformers started to fail, they had to be replaced and/or modified. And had we built that site, we most probably would not have used Chinese transformers but rather transformers of higher quality that would operate within spec. So again, over time, as more and more of the sites that we operate at come under our own control, I think we'll see uptime continue to tick up and we'll see performance improve.When you think about just operating efficiencies, again, stripping out the third-party hosting provider dramatically impacts your cost because you're stripping out some of these built-in margins. And we also begin deploying our immersion technology. The 2PIC immersion technology does a number of things. For one thing, it increases the -- essentially, the lifespan of miners because these miners that traditionally would be air cooled in many sites essentially have to be serviced every 30 days, they have to be cleaned, filters have to be changed, fans have to be replaced, and the mechanical load at the sites is higher. Using 2-phase immersion, you don't have a lot of those issues. We have immersion systems that have run for months without having to be serviced at all. And so, that reduces the overhead at the site, which reduces your operating cost, makes you more efficient, increases uptime.And the other advantage with 2PIC immersion is that, you become fairly immune from heat waves because, at the end of the day, the liquid in this tank is boiling, which means that it's likely to be hotter in the tank than the ambient temperature would be. So that makes heat much less of an issue, especially in places like Texas and in the UAE, for example. And if you look at our site in UAE, that site operates with 99.8% uptime. And this is in an environment where the ambient temperature is over 100 degrees and humidity is well into the 90% range. So I think that's a great example of how our sites operate more efficiently and more effectively when they're under our control. In the interest of time, I think we'll have to wrap up this section of the Q&A. And again, we really appreciate the questions and interest.I'm now going to turn the call back to our operator to open the line to questions from our covering analysts. Alicia, back to you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Fred, my first question is on the pool performance you mentioned. I think you said 44% better. To what extent was this chance versus you being able to pick off kind of above average rewards? Yes. So over the past week period, which that number comes from, it's about 40-point-something percent, not 44%. But there were certain transactions that had very high fees. And at the end of the day, you have to win the block to get paid the transactions. But what Slipstream enables us to do is essentially generate additional fees on top of the standard fees that the pool otherwise would earn. And so, even if you look over longer periods of time, whether it's October through May, October of last year through May, MARA Pool has performed amongst the top pools from an average fee structure. A way to look at it is, if you were to optimally fill a block with the highest value transactions, that would be an index of 0. And then how does a pool perform against that with blocks? And most of the FPPS pools operate at a minus 1% to 2%, sometimes 3% below the optimum, where MARA Pool together with Slipstream has been performing above that. And for the period really for the early part of this year-to-date, it's been almost 6%, 7% and sometimes higher than FPPS pools that it competes against.So this is an advantage that, over time, may decline as more people start trying to leverage the types of technologies that built into our pool. But this is the whole reason why having a vertically integrated tech stack is so important. It allows us to do things that you can't when you're just buying best-of-breed technologies and putting it together. An analogy some people use when describing what we're doing is it's kind of the difference between the PC industry and the Apple ecosystem. Apple is all vertically integrated from their own chips, through their own software, their own cloud services, et cetera. Whereas the rest of the industry uses microprocessors from 1 vendor, operating system from another vendor, graphics, et cetera, from other vendors. So we believe a very tightly integrated tech stack allows you to operate large-scale digital asset compute in a much more efficient and optimized manner than just buying third-party services and leveraging third-party pools. I appreciate that, Fred. And from a modeling perspective, would it be too early to guide on an additional revenue on that? Or would you... Yes. I think you could definitely work with Rob to look at the data. And you can actually just see this in mempool.space. You can just run reports for different periods of time and you can see how our pool fees have averaged compared to others. But I think that over time, 2%, 3% would be a conservative estimate to use for modeling purposes. And then there will be times where it's higher and there may be times where we operate at the same as FPPS pools, but 2%, 3% on average should be fine, which over time becomes quite a large number. Fred, and turning quickly to M&A, I know this has come up before, but where are you spending your energies right now? And are there kind of more opportunities like the ones you've executed on recently in front of you? I would appreciate your thoughts on that. Sure. So with the acquisitions we've already done, we have capacity to get to our 50 exahash goal by the end of this year. And we obviously have the miners inbound to fill that available capacity. So as we look at acquisitions, going forward, we believe that, as I've said before, there's a mix of kind of third-party hosting sites that may be attractive. There's a mix potentially of sites where somebody has tied-up power, but hasn't fully built out the infrastructure. And then there are true greenfield where you're out talking to energy companies, solar project developers, wind project developers and trying to negotiate power deals and then having to build infrastructure from the ground up. So we're looking across all 3 of those buckets pretty equally. We believe that this period post-halving now is going to be quite rich when it comes to M&A opportunities.And we believe that there will be some great opportunities to acquire more capacity. We don't think that there will be a shortage of compute. We look at pricing in the marketplace and what we're seeing is more efficient rigs coming to market at essentially the same prices as they are now. And we don't see an additional buying wave now post-halving of compute. So we think that, that market will likely remain fairly stable with relatively easy access to be able to buy more rigs. And we continue to think that capacity, in other words, sites are kind of the shortage and there's a lead time if you're going to build sites also. So we think that as we look towards 2025 expansion because, obviously, we're not going to stop at 50 exahash and we look at '26, '27 and towards the halving in '28, we think that companies like Marathon, where you have very large scale, utility scale mining, if you would, combined with energy harvesting and technology sales provides you with a really robust and resilient business where you can weather ups and downs and then also get the leverage of being able to continually operate a little bit better than everybody else. That's the goal, be the most efficient, most optimized operator out there. This is helpful. I want to turn it over. Fred, to you and the team, best of luck. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Flynn with Compass Point Research. I had a question regarding the Generate Capital acquisitions. I was wondering how many megawatts of capacities were currently hosted by legacy customers. And if you could provide more color on, ultimately, the timelines of freeing up that capacity and transitioning it to self-mining, that would be helpful. Yes. So about 390 megawatts of total capacity of which we already had somewhere around 180-ish megawatts that we were using. There is about 75 or 80 megawatts, which will be vacated by the end of June, and then the balance, we think shortly thereafter. So we think we'll have 100% utilization of that site for our miners in Q3. Great. And then a follow-up on kind of the power costs. The hash costs look to be impacted just due to the uptime. But just going forward, how should we think about maybe just power costs from a cost per kilowatt hour basis? And ultimately, how owning your own infrastructure can layer in to lower those costs and how much improvement can we see in kind of the second half as you install more efficient machines? Sure. So if you look at the sites in Texas where we can take advantage of a variety of programs to monetize energy, when we were using sites that were operated by a third-party, we didn't get the benefit of economic curtailment in power trading, which is something we now have the benefit of. And we have actually reaped some very material gains already in the first quarter from some of that activity. But that's very opportunistic. It depends on temperature spikes, things that happen in the market that allow you to really benefit from that.The big challenge -- the big difference rather with owning sites versus using third-party sites as you strip out this kind of upwards of $0.02 a kilowatt hour that the hosting provider was charging you, which was their way of covering their infrastructure costs, their operating costs, et cetera. We believe we can operate sites that we own for somewhere between $0.05 and $0.01 per kilowatt hour. It kind of depends on the where and what type of technology. The more immersion technology we have, the lower the cost to operate the site as an example.When it comes to power prices, there's some wide ranges from PTAs that are in the sub $0.03 range to things that run upwards of $0.04. So somewhere in that range across the different sites. But the key savings from the shift from asset-light to owned and operated is stripping out that margin of the third-party hosted provider. So you can imagine $0.01 to $0.015 a kilowatt hour reduction in your cost to mine is pretty significant. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Could you, Fred, maybe peel the onion back a little bit on power? I know you moved some rigs from Ellendale. Could you give us your thinking on when you might be able to move rigs back? And how you plan on building or filling out? I think you have available capacity at the old Generate Capital sites. Just give us some feeling for where you're going with power and how you'll be able to support 50 exahash this year? So let me see if I understood your question properly. So from a capacity perspective, we'll be filling out a lot of the existing capacity over Q3 and a little bit into Q4 as well. As I said earlier to somebody's prior question, we should be seeing most of the hosted customers vacated, majority of the capacity really by end of this quarter and leading into a little bit into Q3. And we halve a whole slew of miners coming in to plug in that are all state-of-the-art S21 class machines.Within the case of Ellendale, power has -- we've been able to bring the site back up partially. Right now it's operating at about 60%, 65% of its max capacity, and each week, a little bit more comes online as transformer fixes are made by Applied on that site. And so far, we've been ahead of schedule there. So we -- miners ready to go to plug in there. We moved 9,500 miners from Ellendale to Garden City just as a way to -- we had the capacity, it was easy to make the move for the miners. And so, it made sense to do that. As Ellendale continues to come back online, we have machines ready to go to plug in to take up those empty slots. So no change in power cost, if that's what you were asking for in regards to power or if that was more related to energization. But essentially, the only site that we're really seeing a challenge at from an energization perspective is just what's left to do at Ellendale. But that's progressing on a weekly basis, as I mentioned, and that will be all back up over the balance of the next coming months. Well, the subtext of the question, Fred, apologies for not making it clear was, I thought that the 2 sites that came with Generate Capital offered you flexibility and adding capacity, power capacity. I was just wondering how you were thinking about that. And whether or not you thought you might need it this year to reach 50? No, we don't need to expand capacity at any sites. The capacity that we have that is energizable, if you would. So no need for additional expansion covers us to 50 exahash. So anything at the Generate sites that would be an increase in site capacity would be additive and think of that as more 2025 growth target. One more if you let me, Fred. Could you add a little color please to your energy harvesting theme and your heat reuse theme? You mentioned a couple of things on calls, but not a ton of detail. Yes. So, again, energy harvesting is taking essentially wasted or stranded energy. And that can come in multiple forms, right? It can come in the form of methane coming off of landfills and we've talked about the pilots that we have running in Utah in that regard. You can also capture methane flare gas from oilfields, for example, and there is methane coming out of a variety of agricultural processes. Obviously, dairy farming generates a lot of manure. You can take a lot of these things such as bio waste. Think of food processing plant, essentially, the waste that comes out of that, the stuff that comes out of ethanol, methanol manufacturing, which is all agricultural product base. You can take those base products and, through anaerobic digesters, generate electricity with them. You then use Bitcoin miners to consume that electricity. And then the heat generated by the miners can be fed back into the industrial process. So in the case of ethanol and methanol manufacturing, you need to pre-heat the biomass that you're using to make ethanol, alcohol, for example, manufacturing, spirits, beer, et cetera. You have to do similar things for the fermentation mass.And in the case of agriculture, you'll find there's a lot of bio waste that can be used and then you can generate heat and feed that back into things like greenhouses or shrimp farms, et cetera. So heat reuse is very important. You also have the simple use case of just heating buildings. You can take electricity that normally is going to power a boiler and you can replace that boiler with our 2PIC technology with miners in it and you can generate hot water just the same. Same amount of energy generates, same type of water at similar cost. And so, if for the building owner, it's cost-neutral to them or even a cost savings to them to deploy our solution versus traditional boilers or heating or even more importantly, if they're transitioning to electric heat from natural gas or oil, as part of the energy transition, then they can get the benefit of having potential cost savings, and we essentially get a situation where our cost to mine Bitcoin is free.And long term, the benefit of energy harvesting is that, the processing of the waste material and the sale of the heat back into an industrial process should hopefully mitigate 100% of your energy cost. And so, the mining of Bitcoin is done for free. Now granted, these are smaller scale sites, but some of these sites potentially are 5 to 20 megawatts in size. And you have the additional benefit that eventually, if transmission lines were available, you could just sell the electricity you're generating. So we believe that, as a way to diversify our business, lower our costs, decentralize the mining of Bitcoin, and this is an important factor because with the halving, you're going to see more and more concentration of Bitcoin mining amongst the big miners. It's very important that you start to develop this long tail of Bitcoin mining that I talked about where you essentially have hundreds of thousands if not millions of things out there that are leveraging energy to mine Bitcoin, all to secure the Bitcoin blockchain and process transactions because, over time, large utility scale miners will eventually come into a place where you can't get energy at utility scale at a lower cost than its cost to produce in those cases. And if Bitcoin price trends upward but not at a accelerated pace, then over the next 4 to 8 years, potentially, utility scale mining will become potentially a more challenging business. And so, the combination of technology, the combination of using alternative energy sources, all these things become really important to optimizing your operations.And our goal is to remain one of the lowest cost operators when we get to the next halving and be positioned to really continue to lead the industry well beyond the point where the block subsidies are the primary driver of revenues for Bitcoin miners. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham & Company. I guess 2, if you could just kind of remind us through the cadence of getting 50 exahash by the end of '24?And then second question, do you anticipate G&A to kind of stay mostly flat from here? It sounded like there was still some hires you needed to do. But just wondering if we could drill into that a bit more. So I'll let Salman answer the G&A question. But relative to the cadence of deployment, as I said before, capacity at the sites starts freeing up really at the end of this quarter and the early part of Q3. We have a large number of miners inbound to fill that capacity. And then the balance of capacity growth will happen over the latter part of Q3 and into Q4 as we continue to get Ellendale back online fully and fill out the little nooks and crannies of capacity that exist out there. We're at the same time also upgrading some of the sites that we acquired from air to immersion and doing things which will increase efficiencies and increase uptime. And this is all before we start talking about the benefits of 2PIC immersion and what it can do from an overclock perspective with minimal impacts to efficiency.So I think longer term, these types of technologies are going to become really important because if you can overclock S21s to the tune of 50% or 60% and you can do it with a de minimis loss of efficiency, then you can save a lot of CapEx, plus have the flexibility to overclock, underclock all depending on energy cost and Bitcoin price. It gives you a lot more flexibility and potentially saves a lot of capital. So we're very excited about kind of the impact of that on the longer term, especially as we grow well beyond 50 exahash at the end of this year. On the G&A, if you think about it from a cash G&A standpoint, excluding stock compensation, which is a non-cash item, we expect it to be flattish on a quarter-over-quarter basis going forward from here. It's a quick reminder that, on a unit basis, we continue to improve from here as we deploy more exahash in the company and spread that across the larger exahash. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Flynn with Compass Point Research. I had a question. I was wondering what the progress is on Auradine. And also, Fred, when you talk about like having the latest and greatest S21, are you referring to 17.5 joules per terahash or the most recent Pro version where it's 15 joules per terahash? Yes. So on Auradine, I'm not going to comment specifically on all the company's achievements because I'll let the management team do that. But what I will say is, we are in the process of -- we'll be deploying Auradine in our 2-phase immersion tanks. We'll have essentially the ability to put almost 800 kilowatts of mining capacity in a 8-foot container, which is a huge power density factor and you can essentially take a -- what is today a -- if you look at our UAE sites, we have essentially each 40-foot container is about 1 megawatt. Well, we can retrofit that container to dual phase immersion and end up with 3.2 megawatts in that same form factor at fairly low cost for the upgrade. Same miners, just more of them and the ability to consume more power, more power is available. So we believe that, that's going to be a big differentiator going forward.The advantage with Auradine's miners for us is, a lot of the intelligence that's built into them regarding fleet management. And like any fabless semiconductor company, Auradine is building wafer capacity with their vendors and continue to grow supply. And we'll continue to buy product from them as the supply chain increases.In regards to the Bitmain question, yes, there is a mix of Pros and the 17 joules per terahash. The immersion version of the 21 does not come in a Pro version. But the immersion version operates more efficiently than the air version. So kind of mitigates the 2. Hopefully that answers your question. Thank you. There are no further questions. I'm going to turn the call back over to Rob Samuels for closing remarks. Thank you all for your time today. If you have any questions that were not answered during today's call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team at ir@mara.com, and thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As usual, we'll begin today's call with prepared remarks from Fred and Salman. After their comments, we will go through some of the more popular questions from investors before transferring to a large Q&A with our covering analysts. And with that on the way, I'm going to return the call over to Fred to kick things off. Fred? Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. Today, I'm going to discuss our second quarter results and provide some insights into our newly launched business teams. In Q2, we celebrated several key achievements that highlight our innovative and strategic initiatives. We completed the successful acquisition and closing of our Garden City data center in Texas, increased our 2024 hash rate target to 50 exahash. Finds a significant partnership with the government of Kenya aimed at developing underutilized energy assets and to fund further development of the electrical grid and boost local economic growth. .
Began to diversify our revenues through the successful launch of MARA's Kaspa mining operations, launched a pilot heating project in Finland, leveraging digital asset compute to offer an efficient and low-cost alternative the district heating by converting clean energy into heat directly on-site while reducing carbon emissions for the district by avoidance of wood pallet and biomass burning source of ENERGY. Continued to increase capacity, reaching an all-time installed hash rate of 31.5 exahash, through the deployment of 15,000 new miners with energy efficiency of 17 jewels per tera hash. Organized MARA into strategic business teams with the focus on pushing responsibility and authority as far down in the organization as possible for diversification and growth.
These accomplishments demonstrate our dedication to innovation, sustainable growth and a long-term vision that leverages digital asset compute to transform the energy industry and enable a speedier energy transformation. As I discussed during our last call, we are beginning to lay the foundation in for MARA to become a globally diversified company that leverages digital assets compute to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. During the second quarter, we recognized -- sorry, we reorganized the internal structure of the business to better align our growth opportunities, sharpen our strategic focus, bolster accountability and accelerate our speed and agility as we scale. MARA is now a streamlined organization consisting of 3 specialized business teams, utility-scale mining, energy harvesting and technology as well as support organizations. Beginning this quarter, I'm going to organize my remarks around these specialties.
Let's begin with utility scale mining. The specialty at MARA is primarily known for today, large-scale digital asset compute focused on providing grid stability at scale and enhancing the viability of renewable energy projects in support of the energy transition. During the second quarter, our bitcoin production was impacted by unexpected equipment failures and transmission line maintenance at the Ellendale site operated by Applied Digital. Increased global hash rate and result in network difficulty in the April halving event. That said, transformer issues in Ellendale were mitigated and remediated post quarter end and our hash rate recovery effort is complete.
Furthermore, we grew our operational fleet by over 10% to approximately 250,000 miners and reached an overall operational hash rate of 30 exahash. Our current fleet efficiency stands at 23.5 deals per tera hash and we expect this will continue -- this will improve through the remainder of the year as we deploy additional S21 pros and emerging fully. Turning to our newly acquired sites. In Garden City, Texas, since taking over the site, we improved our hash rate by 25% and completed airflow enhancements and electrical upgrades. In Karney, Nebraska, hash rate improved by almost 15% due to container upgrades and near completion of hosted customer exits. The site now operates almost entirely with MARA Miners.
Lastly, we began construction of a heat recapture agricultural site, which we will discuss further at a later date. In Grandbery, when we took control from [ HUD 8 earlier ] this year, we inherited a site that was poorly maintained with flawed infrastructure that led to numerous electrical outages and low employee morale. In just a few months, our team has made significant progress fixing the infrastructure, resolving electrical outages and making plans to enhance the sound wall. We have also seen a notable uptick in employee satisfaction. Work continues to upgrade the site with the installation of single phase of merchant containers, which should make up 50% of the infrastructure by year-end.
We have also made good progress on transitioning hosted customers with an expectation of completing all transitions in Q3. Moving to our third-party hosted sites. We deployed software upgrades resulting in 20% increased efficiency of installed miners from 29 per deals tera hash to 23 deals per tera hash. By deploying software upgrades and purposely under clocking machines, we have been able to mitigate issues resulting from pulteTransformers while increasing efficiency and maintaining high uptime.
We currently own and operate approximately 54% of the 1.1 gigawatts of power in our diversified portfolio of digital assets compute. We will continue making owned and operated sites a greater percentage of our lead over time and expect to see material cost savings as this occurs. Longer term, our intention is to be amongst the lower cost operators in the industry. We remain focused on delivering on our 50 exahash goal and continue to install and energize miners according to plan. As we look to diversify our portfolio of digital asset computing, we announced that MARA is mining Kaspa a proof-of-work digital assets.
We currently mine roughly 9% of the global hash rate and once fully deployed, we expect that [ Caspowill ] consume only 1% of our energy capacity or 11 megawatts. The further highlighting the benefits of diversification. Furthermore, we continue -- we currently mine Kaspa at 80% plus margins, which is highly accretive as those margin dollars can be used for everything from covering G&A to acquiring bitcoin in the open market. This brings me to the recent change in our hotel strategy. We have long been advocating that bitcoin should be a strategic treasury asset for corporations in sovereign.
In early 2021, MARA purchased $150 million of bitcoin, which formed the basis of our current hotel. As market conditions changed in late '22, MARA began selling bitcoin from operations to cover operating expenses. Market conditions have since improved and regulatory pressures have eased as exemplified by the successful launch of bitcoin ETFs increased institutional and sovereign investments in bitcoin. Our recent announcement was opportune, given several statements from presidential candidates and Senator Lummus signaling support for bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset at the recent National Conference.
We continue to strongly advocate that corporations and [ Sedrin ] should hold a point as a strategic order of assets, and we will make open market purchases of bitcoin opportunistically from time to time as our in-house digital asset trading desk takes advantage of dips in the market such as our recent purchase of $100 million in bitcoin. [indiscernible] to energy harvesting. Its mission is to support the energy transformation by converting underutilized sources of energy stranded clean energy and environmentally harmful waste energy into economic value. Additionally, we can eliminate redundant expense and waste associated with generating heat. 
Leading to energy and cost savings and a more sustainable approach to energy use. In June, we announced the launch of a 2-megawatt pilot project in Finland to warm a town of 1 -- sorry, a town of 11,000 residents using digital asset computing. I'm pleased to report that we've maintained over 98% uptime over the past 30 days and mined approximately 4.3 bitcoin in June and July. All while generating valuable heat for the community at a total energy use of [ Les -- ] than what each home would have individually required. We plan to increase our heating capacity before the winter season by an additional 1.5 megawatts to the current pilot and start a new 1-megawatt pilot at another location.
By year-end, we expect our total capacity in Finland to reach over 4 megawatts in or an equivalent of approximately 9,000 more finished homes. One distinctive aspect of our energy harvesting strategy is that unlike utility scale mining where electricity is typically purchased from utilities at market price or energy harvesting projects typically benefit from subsidized power costs by utilizing recycled energy or unlocking stranded energy resources that lack rid interconnect. This approach aims to substantially reduce our cost of mine over time, which is part of our goal towards achieving 0 cost energy in the future.
As our energy harvesting business continues to grow, we expect to see projects that have energy generation components with longer lives than traditional bitcoin mining sites. Resulting in higher potential returns. Energy harvesting provides appealing opportunities for potential joint venture partners and infrastructure investors to collaborate with Mara and make a positive impact on the global energy landscape.
Turning to our technology business. The focus is on creating advanced technologies that transform digital infrastructure and enable AI and digital asset compute data center builders and operators to benefit from best-in-class cooling and power optimization strategies. Since its launch earlier this year, our 2 PIC technology has received lots of positive attention, and we are actively working with OEMs, reseller partners and end-user customers on evaluations and potential orders for delivery later this year. We have already begun using and deploying our own technology to improve the operations of our site. The development of our immersion technology will increase our uptime and stability and allow us to operate without curtailing due to heat or other weather-related issues that in the past may have impacted our air-cooled sites.
Over time, we expect the majority of our sites to be converted to immersion, and our new build sites will be predominantly based on immersion. Together with our firmware, immersion will also help us to overclock and under clock with greater ease and effect. As well as provide the perfect complement to balance infants AI load. We recently introduced a version of the tank that is designed specifically to be flexible to use for either bitcoin mining or AI. As a data center operator, this means that you can run bitcoin mining and if or when you want to move to HPC, the infrastructure does not need to change.
We are optimistic about the conversations we're having with OEMs on the AI side, as they like this concept since it allows their customers to deploy infrastructure and have it ready for AI. While utilizing it to mine bitcoin in the near term. Providing infrastructure to data centers is a long-term project, and we expect to see revenues begin to scale in the next 18 to 24 months. In the mining space, we expect technology sales to grow incrementally as companies continue to build out and update their facilities with emerging technologies. As previously stated, our long-term objective is for 50% of our revenues to originate from nonutility-scale mining. Achieving this goal will take time, that these new ventures are already showing progress. I'm now going to turn the call over to Salman, who will discuss our results in more detail. Salman? Thank you, Fred. As Fred mentioned, our hash trade started to climb back up during the quarter. as transformer issues at Allendale started to improve and were subsequently resolved post quarter end. The Ellendale facility where we are hosted by Applied Digital is now fully back on track. During the quarter, despite increased deployment of miners and capacity, a higher global hash rate resulting in increased network difficulty and lower bitcoin production due to April's having event impacted our results. Let's dig into details. Due to the unfavorable fair market value of digital assets and a decrease in bitcoin production due to the having event in April, we reported a net loss of $200 million or $0.72 loss per diluted share in the quarter.
This compares to a net loss of $9 million or $0.07 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. The average price of bitcoin was higher this quarter versus the same quarter last year, but the bitcoin price being lower than the price on the last day of the quarter of 2024, resulted in a significant loss on fair market value of our digital assets. The price of bitcoin deteriorated on June 30, 2024, versus March 31, 2024, and resulting in a loss on digital assets of $148 million during the second quarter of 2024. The price of bitcoin after quarter end has recovered by roughly 6% as of July 30, And we expect this volatility to result in a temporary gain or booking or loss due to one of the largest bitcoin holdings in corporate America on our balance sheet.
I want to point out that if we combine our almost $490 million paper gain in the first quarter, with our roughly $150 million paper loss in the second quarter, we are still up almost $340 million year-to-date. As we continue to hold a larger number of bitcoin on our balance sheet, the recently announced Hoddle strategy, we expect the volatility in bitcoin price to impact our earnings to a larger extent.
For example, a $10,000 change in bitcoin price will result in over a $200 million impact in our earnings, purely due to our large [ hotel ] position. Revenue increased 78% to [ $145 million ] from $82 million in the second quarter of 2023. With the average price of bitcoin mine 136% higher this quarter than the prior year period. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by $79 million increase in the average price of bitcoin, partially offset by a $24 million impact due to lower bitcoin production. We produced an average of 22.9 bitcoin each day, during the quarter compared to 32.2 bitcoin each day in the prior year period.
The company produced 868 less bitcoin in the second quarter as compared to prior year period, primarily due to the having increased global hash rate and the continued impact of unexpected equipment failures at third-party operated sites and transmission line maintenance, partially offset by an improvement in average operational hash rate. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, these issues were completely resolved. We successfully integrated 590 megawatts of 3 operational sites in the last 6 months. As a result of the acquisitions, we are temporarily providing whose services to existing hosted customers. The value we generated from hosting revenues was $9 million, which was not present a year ago. We expect this revenue to taper off in the coming quarters as we work with current tenants of the sites on their transition plans and use that space for our own growth. Our hosting and energy costs were $86 million compared to $55 million last year. The $31 million or approximately 55% increase was primarily driven by the growth in the company's hash rate from the deployment and energization of mining rigs in existing and new facilities, which increased hosting and energy costs compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of unexpected equipment failure and transmission line maintenance, which resulted in downtime that reduced hosting and energy costs.
Our non-GAAP cost of revenue without depreciation has improved 19% from $50.4 per petahash per day in the second quarter of 2023 to $41 per petahash per day in the second quarter of 2024. Sequentially this cost from $45.2 per petahash per day in Q1 of 2024 to $41 per petahash per day in Q2 of 2024. Which reflects a 9% improvement in sequential quarters. As we realized synergies from our recently announced acquisitions, reenergized production at our third-party hosted sites and spread the fixed cost over a larger capacity as we gear towards our 50 exahash go, we expect our cost per petahash per day to improve at times.
Depreciation and amortization was $88 million, a $51 million increase from the same quarter in the prior year. The change was predominantly the result of deploying additional mining rigs since last year. Here, our energized hash rate grew from 17.7 exahash to 31.5 exahash from the same period last year. Our non-GAAP total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization was $51 million this quarter compared to $27 million in the same quarter last year. The change was predominantly related to higher average bitcoin prices and increased operational efficiency.
General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $29 million, compared with $15 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenses was primarily due to the increasing scale of the business and acquisitions, including payroll and benefits, professional fees, facility and equipment expenses and other third-party costs associated with growth in the business. Our head count grew from 40 employees at end Q2 last year to 109 employees at the end of Q2 of this year. As Fred mentioned earlier, we have structured the company in 3 distinct strategic business teams, and we expect to continue funding diversified growth initiatives as we scale. Primarily due to an unfavorable fair value of digital assets at lower bitcoin production from the having, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $85 million compared to a gain of $36 million in the prior year period.
As a reminder, these numbers include the fair value gain or loss on digital assets. Part of our treasury management strategy has involved partially selling bitcoin to cover operating expenses and then handling the remainder on our balance sheet. Last week, we announced a significant shift in our treasury policy and adopted a full huddle approach to retain all bitcoin go forward. In addition, we plan to periodically make strategic open market purchases of bitcoin. The adoption of this strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin and our belief that it is the world's best treasury reserve asset. In Q2 of this year, we increased our bitcoin holdings 7% from 17,320 to 18,488 bitcoin. Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased $100 million worth of bitcoin and currently hold over 20,000 bitcoin on our balance sheet. Digging more into our bitcoin holdings and cash position, Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $256 million, up from $114 million a year ago. Also at June 30, we held approximately 18,488 bitcoin with a fair value of $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. Combined our balance of cash and bitcoin was approximately $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2024.
We sold 1,048 bitcoin during Q2, realizing cash proceeds of $69 million. These proceeds were utilized to fund operating expenses, including cost of revenues for energy hosting and other cash operating expenses and G&A. During the 6 months ended June 30, 2024, we purchased $16 million worth of bitcoin and subsequently announced adding $100 million worth of bitcoin purchases to our [indiscernible] position. During the quarter, we raised $345 million from at-the-market equity sales, which we primarily intend to use for bitcoin purchases, miners operating costs, acquisition of infrastructure and other general corporate purposes. We expect our future bitcoin holdings will generally increase due to our [indiscernible] strategy. We intend to add to our bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities and periodic open market purchases. As Fred mentioned earlier, the company recently introduced Kaspa to its digital asset compute portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, we held approximately 89 million Kaspa coins on our balance sheet. The company intends to add to its Kaspa holdings primarily through its production activities. As of now, we incur significantly less cost to produce Kaspa in U.S. dollar terms, which helps pay for our expenses and allows us to hold a larger amount of bitcoin in our balance sheet. And that completes my update.
I'll now turn it back over to Fred, who will talk more about our future plans. Fred? Thanks, Salman. MARA, Bitcoin mining is a vehicle rather than the end destination. Unlike our bitcoin mining peers, MARA is very focused on executing a long-term vision that leverages digital asset compute to transform the energy industry and enable a speedier energy transformation. Over the past few years, the intersection of bitcoin mining and AI data centers has been at the forefront of our industry. While several of our competitors have announced their intentions to pivot parts of their business model to hosting an operated [ AI HBC ], we have chosen to stay the course.
However, don't take that to mean we're idly sitting by. We're constantly evaluating opportunities and looking for the right approach and entry point. While LLM form the bulk of AI data center investments so far in the industry, AI at the edge will be the predominant application use case for AI. The majority of traffic in inference will not be human to machine, such as when you query your phone about where to find the best widget you're going to buy or how to write the best speech. The predominant volume of inference AI will be machine-to-machine operated at the edge in oilfields, on jet planes by telecoms at the base of telecom cell phone base stations, vehicle-to-vehicle communications networks, et cetera.
The challenge with inference AI is that it's an uneven load, not dissimilar to demand patterns on the grid. Which vary throughout the day. The energy load on the compute varies as demand varies. Typically, these large sites that are operating predominantly inference AI have power purchase agreements, and they need to consume a consistent amount of energy. Bitcoin mining connect as a load balancer for inference AI, similar to how it does with the electrical grid due to its flexible and scalable use of curtail be compute. It can be used to smooth out the energy load of the compute as demand varies throughout the day.
During periods of low AI activity, excess energy can be redirected to digital asset compute, helping to maintain a more consistent energy consumption pattern which is more cost effective and efficient and preferred by utilities. We believe that co-locating AI with bitcoin mining is highly synergistic especially when utilizing our technology where we can significantly overclock and under clock our miners in perfect synchronicity with the energy demand at the AI side.
This is just one example of the types of opportunities we're currently exploring. You won't see us purchasing GPUs and compute directly for a customer. As we develop greenfield sites, we may offer AI data center operators the opportunity to codevelop a site with us where we do the mining and they do the AI or we might build a data center and do the hosting. Whichever path we choose to go down, we believe it is still too early in the cycle to be placing big bets. There are already concerns with overbuilding and overinvesting. M&A remains a high priority for us. We have a dedicated focus to go long capacity, which means a pipeline of greenfield power partially developed power, acquiring additional power or even a competitor.
Our corporate development team of seasoned former energy M&A professionals is building a great pipeline of opportunities for us to execute on. We are not prepared to do a transaction for the sake of grabbing headlines or just to do a transaction. If you look at the transactions that we have done historically, we've set the bar rather low on our cost per megawatt basis. As these types of opportunities are presented to us, we will do our work, but we will only pull the trigger on the right one.
In closing, I'm proud of the way our team performed this quarter. We are past our operational challenges, and we believe our 50 exahash goal by year-end is in sight. I'm a fan of Professor Scott Galloway and a recent podcast of his release struck me. He pointed out that in 1980, the most valuable companies in the world were energy companies. And today, the most valuable firms are tech companies.
Moving forward, he argues it's going to be the marriage of power and compute. This is the future, and we want to sit right in the middle of it. And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob for Q&A. Thanks, Fred. At this time, we are going to commence the Q&A section of today's call. We'll start by answering some of the most popular questions submitted by investors through our Q&A platform.
The first question comes from John P. who asks, can you talk a little bit about your investment in Auradigm, and are you currently using any of their miners? Fred, do you want to take that one? Sure. So we've disclosed in the 10-Q orders and payments to Auradigm for orders of machines. And we believe the Auradigm 3-nanometer miners, which will begin shipments towards the back half of this year and into next year are amongst the best in the industry. In Nashville, they were demonstrating the 3-nanometer machines and getting a lot of very positive feedback from a number of miners who are evaluating it currently. And we believe that the Auradigm miner potentially is a better choice and option due to its performance than the best micro BT machines and very strong competitor to [ Bitman ] going forward. Great. Our next question comes from E&M, who asks, with the announcement of your 100% [ hotel ] strategy of mine bitcoin, how do you plan to fund continuing operations. Salman, do you want to take that? Sure. Thank you, EM, for asking that question. Look, this is not new to Marathon. MARA has bought $150 million worth of bitcoin in 2021 and has had a full [indiscernible] strategy until we change that last year. So certainly back to the strategy, this is not new to MARA. Now in terms of how we plan to fund it we have cash on the balance sheet, and we have access to capital margins. On top of that, in our prepared remarks, we've talked about many of the business initiatives that but the MARA team has been diligently working on during this year. And some of the examples that come to mind, for example, Kaspa, that Fred mentioned earlier is very high margin compared to our current bitcoin operations.
And that -- those kind of initiatives, in addition to that, the technology businesses that we've launched earlier this year will result in additional cash flows for us as we move from here into in the next few quarters. Thanks, Salman. Our last question comes from David A,who asks, you have a number of really great initiatives ongoing -- when can we expect to get some more color on when they will begin to contribute to revenue and earnings? Fred, Salman, you guys want to take that? Sure. I can take that. So listen, we're very focused on developing businesses that are resilient in businesses that have long-term growth potential. And if you look at the synergies of Energy Harvesting, together with our technology business, what you have is effectively a business that can begin to mine bitcoin at very low cost where you're not buying electricity off the grid as the majority of utility scale miners do. The other thing we believe is we think that over time, what is going to happen is you're going to see a movement of bitcoin mining into a lot of technologies related to energy storage, a lot of things related to energy generation, such as combination with residential solar, commercial solar, et cetera, we're going to be playing a very active role in those businesses. .
So we feel the key to success here longer term is a diversified business where you're not just diversified geographically, which is why we're diversifying internationally, but also from a perspective of the use case of digital asset compute. So it's not just to mine bitcoin for balancing a grid, but it's also for heat offtake and other uses where bitcoin mining is simply a means to an end. We're very excited about what we're doing there. And as we said earlier, our technology business, we think, is definitely going to give very good benefits, not just to us, but it will also be able to provide technology to other players in the mining business, but also around AI and around telecoms and other industries where we think a lot of that technology is going to shine. So we're very excited about that. Thanks, Fred. In the interest of time, I think we're going to wrap up this section of the Q&A. Again, we really appreciate the questions and the interest. I'm now going to turn the call back to our operator to open the line to questions from our covering analysts. Darryl, back to you. . [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Thanks for the question. I guess you've talked about . Operational issues the last 2 quarters. And I was hoping -- I don't want to get too technical, but just can you explain maybe explaining what exactly went wrong how it was repaired. And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, I guess, the likelihood that, that could happen again either at that site or another site. I just want to understand a little bit better about what what drove those issues? Sure. So if you look at the Ellendale site operated by Applied Digital which you predominantly had were transformer issues where the transformers that have been supplied by the vendor did not operate to spec when they were operated at -- over the long term. And so you started to see failures. And so the folks that Applied Digital did a heroic job of not just sourcing replacements, but also modifying the transformer such that they could be put back into service so that they wouldn't have this issue again. There were also some transmission line maintenance issues, which again is outside of their ability to control as -- or hosting partners ability to control as that's spent by the electrical utility.
So could it happen again. Once we became aware of these issues, we started looking at all our other sites to see what we could do to make sure that these types of issues wouldn't happen. That's one of the reasons why in our prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we were purposely under clocking miners at some of the third-party hosted sites so that we wouldn't strain the transformers.  And run risk of this. So again, these are sites which we don't own and operate. And so we have little control over the infrastructure that's there. But we've been working very closely with the hosting partners to make sure we put in place strategies to mitigate the potential for this to happen again. Understood. And I appreciate the color on your HPC kind of strategy and thinking. I was curious -- and I know it's early days. You talked about some, I guess, different use cases at the edge. I guess how do you evaluate away the economics of mining versus maybe what you could earn doing some of that edge type work. Do you have a sense of the value of that work today -- on what basis or -- you follow my question? Yes. So again, as we said, we're not going to be the operator of the AI inference operating at the edge. If you just look at NVIDIA's road map for equipment, you'll see that they're quadrupling the power and throughput, if you would, of their technology over the next 3 generations in 24 months, which makes the technology transitions in the bitcoin industry look fairly benign. So we definitely don't want to be in what is a hugely more CapEx-intensive business. That being said, we do want to be a provider of infrastructure for people in this business. And if you look at our immersion technology, you look our cooling technology, it is specifically designed for use in these areas. And if you look at the sheer amount of infrastructure spending that is going to go into all of these inference data centers, especially inference at the edge.
It is an ideal market for us to sell immersion and cooling technology to. And there are very interesting opportunities to partner with people who are building bundled solutions that include the GPU, et cetera. And we're just going to be a vendor to them. We think that is the best way for us to play in that marketplace. I don't believe that Bitcoin miners should really be in the business of doing operating AI. They can be in the business of hosting AI if they feel they want to build that infrastructure. But the real future is around containerized immersion-based infrastructure at the edge, and that's really where we're going to play in that area.
Now when you look at running inference AI data centers of larger scale, we believe there's a great synergy between Bitcoin mining and the AI data center. Because of the electrical load variances in inference and the perfect synergy with bitcoin mining there. And so we will partner with data center operators on that. But again, we don't want to be the operator of the AI. We don't want to own the compute load because we are so early in the technology cycle here, but the CapEx spend in that industry is going to make the CapEx spend in the bitcoin mining industry look fairly small.
A data center for costs over $12 million of megawatt today. And in the bitcoin mining space, you're looking at $1 million a megawatt. So we believe it's an industry where it's there to be a fast follower and to be an infrastructure provider and by being an infrastructure provider, you could partner with the people who are the leaders in the industry, and you can learn and you can see exactly where you can benefit from it. Our next questions come from the line of Tyler DiMatteo with BTIG. Fred, I'm curious. I'm following the rationale for the 3 business units is streamlining and breaking it out. I guess what I'm wondering, though, is how do you think about deploying capital amongst the various units? And I guess what goes into that decision in your mind -- and then my follow-up question here is that you put some notes in the prepared remarks on the speed and the agility. I'm also curious, beyond the capital part of the equation, for the 3 units. How do you think about being flexible among deploying other general resources, whether that be personnel or what have you, among the various units? Any color there? Sure. So you're familiar with a matrix organization because that's the way most investment banks operate today. You have teams that do different things. And you'll notice in our remarks, we're talking about business team. So the groups that are actually affecting the business that are out there winning the business that are out there delivering on the business are divided up in the teams of specialists we're able to go in and execute these transactions -- execute the projects. The support organizations, finance, communications, HR, IT, et cetera, are centralized functions that support the various businesses and their purposes. So it's a very traditional matrix organization. The goal is to not have redundant infrastructure or redundant support people but rather be able to benefit from being able to have specialized teams. It's like a football team, you have specialty units, specialties that do special things -- that's how we look at the business.
Utility scale mining is a very well understood, very easy business. to operate. You have swap teams doing O&M. You have business development, doing acquisition. You have operations folks running NOx and running the actual sites. In the case of energy harvesting, a lot of them are one-off projects. And they start as pilots and then they grow. And so you have to have these specialized project teams that are doing and do those. If you try to do that in a traditional siloed organization, it would be very difficult you wouldn't be able to do it quickly. And more importantly, you would lose the benefit of the specialized knowledge. And so we're able to for example, move very quickly in deploying these sites. We do a test, we do a pilot, we figure out how we're going to do it, and then we can scale it. From a CapEx perspective, where it becomes interesting is on the energy harvesting side, you have an opportunity to bring in co-investors on the energy generation asset. And that lowers your CapEx need for the overall project from a specific Marathon perspective. The other benefit you have is that a lot of the energy harvesting projects, the actual cost of electricity is subsidized. So we are constantly evaluating projects based on an IRR model or a ROIC model, return on investment capital -- invested capital.
And so utility scale mining is a business which is all about operational efficiency, right? How do you get the lowest cost power? How do you operate the mines of the bank in amount of uptime with the lowest energy consumption for minor so you can mine the maximum amount of bitcoin. In the energy harvesting world, it's all about how do you get 0 cost energy, which is very different. And when you look at the ability to finance the CapEx on the energy side using traditional means and bringing in third-party partners and you look at essentially operating a site where the cost of electricity starts becoming insignificant because it's being paid for by the value you're creating for the recipient of either the heat reuse or how you're dealing with the waste energy. Those projects tend to provide a more attractive ROIC over time than some of the traditional utility scale mining sites. And that's why as we look at the 2 businesses sort of side by side, we say we're going to be diversifying and investing more in these nontraditional utility scale mining businesses.
On the technology side, you're looking at a business where you're essentially working with OEMs channel partners and large end users for large projects, we're providing technology, which will then eventually also have ongoing O&M fees and recurring revenues tied to maintenance and managed services projects. So we view that as a very separate type of business. But again, we invested in it just like when we're a start-up company in the same way that we invested in Aradigm, for example, where we leveraged our intellectual property together with great talented teams and venture capital from Silicon Valley. You'll see us continue to kind of build and invest in things like that as we go as we continue to diversify the business. Our next questions come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Thank you so much, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. My first question is on the cost side. When I back into kind of cash cost, direct cost, whatever you may want to call it, I shake out around $59,000 per coin. So first, wondered if you could comment on that. I could see if there might be some pluses and minuses around that number, obviously, it excludes noncash items such as DNA and some other things. And then more broadly, in an environment macro-wise, where there's maybe a bit more volatility. Do you have specific cost targets that you think about where could you squeeze some additional unit cost reductions out of the business? Yes. Let me try to answer that question. So first of all, Lucas, that's right. The cost per coin, the way you're viewing it, it includes certain cash and noncash component to it. So G&A is included in that cost and so is the mining cost of revenue. The way we view this -- a better way of viewing the way we run our business, and we believe this is a better matrix from a KPI perspective is the hash cost petahash per day. And that is a more better representation of our business structure and also the cash that we're deploying, which is effective. and the costs associated with mining. So from that standpoint, if you view it from a going forward perspective, as we deploy more hash and we energized as we head towards the 50 exahash target that we set for ourselves.  We expect the fixed cost to be spread across a larger exahash capacity available. And we expect the cost to decline over a period of time, systematically as a result of that.
Secondly, what we have to understand a little bit is that we've got some one-off costs in our cost structure in the Q1 and Q2 both. We closed 2 major acquisitions, and there are some legal costs and repairs and maintenance costs and certain things that Fred alluded to in the prepared remarks about the quality of assets that the way they were managed previously versus how we are managing the -- bringing them back to our standard it requires some additional money, and that is reflected in our operating cost as of now. The other thing is -- we also have some one-off legal costs in there that we expect over a period of time to disappear. So in the last 2 quarters, we've experienced some additional one-off cost that is driving our G&A at least a little bit on the higher side. Now when you think about our business -- the current business is bitcoin mining, a majority of the business from a materiality standpoint. But then we also have introduced Kaspa, which is more than 80% margin to produce Kaspa less than 1% of our energy capacity. And those kind of businesses as we bring the mainstream from pilot phase as Fred alluded to previously, in our energy harvest business, we expect to see our not only increasing our revenues, but also driving our costs down and squeezing that margin with the passage of time. So hopefully, that answers the question. I appreciate that very much. My second question is a bit higher level for both of you. With the Hoddle strategy, obviously, you have some U.S. dollar expenses -- should we think about you liquidating some bitcoin to pay those U.S. dollar bills, electricity, salaries, what have you. And then more broadly, is the goal here really to just maximize the absolute number of Bitcoin in treasury? Is it maximizing bitcoin produced per share held per share? Or is it ultimately an ROIC measure that's still the most important.  Thank you so much for your perspective. Yes. So Bitcoin purchases, as we announced fairly recently, which is, again, not a new strategy for us. We used to have the strategy 2 years ago. we intend to exclusively have. So we don't intend to sell this point at this stage for the foreseeable future. Macroeconomic conditions and the geological situation and what's the presidential elections here. We expect lots of tailwinds in this space and the bitcoin price, which was already projected to be going up based on the demand and supply and based on the projections that we see publicly discussed. So -- from a harder strategy standpoint, yes, we are a bitcoin minor, and we produced bitcoin, and we were haggling a big portion of our midpoint historically, and we're selling some portion of that is point to pay for our operating expenses. With this change in strategy or going back to our original strategy, we will stop selling bitcoin for paying for operating expenses. So -- what does that mean? That means that we will continue to have more because we see from an ROIC perspective, from a shareholder value perspective, any capital that we deploy in building our bitcoin reserve asset that is highly accretive to our stockholders. I was just going to say that I think the -- we are just at the beginning of the institutional wave of investing and holding bitcoin have now accumulated a substantial position in bitcoin we're starting to see businesses like [ Canteritzgerald ], start offering financing businesses, financing offerings around people who have bitcoin holdings we're starting to see pension funds invest. We're starting to see many long-term holders invest. And at the end of the day, it is a finite resource. And the only place to get it is what's available in the market or what people are willing to sell. And when we're able to go into the marketplace as we did in the past 30 days and buy at very attractive prices, it just makes sense for us to do that. .
And then it makes sense for us to hold it. The $150 million a bitcoin we bought in January of 2021, we never sold. And so we think right now, we are in the beginning of a very attractive time for bitcoin. We believe it's an asset that's going to continue to perform better than other areas. And if we look at kind of the historical returns that bitcoin has offered. You're looking at something north of 30%, 35%. And as Salman said, holding bitcoin can be very accretive for our shareholders. So that's one of the reasons that drove this. Our next questions come from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainright. Fred, am I was wondering if you might add a little more detail to your 50 exahash target. At 31 now, 31.5 now -- congrats -- just kind of curious about power source, where is that increase going to come on the change? I know you talked about the [ S1 ] Pro introduction? Is it efficiency? Or how much more power do you think you're going to need? And will you be able to address to hit that target? So Kevin, we talked about when we did the acquisitions and we announced the target that essentially the vast majority of this is all going to come from the capacity that will be made available to us by owning these assets. And that remains the case today. So we'll continue to add other sources of power along the way. But at this point, we've essentially -- we have the machine ready and we're plugging them in as we vacate customers from the sites. And as we continue to do the refits of the sites that help us expand the capacity at the sites. So it sounds like we have to go out and buy 500 megawatts of power to do this. we're well along that way with what we already have. Fair enough. How would you recommend we judge your perspective on moving the company closer to power generation versus like the [ GenAI ] deal and applied deal in Garden City, right, where you own the facility, but it doesn't really get you closer to that 0 power cost target? Energy harvesting sorry, go ahead. No, no, no. You go ahead, Fred. Yes. Yes. I was just going to say that the -- owning our own infrastructure removes the middleman in the infrastructure allows us to own control of the power generate the revenues from trading of the power and control our destiny. The next step is going all the way back to looking at the actual power source. Now that being said, I'm not going to go out and ask our team to go buy a bunch of power generating large-scale power-generating assets. But the opportunity is there for us to partner with people who have power-generating assets, which to date aren't able to monetize those assets effectively. And then on the harvesting side is where you really see this benefit of 0 cost energy. And there are locations in the world where today they are shutting down power generation because they can't generate revenues for those are locations where the marginal cost to operate those sites is de minimis.
And so partnering with those types of partners allow us to get very low-cost energy as well. So you'll start seeing the energy harvesting business over time become involved in projects where the actual energy cost is low. And then the additional service, the energy harvesting business provides, whether that's heat recapture, whether that's waste mitigation, whether it's consuming methane flare gas from oilfields or landfills essentially provides a subsidized cost, which will help lower our overall mining cost per bitcoin across the board. When you look at your pipeline, though, on the M&A side, Fred, is it fair to assume that more of your emphasis will be on that energy harvesting initiative? Versus then maybe getting involved in a hostile takeover that seems to be go back and forth in the business? We don't comment on M&A activities. But sometimes it can be fun to watch. But as I said in our prepared remarks, we have kind of multiple buckets we look at. We look at full true greenfield, where, for example, somebody has owns an interconnect wants to monetize that. Or they have potentially a renewable energy project that they can't monetize effectively? Or is somebody in substation and at really attractive energy prices, then you have kind of the next step down, which is somebody who has started and built a bitcoin mining site with maybe, let's say, 100 megawatts of power, but the substation and the interconnect they have can provide power up to 300 or 400 megawatts, which is kind of what you see a lot of people. doing in the M&A world around today. And then you have buying an operational miner who maybe has a pipeline of stuff. We're looking at all these things.
The market pricing is kind of where it is today, which is very different than where we were buying sites at the beginning of this year, where we were paying under $500,000 a megawatt. So we'll continue to be opportunistic, but we'll look at where we think we can generate the most long-term value and as opposed to just trying to do nameplate deals. At this point, there are no further questions. I'm going to turn the call back to Rob Samuels for closing remarks. Thanks, operator, and thank you all for your time today.
